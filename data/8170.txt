See also Runebound which feels very similar. However, both are essentially a race game, are very repetitive, a bit predicatble, have little or no player intraction and lack the creativity and 'slickness' of other modern games.

UPDATE--fun game, but I really don't play it very much, and I think there are better games I own that would scratch the itch this game would. Hence, it's for trade now.

Have only managed this with two players, and it was fun--will need to play more to figure out where it ranks compared to Prophecy.  Got a game with four in and I'm still unsure.  I love the way you can set up the board differently each time, and the quests are fun.  There's a bit of a run away leader thing, though, and the lack of meaningful player interaction bugs me a bit.  The rules, as everyone knows, are presented really poorly.  The upshot is that the first game will probably be tedious as you skim through the rules booklet every minute, but after that you hardly need to reference them.  Haven't added the expansion to it yet, though I do own it.

RATING: 7.1
Decent RPG boardgame with one of the worst rulebooks ever written (thank gawd for fans). More player interaction and possibly more modern game mechanics in certain places would improve it.  But that said, the game works and has its moments. A strong RPG group would probably truly enjoy it.

RATING: 4
Kind of a Euro-ish fantasy quest game. You have a modular board which you run around trying to do tasks and quests. There is no fighting each other; it's more of a race and efficiency contest between players to see who can defeat the Evil Overlord (a.k.a. "the Nameless") first. The rule book is the worst I've ever seen, but you can find an (actually good) English translation of it on BGG. It's hard to figure out exactly how strong you have to be to win when you start playing, but when your skill+dice is 13+ you have a good chance at beating the nameless.

It just can't get really into it like other fantasy games. Maybe it's the flavorless tasks and quests, or the hokey-looking goofy CGI on the tiles and map. The fantasy world in this game is as thin and generic as I've ever seen. Also, the beardless female dwarf is a bit odd.

I really wanted to like this game - some cool ideas, but unfortunately the whole package just doesn't come together.  Graphic design is half decent, half terrible.  The whole game just feels far too random and un-balanced and simply isn't very fun or like an adventure.

RATING: 3.5
The first time I played this it was a debacle.  The fiddly nature of the game works against it, and the rule book is horrendous.  Still, I'd like to give it another shot.

I think I'm not all that interested in pick up and deliver character building quest games anymore.  Talisman was fun back in the day, but random.  I guess I've had my fill in MMORPGs and computer RPGs.  

Or not.  Requires more plays.

I had my first game - partially completed as lunch ran out before the game did.  This wasn't helped by having to punch out the pieces before setup!  The game seems good, I guess it would have run a lot more smoothly if I had read the rules.  Wait, I did read the rules.  OK, if I had read and understood the rules.  It does seem like the sort of game I was hoping for though!  First rating's a 6 as the first session went rather slowly.  Let's see how the second game goes.

Sold, I have better adventure games :)

Ah, fantasy board games. I love them. But this one is a bit stinky. Worst rule book ever! Long set up time. Overly complex with pitiful combat and delivery-styled quests. It looks like the venerable Magic Realm which will always hold a fascination for me - like an unsolved mystery. And that's probably why I *really* wish this game was better. But folks, it just isn't.

A decent pseudo-RPG.  Setup time and potential length of game detract a little, though I'd likely play this again sometime.  Fun, but not deep or too engaging.  Movement can feel very constricted early on.  Gameplay is very mechanical.  Theme is nicely represented.  Implementation is good, but the game lacks soul.  Worth playing if you like RPGs.  Make sure you get all the errata (many errors on pieces).

Game has good theme play and is fun.  Easy to learn and play.  The movement system allows players to freely move where they choose.  The combat system is simple and elegant, which keeps game play moving at a good pace.  Characters gain experience and items over the course of the game to become more powerful.  Player interaction is minimal.  The game has high replay value due to the modular board and other mechanics.  The components are excellent except for the rulebook which was very unclear about some game aspects.

Nice adventure game that is a lot of fun to play. Note that this type of 'game' falls under the category of an experience game for me. If you want to have a bunch of fun with some friends and none of you are really out to win then it's a much more enjoyable experience. Once you get some of the kinks worked out of the rules and understand the flow of the game everything moves along nicely. There are a few meaningful choices to be made but not many. Most are related to which tiles are going to benefit you the most in the quickest time. A fun experience and I'm glad I own a copy but probably not a game for everyone. But if you are looking for an 'explore the map' type fantasy game this is the best.

I found the solo version of the game to be quite lacking. It seems awfully dependent on which tiles you get to come out and when. If you want to run this solo I'd recommend just play the standard game and run two characters. It's a much better experience. It also limits some of the rules confusion as well. And you can add in the expansions easily.

I have the Under the Shadow of the Dragon expansion and I really can't see myself ever just playing with the base game ever again. The expansion adds some neat stuff to the game but doesn't increase the difficulty much. I think the multiple ways to win with the expansion actually makes the game better with multiple players. And creating the map from ALL of the tiles in both sets is pretty neat visually.

A solid fun game, but due to the poorly written rules (Return of the Heros) it was very frustrating to play the first time.  (3+ hour game)  If it wasn't for the rule rewrite posted here we would have done even more things wrong.

If you're disappointed by Runebound, pick this one up, the replay value is there and other than the poorly written rules the components are quite good quality. (Other than the few that were missed during the translation process...)

{1 play, 4 player} Okay, I've never played any of these type of games - Talismen, Magic Realm, etc.  But my take on this one is this: it's just a LOT of dice rolling, with a pinch of strategy.  I suspect my rating will drop with further play... but... and this is the thing... because it's so gorgeous - the tiles, the bits - and probably because it was new to me, it was fun.  But I guarantee you, the next time I play this (if I do), I'm gonna feel that 2+ hours playing time, which is kind of too long for a dice-rolling game.

OK firstly the rule book: Well I say rule book it's just a badly written story to keep the sponsors happy. It's terrible, a nice idea that just doesn't work. The game itself is really enjoyable, recomended if you enjoy Fantasy and Euros.
Best with 2-3 players. Drags with 6 (expansion) and a bit dull with 1.

The main thing that I really love about this game is the way the missions work. It's a pick up and deliver system but you need to be able to prioritise and change your plan half way through. Basically it is a race game to complete missions and defeat the Nameless

RATING: 6
my first runebound/roth/prophecy/talisman/magic realm/whatever type game really.  and definitely not a bad one.  the holy grail expansion sounds cooler than this game though, i'm not a big fan of waiting for stuff to come out of the bag in order to fulfill my goal.  looks like it works just fine with 2 players.  reminds me of candamir, makes me want to revisit lotr.  this was definitely a good enough board rpg type thing to make me want to explore what else is out there.  rules are a problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once you get past the difficult rules (the problem is more in looking up details than in understanding while reading) you can partake in a light adventure game.  The random nature of the board layout and the boss monster add to replayability.  Player interaction is low so with more players there is some considerable downtime.  Movement is player choice, so there is a degree of turn planning required, but combat can be luck heavy.  Be prepared for the game time to run long.  [GTI Code: TPCL]

RoTH is a fantastic game, everyone has really liked it or expressed interest in the game. it's a fun game, and don't underestimate the importance of that! however, there are still slight issues here, like the tile misprints & possibly a need to streamline the game a bit to make it more solid. highly recommended for D&D fans who either do not like or cannot make the time for the pen & paper game. this feels like a complete campaign setting in a modular boardgame, sweet! RoTH is easily in my top 5.

This game executes the fantasy quest theme exceedingly well. It's light enough to keep stress levels down, but has a thoughtfully rendered system in place for carrying the players through the story. Components are excellent and plentiful; a rich fantasy dressing covers all; and an adventure of some breadth can be played out in a relatively short period of time. Somewhat of a grail game for me, now proudly owned and deeply cherished.

[i]Posted: 1/7/08, Rated: 7[/i]

I picked up a copy of [i][gameid=13751][/i] during a spell of binge-buying on Tanga.  Even though it is supposed to be playable as a standalone game, it is also an expansion to [i]Return of the Heroes.[/i]  Well, I just had to get the base game, didn't I?  After a well-negotiated trade, I found myself with a copy.  Now, I knew that [i]Return of the Heroes[/i] provided an RPG-like experience in the form of a board game.  That was okay with me, because I really enjoy playing [i][gameid=17223][/i].  The obvious question I should have asked myself (but didn't) was this: did I need both of them?  Apparently so, thanks to Tanga.  Now the question you should be asking yourself is "Which one should I play?"  As always, the answer is "that depends upon you."

[i]Return of the Heroes[/i] takes all of the fantasy stereotypes and blanches them even further to provide an extremely generic experience.  All of the right trappings are there: five different character classes, heroic quests, experience building, random encounters, loot, a market system, and an unspeakable evil entity that needs to be eradicated.  Mmmm, good stuff.  It also has a distinctly Eurogame feel, using wooden cubes to track the progression of skills in three different areas: melee fighting, ranged fighting, and magic ability.  The rotating counter system used for random encounters and also for timing of game events is novel and effective.  The modular board provides a feel of enhanced replayability.  The selection of heroic quests which must be completed and multiple Ã¼ber baddies to defeat (only one per game) give [i]Return of the Heroes[/i] some longer legs.

Still, the game has some halfling-sized shortcomings.  The most glaring of these is the rulebook: I can tell that writing it was a labor of love for Lutz Stepponat.  He is trying to tell an epic story through a board game, so a narrative style sets a great tone.  Unfortunately, it's a poor medium for explaining the rules.  There are several little gotchas as well as printing errors in this game, and these unnecessarily inflate the learning curve of a very simple game system.

The other item that really stands out is the lack of game material.  There are only twenty-one side quests.  Eighteen items which can be purchased from the market.  Five artifacts.  These are sufficient for any one game, but it is likely that you will see most if not all of them in a single playing.  In comparison, [i][gameid=17223][/i] is a luxurious Fantasy Flight Games production, with entire decks devoted to these items.  The sheer number and varied qualities of loot and market items is fantastic.

[i][gameid=17223][/i] has style in abundance.  While it has many of the same archetypal character classes, it does an excellent job of differentiating between them.  You believe that your talent and spell choices are shaping your character.  [i]Return of the Heroes[/i] feels very flat in this regard: okay, I have a mage.  I will probably use my magical ability for every combat situation unless I am prohibited from doing so, in which case I will likely lose a hit point.  I will focus on blue cubes instead of the orange ones.  Other than that, the Mage feels exactly like the Warrior, without spell choices or the ability to shape its development.

[i]Return of the Heroes[/i] scratches that RPG itch, and it does so in a very efficient manner.  It is a good game, even if it is a bland one.  I call it "RPG light."  You can set it up and play it in a fraction of the time required for the more robust entry in this genre.  If you want a quick solution, then go with [i]Return of the Heroes[/i].  If you want a truly epic, highly stylized experience, then [i][gameid=17223][/i] is your answer.  Or, you could go the same route I did, and get both.

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 6[/i]

Going through and updating my ratings, and I realize that [i]Return of the Heroes[/i] had an extra point tacked on for that rosy honeymoon flush.  It's above average, but not much more than that.

After only ONE play, and it was solo with an admitted meandering play style by yours truly, I did get around to the business of killing the big bad and did so quite handily on my last turn of the game! I enjoyed this time however. I will not rate until I get a chance to play this one with others, I do not think it fair as this one came with rules for both. If its any indication however I have plans to play this one solo more VERY soon. Set up time is a bit of a chore, but once you know what you are doing and not reading the sheets for every counter and card, it will not be that bad of a time sink. that RPG feel and the true sensation of traversing a fairly large realm is palpable in this game, and I am grateful to have found it. Almost passed it up as I had never heard of it before, but picked it and its expansion (in English) up for a price that sounds better and better to me the more time I have with it! Great little gem of an adventure game, if you like the genre, and can find it, then get it. It is already proven itself to be different enough, that I do not mind it in my collection with the likes of Runebound and Prophecy laying about, it's a clean take on the genre' and my gratefulness is extensive to have found it.

Changed my mind in record time about the rating, I will revise a I play with first my wife and then three others for a four player Rpg-a-thon, I really like the frame of mind the game set over me as I prepared to and then did play the game, a rare breed of gaming goodness does this, whether solo play or not. I will adjust once I have partaken with others.

LevelACharacter, Solo

This game is quite a lot of fun, despite me trying to trim down my adventure games.  It's lighter than Runebound, and certainly friendlier, which wins points.  I have the German version and needed to stick translations on the tiles.  Thankfully they're tiles, not cards, so the extra bulkiness of the label will go mostly unnoticed.  This is very likely a keeper for me.

The solitaire game is also tense and decent.  Great when you're sick.  Haven't really managed to win before turn 45 yet.

RATING: 6
My ranking could increase, but my first game of this went kind of slow and got interrupted a bit. I think it could increase if I could play this game as fast as I think it's capable of being played.

You pick a character and get some quests. Then you start performing tasks so that you can become powerful enough to take on the big bad at the end. My character had movement rating of 4. I think this was a big key in both my enjoyment and my winning of the game. Lucky dice rolls were also a big key. The board feels huge in comparison to you character and where they need to go. So having a decent movement rating makes the distance you have to traverse seem less onerous. I got some boots which increased my movement by one and an amulet that allowed me to "see" paths. This probably saved me at least 5 turns of movement over the course of the game. It also allowed me to hand pick my quests and in a couple cases, swipe them out from under the noses of my opponents. By the end, I wasn't the strongest, but I had fair shot and was willing to take it. I threaded the needle and won the game. I was fully prepared to lose and would have been happy, but I won.

It must be called return of the heroes because they have to return home after questing to get the stone that allows them entrance to the land of the big bad.

I never thought that the game is actually some kind of racing game that requires players to finish the game as soon as possible and only the one who finish the game will win, while the others will go home as losers. You have some tasks and missions to be accomplished in order to gain power capabilities to fight the evil nemesis in your last final battle. Simple battle game against the game itself and found pretty excited and easy for an adventure game to be played.

The GOOD: This game has very nice components. I really enjoyed it the first couple of times I played it. My wife likes it since it isn't very confrontational.

should look into this one.  Have seen both good and bad comments.  Primary question now is whether this is good enough to get as an intermediate quest/combat/heroic game between HeroScape/DungeonQuest and Dungeons & Dragons or whether I'm better off going directly from HeroScape/DungeonQuest to Dungeons & Dragons.  Leaning toward the latter.

random tile map with locations on it, move heroes around map to resolve quests or encounters to level up and get equipment, when character is levelled up enough, go after the random boss, first to reveal boss may find out the stats been levelling up are the wrong ones and can't win

I'm a sucker for fantasy games, so based on the reviews on BGG I was really looking forward to this. WHAT a disappointment! Hideous setup time, incomprehensible rules, tokens with no explanation of what they do... appalling. Even after I downloaded the "simple" rules from BGG, the game play was simply not interesting.

Played solo, and with my two kids. My 11 year old said he never wanted to play it again; the 14 year old's only comment was "boring", which is probably the most damning thing you can say about any game.

Definitely one for the trade pile!

RATING: 6
This is a well designed game. There is a lot going on, but the overall structure is straight forward, and easy to grasp after a play through. Print out some of the simple rules summations, as the original English rules, written by native German speakers, while entertaining, is difficult to reference. I can see this game really appealing to 10-15 year olds as they start to venture into deeper games.  

Nice basic character development game. 

Don't know how well it will hold for repeated plays. 

Interested in solo versions, but think it will feel like the same thing after a few games. We'll see.

RATING: 7.5
This game is basically a pick-up-and-deliver logistics game with fantasy trappings, which is fine by us.  There's really no reason not to play the advanced game, as even then it only lasts about 90 minutes and it gives some extra seasoning to what could be a little on the simple side.  It would be cool to have a few more quests, but the abstracted nature of the proceedings actually makes it easier to invest in imaginatively, imo.  We've got the expansion too, but haven't played with it, as it would require moving off the table and onto the floor.  Many have called this Magic Realm light - well, I haven't played Magic Realm, but I have to figure this is Magic Realm ultralight (like, 1/4 the calories).  Very nice components, and the modular map really adds to the fun, especially if you play with a random, hidden distribution.  Not a lot of direct interaction in this one (for that, go for MEQ), but still, very good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game, but only when played with the tiles placed randomly and unexplored from the beginning. Set-up time is disastrous if the pieces were not organized well when it was put away last, and the tray in the box doesn't make much sense for holding the pieces. Don't start the game if you don't have several hours to devote to it. Also, be willing to devote an addition two hours to understanding the rules, as they are (and I don't say this lightly) extremely poorly written. The manual is written entirely in dialog form. It is the most annoying rule book ever. Seriously. This is not hyperbole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple, but interesting, adventure game.  I like how the game develops as you play, and how the quest system keeps everyone moving around the board (so movement capability is important).  It has one drawback that keeps me from recommending it: the game is about completing quests but most quest items appear on the board by random draw.  This can result in some players moving back-and-forth across the board to complete quests one-at-a-time while others are able to complete several quests in one trip across the board simply because their chits are already on the board.  This has a large impact on the game and often decides who wins.  There are variants that people have come up with to mitigate this (e.g., draw two chits and select one) but it is still a factor in the game that I do not care for.

The rules are poorly written and incomplete.  Be sure to read the FAQ.

RATING: 5
Played it a second time.  Its ok.  I'd probably play it again, but it can be slow if people aren't really paying attention.

We also still threw too many things back in the bag on the second go around.

Otherwise, a fun little game with lots of Talisman flavor.  Just wish it wasn't taking us 3+ hours to play.

It would be nice if there were more quests and chits so that the game doesn't get repetitive with later plays.

I concur with the sentiment.  It's unfortunate that you should have to read the rules twice, then download the simplified version, and play a solo aborted game to get the gist of how this works.
But once you've done that, if you move the game along, this can be quite a fun pick-up and delivery adventure game.  It's fun to play, even when you lose.
Excellent artwork & bits here too.  Kudos to the art director and anyone else involved in making this look great!

The jury is still out on this one, but I think most of the problems I had with this game involved the newness of the players (almost all of us had neither played nor read the rules), the lateness of the hour, the use of the expansion (the people who'd played the base game had never played with it before).  The game art, especially on the map, is gorgeous.  The random game board layout combined with the random draws of tiles that go on the board help mix the game up a little.  The system is relatively simple to understand.  The game is piecey, but in a game of this type, pieceiness is hard to avoid.  One suggestion I would have for future replays is to have a few player aids put out for a few of the locations, like the desert, labyrinth, city of mages, and water areas.

OK, you're reading these comments and trying to figure out whether you should go with this or Runebound...there's no question, RotH is definitely the better game bumper-to-bumper.  The graphic presentation is excellent (could do without the CG art though)and the rules capture a lot of the concepts of RPG and adventure games while maintaining accessibility and efficiency- unlike the clunky, tedious systems in Runebound.  There are some weird translation/rules issues that pop up from time to time and it really is multiplayer solitaire (less so than Runebound though) but it's a lot of fun and full of flavor.  Strangely, I think the game as much in common with Merchant of Venus as it does with other fantasy adventure-style boardgames.  Wait, hear me out...most of the quests are pickup-and-deliver affairs and you have to explore to find the things you need.  There's even a similar tile exchange system and the need for planning efficient routes.  There's a similar feel, believe it or not.  At least I think it does.  The chief complaint I have is the terrible rules presentation (that requires a full comprehension of the narrative-style rulebook and a more didactic glossary) and a general lack of clarity. This is almost certainly the best game of the genre regardless of a couple of minor irritations and I think anyone inclined to this type of game will find much to enjoy.

(2007-11-25) Surely they were joking when they wrote those rules?  Wait, that's not the word I was looking for.  The rules are terrible.  My rating is two points lower because the rules are such a mess.  If you download the fan re-written rules found here on BGG it is actually a fairly decent game to play with kids (my son really likes it), and my rating would be a 6.  For adults it will get repetitive after a few games, particularly given the almost complete lack of player interaction.

Update: Now that we have Prophecy and play that so often, I can't imagine ever playing this again. If only because I refuse to slog through the novel of a rule book again. Maybe I should try the uploaded rules here, which I hear are much better.

This is pretty close to being a decent game. My son actually really likes this. But oh boy is it tedious. It's entirely possible that I just don't have the proper appreciation for theme in games, but I just don't feel the fantasy in this, despite the great art. It's all just too much of a crapshoot to me. Getting the right tiles to come out when/where you want them, getting the right roles, etc. This is not to mention the fact that there is no player interaction. I can't not mention the rulebook, which is a disaster. It's written in prose, which makes for a somewhat fun read, but impossible to find what you're looking for, especially simple details. And then there's a whole "Glossary", which is actually the rulebook part 2. I'll probably play this some more with my son, and we'll probably even have fun, but I still think it really needs some work to be a "good" game.

Tanga in August 2007.

Played first game with wife an sister/brother-in-law.  Good game!  Was able to get my wife and sister to play a D & D like game.  WOW!  Wife even wanted to play more.  Need to use this as a springboard to other games.  I enjoyed myself a lot too.

Rules plain out stink.  Download the re-write rules available for download on BGG.

Reacquired in 2014 (after trading away in 2011).  Family is old enough to give this a try and more experienced in board games.  This was a huge success.  Family played this a second time after the first playing.

Play a character in this fantasy world, trying to build up in abilities before your opponents so you can be the one to defeat the big bad guy.

Played it once.  I had a character with low speed who couldn't get any movement upgrades.  That killed it for me.  Interesting concept, and felt like an MMO in some ways with the quests and 'leveling'.

My family has developed an interest for fantasy/role-playing adventure-style games. Runebound is far and away their favorite. Return of Heroes strikes me as Runebound Lite: combat is more simple and the tasks and deeds are straightforward.  The character development in Runebound is deeper (and much more personal as you sweat for each skill increase). Nonetheless, I enjoy playing Return of Heroes, especially if in the mood for a lighter, faster game.

Fun, quick playing fantasy "quest" game.  Players take a hero and must complete a quest in order to be worthy enough to take on the Nameless One (and win the game).  The quests involve wandering over the map (pick up this, take it here, defeat that, go home...), along the way upping your skills and equipment for the final battle.  Some luck, beautiful components.  (Dec. 2004 - the English edition is here, which cleans up a few of the rules I was a little uncertain about).  If you enjoy the fantasy quest genre, you'll want this.

This game has a lot of very neat things about it.  The components are great, and many of the mechanics are pretty cool.  However, the game just leaves my wife and me with a "blah" feeling by the end.  Once you picked up an extra die or two all the challenges became too easy.  It doesn't really have the excitement of some other games in this genre (although I know others with the opposite opinion). I'd much rather play Runebound, Dungeoneer, DungeonQuest, or Talisman when I'm in the mood for this type of game.

Did someone actually think this kind of manual was a good idea? The mind reels. Also, I'm not fond of the art style. It is inconsistent. The terrain tiles were obviously done with the aid of CG, yet they look very nice. The characters and monsters on the tiles look like they were rendered for a bad 80's CD-ROM video game cut scene. The orc and troll are the same render in a different color. The wolves look like cute, friendly dogs... I could go on. But I won't. Because despite all these annoyances, this is a good game.

This game is hard to play... for me. First of all I just can't live with the awful illustration that Return of the Heroes presents. I'm happy that not all of the illustration was made with 3d program but that fact doesn't help much as drawn items look dull and characters... well they look good at the first but if you give better look on them you can see that their limbs doesn't grow right. I have studied classical anatomy and I can no longer stand badly drawn humanoid figures. The 3d and drawn illustration just doesn't work togerher they are too different.

The game itself isn't that bad but it took some time to learn how to play as the rules weren't that good. I needed to download homemade rulebook. I have only playd the original RotH and they say it gets much better with the expansions. Still I think I will keep searching for the ultimate dungeon crawler.

The game incorporates (and simplifies) elements from well-known fantasy games like Magic Realm and Talisman and marries them with some "German" game concepts. The result still incorporates luck, but there is more to it than "roll the dice", as attempting intelligent quest/item/training management (and finding the shortest route to them) keeps you interested. The relatively short playing time (in which a lot happens) is also a bonus. Also, this game seems expandable and open for interesting house rules, so any fan of the genre will not be disappointed.

My daughters and I really enjoy the game, although the rules, spread out across three booklets, are unnecessarily confusing. Beautiful pieces, but lots of them.  We say there are three games in one... the setting up game, the main game, and the putting away game.  The rating is for the main game.

Just played once 'till now, but it was a fiasco. Due to the uncomplete and unreadable german rules we had a lot of difficulty to play it smoothly.

But nevertheless there is potential and I WILL get back to it, when there will be some clarifications, or best a revision of the rules.

Im not sure why this game has gotten a bunch of 10's. The confusing Rules are in a very poor "conversation" lay-out and arent quick ref. friendly. This alone should prevent a perfect score. The rules were very frustrating to go through when me and my group pulled this out for a quick play. We really wanted to like the game too and kept at it even past the point of frustration. As we were playing we felt we were playing wrong the experience system (with additional die) seems broken & overpowering. After reading and re-reading rules over and over ive determined we played correctly but it just felt wrong. Overall it just was not fun for me, great ideas and some interesting mechanics but all the Goods are outweighted by the Bads. This is the first board game I wish I had my $50 back on. Sorry.

A rare treat to experience a fantasy adventure theme ported into a boardgame.  It has the spirit of Dungeons & Dragons w/ character attributes, chance encounters, and a common quest.

Travel the board questing and fighting in order to level up your character's skills so you can be the first to defeat one of six possible random Big Bad Bosses to win the game.  An enjoyable lightweight RPG.  After only one four-player session, I'd have to say it seemed to drag on a little too long.  Would like to try again.  Most poorly written rules ever.  The rulebook in the expansion Under the Shadow of the Dragon recaps the basic mechanics of the game much more clearly.

1 to 4 players : 2003

Players take the role of one fantasy hero traveling a hidden world, which is set up differently for every new game. Players gather mighty artifacts to solve their quests. The characters develop during the game, which brings some role-playing flair to the game. To help you feel comfortable with your character, you can even choose a gender by simply flipping the character card.

RATING: 6
This is a very beautiful game, but the rules leave a lot to be desired. All of the different tile types confuse me, and I can't find a clear explanation of them. Having said all that though, once you get it figured out it's a decent game and moves along at a fair clip. It's a bit faster than Runebound 2e, but I don't enjoy it quite as much. My one play was solitaire, but I expect it would work noticeably better with multiple players, compare to Runebound which is just as good solitaire.

After playing with my son, I have clarified my position. The game has some great ideas, but the rulebook is almost useless. Pathetic. Unacceptably bad. We have given up trying to know the rules and just go with what we think works. We agree that Runebound 2e is better.

Really want to like this game, but its only just so-so. The rules are awful. I like the quest aspects of the game, but the use of chits rather than cards means that the flavour and asthetics are both lessened. I would rather play runebound - it just feels better.

Only played with 2 player so far, but was a lot of fun. First game went for 3 hours but the first hour was spent figuring it out! Easy enough to teach once someone knows how it works. The confusion comes with which counters/tokens/tiles/ go where/when. The end was a bit anticlimatic but probably due to avoidance and thus super power ability by the time the end was faced.

Someone once described this as a cross between Magic Realm and Talisman, and I don't disagree.  Skill check system is clever, but simplified design makes this feel like a kid's game.  Graphics are both rich and slightly weird (1990s CG?).  Fun pick-up-and-deliver mechanic doesn't seem to have much replay value.  Terrible rule book makes the rules rewrite on BGG a must.  The task driven missions and explore-as-you-go (in advanced rules) is fun for my young one.  Overall, this is is a game I have a hard time taking seriously, but is worth playing once.

Only gripes are that it plays too long to get much table time around here, and the end seems a bit of an anti-climax. I don't have any idea how to handle it better, but a long dice rolling spree doesn't really fell satisfying.

Sept 08 - Simple fantasy quest genre.  Plays in 1-2 hours.  Little interaction between players (pretty much limited to 'market' and dropping creatures in each other's way).  Not sure if I'm convinced.  Fun enough after one play (7/10), but I think the long term replayability isn't there.

RATING: 7
Nice components (wooden bits, glass beads, pretty graphics), unfortunately there are 5 plastic stands for 10 heroes. I really like the modular board. RoTH has an 'adventuring' feel that Runebound sorely lacks, however Runebound's battles are more engaging. The rules are not the best but after one game we found the mechanics to be very straight-forward and fairly elegant. I much prefer RoTH over Runebound. A real gem for those that like adventuring and much less dry than Runebound's tedious "move, battle, move, battle..".

Should have been called Concierge: The Board Game.  It's just a series of banal errands with little else to break up the monotony.  No strategy, no flavor, no life, no point.

RATING: 6.5
It's a nice step up from Talisman; I like the way the character development is tracked, and the quest system is solid. The production design is a little goofy for my tastes -- a little too bright and too fairy-taleish -- and the terrain tiles suffer for showing everything with equal importance (path connections are sometimes rendered obscure by inessential flavor illustrations, for instance). I think you have to accept that these kinds of games can be capricious and imbalanced, you have to be aware that you might grind through the game for two hours only  to find that you basically have no chance against the ending villain, simply because of the skills you have developed and the items you may or may not have. You also have to accept that some die rolls will be game-changing while others will mean little or nothing, that some gear will be uber-powerful (the Broom!), while others are of dubious value (hmm ... this armor slows me down every turn and still can't protect me from that damn spider). At the end of the day you don't play this kind of game for the competition -- you play it for the shared experience with friends, and hopefully you generate some stories and have some laughs along the way. And in this the game succeeds admirably.

Can't believe this is rated as high as it is here.  Boring, broken, solitaire, random, dice-fest, with poorly written rules.  Maybe the basic game is slightly better than the advanced because at least you're guaranteed your 1st goal is on the board.  With the advanced rules, you can be sitting the whole game doing nothing but buff your character, waiting for your tiles to come out, while everyone else races ahead to the boring, dice-filled conclusion.  And woe to anyone that dies and has to basically start over... bad, bad, overrated game.

Overall: good game with limited re-play ability.  Would rate higher if re-play was not so limited.
The basic concept makes a good game.  It's like a RPG that can be played in a few hours.  Players can gather items, perform good deeds, battle monsters and eventually save the land from the Nameless.
The game has good flow, and players don't spend insane amounts of time waiting for their turn.  The rules are easy and generally conclusive (although not well-written).  
On the other hand, the game lacks variety.  After a few plays, games start to become repetitive.  Players have seen all the monsters, items and quests after just a few plays.  A larger variety of counters would increase interest in playing the game again and again.  After a few games, you learn which servants to attack (ie - where the ones with close/ranged/magic combat skills appear).   
The final conflict lacks drama and player interaction.  By the time the Nameless shows up, it is usually defeated fairly easily.   
One final note:  My game group randomly draws characters.  I groan with dispair every time I get the Mage (2 life points greatly limits the Mage's ability to travel too far from a place of healing).

Absolutely horrid, and with the expansion and six players, set aside four hours for a group that includes new people.  (Disclaimer: we did get a few rules wrong that caused the chits on the board to not recycle as quickly as they should have.)  There's not enough game in here to be fun for thirty minutes, let alone that long.  The quests are all insultingly simple and dull, and it felt like the first two hours or more were basically just setup, waiting for tiles to appear on the board, locations to get discovered, and so forth.  Nobody could accomplish anything except by incredible luck at that point in the game; the start of the game is very difficult.  There's no more feeling of adventure than Elfenland.  It's totally, utterly random.  I did like the way that the combat mechanics were designed, and that's perhaps the only thing saving this game from a 1.  I'll never play this again.

All the usual stuff one would expect in this kind of setting: random encounters, magic, monsters, quests, artifacts and your character's improving by gaining experience. The rules are much simpler than the awful rulebook may suggest. The artwork, although too "computerish" sometimes, in general looks good. However, most of the action is basically moving your character and rolling dice, so I would recommend it only to Fantasy fans. RPG players may like it, if they don't find it too simplistic. But anyone who plays only Euros and does not care for fantasy themes should stay away.

I've played 3 times so far. And, while it's quite random who will win, it has always been fun. Maybe after 20 plays my rating will drop to 6 or 5, but now it's a solid 7. The turns are quick so their's hardly any downtime, and being killed isn't necessarily a game ender.

I REALLY like this game. The artwork is fantastic and it just oozes theme. I rated the base game a 7.5 because of the horrendous manual and essential lack of co-op play (it's basically a race game), but with the addition of a few house rules this game can easily be an 8 or 9.

A fun fantasy game with great components.  Plays fast and different each time.  No player interaction, other than putting chits in other players way to try to slow them down.

I have the English version.  The rating reflects my love for Talisman RPG-lites.  Obviously, if you aren't into these fantasy pseudo-RPG's, then calling it the best in its genre is a bit of faint praise.  But it's an enjoyable game.  

CAVEAT: Do *not* use the rules provided.  Although in English, they are aggressively terrible to read and understand (it's all done in conversations that the characters have with one another, and all the information is badly organized).  As a direct result of the rules we were given (being without access to the 'Geek for better translations and summaries), set-up took longer, and we played the game fairly incorrectly for half of it.  Despite our troubles the group liked it for what it was.  

Like all Talisman-based games, there's no interaction, and a lot of running around bulking up, getting gold, etc.  There's just as much luck (everything is dice rolls), but it's mitigated much better by experience (which give you more dice to roll and then choose from for successful rolls).  This lends itself well for expansions, and will probably hit the table occasionally a la Phantasy Realm. If given a choice, I'd play Phantasy Realm or Prophecy over this one again.

[Initial Impression: 4]
Beautiful production values. I do like the possibility for variable set ups, but it still feels like each game should proceed in a similar fashion. Sure, the individual heroic quests are different, and there's the uncertainty about what is under each encounter token - but ultimately, each is just an abstract modifier on a dice roll. Complete a few quick quests to improve the number of dice you get to use and up your value in two of the three combat types, and you'll do well. Finding or purchasing a movement-enhancing item is very helpful - the ability to move quickly from quest to quest will speed your development. All in all, it's essentially a race game: improve your stats faster than the other players, beat a path to the tower of the Nameless, and hope for beneficent dice. There is very little player interaction - you can't stop others from completing their quests, can't fight each other, or trade items between players. It might actually be more interesting and fun if there were a cooperative variant. Overall, the game felt a bit too programmed to allow me to get into the role-playing aspect. New players will be better off choosing a character with high hit points - it is an extreme drawback to have to start over after a death. Although the basic rules are fairly simply to grasp, the rule book is not particularly well-written, and I hate that you have to constantly shuttle between the main rule book and a separate glossary booklet to fully understand the gameplay.

Fun game.  Deep enough to be engaging and light enough to teach pretty much anyone.  I tend to like a bit more combat in my epic fantasy quests, but this is a nice change of pace.  The Fed-Ex style of quest, while tired in PC and videogame RPGS has not really been done too much in the boardgame medium, so it is a bit of a breath of fresh air.  My only real problems are that the classes are not THAT different, there isn't really any interaction at all between players (even in Talisman you at least got to roll for the monster's combat score against your buddy's roll) and the set up time can be a bit heavy, although that is rectified by having ziplocs and being organized.  Definitely a fun game, and I would like to try out the expansion sometime.

A very enjoyable game once you wrap your brain around the million little special counters and cryptic symbols on the chits and keep the glossary for the game handy.  We printed out an FAQ which helps quite a bit.  My wife actually kind of liked it and said she would play it again - which is major red-letter for a fantasy game.  When you add in the expansions to the "full game" experience, then this hits a "9" for me.  I'm a big fan.

This seems like a decent game, definitely soloish in nature.  You are racing against others to complete your quest and then assault the big bad guy at the end.  I haven't played a game quite like it before, it seems similar to Runebound in that you are racing to defeat a bad guy but it is about finishing tasks, not about killing things.  You can gain experience through killing monsters, but that is not as common as just ferrying chits around.

Advernture boardgaming!  My wife and I actually enjoyed this one quite a bit.  I would compare it much closer to King's Quest than I would to any true RPG.  The replayability isn't bad with all of the randomness.  At the same time though, the quests and tasks aren't *that* different either.  Still though, it does a great job of delivering a full adventure in under 90 minutes.

Ideal Players: 4

Description: Explore the land to gain skills and items in preparation for the final battle. Can you defeat the ultimate evil?

Pro: Many satisfying mini-quests. Challenging boss opponents. Items add variety and specialization. Drawing encounter tiles from a bag is a great random mechanic. Wonderful art.

Con: Dice can make or break you. Random board setup can make the game easier for one character. End boss fight is a little anti-climactic, especially if it's not your character fighting.

I bought this game at Barnes and Nobles during one of their 50% sales and then didn't play it for over a year.  Once I moved to Atlanta, I was taught the game from the Cave expansion (Helden in der Unterwelt) for this game by Rob Martin.  Since this I've really enjoyed the game.

I've played anywhere from 1-5 players including the expansions and I've enjoyed it everytime.  The single player version of the game is balanced quite nicely though I think it could be about 5 turns shorter.

The game is enjoyable but I disagree with the notion that the game is more strategy than luck.  Any game where you flip random tiles and roll dice continuously is going to be very high on luck.  The best strategy seems to be getting lucky!  The winner of my first game was also the only player to die half-way through the game. They grabbed the magic broom and jumped all around the board grabbing and completing tasks in just 2 turns.

This is one of the best adventure boardgames. It is, I think, a more interesting game than Talisman and is certainly more user-friendly than Magic Realm. Unfortunately, the rules are presented as a tedious conversation between game characters. This makes the rule-related documents from BGG particularly useful. The art is nowhere near as good as, say, Talisman 2nd ed. (mmm...) or even Prophecy, but I find that I like this game more each year.

If Descent is a boiled down version of tactical RPG fights, then RotH is a boiled down "quest" part of RPGs. (An aspect which is the weakest part of boardgame/computer game RPG)  Its well done for its genre but the rulebook makes it lose a whole 1 or 2 points.  Its a simple game but written in a manner which defies comprehension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I was looking for an Adventuring game (eg Talisman) that would keep working for both myself and my wife. Neither Talisman nor Runebound had seemed to be it but there was clear potential for something to fill this gaming place for us.

RotH is one of those surprising games that (a) my wife kept asking for repeatedly when we first got it open and (b) I kept losing at but really enjoy anyway. (I wonder if the two are related?)

It takes a while to glean all the tweaks out of the rulebooks but it doesn't matter... for the odd things where you can't get the answer in a few moments during play you just make something up and keep going, it's not dependant on rule precision.

RATING: 7
I see it as a 'Magic Realm' influenced euroized RPG game. 

It's very good, easy to learn (but the rules can throw you at first), high replay factor. It looks nice when it's set up and it has good variety with random tiles and variable set up (map and events). It's also prime for expansions. The character cards are fantastic and really help the game flow out; it also helps learning the system.

A very good RPGish game. Great solitaire (and HARD to beat in the given time frame); great for sick days.

When I first saw the game here on the Geek I was interested but didn't want another RUNEBOUND. This is no RUNEBOUND, it's a lot better! RUNEBOUND and ARKHAM both borrowed from this game but this game borrowed from TALISMAN. Easy to start playing and learn as you go. The modular board makes it a little different each time you play and also makes it easily expandable. It comes with an excellent solataire version which is a huge plus over RUNEBOUND. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game, great components, bad art. Dull selection of player characters. Not enough variation of quests, items, etc. Great modular board. Interesting combat. More compelling mechanics than Runebound, but far less content.

The trade off, IMO, falls in ROTH's favor.

Its a bit long and mostly solitaire, but there's genuine drama and fun here, which means it gets played!  MUCH better than Prophecy.  Probably has the best of the simple combat systems - ROTH has two 'dimensions': the number of dice rolled and the modifier, which adds something extra to the simple roll+modifier in most of these kids of games.  The penalty for dying is VERY harsh - house rules might be required.  If you die you are pretty much out of the game.

This is a fun adventure game with a variable board and non-linear events. The sequence of play is simple to pick up and the game moves fast. Advancing your character's skills is fun, and not knowing which Nameless One you will face creates a bit of tension. The theme is strong, and this game is begging for an expansion so that replayability doesn't become an issue. I've enjoyed this both as a solo game and with a group.

This game provides a real feeling of adventure.  You explore the lands and take on tasks to gain gold, experience and items.  You fight monsters and eventually have to face the Nameless One.

The rule book for the expansion In the Shadow of the Dragon is much, much better and works well for the original game.

After 3 plays, the game can either go pretty fast or pretty slow. The number of players doesn't seem to have much of an impact (although 2 player was the slowest). The map layout and the random marker layout and the random tile draw will determine whether or not a particular game drags on or goes by fast.

A fine fantasy "race" game with questing and slaying a-plenty.  Rules are a tangled mess (they have the clarity of a manual for a chinese mp3 player) but the turn summary card in the English version makes some of the basics a lot clearer.

This game just drips with atmosphere, and I really wanted to like it. However, this is a luck-fest. That by itself would not be so bad, but it is 2.5 hours.

The game was fun for about 30 minutes but after that it was a lot of the same things.  And on top of that you had a good idea without really thinking too much as to what to do next and you are just stuck waiting for your turn.  This game also seems to be you against the game playing solitaire while everyone else is doing the same.  Not enough interaction b/w the different players, if any at all.

RATING: 8
Return of the Heroes as a single, yet very glaring, flaw: it's not as newbie-friendly as it seems. The game's pace depends solely on the players, and doesn't give them enough information about what they're supposed to face. If players behave excessively cautiously, which is quite common with newbies, the game will drag. I get the impression the game would benefit from a built-in timer, so if players haven't awakened the evil guy after a certain number of turns, it would awaken on its own.

Now, if players do keep moving things forward, it's a great adventure game. Mixes combat with pick-and-deliver in a very satisfying way. It lacks the narrative weight of, let's say, Fury of Dracula or Android, but also it's way more elegant and streamlined.

My group wasn't too fond of this game. I enjoyed it quite a bit though. Especially the rules of getting killed and losing practically everything seems too hard to swallow, and the game drags on too long.
Oh well, if no one else will play it again, at least it has solo rules. But frankly, I rather play Dungeoneer or Runebound than this.
Update: This seems to go well with friends at work, played a few dozen turns per day. Finally getting a few more plays..

After reading a lot of reviews, [GAMEID=8170] kept popping up as a light rpg with Euro qualities, so we ended up getting it in a trade.  Unfortunately, the rumors of the horrible, incomprehensible rulebook were true.  Our first session took over three hours as we tried to figure out how to set up the game and then had to try to consult the rulebook after every turn.  I highly recommend downloading the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/28176]rules rewrite[/url] by Nova2001, which makes the gameplay so much clearer.  I also recommend skipping the confusing introductory setup and just going right to the standard setup.  Still, despite this agonizing session, my girlfriend thought that it wasn't bad, so my hopes weren't completely dashed.  Still, it ended up sitting on the shelf for months.

I finally printed out the great corrected rules here and we had another go.  This time, we ended up playing [i]3 games in a row in only 3 hours[/i] and had a lot of fun.  The gameplay is actually fairly straightforward once you know what you're doing.  The emphasis on completing tasks and quests gives the game a sense of accomplishment, especially as you watch your character gain experience and life points.  At the same time, like any good Euro, it's also a race game---you have to optimize your character in the most efficient way possible by balancing different resources (experience, skill, and gold).  Although the standard quests are the same, the way that they're drawn from the bag unseen, the modular map, the different characters, the variety of heroic quests and ultimate evil Nameless Ones, gives the game a lot more replayability than expected.  There's no direct player interaction, but we do like placing newly drawn monster tiles in front of the other player.  We also got the first expansion [GAMEID=13751] in the trade as well, and together they make a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

First play. Worst rulebook ever. Lots of question during play... half of them without answers. Plus some of the agme components had errors on them (one of the Nameless tile + stubborn magic broom). I guess the second game would be better since we will know most of the tiles. But still, this game feels repetitive to me. You move your character toward a quest/subquest goal. Resolve an encounter. Draw a tile. Repeat till end of game.

I like the experience cube. They add a feeling of improvement to the game. But I must say that for me Dungeonneer is a similar game (exploration/RPG/Quest solving) that is much shorter, clearer has more player interaction (with the monsters + you can attack the other player) and way better rule explanation!

I actually like the race to finish first aspect of the game but you can't be to hasty because you'll end up dead and back where you started. The only drawback to this one is that once you've played it a couple of times you pretty much know what's coming up next. Its still a lot of fun and also good for someone who doesn't like direct competition with their opponent. It can also work as a good game to introduce someone to board games.

Great game but it is missing 1 very important thing.  There is NO reason to play with other people.  This game has ZERO interaction.  I have only found 1 thing in this and the expansion that allows you to steal a cube from another player by (get this) visiting their house.  Other then that you will never interact with each other (except for putting monsters in their path)  That and the HORRIBLE rules books mar what could have been a exceptional game

     This is a game of similar hue to Talisman.  It is a good one if you are sickened near death of that game.  Its emphasis lies more on the completing of quests than combat, though quests are pretty much limited to errand running and skill tests (dice tossing).  Also, there is a certain sense of class that the German style of production lends to this game that Talisman lacks.

Beautiful components and a some new ideas for the pseudo-RPG genre - several of them quite good, too - but I don't think there is enough player interaction to make the fun last for long. And unless we missed something terribly important, luck is far more important than strategy.
Played once.

An excellent fantasy boardgame. Only downside for me is the "race" aspect. I've posted a variant that solves this problem for me, giving each player the option of choosing their own goals for the game. 

With this variant the game is a 8 for me.

5: Kind of a long game with no real player interaction. Build your stats and try to kill the "boss." The random placement of chits and area tiles makes for a different game each time. I pretty well play this only when my kids ask to play.

RATING: 6
The conversational style rules make it almost impossible to play this game correctly the first time around.  The reference book helps.  However, if you can find someone to teach you the game, it's actually a very good game.  Death rules might as well be player elimination.  The way things get removed from the board, at a certain point, when you die, your game is over.  You cannot possibly catch back up.

Got this one under the misapprehension that it was Magic Realm re-made but playable, The worst rulebook ever and some strange quirky rules but a fun experience that scratches an itch. I mis-understood a rule and the warrior was zipping around on a broomstick which slightly un-balanced the game! Has to be a strong candidate for worse rulebook ever.

Return of the Heroes is a hidden gem of a game. I and the two other I played with were pleasantly surprised with how much fun this game is. The tiles remind me a lot of Magic Realm but with faster playing with no down time and easier to teach to new players. The first two turns were almost too simple then the game really turned into quite a fun time. It plays like a board game version of the PC or console fantasy world exploration games where you race to build up your stats in order to be the first player to kill the evil lord. It has a modular board and lots of replay ability. I actually like this game better than Prophecy.

I personally like this game. It's a light one, the setup is quite long but once the rules are known the game goes on smooth.
To play just for fun, there's almost no place for strategy. But if you like to have some dice rolling and play a kind of "talisman" with some new ideas, this game fits right.

An amazing mix between awesome bits and laughably bad CGI art, I'm still amazed at how you can have such a huge spectrum of production quality represented in a single game. The rules are some of the worst written I've ever encountered though. 

Me and the Boy play it two player fairly often, and we can kick out a game pretty quickly. I really like that there are some narrative threads to follow on you way to the final battle, something I find lacking in similar games.

I've also taken to playing with a variant found here that allows for more flexibility in victory conditions based on a point system for completing all kinds of different goals.

2 / 5 - Fair.

A game with multiple flaws which is ultimately redeemed by it's rich narrative, built around the quest/task system, and the fact that it's slap-bang spot on in terms of weight and length for a game of this type. The solo game is also tense, fun and often challenging. Still want the flaws? Okay: it lacks variety, depth, player interaction, combat, and it's horrible when you have to wait forever for the tile *you* need to come out of the bag. But it's still fun.

It's quick and lightweight. In fact, it's everything that you would expect after reading the rules. Sometimes adventure games just seem to come alive when you actually play them. This was just not one of those times.

I think the experience one has with this game is almost entirely dependent on the attitude of the players. There isn't much in terms of strategy or tactics, but the collection of stuff and experience can be satisfying as long as no one takes the game too seriously. Probably better with fewer players as with 4 I imagine the downtime would be too severe.

This is my favorite of the fantasy adventure games. Great production, beautiful components and map sections. Tremendous theme and flavor. I like that quests are available to 'level-up' rather than just endless combat. Wonderful 1-4 players. A great substitution for those of us who no longer have time to get TT RPGs on the table. Talisman on Steroids, less complicated than Runebound and way less complicated but slightly reminiscent of Magic Realm. The rules are horrible though, so be prepared to take some time to puzzle them out, read extra material or have someone teach you. Its worth the effort.

2nd play took 2Â½ hours.  I made up my mind to give up on it...until I read in the forums that we were playing training incorrectly.  When you train, if you have multiple dice, you can choose the 2 highest dice to help you "fail".  This makes it MUCH easier to boost your stats and will speed up the game considerably!  I'll have to give it one more play...

A cool pick up and deliver style quest game with nice mechanics.  Horrible, sloppy rulebooks (so get the rewrite posted in the files). I wish the art was more vintage and less digital but that's just my taste.  One of the best light RPG style games.  Bummer about the non english expansions.  Also, I recommend using the optional wrap around movement rules to help out the slower characters since planning your moves is key.  Plays great with 2 players all the way to 6 players and can accommodate younger gamers as well. Great with 4. I like it more than Runebound, Talengarde and Talisman, but not as much as Prophecy, Wizards, and Magic Realm.

Although there are some components and ideas to this game which are tacky and pretty rubbish, the gameplay itself shines through and is quite a joy to experience. Not sure its better then Talisman 2nd (my fantasy adventure choice) but I'd be happy to play again.

Needs more varied encounters- towards the end of the game their seems little to do other then fight monsters- but our encounter bag just had the same three monsters taking turns to swap between being in the bag and on the board again.

RATING: 5
I really like RPGs and have been looking for something to replace a bit the RPG experience when we're just 2.  I've tried Runebound, and found it somewhat lacking, Talisman as well. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Fiddly would be justified, too many small chits spread across a board make it visually already hard to see what's where, and keep track, but the rules are also not very logical. Plus it dragged on... A shame, but this is not the RPG fix I was looking for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A  great, underrated game but not without its faults. RotH solitaire game is well done since the countdown forces you to hurry to complete your quest and gain experience to battle The Nameless.  My four player game was essentially a solitaire exercise with excessive downtime.  It could have ended up much sooner if we had known The Nameless was pretty weak.  

The map tiles look great on the table but the character and creature artwork on the tiles are terrible; reminicent of 80's CGI.  Why couldn't they have used the same artwork as the character cards?  Also, the cheesy rules are poorly organized therefore more complicated than they should be.  Don't get me wrong, this really is a good game with some great concepts.  The game mechanics work really well and the mini-quests provide a nice RPG feel.  I just wish it had a clearer and better organized rulebook and consistant artwork for all of the components.

Beautiful looking game with great tiles, curious euro wooden blocks and a flimsy fantasy theme.  Plays quite enjoyably for a while but becomes a bit samey, and the chit and block management rather than card encounters with art means it just doesn't quite live up to its competitors.  Has nice solo rules and levelling, but sometimes you'll level up say, fighting skills, only to realise they're useless against the boss and that you wasted a lot of time.

I really liked this, it's the first Magic Realm like game that actually captures some of the feel of MR.

The chummy rulebook approach is OK, but leaves many of the important rules in the glossary, so make sure you read through that as well.

My main problem believe it or not is the artwork.  Appealing art in character sheets both male and female; awful computer-generated art in monster chits.  Things written down in small chits is a pain to pick up and read.  Board itself is beautiful and I like the traveling aspect, but the effort given to it is uneven.  There are some things I like, others I don't and the final fight is all about the roll of the dice.  I don't know, overall my personal feeling about this game is more negative than positive.  Runebound interested me better and it seemed better but not good enough to stay.

RATING: 6
Can be way too long for what it is. Component quality is fine. I'm even willing to overlook the laughably bad poser-quality 3d graphics used for the art. It's light Tolkein fantasy done in the most typical way possible.

Game mechanics are fine. Tends to degenerate into way too much walking around (and around, and around) the board looking for the correct things to complete your quests. 

I rarely want to play this anymore, but I have some non-gamer friends who do enjoy, so I pull it out more than I want to.

Played now the basic game with 4 and 3-player game with the Grail expansion. Both have been very good experiences. RotH is a very good fantasy themed adventure type game. There is exploring, fighting monsters and gaining experience & skill enchanting items. It is not very deep game but as games take only 1,5 to 2 hours it offers enough content for that time frame. A good combination of experience game and a "real" game.

Update (30.5.2010): Using Dragon-expansion the game length is increased and therefore you might want to stick to 3 players when playing with that.

Fantasy adventure game in the same vein as Talisman. Although this has good production and some well thought out mechanics it takes a while to get going and lacks player interaction. The quests are basically pick up and deliver and there is little tension as players race to maximise a stat and fight the dark lord. I have to question the replayability as the quests are the same each time. I think the pseudo-RPG board game isn't a game genre that appeals to me anymore - or maybe I haven't played one that delivers what I expect.

I really enjoy this game solitaire.  I played my first two player game the other day (as the mage), and found that the game was very easy.  The nameless posed no challenge whatsoever even after the -3 penalty he gave.  It seems very easy to level up quickly and the fact that you can just run past random encounters that may give your particular character a problem after one round of combat with them doesn't help.  Still I enjoy the game and want to see how it plays with more than two.  I am also interested in the first expansion.

This is so much fun to play! The best description of this game is an ultra easy version of Arkham Horror! It's easy in that it's easy to beat the game! You travel around the board collecting items and gaining experience and strength! When you are ready you engage the big bad guy (who resembles Sauron) and fight to win or until death! It may be a great way to introduce kids into this type of game play! The rule book is lousy...but the game is enjoyable and can be played solo too! You can print up a redesigned set of rules from the files section that greatly speeds things up! I am so glad I got this before it went out of print!

I like the idea. It looks like perfect fantasy adventure game. But it isn`t. Despite very promising mechanic (small downtime, quest system) it lack variety. After 5-6 games it starts to feel like dejavu - the same quests, monsters, characters, obvious choises. And NO interraction. Only the official co-operative variant gives much help. But I still consider Talisman a better game. Although it`s almost totally random it `s got much more variety and sense of adventure (at least for myself).

Light fantasy themed adventure game.  I like that the game is heavily quest-based and fast moving.  Also big props for detailed solitaire rules, introductory game rules and a system that scales perfectly from 2-4 players.

Played only the introductory game with 2 players. It showed that game had potential but was missing quite a lot. Don't bother with the introductory game, hop right into the real thing!
(Expecting this one being 8 after more plays.)

RATING: 5
Fun fantasy romp. Pretty, but cheesy, components (What about this whole thing about female warriors running around wearing thongs - whose fantasy are we talking about anyway?).
No negligable amount of luck (placement of map tiles, tile draws, combat rolls) but still strategy and choices enough to make it interesting (what tasks to accept, which road to take). Solo game works OK. Only some player interaction - more like a racing game actually (How do I optimize my acquisition of experience/skills/items to as quickly as possible be able to defeat the dark lord?)
Expansions are hinted and will be appreciated to lengthen the life of the game.
Language on the components are mostly flavor, the information is pretty easily reduced to coordinates, stats and modifiers. With an english translation of the rules you will get by.
*Update*
Replayability low!

[Tentative Rating] I've only given this game one solo play. I'm interested in getting it out but it just hasn't hit the table again yet. [2nd Play] I got a two player in. The game took a bit too long for what it was. To speed things up next time I think I'd discard any chit pulled for a heroic task that wasn't in the game.

Really like the D&D on the board idea but had to pass it along to make room on the shelf. (RA)

Fun game although there doesn't really appear to be that much depth to it, given the apparent complexity of the rules.

Firstly, I'm not a fan of fantasy worlds(except Lord of the Rings in small doses)and so now I find I can't get enthusiastic with the theme of this game. Played solo once but the rules fiddliness don't help. But I have strong suspicions that once your attempt at overcoming the Nameless one has failed, there may be no hope of getting back into the game. However, the game seems too long for at least two players that I can't see myself playing this to test my suspicion.

Very good fantasy feeling for a game that seems a deeper version of Talisman. Well balanced, good play-mechanics and interesting decisions to make during the game (luck factor is high but lesser than games like Talisman, Runebound or Dungeoneer, in my opinion); good game difficulty - the final bosses are tough!
Really great components.
On the bad side the very poor interaction between players, the artwork which I don't like very much and the 'cold' (german) theme.

A good game even though the title is a bit of a misnomer. If the Heroes were returning from somewhere, they should be stronger than "level 1 pukes" or maybe it means that we haven't seen heroes in this world for a long while. But in that case, the world should be overrun with evil but this is clearly not the case as we still have archery competitions at the county fair. So this game is rated a 6 if you call it 'Return of the Heroes' but it gets an 8 rating with the proper name of 'The Adventures of Steve & Gary'

Pretty good fantasy game.  Great bits.  Instructions are horrible (worse I've seen) and require a download from BGG to understand how to play.  However, once you understand how to play, it's rather easy.  I only played it with 2 players, I think it would play better with 4, as we tended to overbuild our characters instead of racing to beat the "UnNamed One".  I think with more players to dilute the oppertunities to build character and gain items, it would be more challenging.

Nice adventure game which sometimes takes a little long to get going and than can be over pretty quickly. Your actions are very much dictated by the chits that you reveal and it can be very frustrating if your character does not develop properly due to bad chit draw or bad dice rolls. But if you are not a control freak and like adventure-type games, it can be great fun.

 Our family likes it.  We use the joke that Runebound was Everquest II, but this game is the much superior World of Warcraft!   Yes, both Movement and Combat are less complex and perhaps less tactical.   But the strategic levels are the same and the FUN factor is very high.   Great job with making Quests that are easy to understand (and printable on a small counter) yet still have a world of feel and immersion.  After many plays time to go on the trading block.

Hard to get past all the difficulties in the rules. If they'd spent as much time polishing the rules as they did in producing this admittedly nice looking game, it would be a home run.

Imagine a computer-RPG three notches simpler than the simplest one you've ever played, with excellent graphics, played with three of your friends who are stationed on separate offline computers in the same room.  It's immersive fun, trying to obtain magic items, killing orcs, improving your sword skills.  The fact that it's such a simplified RPG is good for a boardgame--it causes less rules-headaches (and there is still quite a lot of looking at rules as you play, though at least the game has the benefit of allowing players to start up with little rules explanation).  On the minus, it's simplified also in the sense that the monster difficulty doesn't appreciably advance as the game goes on, so there's less sense of accomplishment than you would feel in a computer-rpg (though this is to be expected when comparing a 1.5-hr boardgame to a 40-hr computer game).  Also, there's very little interaction between players--you may as well be playing on different boards.  Too simple and too long for my tastes normally, and definetely too much of a multi-player solitaire, but I had fun traveling through strange and beautiful lands, going on quests, improving my combat abilities, gaining cool stuff, and watching my buddies do the same.  This is probably great with kids 8-12!

--Dec2006-- Amusing quest game.  My primary experience in the genre is Magic Realm, and RotH is pretty small potatoes in comparison.  On the other hand, it stacks up fairly well against Prophecy, which I find is a pretty nice afternoon's entertainment.  So:  all things considered, not too bad.  Well, other than the rules, at least; they're quite appalling.

RATING: 6
We really enjoy this game.  It seems like it shouldn't be so fun, looking over its fairly straight-forward mechanics, and somewhat terse encounter and quest descriptions (most of the time, they're simply beasties with specific difficulty ratings and a listed reward for beating them--similary, "quests" typically will provide only a coordinate to reach and a reward for doing so).  We get a kick out of the occasional term left in the original German (appears here and there as if missed by the translator).  The game rules are original in that they are presented in a "story" format, and by "origianal", I mean WAY frustrating.  "What chapter do they explain end-game conditions in?"  Interesting concept that obviously was more about being different than being usable.  It is necessary to read through a dialogue with caracitures of figures from the game in order to learn to play.  However, for a translated game, the completeness and understandability of the rules is stellar--one of the best I've seen.  And the additional Glossary book nearly always provides the exact information one seeks--excellent job on that!!  The components are high-quality, the artwork very satisfying, and the storage tray is one of the best I've seen--probably could have been more attention paid to enclosing the little bits somehow (I still use baggies as does anyone who travels with games a lot--it stinks if you've got to go through a duffel looking for the one errant chit!!).  All in all, a great value and enjoyable game to own and play.  It's starting to become a new favorite.  I don't honestly see the simiarity to Magic Realm (apart from the obvious board similarities and general theme cadence)--it is I guess like comparing Runebound to Talisman.  If you like one, you'll likely enoy the other.  At any rate, a worthy addition to any fantasy/RPG collection.  Also a very good game for younger kids and adults alike, and therefore a good family game.

A very nice fantasy game in which players develop their characters to make them stronger and get some valuable items to be ready for the final match.  Nevertheless, before to try to beat the Bad Guy, they must prove they are good enough performing a quest that will make them travel around the board.  Speaking of the map, it is modular, so each game is different. I had heard that the game was silly, cause the items needed for the quests come out from a bag and there is a chance that the one needed just doesn't go out.  In our game experience, the items have came out very quickly and in the perfect time, cause even if they would have gone out earlier, nobody would have been strong enough to fulfill the correspondant quests.

A unique take on a Talisman type game.  Very fiddly and setup is a chore but very entertaining.  Is quite epic when the expansion is added but much longer unless you use a few house rules.  The manual is horrible!  Get the expansion "Under the Shadow of the Dragon" which has a much better manual to help understand the game.  There's also a wonderful player made manual in the file section.

RATING: 4
This is one of my daughter's favorites, but I find the game drags for me. The components are gorgeous, but that simply cannot make up for the lackluster play. In RotH, you adventure around with your hero, running errands which you pick up all around the modular board. You also spend some time fighting monsters to gain gold and experience, becoming as strong as possible to fight the end game boss. Like I said, my daughter really enjoys this game - it reminds me of roll-and-move games. Although you do not actually roll to move, there is plenty of moving and plenty of rolling. One frustrating aspect of the design is that, often, in order for you to complete a quest, the person/thing you need will not be on the board. This is because many of them start in a bag, and things are randomly drawn out of the bag when you defeat monsters, for instance. The game also takes at least two hours. There isn't a huge amount of downtime, there just aren't any very interesting decisions to be made. Finally, rulebook = ugh. I mean, the rules aren't that complex at all, but the organization and presentation of rules makes the game much harder to learn than it has to be. Part of the problem is that cardboard chits are used throughout the game and the vitals are not actually on the chits. So you have to dig through a glossary until you are familiar with them. But the rulebook in general is also put together in counterintuitive fashion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rulebook sucks (though the narrative style is kind of interesting), but the game itself is pretty fun for the most part.  Sometimes doesn't feel epic enough, but perhaps by combining the game with the expansion may help.  My only complaint is not enough variety in the chits; it could probably use more stuff to keep it fresh.

I would imagine that this game would be fantastic to play with your kids.  There are some nice mechanics in this and the art is clear and works well with the game.  This game certainly is superior to Runebound, only in that the game snaps along at a decent pace. At its roots though, this game is really one of those "fun enough" games, and for the length of what I can only imagine the average playing time must be, I would think that it would often overstay its welcome.  It certainly had in our group (of course, we did have some tile replenishing issues).   Overall, outside of our perhaps mistaken impression of how long the game should be, I feel that this game lacks the interaction of Talisman, the free form movement system of Runebound, both of which ranks those games in higher esteem for me.  One last thing, the most embarassing rules, ever.  I can't see ever playing this again.

This is an awesome fantasy adventure game and a great gaming experience. Completing quests is fun and drives the game forward. Players always have several tasks to juggle, so they stay involved. The variable set up for the map, encounters, tasks, and creatures keeps players coming back for more.

Very basic game. Pretty good components, though. The rules are horribly, horribly written! (Download one of the two excellent unofficial re-writes to figure out how to play this thing. It's a relatively simple game.)

The first time we played it, we had some of the basic rules wrong (we were rushed).

Don't mix both sets together (Under the Shadow of the Dragon) unless you have four or more players. We did it two-player and it took forever to complete the quests / have the Nameless appear, because we couldn't draw the right chips from the bag.

It's a challenge to separate out the components of the two sets: I suggest marking the random chips and the bag chips for the Shadow game.

Basically a pick-up-and-deliver game. Your character runs around exploring, looking for tasks. Tasks generally make you go to one or more locations and reward you with experience and/or gold. Along the way, you'll have encounters where you fight monsters for experience. Other encounters do other stuff, e.g., have an auction for items, give you a free item, etc. Combat is by rolling d6: roll more dice with more experience, always choosing 2 dice to sum (trying to get a lower total than whatever your skill is in the type of combat you're fighting: magic, ranged or melee). Eventually you've built up your character and go after the Nameless One: you need to complete your personal Heroic Quest (4 steps) to get a relic that gives you access to the Nameless One's location, and you go there and try to kill him. There are several versions in the game, chosen randomly for each play.

In our 4er game, we were all new and the game took 2.5 hours (play time, not rules)! Too long! As usual, we spent too much time wandering around -- some people could've killed him earlier. Still, movement can be slow (esp for my lame-ass dwarf who could only move 2). Always keep some money around (getting more can be tough -- somewhat random) in case a market comes up. I didn't, and couldn't buy boots/horse so was stuck moving 2/turn for a LONG time. The rules are HORRIBLY written but once you've figured it out it is really a pretty simple game. It ought to play more quickly than Runebound, although I think I prefer the latter -- more variety in play, easier to get around. Will have to try this with 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 5
Only tried once.  So far, I prefer Runebound if I want to play a pseudo-RPG.  The heart of this game is quests, which is basically taking some item to some predetermined spot on the board.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like this -- it's sort of an updated (and more playable) Magic Realm.  But there's no real player interaction, and somehow the flavor isn't quite right, so it left me a little flat.
Update 2013-08: Turns out this is a very good RPG crossover for non-gamer nerd-friendlies and kids. Re-rated with that in mind, as most of my gaming these days is with those two audiences.

Well for anyone who thought RPG's were only for videogames, now they are in board games. This is a relatively easy to learn game that has quite a bit of playability and again, is an actual rpg. That alone makes it worth a look. Many games give you rules and options to play with yourself which are pretty depressing because... you're playing with yourself. However you may get the sudden urge to do so with this one. They have a scoring system that takes tally of almost everything you do and lets you try to beat your personal best. As this is an rpg it is actually kind of fun.

RATING: 6
A nice fantasy adventure boardgame with simple rules, not too much chrome and a nice story arc. But as much as I dislike chrome, games of this type really need it to prevent them from becoming stale after a few plays. Return of the Heroes just has too little variety to offer in the items, quests and monsters tha players are confronted with. Runebound, a very similar game in alle respects, does this a lot better. So I kept that and traded Return of the Heroes away.

Math trade March 2010.

Mucked around with this a bit tonight. First impression, the rules suck. Hard. Luckily, there's a good revision here on the Geek (highly recommended, made the game playable). Second impression, even with the re-written rules, many tasks/events are still unclear.

Played through with the wife. Since I explained the rules instead of making her read them, things went well, and she enjoyed it.

*EDIT* After a few games with "the guys", this one ranks high. The wife likes it, I just need the expansion so we can have more players...

*RE-EDIT* A few plays of this plus the expansion, and we're really enjoying it. Unlike most games, though, we don't automatically default to using the expansion as it adds quite a bit of time to the game. This makes breaking down the game a somewhat long process as we have to separate everything back out...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is our first fantasy adventure game, and it has quickly become my wife's second favourite game, just behind her long-time favourite, "The Settlers of Catan".  And I kind of enjoy it too, despite it's high degree of randomness in the dice rolls, the discovery of the encounters, and the drawing of tiles from the bag; and its rather excessive game length for such a repetitive game.  In a game like this, the randomness merely adds to the sense of adventure and excitement (and occasionally the frustration), as well as the re-play factor.  It is a beautiful game, even if the artwork on many of the tiles is rather strange and slightly grotesque.  It is also a game which has a lot of possibilities for variations and the possibility even for creating your own events, items, creatures, and quests.  To be honest, we've never played this game without the  "Under the Shadow of the Dragon" expansion (I'm glad we had THAT rule book!), however I suspect that playing the base game would be almost as fun, and would certainly shave off some of the rather lengthy playing time, which is possibly the biggest downfall of this game in my opinion.  There just isn't quite enough variety of things happening to keep me interested for 4 or 5 hours in a 4-player game.  However, I've gone to a LOT of work to create a playable variant that incorporates both the expansions that we own...  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/402460 ...and I am now much more satisfied with the game.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total 6/10

RATING: 5
As far as fantasy RPG-like boardgames go, this one is pretty good.  It definitely has a very Euroish feel to it which can be good or bad, depending upon how you view Euros.  Personally, I think the Euroish rules are a good thing here because they keep the game moving, minimize downtime, and make the game accessible to many different players.  ROTH features wonderful bits and artwork, but I don't know about the replay value.  The reason I say this is that half the fun of the game is discovering the different quests, NPCs, and monsters.  Once you have played the game a few times, things start to feel kind of repetitive because you are already familiar with everything.  Thus it becomes more of just a pick-up and deliver game with a little combat thrown in.  I think I'll need to try Runebound and Descent to make a full comparison.  Overall though, ROTH is a decent game that warrants trying if you are itching to play a game in this genre.

RATING: 7.5
Game has good theme play and is fun.  Easy to learn and play.  The movement system allows players to freely move where they choose.  The combat system is simple and eloquent, keeps the game moving.  Characters gain experience and items over the course of the game to become more powerful.  Player interaction is minimal.  The game has high replay value due to the modular board and other mechanics.  The components are of good quality; however, the rulebook is unclear about many aspects of the game.

This will never be my favorite type of game, but for what it was, I enjoyed it! More to think about than Talisman. More elegant than Runebound. Seriously, with this in my collection, I never have to play those again. I can't wait to turn my son into a Return of the Heroes fan.

Update: Okay, I have successfully turned my son into a RotH fan. Meaning: I've played about five times in the last two weeks. I think I've basically seen all there is to see. I'm sure my son will have no problem recruiting his friends to play with him.

Played 4 solo games and 3 two-player and had a blast; this is all in the two day time span since I received it.  It is definitely similar to Talisman, but I like it better.  It does not take as long to play and has more flavor.  I look forward to filling that cloth sack up with expansions chits!  I would think that alternate boards would be fun, too; a cavern, dungeon, castle, etc.  You name it.

A game bought with adventure in mind. I love the idea of the game and roleplaying the adventures, but as it turns out I am not much of a roleplayer.

We tried the game with the kids, but it fell flat. Given a few more years, it might have worked, but no patience to let it stick around.

The game is very fiddly, has some interesting bits to it, but in the end was just not cutting it.

RATING: 7
Once I got past the terrible rulebook and fudgy artwork (I much prefer Talisman-like artwork myself), the game itself plays out very well. My wife and I came down to 1 turn from winning from each other. I just wish that the rules were better organised and that special rules (like markets, healing at the White Village, etc) were printed on the board itself.

Oh yeah, and whoever said that this game was "Magic Realm-lite" must be tripping on drugs or something - this game doesn't come close to anything like MR at all.

I really wanted to like this one; the bits, theme and art are wonderful. The game can drag, though, and the end-game boss monster may not make an appearance before things get a bit tedious. The luck factor also is pretty steep for a game of this length, and the lack of player interaction hurts. It's one that I might play once in a great while, but not good enough to rise above "average."

(only solo play so far) overall solid gameplay, although I prefer fantasy games that are less 'lighthearted' and more 'moody' - furthermore, there are some problems in the solo variant (try beating the 45 round limit with the dwarf who can only move 2 spaces per turn... sheer madness!)

RATING: 7
Painfully close to being a wonderful quest-based adventure game! While those quests can be evocative and the randomize map fun to explore, the horrendous rules, bad usability on the components, and some strange design decisions (not being able to "see" the Big Bad until you fight him... and discover he's immune to your powers) prevent this one from knocking others in the genre from their throne.

Once you get past the horrible, horrible rules there is a fun game here.  A different fantasy game that is more about pick-up-and-deliver and racing than fighting.  My only big complaint about the game (as opposed to the rule book, about which I have no end of complaints) is that it seems a bit long for what it is (explore, accomplish task, maybe fight, hope the markers for your big quest appear, repeat).  Right now, this dampens my desire to play more, but this may get better with more play and familiarity.  My 9 year old daughter enjoys it, and my younger daughter (6) just played her first game as well, so I expect to get fairly regular plays in at their request.

It seemed to be a good game for the kids, and we adults didn't mind it.

Liked the playing of the game, but the ending was a bit of a disappointment.  1st time playing for the 3 players in our game, so maybe we missed something.
My son demoed "Shadows of Dragon" at GenCon and really liked it. 
I want to play this again and see if the rating goes up.
**Update** Played again and the ending still sucks, but the play during the game is great.  However, it's usually just a race at end to see which character gets to the end 1st since they will usually kill.  
Also, have to add in house rules or the game would take way too long, if you lose everything when you die.

This game really is fantastic to look at with wooden cubes, agreeable artwork and a fantastic(!) looking board. It is also very suitable for non-gamers, as the rules are really easy to teach. The manual, however, truly is awful. Also, after two very enjoyable sessions, I question the replayability of this game. Hopefully the expansion, which I just ordered, will remedy this feeling. At least for now, I like this a bit better than Talisman (a game to which it really should be compared). At least its playing time is much more manageable. I also feel that you only need one game of this ilk in your collection, as Runebound, Talisman and this game are pretty similar.

This game has incredible potential for its world exploration system, but this gets overshadowed by the sole emphasis on pick up and delivery.

I thought the rules were written well enough to play an introductory game after just one read through. We did have to refer to the rules and glossary during the game, but everything was found. Pretty fun game, I just wish the expansions added to the flavor of the game rather than change the feel of it. I probably won't be getting either of them.

RATING: N/A
Players take the role of one Fantasy-Hero traveling a hidden world which is set up differently for every new game. Players gather mighty artifacts to solve their quests. During games the characters develop which brings some role-playing flair to the game. (to help you feel comfortable with your character you can even choose the gender of your character by simply flipping the character-card before game start). Can be played solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
So, on the one hand, the combat mechanism is pretty cool, as is the way that you improve your odds with more experience cubes.  On the other hand, the game seems to be heavily weighted to the person who gets the most experience the fastest, and that sort of depends on how quickly your goal tiles turn up from the random draw.  I think once players know the game well enough, the game would play quickly enough where it's not that big of an issue, but learning the insides and outs of the game takes a lot of checking, double-checking, and re-reading.  AIGH.

That being said, I'll play it again.

Nice component, great game. However i feel that all of quest a little bit like. So it cannot get rank 10 of this game for my opinion.

The first game, played with my daughter, took 4.5 hours (excluding setup!).
It was enjoyable and I am looking forward to playing it again, but hopefully a lot shorter.

Fantasy quest game in a similar vein to old games workshop talisman, pretty bits (it looks very impressive all laid out) but marred somewhat by a confusing rulebook

RATING: 8.8
Ranks in my Top 5 for Fantasy/RPG Games along with Talisman, Runebound, Kings & Things, and Dungeonquest.  This one gaines extra point for keeping it simple as well as fun. Plenty of replayability and quality components to boot.

RATING: 6
This is neat little fantasy adventure game with Euro style mechanics.  For me this backfires though as I find the combat mechanics to simplistic and the game usually ends just as things begin to get interesting.  That said, it plays quicker than many of my other adventure games (ie Talisman and Runebound) so it does see the table occasionally.  And some of my friends love it far more than I do... which also helps it get to the table.

Box comes with a pretty good plastic insert,  bagged wooden pieces,  life stones in a plastic roll,  a bunch of character stands and a whole bunch of sheets of die-cut cardboard that you have to punch out.  First play was interesting - definitely a lot less combat,  and more high speed running.   Looks like there's a lot more room for strategy.  Definitely some strategic planning,  but a substantial amount of luck with the dice-based skill resolution system,  so if you roll badly you can end up hosed no matter how buff you set yourself up to be.  others have already mentioned that there's aspects of "traveling salesman" style problems - a lot of the quests are pickup-and-deliver style,  so optimising route planning is a good chunk.

Wow! I want it! I want it!... I'm a great fan of Runebound, but until have played a game of ROTH I want it too.

First off - just toss the rules from the game and print off the ones from the Geek.  I tried to read the original rules and put the game aside for months because I just couldn't be bothered with the disasterous rules.  I finally printed out the rules here, and the game became very easy to play.

I played this one over the weekend with my 8 year old.  We had a great time.  I wouldn't recommend this one for the hard core game groups, but for the family, it is a fun game and a great time.

I ended up getting rid of this because I like Runebound and Prophecy better.  Also, with the new World of Warcraft Adventure Game in the fold, this one just wasn't going to get played anymore.

The game oozes with theme, and it's fun running around and killing the bad guys while completing quests. If you enjoy the fantasy quest genre, you'll want this.

I know it shouldn't matter, but the graphics on this game are absolutely awful - it's like 'my first fantasy clip art collection'. This has really put me off playing over Talisman (which is gorgeous, if random). 

I know, I know, the game engine's good, and the chit-pull system is appealing, but even the land tile artwork looks like all the world's worst children's CGI cartoons have conspired to create a new monster. IMHO the visuals in a fantasy boardgame are half the fun.

I will play this to death soon. I might glue some of Talisman's adventure card art to some of its tiles to make me feel like playing.

  Ok game. Almost no replay value, with the only thing being replayable is the random tile map. The characters don't feel personal because I usually end up feeling the whole character board with experience. It can easily get boring, but the short turns help that. There are better games of this type.

The replayabilty of the game is low for me.  I am keeping it though since it is one of my daughter's favorite games.

Hands-down the best fantasy game for kids (or kids and their parents).

Played with two, this game can be knocked out in 90 minutes.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable romp through fantasy land. Each player attempts to gain strength in magic, ranged, and hand to hand combat as well as gold and defense. Most cases involve picking up something and taking it somewhere else. You also fight monsters and prepare to fight the big bad monster at the end.

RATING: 4.4
I'm not really a fan of these adventure board games. I'd rather play a computer RPG or a Pen and Paper. The problem is the down time between turns and the fact that most of the time you appear to be playing by yourself.

Mildly amusing adventure romp.  Instructions are badly presented.  BGG file section is very helpful in this regard.  I might have rated this higher if I liked this genre more but I don't.

I love this game, I just wish I could win every once and a while.  The game hates me and loves tricksy hobbittses thats for certain. My first exposure to a RPG-style boardgame (WoWtbg definitely does NOT count) I love everything about the game save for the rule book (don't even bother with it... throw it away and print out the excellent re-write of the rules created by Christopher Young).  I suppose it would be nice to have some painted minis as well, but that can be easily remedied.  Its awakened my interest in all things fantasy-RPG again where World of Warcraft the Boardgame had practically killed it.  Now to try and get a win... perhaps some PvP would slow that hobbit down...

Exciting for a little bit, but I need more interaction with the players to feel at home in a magic universe. It feels too big most of the time. Interesting ideas for some of the mechanics and items, but too hidden behind an absolutely despicable excuse for a rulebook.

Surprisingly boring. The design goes out of its way to block player interaction, and there are too few ways to improve your stats. The game plays itself. Youngsters might like it.

I don't quite know what to make of Return of the Heroes.  It's extremely luck-driven, so I don't feel as though the decisions I make are really worthwhile...and yet, I have fun playing it.  I'll probably play it a few more times until it grows tiresome (after all, you're seeing the same encounters over and over again), then the rating will drop.

Very well made fantasy adventure game. I like the mechanism for the quests and the fact that danger starts lurking once you start on your man quest. There could be some adjustments to improve the game, and the only shame is that they don't dish out dead cheap expansions for this. The ONLY thing you need is a new set of counters, and they could vary the game ad infinitum. Why don't they!?

I think I shouldn't have bought this and all the "expansions" at once. It just doesn't seem to be something I would like to play even after I think I might have bested those horrible, horrible rules.

I will give it a shot some day... maybe...

RATING: 8.8
This is a really well done Star Wars strategy game that does a good job of capturing the feel of the original trilogy, letting you sort of create your own Star Wars story that still feels like Star Wars. Combat feels a bit tedious, fleets feel very slow as they only move one space a turn without special cards, and the board doesn't exactly adhere to cannon (Geonosis and Felucia weren't populated during the OT era. Why not use Lothal, Kuat, Eriadu, etc?), which is sort of annoying, but those are my only complaints about the game, really. It's really good.

The game is fantastic - probably the best I have played so far. I had difficulties to find sleep because I was constantly thinking about the game, the moves I had made and the consequences. I've never experienced this with a game before and I'm eager to play it again.

The only (minor) critics in my eyes are the tactic cards, which slow down combat, and the playing time. You surely need to play a couple of games to finish it in under 3 or even 4 hours. But still, it's a blast and a fantastic ride!

RATING: 9
Loved it. Now need to settle into a few more games to see if it truly holds up. There's quite a bit to explore yet - not to mention playing *both* sides of the conflict. If one is seeking flaws, I think there are three. First, the game is quite long - allow 3+ hours for a first play (and it may not go down much with repeated plays). Second, there are small corner cases with cards that create conflicts to be resolved mainly by common sense. Third, the order in which you draw cards has a significant effect on the potential of the outcome. Still, the game is wonderful and is the definitive dramatic implementation of Star Wars. The *only* significant drawback is the length of play.

EDIT: One take back with this one is there really *isn't* much combat - that the game is deceptive in that way. The miniatures seem to scream old 80's games of smashing ships against one another. But in fact, combat isn't as important as deception (for the Rebellion) and fear (for the Empire). It's more a cat and mouse game than a conquest game. When combat does happen (perhaps 3-4 significant times), it is at times clunky to resolve.

RATING: 7.5
Star Wars: Rebellion is an action selection game masquerading as a war game.  While the fleet actions and combat are an important element of the game, the crux of the game is the use of the game's leaders.  The Rebels are not going to win a war campaign against the Empire.  Instead, they have to use clever planning and strategy to survive the Imperial onslaught and buy time to rally the galaxy to their side.  On the Imperial side, the war game is much more important, but as an occupying force, the Empire cannot clump their ships and troops together to crush the Rebel fleets, but must spread out their forces to ensure find the Rebel base and prevent the Rebels from going to ground if found.

The game is dripping with Star Wars theme.  All the main characters from the original trilogy are there and your odds of seeing them in most games are high.  The events, objectives, projects, and action cards all fit the game's flavor.  The artwork and models are all spot-on, and seeing everything on the board engrosses you in the theme.

The game does have its downsides.  First, it is long, likely taking a good 4-6 hours to play.  That may not be a hurdle to some people, but for me it will mean the game is a special occasion type of game, rather than a regular game night favorite.

Second, there is a fair helping of randomness in the game with the use of dice in mission attempts and combat, but you'll be rolling dice frequently enough that luck should balance out for both sides.  And I think the more experienced, more strategic-minded player will win the majority of the time.

And third, the replayability of the game might not quite be what you might expect from a $100 game.  I've played twice, both times as the Rebels, and so have seen most of the cards that side has to offer come up during games.  The second game definitely did not feel the same as the first, and I think it would not feel samey if you only play once a month or less, but if you were to play it weekly, it might get tiring before too long.  I think the game will stand up to multiple plays, but I wouldn't turn down an expansion with some added missions and objectives.

One last area I wanted to address is the multiplayer rules.  I have played the game both as a 2 player and a 4 player game, and I liked both very much.  I was skeptical about the multiplayer rules, because they seemed tacked on to what would be best as a 1 vs 1 game, but they really turned out to be a lot of fun.  The snaking turn order really adds an extra wrinkle to the game, and both players feel like they have enough responsibilities to feel like an equal team.  Granted I played the game with a cooperative partner, so if you end up with a selfish or bossy partner, your experience may be ruined, but I put that on the player and not the game.

Rebellion is a great "event" game, i.e. one to be played infrequently on special occasions.  I liked it much more than my recent play of Twilight Imperium 3, and I would even prefer it to something like Star Wars: Imperial Assault.  It might be hard for some to justify $100 for a game that will not see the table often, but if it fits your budget and you are a Star Wars fan, this is a must-have.

Initial thoughts: nice, tactical, war-type game, marred by its length. Feels a bit too whack-a-moleish but I wonder if further plays would allow more exploration of the tactical options. Might need a few more plays.

RATING: 8
Initial rating.  This one will probably go up with more plays.  My buddy and I figure this game takes about 3 plays to understand the cards, strategies, and interactions.

Thematically, this nails Star Wars in a way that others do not.  [thing=939]The Queen's Gambit[/thing] is pretty good, but really just a luck fest based on crappy source material.  [thing=3284]Epic Duels[/thing] sucks.  The miniature game is alright, but has no ships.  But this one has it all -- from the good Star Wars movies.  It has oodles of cool plastic.  It has theme (find the hidden rebel base and destroy it!) it has characters, cards, and chits.  It is not overly complicated to learn but is not overly simple in strategy.

This is for the Star Wars universe what [thing=115746]War of the Ring[/thing] is for the Lord of the Rings' universe.  Is it as epic and awesome as WotR?  Time will tell.

RATING: 10
This game is drenched in theme—from destroying a Death Star with a "one in a million" shot and staging daring rescues with the Millennium Falcon to inexorably subjugating the galaxy and converting Rebel heroes to the Dark Side of the Force. Other than War of the Ring, there's nothing out there that so completely immerses you in the epic feel of the source material.

The strategy feels extraordinarily deep, too. No two games are the same, because there are so many different paths to victory depending on the board state, your opponent, your leaders, where you've chosen to hide the Rebel base (or think it's hidden), etc. And despite some rumblings to the contrary, I find the combat system quite enjoyable. A fantastic game!

Great game, good Star Wars "feel" to it, engaging game play that grows with you and you learning your strategies; and comparably priced for similar style and scope games.

FAVOURITE GAME - an epic space battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. As in the video game it is based on, the Empire has to find the secret rebel base, while the Rebels have to gain loyalty in order to outlast the Empire's schemes. In the game you'll take your leaders and send them on mission to gain support, to build, even to fire the mighty Death Star, and also to move your fleets between systems and combat the enemy. The game is all about hard decisions, and card management. The combat is straightforward: the winner takes it all. Up until the last moment, everything is tensed. But, it can take up to three hours and that can be a hindering fact.

RATING: 8
1st play - Star Wars in a box - completely perfect description.  The Imperial forces are all over the Galaxy, and their size works against them.  It's hard to marshal troops in any one area, and the Rebels could be anywhere.  Toe to toe the Empire destroys the Rebels but completely thematically the Rebels are hard to force to a battle.  They're just strong enough to hold off small skirmish fights, and the missions take from all three movies - Sith corrupting Rebel leaders, Luke trains with Yoda, and the Death Star slowly builds.  Very satisfying thematic romp through the whole Star Wars story.

2nd play - This time I played as the Rebels and the experience is awesome.  The feeling of being completely outgunned and outmanned the entire time, forced to resort to guerilla tactics.  It's great fun to use the Empire's size and lack of agility against itself.   Trying to draw attention away from the hidden rebel base, a failed assault on the Death Star and a daring rescue on a captured Princess Leia rounded out the thematic experience.  The only downside to this game is the length, but the time flies by because the game doesn't drag.

RATING: 8.5
Excelent game. SW rebellion puts all the plots in Star Wars universe into a global theatre in game. Well, not everything, just the best part, the 3 classic episodes.

The game is huge and with very good quality miniatures, the battle and movement plays simple rules but makes the advance very slow. But the best part are the missions and the leaders that you put to play them, the leader action mechanics are good and makes this game even more thematic.

The only bad thing to say about this game is the playtime that is huge. But playing this in 2 makes not so much downtime, and you feel playing the game all the time.

RATING: 9.5
wonderfully engineered to provide climatic endings and problematic choices. the not very thematic&choiceful combat system costs half a point to my final evaluation. AFAIC combat was more offputting when I was new to the game- once you get it streamlined and you realize how it is secondary to the rest of the game it fits well enough.

This is an excellent game that should especially appeal to Star Wars fans.

This game strongly resembles War of the Ring, in the fact that the "bad guys" are more powerful than the "good guys", and the way that the turn track works.  However, the mechanics of the missions is very different.  Also, set up has more variety than War of the Ring.

Like War of the Ring, playing this game is an intense experience.

Warning: The rules for this game are a disappointment. You will need to read both the "Larn to Play" and "Rules Referrence" guides to play it correctly.  While not too complex, there are several small rules with a HUGE impact on the game if you play them incorrectly or miss using them. That said...

A 4 player game with all players having played it once before took five hours to play.  It felt a little long, but not overly so.  The theme comes across so well in this game that even the most critical Star Wars Universe fans will apprciate this game and mild fans of that universe will appreciate it. First 2 player game took a solid 7 hours and didn't have a lot of looking up rules or AP.  Onthe bright side, it was so fun we played another right after and it only took 4:40.

RATING: 6
I see the fanboys have been skewing the BGG ratings...again. Oh, and the Fantasy Flight drones too!

Star Wars: Rebellion is a game that caused an emotional rollercoaster—and maybe not entirely the good kind. First, I have to say that our initial game could not be completed. Due to some reasons that I'll be listing in the CONS section of this review, but mostly it was how slow to start the game is and how long it would be. It was basically eating up the table for a whole day, so we walked away. For a week. Never finished that game. After finally getting to play this game for a long time, I'm ready to chip in with what I think. Let's start with the good.

PROS:
• Nice, big board. Linen quality cards. Cool plastics ("meh" quality). Cool art (no screenshots!)
• Both sides play legitimately differently. IMO, this is a pro not a con. That's why you would even buy this game.
• Tight, but not choked, actions. I really hate games where you're choked for actions each turn. The game starts a bit choked, gets tight, then loosens up by a lot near the end.
• Sense of legitimate pacing if the Rebel player can hack it.
• Genuine moments of euphoria from successfully finding/hiding/relocating the base, misdirecting, mind games, or just pulling off a mission that seems like a bit of a long shot.

CONS:
• The randomness in this game is off the charts. I'm much more critical of this due to it being so tactical. What frustrates the shit out of me about this game is how it feels like Terra Mystica (a game I HATE) combined with globs of randomness (something I HATE and doesn't go with the game type at all). I can't stress this enough: Both players have random mission decks they draw randomly from, the objective cards are randomly drawn, there are two combat tactics card decks you can randomly draw from, and every single combat is random dice with "Fantasy Flight" syndrome where they have extremely low chances of success like some old 80's game before we knew how to make combat fun. This will be the longest point in the review and single-handedly kills the replay value of this game for me in a big way. Randomness doesn't have to kill a game, but FFG sure knows how to make it happen every time without fail.

• NO THEME. How fucking ironic that a game about theme has no theme. It's clearly and blatantly pasted-on when you teleport Emperor Palpatine into a Rebel loyal system to change it to Imperial control with: no ships; no support; an entire Rebel ARMADA there; no assassination of this lone dude; no recourse; no real ability to stop it. Everything in the entire game is like this. It's like someone took a basic abstract strategy game with nonsensical logic, pasted a Star Wars theme on it, then loaded it up with dice and cards so we wouldn't notice how bizarre it was.

• The "oppose" system was clearly designed by a monkey typing randomly on a typewriter. You have to spend your actions to DICE ROLL to try to stop one opponent's action. Sure, it's nice for Rebels who want to stall the game out but god damn it's just shitty, boring, and way too random. If you don't want a particular mission to go off and fail to oppose, you lose your action AND it goes off. This is the most ill-conceived shit I've seen in a game to date.

• The Empire can win instantly with a combination of minor movement and some cards on Turn 1 by getting really lucky. Even if the Rebel player is omnisciently good at picking the rebel base. This never happened to us but it could have easily and almost did twice.

• The Rebels win by making the game as boring as possible: drawing the game out to be even longer. And they probably WILL win if you have competent players, but unfortunately:

• No one can do any setup or make ANY moves until they read every single card in all the tactics decks, mission decks, plan deck, action decks, know every face of every die, what every planet can produce, and so on. EVERYTHING. Want proof? The strongest opening move for the Rebels is Turn 1 Mon-Mothma's ability (which is RANDOMLY given to you) on Utapau, then start the entire Rebel fleet there. This guarantees you 2 Calamari Cruisers, which are equal to Star Destroyers in power. If you can also take Mustafar/Mon-Calamari turn 2, you get more of them which completely changes the game to your favor. But you won't know that without her ability and knowing every single planet. You also have to GET OFF that planet because the Empire has the most broken card in the entire game, which you need to know about:

• SHOW OF POWER. FUCK WHOMEVER DESIGNED THIS CARD.

• Once you get past the very "Fantasy-flightness" about the cards and really grok them, they're not so bad. The biggest problem is how much studying you have to do until everything falls into place and the missions (and their efficacy) become understandable. I suppose that's a learning curve issue, but ingame it feels like a fun issue instead. This game is just not first-timer friendly in any capacity. It's not hard at all, it just requires bookwork like you wouldn't believe.

• If either player is getting more than one "3-Build-Queue" set of ships placed per game, the Rebel player fucked up or got chance-sacked. It would be rare for all but maybe the last turn of the game to see another 3-build set of units come out. That really means the game is hyper-choked on units, even though they kind of feel like a waterfall for the Empire.

• INCREDIBLY cutthroat. Plus on top of that, the cutthroat can just turn out downright dirty if you also get favored by chance at the same time. Go into this game knowing that there will be lamentations and gnashing of teeth. Troops will spawn on top of your weakest places and wipe them out, despite it being a good position. You will randomly lose loyalty to a system RIGHT before you were going to use it to complete a mission. Objectives will blindly be pulled from under the Rebels' nose by an unaware Imperial. This makes the game a really tough sell: Wargames do cutthroat better and tactical mindgames feel like shit with cutthroat. Not sure what SW:R was trying to do here.

Overall, despite the numerous CONs to the game, SW:R has some legitimately "worth-it" moments peppered into the shitpile of randomness, rage, and tedium. I don't think being a fan of SW should ever dictate whether you buy this game. You have to be a fan of hide-and-seek, not mind fantasy flight games, and have a friend who's willing to dive into the deep end immediately.

P.S. Fuck you "Shut Up and Sit Down" team for telling us not to look at the decks because HURR DURR SURPRISES! I wish I could hate you to death.

Le thème est les figurines sont jolis. Dommage, Le hasard trop présent et gameplay pas optimal, le temps de la partie trop long, les stratégies pas équilibrées (pour l'empire construire une 2ème  étoile ou autre ne semble pas avoir gros intérêt, il suffit d'explorer à fond en priant pour tomber vite sur la base rebelle). J'ai du mal à comprendre comment on peut mettre 10 à ce jeu... Le jeu du seigneur des anneaux est beaucoup mieux fait de mon point de vue.

Rebellion is my favourite SW computer game, big deal, wanna fight about it? Get the same feeling with this, right down to how clunky the combat sounds.

The problem with being in an introvert-extrovert relationship is that there may never be an opportunity to play this that wouldn't be spent around other people that require more than a 2-player game. Therefore I may sadly never feel the joy of playing this.

I really enjoy this game, I think the mechanisms are intuitive, the game flows well, it's very strategic, every action makes sense, and I feel like every bit of the game meshes together very well. However, the game does drag a bit and if you play this game with someone who in the slightest might not enjoy longer games or is not a very experienced gamer, their confusion and ultimate dislike of the game really makes it unplayable. I have no one to play this game with and it's unlikely I'll find someone anytime soon, so that's why my rating is averaged out to where it is.

Not a Star Wars guy, but I rather enjoyed this. It plays like watching the movies. Negative: building/deploying was complicated (including matching symbols to see what units you produced).

I played yesterday my first game I found it absolutely fantastic. I did not even realise that it took us 4.5 hours to finish it. The only drawback is that you must find 4 straight hours to finish it and that you need an enormous table. But it is worth it!

Phenomenally good. FFG have refined their earlier Ameritrash triumphs to crystallise what might be the definitive long, thematic game. The probe deck mechanics and combat push this game up to a ten. The fact that an asymmetrical game can be this fun from both sides is, quite frankly, a surprise. This game is easily within reach of War of the Ring. If anything, it's actually better than that game as it doesn't feature the clunk associated with the "hunt for the ring" and other fiddly rules that are difficult to explain to newcomers. It's highly likely that I would sell members of your family to get the opportunity to play this one. Utterly brilliant.

RATING: 10
Deeply thematic with fairly complex but well designed rules.  Playing as the Rebels, you really do get a sense of their plight, and how hard it is to avoid detection and capture by the Imperials.  As the Imperials, you have a mighty fleet at your disposal (you start with a fully armed and operational battle station, the Death Star!), along with a fair number of systems under your control.  On some turns the Imperials will be able to produce more units than the Rebels start with!  Both factions offer an entirely asymmetrical experience, with entirely different goals.  Can the Imperials find and destroy the hidden Rebel base before the Rebels can sway the rest of the galaxy against the Imperials.  There's only one way to find out!

Gefällt mir mit den Missionen und der Asymmetrie sehr gut, aber hat ein paar typische FFG Schwächen. Der Kampf zieht sich manchmal schon arg, wenn am Ende sich nur noch zwei Einheiten bekämpfen, die aber nicht die richtigen Angriffswürfel werfen. Aber das Spiel liefert einfach coole Momente, die man nicht so schnell vergisst.

Fantastic asymmetrical game that really captures some of the cinematic feel of the franchise and the overwhelming feeling of the Empire trying to hunt down the Rebellion. The game can start to feel long as it goes on but doesn't really diminish the enjoyment too much. Custom foam insert makes setup a whole lot easier and acrylic stands for the leaders really make them pop and pleasant to look at.

Excellent game with a strong connection to the source material. Great art and balanced from the experience I've with it on the table. The board and scope of the game is daunting, but actually flows quite well with a good amount of strategy.  The only real hiccup is in the battle itself. While not complicated, large scale battles tend to slow down the overall pace of the game. Hopefully FFG will sell extra dice for this one as it uses it's own custom set unique to this game.

The one game to rule them all. With this game you go boldy where no man has gone before. A boardgame version of the old PC game Star Wars Rebellion / Supremacy. Also kind a like Star War Empire at War.
Anyhow, an epic game about the Original trilogy. Strategic but with detailed characters giving the full Star Wars treatment.
This is a must have! Played this a few times, it is an EPIC GAME!

Played this a couple of times now with my GF. She's a Star Wars Fanatic!!! So finally getting to play this was like a dream come true... until we actually sat down to play it... 
GOOD- Theme and Production
BAD- Just about everything else... 
You pretty much HAVE to play to the style of the side. Rebels... go in to battles knowing you are going to lose but that's okay because you'll meet Objective Goals. 
Emipire... just go destroy stuff
This game takes A LOT of card references. I felt like I had one hand in the game and one on the rulebook (or on BGG blogs). We even watched a couple reviews and one How To Play. But they can't go through all the cards in those. 
I would still recommend this game to players but I would hope they could borrow it or rent it (like I did) instead of dropping $100 on this game.

Kinda shocked to say, FFG game with a hot license that wasn't mailed in at all. I only played it once, but WoTR totally didn't do it for me. This is similar in the light versus dark, hiding versus searching aspect, but I think they got it way right. After a few more plays, bumping from an 8 to a 9. It's wonky, it's swingy, but steeped in narrative and never overstays its welcome. Love it so far.

7/7/16: The Theme is strong in this one.  First impressions, needlessly complicated.  Playing teams can get very frustrating.  Like all FFG games, you're buying this for the theme, not the gameplay.  If you don't love Star Wars, I'd stay away from this.  If you're used to wargames, the clunky and swingy combat will be frustrating.

Only FFG  would have come up with dice symbols meaning one thing on one type of roll, and something else on another roll.

What you do get is a very thematic game, with a great story and a ton of great plastic.  You do need to learn what possibilities are made available via the cards, the first time through you're just trying to learn the game.  The cards do cause some wild swings, but that's the nature of the game.

I think that the length is going to kill it for me, but will need more plays to really know.  I don't mind 4 hours of Fury of Dracula, because you're working with a team, but here where it's just one on one, it's a little long for what it offers.  It may also be that I'm slowly burning out on the FFG game style where so much of the game is on cards.  The tactics cards in this game really remind me of the Battlestar Galactica game where your card draws really determine everything.

I don't think that 4 player works all that well unless you have 2 people that work really well together.  The rolls aren't that well defined, and you have to go through everything together which slows things down further..


Learning 2 player game: 4 hours, 4 player game 5.5 hours

RATING: 10
This is probably my favorite game of all time.  Theme is absolutely amazing and feels just like your are reliving the original Star Wars trilogy.  Battles are climactic.  Game play is extremely fun and the pace is great.  Pieces are amazing quality.  I have probably played this game well over 20 times and still can't wait to play it again.

The only downside is due to the complexity of the game, it takes about an hour just to teach someone the rules before playing.  It then usually takes an entire game for that new person to learn the core fundamentals of the game.  Other than the learning curve though, absolutely fantastic.

I really love this game it's huge and I'm really enjoying ffg miniatures and their known fantastic art, I love star wars universe (a normal one not sleeping with star wars sheets on the bed) and this game really give me the feel of this universe.as  rebels I feel as a tiny force hiding against the mighty empire, I found myself trying to hold , using gorilla tactics , attacking and retreating while as an empire I'm in "search and destroy" mode sending my forces around the galaxy seeking their base.
 Some complained about the battles system but I think they are really ok for this scale, and they are not slow. If there is a problem with this game it's the length for 2 players, about 4- 5 hours. 
I didn’t try the 2 vs 2 game, seems a lees fun since the take a decisions are split.
It's really long and it's hard to stop the day to play with, then again if you love star wars and you love strategy games it's a really good one, I enjoyed my time with this one.

Where to start that hasn't already been said?

This game is War of the Ring for the Star Wars universe. It captures the FEEL of the original trilogy very well. There's some great bluffing, great push-your-luck mechanics and a wonderful cat-and-mouse game between the Empire and Alliance.

It's one of those games that if you were to play 100 games of it with the same person, individual strategies would arise between the two of you - expected bases, methods of lockdown from the imperials, and ways to counter those strategies.

However, due to the length of the game, I don't think anyone will ever saturate the iterations needed to know the game that well.

A big complaint a lot of people have is the combat. However, I don't see it as too bad - it doesn't take long, and is easy enough to learn. It can be a bit of a dice-fest, but that isn't too much of a problem because it isn't central to the game.

Can't wait to play this one more.

The Star Wars game we all wanted. A superb realisation of Episodes 4-6 of the saga. Empire starts out a strong favourite in each game but the Rebels can win (usually on a knife's edge though). Highly immersive and the long play time quickly loses its significance as the hunt hots up. I felt a strong likeness to Fury of Dracula in the 'hide-&-seek' aspect of this game which is one of my all-time favourite games and a high compliment here.

RATING: 8
Thoughts after first play as Empire (with Rise of the Empire expansion): It's very good, but feels a bit like you are treading water (as Empire). Progress feels very slow with a lot of guesswork while the Rebel player slaps the Empire player around, frustrating him for 3-4 hours. 
Will be trying Rebel side soon, which looks to be a bit more fun to play having more freedom in the game, although Rebel victory feels kind of anticlimactic. They go out with a whimper, not a bang, when the game ends by moving a marker on the reputation/round track.

But overall, I enjoyed my 4 hours of game with Rebellion and despite my criticisms, it's a very good game and I'm very interested to try the rebels. 

Nitpick time: ships look ridiculous just lying on the board. They should have at least some basic stands...

RATING: 8
Több okból is úgy ültem neki, hogy a WOTR játékkal való összevetést szem előtt tartottam. Már eleve úgy ajánlották, hogy ez is egy jóféle aszimmetrikus játék, ráadásul itt is hasonlóan a "jó oldal" játékában a rejtőzködésen van a fő hangsúly, míg a "rossz oldal" a nagy harci erejére épít.

Röviden: nem a WOTR-hoz kellett volna viszonyítani, mert önmagában nézve tök jó játék a Rebellion, de ha a kettő közül kéne választanom, egyértelműen a WOTR mellé ülnék le szívesebben. Mind monumentalitásában, mind az eredeti ötletek terén, mind a szabály letisztultságában, mind hangulatban, de még változatosság ígéretében is (néhány partit játszottam csak mindkettővel) a Gyűrűk háborúja a Lázadás fölé nő. Amott a Gyűrűhordozás rejtőzködő mechanizmusa egészen különleges, cserébe itt is van egy egész jó Kutászkodás, de nekem azért ez picit laposabb.

De hogy ne csak összehasonlítsak: A Rebellion egy jól összerakott, élvezetes játék, aminek átjön a hangulata. A küldetésekhez kiküldött vezetők egy tök jó taktikai részt visznek a játékba, jól kell elosztani a vezetőket, számítani kell meglepetésekre a másik oldalról. Tetszik, hogy a kockadobós részek nincsenek túlbonyolítva: mind a csatáknál, mind a küldetéseknél csak 3-4 kimenet lehetséges, nincsen kismillió módosító, igaz a sebzéseket meg azok kivédését a kártyákkal kicsit egzaktabbul is leszabályozhatták volna. Az egységek gyártása jól ki van találva, a Halálcsillag meg teljes egészében tematikusan van megoldva, tetszik. Amikor fenyegetve volt a bázisom, mindent megtettem, hogy a feladatok közül valahogy megszerezzem a "Halálcsillag tervek" lapot, különben game over. Izgalmas kör volt, mivel azt túléltem, még 3 órán át tartott a parti. Ez érdekes egyébként, hogy nagy pech, vagy rossz bázis választás esetén lehet nagyon rövid is a parti, de akár 4-5 órás is.

A szabály külön megemlíti azt hiszem a jótanácsoknál, hogy a Lázadó játékos ne törődjön azzal, hogy esetleg szinte teljesen lesöpörték már a térképről, úgy van felépítve a játék, hogy ettől még nyerhető a Lázadókkal, csak néhány hírnévpontot kell összekaparni és rejtőzködni még néhány kört. Ez a része nagyon tetszik. A minik is jók.

A gyűrűk, amiket a szereplőkre tehetünk, nagyon jópofák, de a technikai kivitelezés zavar, nem szeretem, ha sérülnek a játékelemek. A magyar kiadásról még néhány szó: néhányan túllihegték szerintem a fordítással kapcsolatos bénázásokat. Persze én is örültem volna, ha nem kell még házilag javításokat nyomtatgatni, de így is bőven a pozitív oldalon van a kiadás. Rendelkezem a játékhoz szükséges angollal, mégsem vettem volna meg szerintem, ha nem adják ki magyarul, mert így a családban is ki tudom próbálni esetleg.

Összefoglalva: SW fanoknak kötelező, de mindenki próbálja ki szerintem, aki szereti a 2 személyes komolyabb játékokat. 4 személlyel nem tudom, milyen lehet.

This is the most epic game ever made with the Star Wars license: a two-player struggle between the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion, encompassing the whole civil war.

It is essentially a card driven game, with leaders assigned to mission cards as the main mechanic, so it is necessary to memorize (or at least have a more than vague idea about) the cards in each deck.
The political control and resource/unit production are both simple and elegant, while the combat system is a bit clunky and time-consuming (but not too-much convoluted).

The length of the game will keep it from hitting the table too much, but when it does, it's epicness will unravel in all its magnificence... Well done, FFG!

RATING: 8
I'm not really a fan of the series.  I'm definitely not a hater though.  I do however, find this game intriguing and enjoy it quite a bit.  An epic 2 player experience for sure.  Not sure what the big gripe is with the combat as I find it fine as it stands.

The part where it says it is a 2 or 4 player game is rubbish.  This game is meant for 2.  The 4 player mode is tacked on and purely for sales.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: FFG has done it again. A highly thematic game with wonderfully produced components treats this Star Wars IP properly. This is without a doubt my favorite of the Star Wars games that FFG has produced. It's akin to a wargame but can be taught quickly and played within a reasonable amount of time for a game of this epic scale. I particularly enjoy the cat-n-mouse game of locating the rebel base. The game is a wonderful blend of strategic decisions for both the Empire and Rebellion, as well as tactical choices with a healthy dose of bluffing. Tying all actions/missions to leaders is a brilliant way to limit operations in the game, while tying the mechanisms closely to the theme. There's almost a CDG feel to this game. I'm very tempted to add this game to my collection, and probably will at some point in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First the good - the game mostly looks great, the rules are not bad (for FFG), minis are cool, and the asymmetric player goals are interesting.

But there is a lot of junk here, the game is inelegant, full of useless and sometimes counterproductive complexity and chrome and the combat is terrible.  Not sure about the balance yet either, I suspect the Imperial player has a slight advantage that is magnified by Rebel inexperience - but I'm almost positive that I will not want to play enough games to find out.

Oh, did I mention the game is long?  Too long by at least an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great game, I have left it short of a 10 as I think that there could be some 'set strategies' that could win it for either side, the game may be a bit short (in turns) as it seems quite easy for the Rebels to get reputation thus stifling some things that the Empire player can do (build a 2nd DS or an SSD) or might try (I never thought of destroying a system in case I gifted reputation, and the win, to the Rebels), That's probably being super critical and i'll probably change it to a 10 soon :-)

After five games with the same opponent we are struggling to see how the Rebels can win against a decent player running the Empire. The only close game was the first two with me playing the Empire and not really knowing what I was doing. And don't even get me started about the setup system draw having Rebel systems right beside Empire systems, twice now I have lost two systems on the first turn. 
Have to drop my rating because of this.

This is the Star Wars Saga in a Box. While Imperial Assault or X-Wing are concerned with small skirmishes, in Rebellion you either represent the whole galactic empire or the band of rebels trying to bring back a senate republic. The empire tries to find the location of the rebel base and wipe it out. The rebels try to hide from the empire long enough in order to win more support in the senate. 

Players plan simultaneously which characters they want to send on tasks to the different planets. These tasks include things like winning support of the system (area control), taking prisoners from the other side, building a super star destroyer or moving the rebel base to a new system. Some characters are left without tasks. They are used to move ships and land units across the board. Despite both sides having a military win conditon, only the empire has a chance of winning this way. The rebels try to hide long enough and fulfill some missions/assignments that shorten the time that has to pass in order for them to win.
All the tasks and missions feel so thematic. Luke Skywalker can go to Dagoba to look for Yoda. If he finds him then Luke becomes a Jedi and is replaced by a stronger character pawn. The empire can develop the main weapon on the death star and blow up planets - hopefully containing the rebel base. 
There is a ton of player interaction with some dice rolling for combat and sometimes to see if a task/mission is accomplished or if the enemy side did interfere successfully. The rebel player constantly fears that the empire finds the location of his rebel base - tense.

The box says 2-4 players but I would only play it as a 2-player game. It takes some time (also to set it up) but it gets you in the zone for the whole time. I suggest you turn on any of the Star Wars Soundtracks while playing.

People who like the theme, area control, simultaneous action selection, dice based combat and miniatures will have a blast - pun intended.

Yes it's "Star Wars in box." And it's enjoyable if you like games that heavily lean on theme. I find it a little long for what it is though, and don't think has the legs a fairly epic game like this should have. It's cool when it twists on the events of the movies, but that novelty quickly wears off. A good time, but I don't get a charge out of it like I do some other favorites of this length.

Great game.  Similar tug-of-war tension as Twilight Struggle.  Seems that early game favors Imperials and late game favors Rebels.  Main reason to play with 4 is to share the thematic richness.

This is the kind of game that you talk about for hours ( or days ) after you played it. So much story and so much theme that you can basically rewrite Star Wars. And a lot of tension for both sides.

Playing as the dark side, I ended up capturing Luke Skywalker with Boba Fett, then corrupting him with Emperor Palpatine and then I made him to fight Obi-Wan Kenobi. 

The only downside of this game is its length.

A great man once said: "Star wars: rebellion tm c etc. is a lot like Lord of the rings the board game tm c etc." Who was this great man? I dunno. Nvm it was probably me or will. 
But anyways, this quote sums up rebellion well. You have an overwhelmingly evil, aggressive, and insidious force against the righteous Empire/Sauron. The primary moral of this game is palpatine did nothing wrong. If you play as the imperial side, you will learn that the rebels are just terrorists, trying to undo the beautiful order you are trying to build. They are constantly nipping at your heels like self-righteous chihuahas. I give this game a high rating for turning the age old paradigm on its head. This game basically made me a facist. 
Is it appropriate for small children? Well obviously not, its a complex game with small chockeable pieces. But it has a heartwarming message: that people will always try to tear down great things, but you cant let the haters stop you.

Beautiful design.  Played it with 4 players and it was very fun.  Won as Rebels, but was a card draw away from losing halfway through the game.  Long but worth the experience.

Played it a few more times and like it more each time.  All my games have come down to the last turn and a couple of die rolls in the last turn determining the winner.  I think this has been well playtested and seems very balanced to me.  A big time commitment, but can't wait to play it again.  This is a great experience with tales to tell win or lose.  Highly recommend this game.

Typical FFG mess of a game:

Such cool concepts with the different worker stats and the player cards, spoiled by an old fashioned and clunky roll to resolve 'mechanic' (if you even want to call something like that a mechanic) and that combat system is just garbage.

We had games of this were the overall outcome depended on the roll of one single die at the very end. In situations like this, I feel like there are no winners: the loser fells unlucky, whereas the winner (as was the case for me) feels cheated out of his victory as he has no agency in what the result of that roll might be. This is just unacceptable in a game that sets players plotting against each other for 4 hours.

My one play was fun. I guess I would not pay the money you have to pay for it. The game is fun and alright. On the other hand I guess play could be samey with repeated plays. I know there will always be different cards, but the main strategies are the same, so it will feel the same. I don't care to much about a specific card interaction.
Positives: It is hard to say why, but I enjoyed this game. The mechanisms are neither innovative, nor elegant. Gameplay is slow, but I enjoyed it.
Negatives: The combat system is shit. The game is very long. There is a lot of stuff to sort through. The rules are extremely long, although not complex (poor writing). They used these shitty rules reference system again. So read the rules and know you missed some things and will only be told those after your 40th play with your 10th opponent, or read the whole rules reference.

The game feels long, but not as long as it actually is, which is a good thing! There are lots of little odds and ends to keep track of, but as far as depth goes, this game's got it! So many different strategies and ways to win, and things to be considered every turn. If you're prone to analysis paralysis, this may not be the game for you, but if you're able to get into strategy and keep it breezy, this one's worth a poke!

Too luck based. Played it a dozen times or so. Started out excited (I mean we're flying Xwings and star destroyers, who wouldn't be) but the game mechanics are such that we soon realized that every game came down to one or two coin tosses. Sure when you first play you don't know the rules so you make mistakes and someone can capitalize on them but once you have the rules down it comes down to who got which card combos (luck) or who gets the right defensive/offensive card drawn (luck).

Captures the feel of the movies into a very rewarding game. In my opinion, length is perfect for a game that is supposed to span 3 movies. My only gripe is that battles are a bit fiddly. Tactics cards are ok. I really wish leaders would provide a more thematic impact on battle rather then just drawing battle modifying cards. Aside from this gripe, this is a fantastic game. Thematic, cinematic, and memorable.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------------
Have always thought a "COIN" type game in the Star Wars universe would be really neat.  This is the first attempt at something like that, and it passes with flying colors.  The asymmetric play is intense for both sides, and the way they integrated an entire galactic battle with key leaders works so well.  Any time i have 3-4 hours free, and someone wants to play this... I am in!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome game. Greatly exceeds the 90s computer game of the same name. I really love the asymmetric nature of the game. The Rebels simply cannot beat the Empire through military might alone, as it should be. Minis are fantastic. The gameplay is well-balanced.

There are only two real downsides to this game. The first is that the rulebook is not very well-written. The first few games will likely involve a lot of confusion and flipping through pages. The second is that it really is only designed for 2 players, regardless of what it says on the box. The rules for additional players feel like they were hastily tacked-on and don't seem to work very well.

Another epic sci-fi game takes place in Star Wars universe. I think it is best play with 2. The feeling is like playing Mr.Jack but at a higher epic level and adding some battles and space ships moving around in the "cat and mouse" game. On the downside, the game could last very very very long especially if you are new to the game and don't know what to do in the first couple turns. If you are not a fan of Star Wars and also not willing to dig into a long epic war, you better think twice and the price tag is also something you need to consider.

Might be the best thematic experience I've had in a game that seems to have depth and strategy. Yes, I've only played it once (3 hours, 4 players), but it's beautiful in its scope and tense in its decisions. The resources are constrained enough that you always have more that you want to do and the outcomes of each decision, whether a failure or a success, is important and weighty.

This is Episode 4-6 in a box. Hugely thematic. Hugely asymmetric. It really gives the feel of the military might of the Empire going up against a shadow war and tactical strikes coming from the Rebellion. Great storylines as you move your leaders across the board. For example: Rebels recruit Wedge, Wedge gets captured, Palpatine turns Wedge, Wedge leads final attack on Rebel base. Hidden base mechanic and probe deck is very engaging to play out. Very deep strategy regarding where you use your leaders. Only con is that games can feel too similar if you draw the same mission cards, but that's minor. I don't have an issue with the combat other than wanting more variety of tactic cards. Yes it can take multiple rounds. Yes  it can be complicated, but simulating an entire land/space invasion in a single combat should be complex. Combat happens infrequently enough that it should be epic.

Absolutely majestic. I was unprepared for how epic, tense and engrossing this game was going to be. It really is the trilogy in a box. I played the Empire and just ached to crush the Rebels. I felt my power sprawling about the galaxy. The game went long - about five hours - but it went by in the blink of an eye. It also very much evokes the feel of War of the Ring in the Star Wars universe but with more approachable Star Wars mechanics and a more intuitive "Hunt" sequence. Do the space battles interrupt the main game - do they involve fewer decisions? The answer is a "yes, but." So much rests on breath-in-throat player decisions that it's almost a relief to have a battle of good old dice chucking interspersing the main board action. It offers a catharsis for both players to see things happen and units blown up. If it were any more demanding, it might become more of distracting mini-game (and I might get exhausted before game end). Perfect realization of the Star Wars narrative; perfect game.

I have to fold in the Rise of Empire expansion--the combat modifications and new missions are core to the experience now.

Star Wars Rebellion does a lot of good things: It combines decent euro gameplay with some ameritrash and adds storytelling on top of a ruleset that is actually quite simple, while still offering a medium-deep gameplay experience with good game-to-game variance.

The weakest point is the limited options to each player, who are mostly on rail due to their card draw or the current board state. Still there's enough room left for some tactic decisions, that keep you interested while you follow the creation of your personal Star Wars story, that you'll remember for some time.

RATING: 3
Might be irreversibly ruined for me, knowing it was loosely based on the 90s computer game of the same name. That game was fantastic, and this system simply doesn't have any of that decision space. This simply isn't Star Wars; it's something else entirely, with $70 of Star Wars bling slapped onto it.

- The game track makes zero thematic sense.

- There is zero interrelation between space and ground units other than the odd tactic card. No orbital bombardment? Come on.

- No hyperspace to speak of, really ... Except a very limited element associated with the Rebel base. All adjacent planets are the same distance away from one another, and there are no solar systems to speak of.

- No assymetric production like one would expect from Rebels v. Empire.

- The hard dice limit of five per color makes no sense thematically.

- The minimized difference in ship capabilities is annoying at best, and horribly arbitrary at worst. The SSD is only 1.5 times better than the ISD, even though it's ten times longer?

- The arbitrary limitations set throughout the rulebook are frustrating, and serve to only limit the flexibility of the media provided. There's no thematic reason to have only one Rebel captured at a time, and there's also no thematic reason why Rebel can take prisoners of their own.

All of which serves to just suggest this was a fine game during its inception, but someone down the line realized they could make a killing by making it a Star Wars game, so they slapped the theme on.

RATING: 10
Comparisons to War of the Ring are obvious - strategic boardgames of that particular theme.

This feels a bit like a reboot of Freedom in the Galaxy (a bit less focus on the characters, and a lot less rules and modern bits).

Nicely asymmetric, with enough variety to ensure replayability (although I suspect 'optional' strategies will develop) 

Overall, like it a lot - and I suck (still yet to win a game).

I can see the game becoming more tense with familiarity of the card play of the various decks - leaders, missions, progress, and actions. Seems to be well balanced. Finding the Rebel base is not at all mission impossible, in fact, it will happen. The Rebel player has to accomplish missions, and especially challenging objectives that will diminish the reputation of the Empire, and which will put a short timer on his search for the Rebel base.  Very clever design. Long game that keeps players engaged despite its length.

It was fun, we played a team game which satisfies a cooperative and competitive itch at once.  I would consider it as the go to 2 player game considering the built-in team mode and theme.  War of the Ring is a better game but requires a dedicated partner, which may not be the case for everyone.  We had a cool interaction when Leia was captured.  The rebel player played an action card to have Obi-Wan free Leia, the imperials countered by playing an action card to capture Obi-Wan instead, then the rebels countered by sacrificing Obi-Wan.  This play was crucial because we (the Imperials) had an action or assignment which would have caused the captured character to indicate if the rebel base was in the same region as the system the standee was in.  Since we did not get to interrogate Obi-Wan we ended up guessing that the Rebel Base was in Endor when it was in fact in Utapau which would have been revealed if we interrogated Obi.  Oh well... It was fun.

It took a few games to grow on me, but now that I understand the flow of the game better, I really, really like it. I actually kind of disliked it after my first play, and even considered selling it at that point. I think this was simply because the game went on longer than anticipated, and it was hard to nail down what strategies I should be employing. But I've also learned much each game, and that has improved my skill and enjoyment of every subsequent game. I've lost every game up to this point (2x as Rebellion, 1x as Empire) and to the same person (mark my words Alex, I will win eventually!), but they still ended up being enjoyable and worthwhile experiences.

I recommend to anyone who loves Star Wars, enjoys multi-hour games, wants a unique experience, likes asymmetry, and is open to playing a few games before being able to fully comprehend what they're supposed to be doing.

Some notes after another play several months later:
*This can be a long game! That's probably the main factor holding my rating at an 8. It just takes too long to want to play all the time (granted, I am a slow player, so perhaps this is mostly a personal issue).
*This game gets better and smoother the more the players are familiar with the cards, leaders, etc. Coming back to it after having not played for many months makes me kinda feel like an inexperienced player again as there are many important intricacies present that can be easily overlooked if you're not already "in the groove".

War of the Ring and Star Wars made a baby? Hell yeah!
After reading the rules it looked more like a lighter TI3 or Runewars combined with the asymmetry...blabla.

IT'S STAR WARS!!! EPIC SCALE!!!

It looks heavier than it is. The rules are pretty simple and the game-system is pretty easy to manage while providing enough range for big strategy, meaningful plans and outbluffing each other.

It plays super fast, no downtime, and the playtime is shorter than expected. 2,5 hours are enough.

Great game.

The video game Star Wars Rebellion was quite fun in spite of an awful interface. It was a computer adaptation of Freedom in the Galaxy released by SPI and then Avalon Hill back in the late '70s. Turning Star Wars Rebellion into a board game doesn't really work as well as the video game because they had to shrink the scale of the universe and conflict to get a reasonable play time. I've played the rebels twice. You don't get enough of anything to make it very much fun. All you do is hide and wait and try to survive to the end. You don't get all the rebel leaders just some, you can't build up much, the cards you can play are pretty generic and bland and it's not uncommon to just be unable to do anything, and combat is a pain in the ass. It makes me wish I would have picked up Freedom in the Galaxy for $5 from KayBee Toys back in 1987 along with the Starship Troopers I bought for $4. While I don't know if that game is playable nowadays at least the scale was right. Why does the empire need to build a super star destroyer? If the rebels could actually put together a fleet with four Mon Calamari cruisers I could see it making sense. I'll play one more time as the Imperial side but I think I'll be done with the game after that and I'm glad I didn't buy it.

I did not find this enjoyable as the rebel player.  Draw random missions, hope they are useful / achievable, flip a few worlds when you can, and hope the imperial player does not luck into your base location too soon.  Fairly boring.  The imperial player seemed to have a little more fun since he had more units to use, more things to keep track of, and got to build up his death star, but still, it didn't seem really fun.

Two things I definitely did not like: 1) the combat system: boring and tedious, and 2) the game length of 4 hours.

Overall I give it a "meh".  I'll play it is someone else wants to, but I'm not going to suggest it.

This game is way, way, WAY too long for the experience it provides. If it played in half the time, I would probably rate it an 8. But this is one of those cases for me where the game just outstays its welcome by a couple of hours. That's a shame, because I'm a big fan of both the Star Wars universe and the game's designer (Koneiczka). I just have little desire to ever play this game again when there are so many superior games out there that play in far less time.

Played a whole bunch of times - and haven't had a bad, unthematic experience yet... even in learning games.  DOAM, chrome, story and engagement all exist within the framework of the design --- I'm so pleased with this purchase.  I only hope the expansion enhances, and doesn't ruin, the base experience.

Preliminary rating after one- It's so good, and intuitive, that it's unlike anything I have in my collection.  Star Wars come to life - no higher praise I can give it.

Almost done with the introductory game, playing with my 9 year old son.

Beautifully assymetrical and dripping with Star Wars thematics. My son captured Han Solo, successfully interrogated him, and was certain that he had obliterated the Rebel Base when his Death Star blew up Mon Calamari. But to his surprise, the Rebel Base wasn't there!

After leaving his Death Star unguarded, I launched a surprise attack with a small force of fighters, but Darth Vader managed to turn the tide in his favor and keep the Death Star safe.

Then I launched another surprise attack, but this time a large force of Y-Wings (with X-Wing escorts) managed to take down a lightly defended Star Destroyer in orbit around Coruscant, sending more shockwaves throughout the galaxy and turning many to sympathize with the Rebellion. 

He later retaliated by capturing Obi-Wan Kenobi and encasing him in carbonite, sending shockwaves through the galaxy that countered my efforts to sway systems to the Rebellion.

Now I am seeing the end game coming, and he is far away from my base, and I can't wait to spring Rapid Mobilization on him at the last moment.

Seriously, very fun game.

My biggest concern with Rebellion was that the playing time was going to be much to high for it to have legs. Now that I'm up to 4 plays, this has gone from concern to reality. Like all games from this designer, there is just too much crap in the system. Last game I was the Rebels and sitting on 9 leaders and a handful of missions, and basically nothing interesting to do - the missions were inapplicable not doing useful things and I didn't have forces that needed to move. My Imperial opponent was in the same boat. We all knew where the rebel base was, he had about two turns to get enough force there to kill it, and all the rest was screwing around; but there still was a lot of screwing around. The game just has too much flab and bloat and it comes through with a 4 hour playing time, of which about 2 is actually interesting. As always, the principal culprit here is the mission deck: too few are generally interesting, too many don't make enough difference to generate interest, and you don't cycle enough of them to feel like you have real choices - you just go on all the missions you get, and hope it works out. If you're the Imperials and get the carbon-freezing mission that's great, if you don't ever draw it that means the game is one fewer turn and you probably lose.

In general, the game just had very little sense of dynamism. Military operations take place at an excruciatingly slow pace. Forces take forever to concentrate. While Han and Luke got from Tatooine to Alderaan in a matter of hours, not days, in the game it's the work of the entire length of the game for military forces to make that same trip. Missions rarely pack enough punch to be interesting. There just is no "bomb" in the game, the dynamic event that really changed things up and makes for excitement or anticipation or fear. There is just the long slow grind to the end.

Lastly, and probably most problematically, Rebellion seems like basically a 1-player game. The Imperials will win or lose. It's not clear that the Rebels do very much that really makes any difference. The Imperials have lots of variables to juggle: they need to find the rebel base, they need to manage their economy to generate enough forces, they need to block the Rebels activities, and they need to pursue the super-weapons projects. The Rebels just need to do a few obvious things - try to get some loyalty down, win a few local victories - and basically they succeed where the Imperials allow them to, or where they roll well. They just don't have a ton of agency. The Imperials will win if they successfully balance all their competing interests (pretty hard), and lose otherwise. What the rebels do does not seem to be all that relevant.

I could suspend my disbelief for a while, and hope that Rebellion wouldn't fall prey to all the crippling design problems that every game Konieczka has had. But no. The pace is leaden, too much of the model makes no sense, it's weirdly over-complicated in some ways (although in general Rebellion is petty playable, it's just got a bunch of weird edge cases and the combat system is a mess), the theme isn't that much more than fan service, and it has very little intensity or engagement. Compared to any other decent 4 hour wargame (any No Retreat game, EastFront, Hannibal, Caucuses Campaign), Rebellion just feels really overwrought, slack, and uncompelling.

Anyway, with Fantasy Flight you know what you're getting these days. If you like Battlestar Galactica or Descent, you might like Rebellion. If not, give it a miss. Yeah, it's Star Wars, but all the weird ways in which it's not Star Wars will start to annoy you pretty quickly. Stick to X-Wing.

My take on some things Rebellion does well, and some it doesn't: https://li.st/l/63c4db68-9cec-43e8-88ae-b9e12eaeeb70

Although it's not that similar, Rebellion's closest analog is War of the Ring. I actually think it's better than WotR, but I didn't like WotR that much. 
---
Just one play, but you'll be as shocked as I am to hear me say that this seems to show some real promise! The game plays pretty cleanly and gives you a bunch of interesting trade-offs, and manages to maintain some interesting game tension. It captures some fun stuff from the classic trilogy, and while it's not in the same tightly thematic league as Knizia's Lord of the Rings or Middle-Earth: The Wizards, it's pretty solid.

The risk is that FFG usually doesn't do the heavy lifting to get the nuts-and-bolts card balance and narrative tension of its games right. So there is still a lot of risk (in my mind anyway) associated with the mission cards, and whether as the Imperials you need to pursue a balanced approach, or if it's really just a "probe droids all the way then blow up the Rebel Base" kind of a thing. I kinda think it might be. But at the very least you'll probably need to do some kind of holding action to keep the Rebel objectives at bay, so there is adequate reason to hope. On the Rebel side, there is some question as to whether it's worth the opportunity cost and hassle to upgrade Luke to a Jedi, or pursue some other plot lines they actually did in the movies, but time will tell on that.

The narrative cohesion is actually pretty good, certainly better than previous games by this designer and FFG in general. You get a little bit of a rational flow to the missions and such which gives it a bit of a narrative pulse. Still - weird choices. Why, for example, is it not a mission to steal the Death Star plans? You get the plans from an Objective. Certainly far from game-breaking, just another one of those odd choices that FFG routinely makes in their games.

It is a bit long, I think longer than it really wants to be. Plan on probably 4+ hours your first time out, with a potential to run 5+. Not great; there is not so much depth here that it justifies a playing time that much over 3hr. But not too bad either. Battlestar Galactica was punishingly over-long, and this is not in that league. It's definitely not super-tight game, but it's not too bad.

Anyway, that's some random thoughts. I enjoyed my first game, and I look forward to playing it again. There are still some obvious long-term risks, but also some significant potential. It's obviously designed to be significantly expanded; if, for example, Rogue One works out it would be fun to get some of the characters and events from the new movie into the game (especially since it looks like there are a few women in the cast in leading roles, which the game sadly lacks; not including Howlrunner on the Imperial side, especially given how high-profile she is in FFG's X-Wing, was a huge oversight).

----

Intriguing to see a few nods to the classic SPI/AH Freedom in the Galaxy, which was Star Wars with the serial numbers filed off. Could be a coincidence.

This is actually a totally great premise for a game, and there are a number of really interesting ways you could go with it. Clearly the core structure of Freedom in the Galaxy is basically correct for one political/military angle, but since that game was unplayable even in the 80s, you'd want to pick and choose what you want to do, and have an interesting angle. Unfortunately, the in-house designers at FFG seem to be fuck-ups, so what we'll likely get is some half-assed plastic monster which doesn't really work (see: Merchant of Venus, Rex, Mansions of Madness, too many others to count). I'll play it once just to see how they screw it up, but hold out no optimism.

Phenomenal game of cat and mouse.  This is Scotland Yard/Letters From Whitechapel/Fury of Dracula melded with a dudes on a map game.  The whole thing is tied together with a really unique worker placement-ish mission system where you assign limited commander assets each turn to narrative missions or use them to move about the board and fight.

Playtime is extremely long (3 hours) but it flows very well and feels only like an hour has passed.  Very engaging and exciting.  Full of drama.

The only weak point I found was the combat, which isn't bad.  It merely is a bit bland and not up to the excellence of the rest of the design.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

This is one of those games that is INCREDIBLY difficult to rate after just one play, so it feels wrong to start of with "I'm not sure I understand the hype here" but that's all I can think of so there ya go.

Essentially it felt like this game isn't sure what it wants to be. It tries to marry a tense bluffing game with a galactic conquest game to mixed success. It seems like bluffing ought to be the heart of the game, but most of the systems tie more meaningfully into the conquest game which is frankly lacking.

The takeaway here is that the action resolution and combat systems are just plain dull. Roll some dice, who got lucky? Wheeeeeeee. And that's like, 70% of the game.

Again, having only played once we spent most of the game trying to wrap our heads around the rules (the subjugation vs loyalty system was pretty fuzzy for us for most of the game) so there may very well be more interesting ways to bluff and deduce than I'm giving this game credit for - but this first play absolutely did not have the same kind of tension you would find in, say, a hidden movement game. Ultimately it just comes down to feeling like there are more tense and exciting cat-and-mouse games and way better conquest games (Konieczka's own Forbidden Stars for example), so it's hard to want to spend 2-3 hours on this.

I have played Star Wars: Rebellion at least eight times now in the past two weeks. It is by far one of the best games I've played before. However, the only things I find is it takes a while to play and setup, which makes it hard for busy people to play, as my games have lasted from 2 to as long as 5 hours in one case. To play you need to have at least 3 hours minimum to spare. The game is also gigantic, with it's box being 4'5" (13cm) thick, making it hard to store and the two boards streching the length of most large tables. However if you have a large table and 3 hours to spare, then the time spent playing is some of the best, being one of the most exciting, strategic and advvanced war games for all Star Wars fans alike. 10/10

Typical FFG game. Really well produced and with loads of theme which Star Wars fans will appreciate. Nicely molded miniatures. The balance seems to be okay. There is however a lot of chrome which slows down what should be a fairly straightforward game. The battles are unnecessarily drawn out with dice and leaders producing endless cards which can cancel dice. Feels like a meeting of accountants rather than a battle. Overall 4+ hours seems too long for the limited decision making going on.

Dudes on a map isn't my thing and this seems like it would require a crazy amount of fiddly detail memorization to become competent at even for an FFG game.

Very thematic Star Wars strategy game that fits best as a 2 player. The asymetrial sides really fit the theme and make the game very interesting. It does play longer than I would like but should speed up with more plays. The decision making is pretty good, trying to establish what your opponent is trying to do, It feels a bit abstract. If you’re a Star Wars fan and enjoy deep 2 player games this is for you.

RATING: 9
The most perfectly balanced game I have played!
There are so many ways to play and so many things to do you can try something new each time.
Both sides play differently, too, with obvious strengths to use and weaknesses for your opponent to exploit.

The dice add a random factor which some people have incorrectly attributed to a reliance on luck. But careful use of your cards and characters can still put things firmly in your favour. Your resources are essential - many of your cards are one-use only so you need to pick the right moment. If you're relying on just a dice roll, you're playing it wrong!

The promotional material promised a game that was cinematic in scope and it doesn't disappoint, whether you're turning Mon Mothma to the Dark Side on Ord Mandell or having Luke Skywalker lead a Rogue Squadron strike on a Star Destroyer being constructed above Sullust, each game tells a story.

The use of heroes to drive the game works really well and fits the Star Wars setting perfectly. The placement of heroes, their unique abilities and strengths in combat, form the chief mechanic, but they can't be everywhere at once, making allocating characters an important task.

In a nutshell, it manages to achieve everything it claims to be, which is pretty special.

A beautiful galactic sandbox that is part game part storybook. A reasonably exciting asymmetrical duel is elevated to the sublime as you wrap it a custom Star Wars narrative that unfolds during play. Individual moments linger long in the memory - the titanic space combat above Bespin, blowing up the Death Star just before the rebel base is destroyed, Luke, freshly a Jedi Knight, falling to the Dark Side. If you're a Star Wars fan this is delightful.

The best strategic game I've played so far packed with awesome miniatures and beautiful art design - as always everything in top standard from FFG. 4-6 hours for a play might be too much for someone, but that is a tax for a great experience.

Balancing is OK, when the empire player is not dull hungry for victory (in other words he doesn't subjugate every planet on the map in round 6-7). Our plays usually end around step 8-9.

Battle mechanic is simple, could be better, but on the other hand, making it more complex would be harmful for the gameplay I guess.

This is the best game I have played in many years. 

In 3-4 hours, you play one encounter. The conflict is asymmetric; the Empire has more forces, but a limited time to find and destroy the Rebel base. The Rebel player need only delay the Empire until time runs out, but can make that clock go faster by meeting objectives. Even after 10 games, I'm still learning things and seeing new strategies. 

The rules are pretty well written, so after your first game most of your time will be spent playing and thinking. There are a lot of decisions to make, and the better player wins a vast majority of the time.

The tactical part (how many forces to send into an attack, or how to assign damage during a battle) is very minor. A bigger part for the Empire is planning: where do I position fleets, and how do I defend my territories from raids. Both sides must make Go-like decisions. Where do I want to fight or escalate, and where should I ignore? The Rebel player has to balance maximizing the safety of the hidden rebel base, meeting objectives to accelerate the clock, and confusing/deflecting the Empire's search for the base. 

The game also plays well with 3-4 players (using up to 2 players per side). The subtle changes in the game rules for >2 players significantly changes the strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pretty much everything I wanted in a strategic Star Wars game.
Where it's too simple, I can use the events as models for miniatures or roleplaying game scenarios. 
Character cards are replaceable with personalized units, but the general mechnics are beautifully accessible.
My only regret is that this game, like its classic DOS predecessor, namesake, and obvious inspiration, is really only two-player.
In this regard, the Risk Star Wars "Saga" edition is slightly superior, and a mash-up of the two results in what is, for me, the perfect Star Wars campaign game.

This is my first game review as I'm still semi new to board gaming. This game is AMAZING! I bought it on Friday after watching hours of videos and reviews online about it. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and the "Star Wars in a box" tag line got me. So I had a game night with 3 friends last night...we opened up the game and started popping cardboard! 

Myself and another friend had been watching videos online so we had a BASIC understanding of the mechanics. We knew we were in for a long game but we wound up playing for...8 hours! 1 game...8 hours. Now I know that sounds crazy but that includes setting everything up, smoke breaks, food break and of course playing the game. We took our time to make sure we were playing the game correctly. It did not seem like we were playing for that long at all! It was pretty much non stop fun from beginning to end!

My partner and I were the Empire while my 2 other buddy's were the Rebels. Playing as the Empire definitely makes you feel powerful. The whole game I felt as if we were unstoppable. We got overconfident and let the Rebellion sneak in and DESTROY OUR DEATH STAR!  Now normally when something like that happens it illicits anger...nope it was AWESOME! Han Solo led an armada of Mon Kalamari ships and Y-Wings into our system....we thought "no way, what are they thinking?" And then boom! Darth Star plans card is played....we tried to recover (we were in the process of moving towards Tattooine where the Rebel base was located) but simply ran out of time. I have never had so much fun losing a game. 

From trying to freeze Luke in Carbonite to Interrogating Leia to find out where the Rebel Base was this game is very thematic! If you like Star Wars do yourself a favor and RUN to the store to pick it up. May the Force be with you.

RATING: 9.95
The Force is strong in this game! Absolutely amazing! "Star Wars in a box" is the perfect description. It evokes the movies incredibly well. It's beyond epic; it's a saga! And very cinematic. You can send Luke off to train with Yoda to become, you can plan an assault on the Death Star, and rapidly move the Rebel Base when the Empire gets close to finding it. It's thrilling and evocative. We truly live in a Golden Age of Board Games. If I could just play this game in about three hours with my friends, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, we play far too slowly to get this to the table more than a couple times per year, I'm guessing. When we do though, I'm sure I'll love every minute of it.

fun game, really captures the theme. A bit too much random (random mission cards, combat cards, heroes recruitment and lots of dice rolling) to reach 9 or 10 rating. Dropped rating to 7 because of combat which is clumsy and slows game to a crawl when too many units are involved....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid gaming experience and great for fans of the franchise. I would give more stars, but I found combat a little too clunky and chaotic. There is next to no room to place all your units and allocating hit tokens makes it even worse! Also, it is advertised as a 4 player game, but let's be honest - it's a two player game. The responsibilities get split between two people on opposite teams, which is fun, but ultimately it feels tacked on. 
The miniatures are lovely and the artwork is great, so it is highly reccommended to fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
With a few more plays I think I may raise the rating. This does seem to be the definitive Star Wars game, but if the rebel base is discovered too early it can be far too quick an ending. Otherwise, the game can tend to drag for too long instead. Its hard to decide what is the perfect length for a game of this kind.

The License is so popular, that any Star Wars game will be overrated.
Doesn't look bad actually but it feels like the usual FFG big boxes with plenty of stuff,  cool minis and average FFG rules. The sheer length may reduce the immersion.

- Pricey for the components, there are 150 minis but they are small, at 70€ it wouldn't be cheap. the box is half empty, so everything would fit in a standard sized box.
- The gfx design is not so good, dark units and dark tokens on a dark background make the game harder to read than it should.

For those who are not Star Wars fans, this is just a good game, for those who are, this is an outstanding game.
All the characters in the game (leaders) reproduce the skills and the missions they have in the original story, as also the several types of ships reproduce the correspondence strenghts and features, so the theme is quite strong here. 
Basically, a "cat and mouse" game, however, so nicely done. The feeling when playing the empire is of an enormous strenght that is, however, put to the test by the continuous advance of the clock towards endgame (game turns). 
The rebelds, by their part, feel so completely powerless and overwhelmed, yet, there is always that little hope of surviving just a little bit more, so that the endgame may came in their rescue...

April 2016 - just received the game in the mail, via Amazon. Looks amazing! Can't wait to play it!

March 2017 - just finished our fourth straight play, and our first Rebel victory! What an outstanding game, with great tension and such a strong tie back to the source material. A masterpiece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
- Balanced but highly asymmetrical.
- Action management through leader placement and mission planning stage is satisfying.
- Military unit positioning in galaxy map is important and key to each sides' strategy.
- Tense cat and mouse gameplay.
- Fantastic components.

Cons:
- Combat could be more interesting but the leader card bonus to give an edge to space and/or ground forces is not a bad system. Expansion possibly improves and expands on the combat.
- Rather long game, 3 plus hours for sure.
- Plays best at 2, wouldn't recommend sharing turn duties with the 3-4 player rules.
- Set up takes a while but also is part of the gameplay.

RATING: 9.5
I love this game!  The gameplay is quite simple, yet the amount of actions you are able to do each turn because of how many leaders you have available is what causes it to become quite lengthy.  Yet, that is where the heart of the game lies, in the strategy and planning of which leaders you will send on missions, and to where, because trying to draw out your opponents leaders to oppose your missions may be part of the strategy even more so than wanting to succeed on the mission. . . The combat isn't as complicated as it originally seems, and there is a bit of strategy involved when planning which units to send. I love the tension involved, and the theme is perfect.  It is a long game, so that will make it hard to get out, but it's worth it.

Played once but decided to sell.  It was a long game and admittedly I only picked up a good strategy towards the end.  I felt as the rebels that it was seven hours of relentless hammering, yet I nearly stole the win with a trench run that failed with an unlucky dice roll.  Had I won I think it would've felt undeserved.

Decided to sell as it's a heavy game and I struggle to get these to the table as often as light-mid weight games.

This is straight up War of the Ring with Star Wars. I don't know why anyone hasn't mentioned this yet in any review. 

You have one overwhelming evil side with tons of resources going trying to overwhelm the good side that basically only win by avoiding the evil side. There is even a mechanic where the Empire searches for the hidden Rebel base which screams "Hunt for the Ring" from War of the Ring.

That all being said, all board games borrow from other board games and I think this one does it well. This is a hell of an excellent game and if you love games like War of the Ring or Battle of the Five Armies, you will love this game. 

Also, components are excellent and Fantasy Flight actually made a decent box for this one that can fit all the components in–a far superior design to the Descent Second Edition box.

This game is worth your time and money.

Really got the feeling of being the Empire or rebels, wonderfully done. Takes a long time but worth it. Only worried a little about combat. In my first game their was a big final battle, which seemed to be based on luck too much for my liking. But maybe it was bad luck combined with a small chance that there is one huge battle vs multiple smaller battles. Either way, amazing thematic engaging game!

Does for Star Wars what War of the Ring does for Tolkien: playing it transports you to the world of the original trilogy. This game is actually a bit simpler than WotR, but takes longer to play. I'm not sure that the depth matches the play time (I feel kind of the same way about WotR in terms of effort, rather than time), but there is so much flavor that I never get bored. Four hours of SW:Rebellion is a really fun four hours.

The components are fantastic, even by FFG standards. Everything is beautiful *and* functional.

I haven't tried this with more than two players, but I assume that the team rules would extend the play time, which is not what this game needs.

On that note, if you don't love Star Wars, don't bother with this unless a light 2-player 4X game that takes all afternoon really appeals to you. (Yes, this is absolutely a 4X game, despite its asymmetry.)

Combat mechanics are a bit wonky and battles can be fairly boring. Gameplay mechanics can become somewhat tedious and repetitive in the later rounds. I've played the game 3 times and each time we were mentally drained by the last couple of turns and each finish was slightly underwhelming regardless of who won. Regardless, thematically speaking, it's a great game if you're a Star Wars fan and I haven't given up on playing it yet.

This is a fun and challenging game. It seems to combine the political control elements of Washington's War with the hero and unit-type dynamics of A Game of Thrones:  The Board Game. The gist of the game is that the Rebel player places a secret base at the beginning, and the Imperial player has to find it. While there are a number of systems to chose from, it seems to me the Rebel player would want to typically place it as far away from Imperial forces as possible—thereby maximizing the amount of time it takes for the Imperial player to get there and poke around. This may limit replayability, but I will have to play more before I decide anything on that point. It is also nice that the game facilitates play from 2-4 players. Be prepared, though: it does not play fast! But it should be enjoyable to any fans of the series, as well as strategy gamers generally.

This looks pretty cool and it's freaking Star Wars! So why not pick it up? I have some concerns. First, it has a very long play time and I'm not sure this would get played as much as I would like. Second, some of the early reviews have me concerned about the replayability. Both of these issues might not be deal breakers, but at that price point it probably is. I can't get this for much under $120 Canadian mail order, which is too much to make me to overlook these red flags.

Difficult to see how they could have made this any more Star Warsy than they have managed. The hidden base mechanic and the asynchronous sides is very well done and the action cards feed in very well to hatching cunning plans and surprise wheezes.

This game is so absorbing that the length is not usually a problem if you have the time to play it.

Outstanding game.  Rating a 9 after one play but expect this to creep up to a 10 with more plays.   Excellent mix of theme and strategy.  My first game came down to the wire with the death star on the rebel base's front door.  I'm very much looking to playing it again.   The game was long though.  It took about 5 hours.  I expect this to come down with more experience, but there is a lot to look over once the game kicks in gear.  7 leaders with 10 missions.  Which ones to do and with whom?  Also, during this planning stage, you have to have a good idea of what you want to move and accomplish.  Just all around excellent and gives a good mental workout.

Interesting asymmetric wargame sees players take on the Empire and the Rebellion in the Star Wars universe.  The player's motives are very clear - find the Rebel base, or don't let the Rebel base get found.  Game play is basically commit a leader to do something - attempt a mission or move forces on the board.  Slowly the Empire will clear the 40 odd planets and begin to narrow down where the base is located, while the Rebel player desperately tries to run the clock down.

Felt a lot like War of the Ring (good) with a messier combat system (bad), but a cleaner activation system (good).  This is about twice the length of War of the Ring (bad) but still fun to play (good).  

War of the Ring is possibly the best game out there ... ever ... this is simply very good.  Like so many Fantasy Flight games, it needed more development to shave an hour off the playing time.  Someone should have told them the combat system simply needs to be faster, as all the fun is in the cards and the game of hide and seek.

Explicitly amazing game, highly thematic, excellently put together, fun and interesting. Not too sure how often it will get played as it's a long (potentially very long) two player game. Though in its defence the decision space is enormous, but the core mechanisms are quite simple, you can explain the rules enough to play in about 20 minutes. Combat isn't bad, it's just not as amazing as the rest of the game, and in the end it's a bit of a roll off - which might have worked if it was a very simple one to speed up the game. These combats get very out of hand when many units are involved. That said this game for what it is offering is amazing. Let's hope ffg do something similar for game of thrones.

Addendum: this game is a recent bgg top ten entry and though cynical of more recent hotness ranking so highly, I think this games position is deserved.

This game reminds me strongly of a couple other of my favorite games: Middle Earth Quest and War of the Ring.  These types of epic asymmetric games are hard to do well, but SW:R nails it.  

SW:R is clearly at its best when both players know the game well.  It is critical that both players know what their opponent is capable of.  To this end, there are some essential user-created player aids here on BGG, namely the lists of objective, mission, and action cards, as well as the battle board.

I don't understand all the complaining about the combat system.  I think it does a great job of abstracting the importance of combined arms and leadership.  The battles are exciting and usually go the way of the stronger force.  So it's not too lucky, but does allow for some surprises, and particularly can allow the Rebellion to get in some quick jabs if they bring a good leader in with their strike force.  I also love the way the Death Star is both the Empire's most deadly weapon and greatest potential liability.

Lived up to the buzz.  Lots of good things in this game, but they are well-reported so I'll just nitpick a couple of things.  (1) The table sprawl is huge.   Borderline ridiculous.   (2)  The box size is silly.   Borderline ridiculous.   (3)   The opposing leader icons are a little small to see across the table.  (4) There is some nuance in when (or when NOT) to oppose missions and how to do so that the rulebook could have clarified via one good example.   The rule book and glossary are nicely done and quite clear, but lacking in enough examples and tips, which isn't essential but would have been nice at this price.

Plays quite smoothly once you get the flow of it.  Very engaging gameplay.  Combat is simple and logical.  Generates a lot of tension near the end-game, which harkens back to War Of The Ring.  Keeps me thinking about it and makes me want to play it some more, so that's a really good sign.

A bit long, but otherwise an excellent game. The only downside to the length is getting people to agree to play it and finding the time to play it.  It's length is not bad in terms of game play though, as it pays you back for the time you put in.  Dripping with theme, great strategy, excellent graphic design and artwork, the minis are great, and I can't get enough of the game. I love it and wish I had it when I was younger.

The cliche that everybody spouts when reviewing this game is that this is Star Wars in a box (original trilogy). It's true. The 3 hrs of play time fly by as you become engrossed in the asymmetrical battle between the Empire and Rebellion. Need to play it more to better focus on the strategy rather than the rules but I still love it. Combat is a bit wonky but still ok. Epic in scale and fun.

Sets itself apart from War of the Ring and Horus Heresy by being half a war game and half a hidden movement (read base) deduction game. Takes about 3 hours and has a good tempo and hits most of the starwars plot points you hope to see. I like it but it is frustrating sometimes. A bit like War of the Ring one has to do effective aggression early to buffer against the late game luck as the game can boil down to guess which of two planets has the hidden base in it.

This really is Star Wars in a box.

The only negative i can think of is that it's really long the first time you play. Need atleast 6 houres to unbox, learn gameplay and then play with Rule book close at hand. This can make that last hour a bit frustrating when you start to get tired.

Great fun tho.

As it stands, I think it becomes two very different games when you compare early plays to later plays and what you get out of it changes, so it's hard to rate this as I would rate other games.

In the initial game - provided you are not the type to review all components before sitting down to play - there is a lot of wonderful mystery in trying to figure out what your opponent is doing; on the flip side, if you've played it at least once on both sides, the card-limitations change the game into something else.  For example, if I recall my counts correctly, the Rebel's "stack 1" objectives amounts to four or five cards.  That's it.  With any foreknowledge of what the Rebel is attempting to do, you can pretty much prep for it before he's even ready to do it, so it becomes less a question of [i]what[/i] is the player trying to do and more about [i]when[/i] is he going to try to do it?  

Since the card pool is relatively low when it comes to the Rebel's objectives or the Empire's projects (both game-changing stacks of cards that can win the game for either player if timed correctly), the game evolves into one of anticipation and it starts looking like a magic trick whose machinations you already know.  This wouldn't be a problem if the magician is incredibly skilled as you are more taken with the execution than the actual trick, but Rebellion, while skilled, isn't an exemplary magician.  So what you get out of the game, then, depends on what you came for.

If the game you're looking for is one of cat-and-mouse - the heavily-armed Empire versus the nimble Rebellion respectively - then you will find that only in your first one or two plays, and to me, that's a little disappointing.  While thematically everything makes sense and really communicates the Star Wars universe very well, the idea of a small Rebellion exercising guerilla warfare starts to fade away as the card pool becomes known to both players.  The theme doesn't suffer in this case, so no worries there, but it becomes more like the Empire being fortune tellers and positioning themselves correctly while the Rebellion tries to find alternate ways of accomplishing what the Empire knows.  It's weird.

From a strategic standpoint, it can be an interesting talking point and it doesn't tarnish the quality of the game; only it's nature is challenged.  While you can reach this point with several other games, the reason I am being so critical about it is because the card pool is so small.  If you love a game enough, you hit this point anyway, but with a large enough card pool, the guess-work remains and the strategic choices you have are still relatively open to you.  In this case, however, you have to adjust the way you play on both sides.  The Empire [i]knows[/i] that the Rebels need 4 systems with a unit in it each.  It [i]knows[/i] that 6 systems with Rebel loyalty gets them points.  It [i]knows[/i] that leaving Coruscant open to Rebel occupation is worth two points.  The Rebellion [i]knows[/i] the Empire knows this.

So, at the end of it all, is the game good?  I like it!  lol  Despite all of that, I totally dig the way the game plays.  I know it's common-place to compare it to various games and while elements are familiar, I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking this is something it's not (it's [i]not[/i] Twilight Struggle [i]anything[/i], get that out of your head).  I can't imagine playing it as a team game; this one is 2p designed with 3-4p added as an afterthought.  The short of it is that the Rebels have a hidden base which may or may not be canonically located on Yavin (player's choice) and they need to complete several objectives in order to gain enough popular support in the galaxy to take down the Empire.  The Empire player, on the other hand, has to find this rebel base and destroy it before the rebels can have their day.  That's it.

What you get is a wonderfully asymmetric game; while the actions and overall play mechanics are the same for each side, the rebels are low on resources and easily lose systems while their missions keep them highly mobile.  On the other hand, the Empire is a formidable military beast, rolling over systems in its hunt for the rebels, but its pace is slow and it relies on capturing leaders and interrogating them.

An expansion full of objectives and projects would make this game what I want it to be, but that's not to knock on what it is.  After some plays, the challenge is different and it's still fun if somewhat predictable at that point.  YMMV.

Need to set aside a good afternoon to play properly (or morning if you're some sort of animal).

An amazing back and forth on the table recreating the Star Wars universe, which I love. I think any Star Wars fan owes it to themselves to try this one out, as it re-creates the feelings and events of the classic trilogy so well.

RATING: 7
There are some neat ideas in this game, the hidden rebel base is fantastic, but nothing seemed to gel in a way that was particularly good when I played. The combat was crap (and why not make combat and assignment dice different for newbies?), the storyline didn't quite pull together, but so many of the elements were cool. I think a streamlined version could be amazing, or even if you spent hours more playing and getting used to it it could enhance, but this just has too much bloat for me.

Soooo good. Really captures the epic feel of Star Wars, and the desperate struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire. I love the asymmetry, I love the theme. A great game for 2 players that have some time to dig into the game, as it is long, but it's tense and thrilling throughout the entire game. The structure and feel of the game reminds me of War of the Ring.

Wow.  What an extraordinary game, and one where the theme and its associated storytelling component shines through brilliantly.  Not to mention the multi-leveled and interacting tactical and strategic options, and the deliciously brain-burning and rich array of meaningful decisions to be made in each phase of each turn.  And then there are the components, which are truly stunning.  Especially now that I've managed to come up with a viable solitaire variant so I can play it solo, since that is the main way I play.  Just... wow!

Game is way, way too long. Just too long of a game, if you like to think about your moves at all. Our group typically plays games, even the first time, within +/- 30 minutes of the printed playing time. This game, which is rated at 3-4 hours, easily takes 5-6 or more hours in a close game. Once you hit the 5 hour mark for a 2 player game, that's no longer board game territory for our play group. And while the game time does pass mostly quickly cause you're constantly doing something - there is little downtime - the sad part is that ultimately the first 1-3 turns of searching and building up don't really add much to the game, and the game could have been designed to be 50% of the current length. 

A great boardgame concept with a great setting and theme, that overall failed in execution by not aiming for a 1.5-2 playtime. 5 Stars - take it or leave it.

Like many FFG games, some of the rules are too confusing, but if you can get over the fact that you will be regularly consulting the two instruction manuals, this game is incredibly fun!  It is a very different game depending on which faction you are playing.  True to A New Hope, the empire is a juggernaut that needs to expand aggressively to find the secret Rebel Base.  The Rebels feel like underdogs, but with crafty planning, can make advances toward winning.  On my first game I played as the Rebellion, and was within one turn of winning when the Empire found my base, which was unfortunately undefended.  On the second game I played as the Empire, which was able to systematically subjugate Rebel systems and capture Rebel leaders.  The Rebels feel like they are at a distinct advantage, which at first feels annoying, but the more you think about it, it is actually the way it should be.  We don't want the Rebels to be as powerful as the Empire.  We want them to win the miraculous victory.  We want Luke to make that one in a million shot down the exhaust port after all his fellow pilots have been shot down.  Thematically this game allows you to feel like you are in the world of Episodes IV - VII.

This game has a lot of great aspects but in my opinion it lacks the necessary micro calibration and some real problems pop up with the way the leaders are added in the game.

I love, love, love:
- the theme is so, so solid
- the cat-and-mouse game

- that the Death Star is indestructible--heh, heh
- recruiting leaders and having them fulfill special missions
- the story and post-game discussions

I dislike:
- the combat, kinda?
- game length can go for hours--we'll try a variant to see if it gets the game played more

Final verdict: Like many others have already said, it's Star Wars in a box and pretty darn perfect.

I really liked the hide-n-seek gameplay, and the objective cards and build queues.  I liked the idea of keeping leaders back to oppose missions, and didn't even mind the die rolls to resolve those missions - despite how much I hate "roll dice to see if you win" mechanisms.

The combat, however, was awful.  Not only was it luck-driven random dicefest nonsense, it was long and drawn out, playing over multiple rounds.  It was stopping this really interesting game of secrets and manipulation and bluffing to play a lousy mini-game.  If a second edition was released with a better combat system (maybe stolen from Cry Havoc's supper innovative approach?) I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.

I like the missions you can choose to send your heroes on and a enjoyed the hunt for the rebel base, but I liked the conflict there as if heroes are completing missions they are not available to lead troops across the galaxy and subjugate another planet, thus there is a careful balance needed between the missions and expansion.

The build queue mechanic here is very clever and I like that the empire has ways to add more units to said build queue or pull then from the build queue faster than standard, and this leads to the very thematic overwhelming force for the empire, however the game is not about combat superiority. Empire must find and destroy that rebel base and the rebels must stall the empire just long enough.

A lot of mechanics here and to be honest they all seem to work well together and the result is actually quite thematic. I enjoyed this one and would like to play again, even though the rebels managed to deflect my death star laser and save Kashyyyk :shake:, and then Wedge Antillies blew up my death star :cry:... stupid Wedge!

In retrospect, there was no way a game that recreates the original Star Wars trilogy wasn't going to appear in my personal top 10. This really is the quintessential SW game: it's hard to imagine it being re-themed around, say, Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones. The game's mechanics feel inextricably tied to Star Wars. (Speaking of mechanics, the oft-maligned combat system is fine, if somewhat clumsy. And you should feel free to use the action cards in your first game, despite what the rules say to do.) A true narrative emerges during this game: as much as I'm trying to win, it's just as much fun to see what happens next.

I'd say the Rebels have a much more uphill battle, which is the way it should be. I don't want to play a perfectly balanced Star Wars game. However, the Imperials have a much steeper learning curve. Familiarity with the Objective deck is important for both sides, as the Imperial player can doom themselves by being reckless.

The game also feels complete out of the box. I've got the expansion now and I'm super excited to eventually play with it, but you shouldn't feel the need to rush out and buy it at the same time as the base game. There's plenty of Leaders, Missions, etc. to keep the game fresh for a very long time.

Once you get used to this it can be pretty speedy.  First turns are quick, but as you acquire more recruits to your leader pool it can slow down to a crawl as you cogitate over choices.

Still very good thoughtful game.

Winning on turn 3 because rebel player was too clever for themselves and hid too close to imperials only to be blown up by deathstar "just because I had the laser and wanted to use it" is a fantastic feeling though.

This game is brilliant 1v1 fun.  This game is the original trilogy in a box.  The mechanics and cat and mouse game are excellent.  People say the combat mechanics are weak and drag out the game, but I find combat to be quick and decisive, without slowing the game down any considerable amount.  In fact, I find it interesting that the Rebels can gain quite a bit by picking fights themselves given the circumstances, even if it's a fight they don't think they'll end up winning, but need to sacrifice themselves for the greater cause.

This game oozes theme.

SW: Rebellion really plays differently than you would think when looking at all the pieces before playing. You would think this is an Axis & Allies-type game, but it actually shares little with dice-chucking Ameritrash games. I found it actually had a lot more in common with Twilight Struggle. Players are attempting to enact various missions on the board to either bolster their plans or muck up their opponents, and complete objectives to win reputation or build projects to turn the tide of war. With the right amount of influence played into these various systems, the better chance of these missions being completed. Opponents must balance whether to assign their leaders to their own plans, or hold back to confront their opponent's plans later on or to keep their leaders for movement.  Rebellion is gloriously asymmetrical.  The rules are brief and straightforward, with most of the complexity downloaded to the card effects.  The theme shines through!  While combat might run on autopilot as it happens, I do find it rewards good planning and also allows for some surprises.  Once you play it a couple of times, the Combat system will flow better and not bog down the game.  And for what it's worth, the Empire is purposely designed to overpower the Rebels in firepower, so sometimes just starting a battle feels like a foregone conclusion (that conclusion typically being a win for the Empire).  But as we know, if the Empire concentrates so much firepower on one pocket of the universe, a lone X-Wing might be able to sneak in and show them who actually has the upper hand.  The production is pretty top-notch, other than the usual FFG oversight of a decent insert. I'd still say it's about $30 overpriced, but if you're a Star Wars fan and Corey Konieczka fan, and trust the boys and girls at FFG to not skimp, then this is probably an auto-buy at any price.  If anything detracts other than the price, it is long (4-5 hours) and exhausting (in a positive "I just ran a marathon" sort of way) but if you have the time and endurance, there are few more rewarding experiences in gaming than winning at Rebellion.  It also (like Twilight Struggle) slightly benefits the player who has played more than the other and has a better recall of the cards in their opponent's deck and their own deck and is able to plan for possibilities. But I'd ignore that fact and try to play with all the excitement of not knowing what is going to come up (but just know that will make thematic sense and surprise you rather than frustrate you).

Sets out to do what its computer predecessor couldn't quite -> make an engaging struggle between two asymmetric opponents using a core set of rules but very different resource and tactics bases.

The rules review with my gaming buddy and first few turns were fun, but it was a false promise.  The game bogged down into a series of accounting exercises (Tally for production, tally for battle, search through your probe cards - yet again - to sort out where the Rebel Base can't be).

When it became apparent that we would have a big battle that neither of us wanted to go through the drudgery of resolving, we quit.    A 5-hour nightmare...

Best described as Runewars set in the Star Wars universe.  Very enjoyable "find the secret rebel base" objective.  Variable leader actions and a combination of standard and unique missions makes every turn interesting.  Beautiful artwork and components.  The last round is usually very tight but the luck can be a bit swingy.  Theme is impressively integrated with the mechanics.  More mission and objective cards would have added to the replayability, but as is this game has earned a respected place on my shelf.

RATING: 10
This isn't my attempt at an "objective" review.

But this is my absolute favorite game!

I enjoy games of all kinds: I love euros, and Ameritrash, cooperative and competitive, party games and big chunky games.

This is one big chunky Ameritrash game with a healthy dose of Euro.

I can't even explain why I love it so much, but I love this game.  I always want to play it!  However, I don't always have the time - which is perhaps part of the allure.

There is no getting around the fact that this is a long game.  I have played this game 7 or 8 times now and it clocks in around 5 hours for me and I don't see it getting shorter than that, realistically.  This game is an event, and boy does it deliver.

One of the reasons the game takes a while is the fact that there is so much to think about.  It's interesting how asymmetrical this game yet you still feel like you are playing the same game, not two separate games.

The almost worker-placement of the game provides a nice euro engine that drives the Ameritrash madness.  If you are the imperial player you are playing a very chunky resource management game that I find absolutely addictive!  

The rebels will win or lose based on how they fly by the seat of their pants and make daring raids and hit-and-run, hamstringing the massive resource machine that is the empire.  It really feels like the movies come to life.  It's swingy, but your defeat or victory is based on your decisions, gambles, and mistakes.

It doesn't hurt that I am a big Star Wars fan!  I am not even trying to say that this is the best game I own, but it is the one I like the best, if that makes sense to anyone else but me.

I want to love it. I especially like sending leaders on missions. But... it is overwrought with perhaps one or two too many mechanics thrown in. The combat system is just awful. I am not a fan of the small tactics cards in particular: dice are fine, cards are fine... but both? It doesn't bother me that combat is "different."  It bothers me that it is super fiddly for very little payoff. This, coupled with the possibility of an early planetary invasion insta-win, ruins the game for me.

A terrific game with options that keep growing the more you understand it. Try to spread out to corner and exterminate the rebels or strike suddenly against an overstretched Imperial navy?

I just find the base mechanic (deploying and using characters) very uninspired and boring.  Add to that the strictly two-player , the length, the overly large box, and the "so, you've found me?  I'll just move somewhere else, try again" aspects and I'll find a game that I'm not interested in at all.

Also, I should be honest and tell you I'm not a Star Wars guy.  I'm into Sci-Fi in general, so I know the lore more than most, but the theme of this game (the grand story of the original trilogy) leaves me really cold.

And second: I've only played as the Rebels, and in general I loathe playing reactively. Maybe if I played as the Empire, I'll rate this a point or two better.

Ratings on BGG Scale:
"likely won’t play this again" (3)
"Mediocre" (5)
My rating: a (4).  I recognize why they designed this as they did, and it got all bases covered as far as theme goes.  Also, major props for taking a different route in the "dudes on a map" genre.  Sadly, both theme and core mechanic don't appeal to me.

Played a preview copy of this before it's official release. It's grand, epic, and everything a space opera should be! The theme is chock-full of Star Wars and it definitely has a Fury-of-Dracula-meets-War-of-the-Ring vibe, too! The only knock is its length and heavy rules-set when first learning.  It's a lot to take in and not sure it would be something you'd get to the table every week (but maybe once a month). Otherwise, the force is strong with this one!

The components are short of amazing, the mechanics are bordering Twilight Struggle originality and complexity and asynchronous play means you can always switch the team and play completely different game.

The only thing to consider is there are 3+ D6 dice rolls involved with double on one side involved, and this might hurt you sometimes.

El sabor de la trilogía original -verdadera y única- está muy presente en este estupendo juego. Llama la atención su mecánica central: los jugadores disponen de diversos personajes y cada turno los utilizan para mover unidades por la Galaxia, atacar al enemigo, cumplir misiones, o bien tratar de impedir que el enemigo cumpla las suyas.

El Imperio trata de localizar y destruir la base secreta rebelde, mientras la Rebelión intenta sobrevivir y acelerar el fin de la partida.

Se trata ante todo de un juego muy divertido y dinámico, que lógicamente disfrutarán más los fans de Star Wars. Las batallas épicas se combinan estupendamente con las aventuras y acciones protagonizadas por los personajes que aparecen en las películas.

Looks beautiful.  I can't wait to play it. 

1) Kind of not what I thought it would be.  I need more plays to really know, but this seems like a alternative version of Twilight Struggle, and I hate that game. 

2) A couple of plays and this game is a huge time commitment (3-4+ hours), and then it will end suddenly on you.  That sucks. 

3) Played again only due to the wonderful theme, and again the game ended suddenly.  That stinks.

So, this game is hammer and nail with fleet-- meaning Rebels will almost never win a straight up fight, so this is no war game.

It is all cat and mouse for 3+ hours. Then, when the rebels actually win, will win suddenly after 4 hours of play.  The rebel victories do not feel thematic to me at all. 

Ultimately, rebels are all missions with minimal fleet.  The Empire should be a great deal of fleet with minimal missions.

This is a card advantage game disguised as a Star Wars War Game, which it is certainly not.

Just amazing.  My favorite game and will probably remain so for a long while, possibly forever.  

Every time I play this one, I'm struck at how well they captured the tension of the cat and mouse game the Alliance and the Empire were playing.  Almost every game comes down to a nail biter ending.  I just love it.  Certainly not a Risk clone type game.  It's very impressive.

[Haller's copy] Played as Rebellion twice, each play a year apart.  So each game was a learning game.  It's fiddly, heavy, interwoven, knotted, frustrating, and I can't wrap my head around all the moving parts and figure out the timing of missions and relocating my rebel base.  Both times I wanted to move, but forgot that it only happens at the end of the phase, assuming I'm still alive, and I'm not.  Both games ended anti-climactically because of this.  There's just too many things going on.  This is the fiddliest game I've ever played.  So frustrating!

I have added two more plays and it keeps getting better.  You will leave every game with a story to tell.

There is little I can say about Star Wars: Rebellion that hasn't been said before. The game is amazing, no doubt about that, but perhaps I can shed a bit of a unique perspective. I've been in the hobby about three years now and my tastes have certainly solidified over time. I like euros, euros with theme, but euros nonetheless. The only "dudes on a map" games I own are Cry Havoc and Blood Rage and even those are euros in ameritrash clothing (and they happen to be among the least played games in my collection). I tried Mansions of Madness. I wanted to love it. But in the end I rated it a 5.5 and sold it from my collection. Games like Star Wars Rebellion are ones I typically do NOT enjoy.

Yet I think when all is said and done, SW:R could go down as my favorite game of all-time. The game is flat-out incredible. Fantasy Flight nailed the theme here. What makes the game so great are the mission cards and how they tie back to the movies so well. You can run a mission using Luke and Yoda to Dahobah and if successful, turn Luke into a Jedi. But at the time, in one of my games, Luke was already captured by the dark side, so that mission was not worth it for me. Perhaps I should send Leia on a rescue mission? There is nothing in board gaming that I have experienced to date that makes me feel like I am IN a world like this game does. I liked it so much that I played it again three days later with a different opponent. Each game played out much differently with the Empire winning easily in my first play and the Rebellion surviving in the second. The only thing that could break this game for me is if I determine that the sides are imbalanced. One of my friends has played this 5x so far and said that in his plays, the Empire has never won. If that turns out to be true, that will be a shame, but I will say this. I am very happy to keep playing to find out. This game is a wonder, a joy, an EXPERIENCE. You owe it to yourself as a gamer to play it.

Oh, and when you do? Make sure you stream the Star Wars soundtrack (free if you have an Amazon Prime subscription using the Amazon Music app). It creates a great atmosphere and backdrop for your plays!

Impressive. :D
I believe this is a lighter version of the War of the Ring, while the combat system is definitely better. Don't believe the criticism about the supposed clunkiness of the combat system. I found it pretty neat even for bigger engagements. 

In my first game as the Imperial I concentrated too much on military conquest and Imperial Diplomacy, in order to consolidate my power, augment my production and destroy Rebel insurgents. I have fallen short by not  devoting energies into espionage and therefore I wasn't able to find the Rebel base till the bitter end. I had fun nevertheless so I'd consider that a good 4 hours long experience. That time really passed fast.

In the second game, as the Imperial, I devoted most of my attention to discover the enemy base. By turn 5-6 I had a fair good idea of where it was, I attacked it earlier and was lucky with a land mission which makes possible to attack systems from a distance. There was little the Rebel could do by then. He resisted the first attack, but could do nothing for the subsequent one, which was overwhelming. All in all a good game, but I don't know honestly what the Rebel could have done to advert the Imperial onslaught.

Again a 4 hours long game for my third game. As the Rebels which I played for the first time times couldn't be tougher. Matteo, my host, was very careful in not letting me get any points, and indeed it was extremely difficult. I just got one by sacrificing Obi-Wan, and destroying - at great cost - an imperial star destroyer. I was able, later in the game, to collect some points conquering Coruscant with a double mission. A very lucky thing which I don't think Matteo will allow me to pull off in other games. 
In the meanwhile my leaders were captured one after the other, and Leila was turned to the dark side. By this time I was feeling pretty claustrophobic, and I had nowhere to run, my forces basically only present in the base. The base was then suddenly attacked, but fortunately I was able to repel this attack, which, everything considered, could have given me the game. Next turn the imperial forces could have gotten the base, but it was a 50% chance. In any case, before their attack, I resolved a mission with the Consul and Luke - which had become a Jedi. That mission was to attack a local planet which was subjugated, a 3 troopers against 3 stormtroopers. Emperor Palpatine tried to block the plot, fortunately to no avail, and a battle ensued, but Luke's ability and rerolling dice carried the day. With that I scored the last point in order to win the game. Thematically Palpatine trying to convert Luke was slayed and the Empire liberated of his influence for ever. Great, good and very tense game, till the end!

Asymmetric turf game of backstabbery, glory-grabbing insurrectionists, and egregious number of deaths of civil servants. It's a great game that's worth the time investment and if you play through a game and think, "Man, I really had fun except for..." there's a good chance that the expansion has already fixed what you're hung up on. Definitely worth the play.

I love Star Wars. Love it. Have since I was a kid. Everyone said this game was Star wars in a box, and it really is. It really captures the feel of the movies, the feeling of helplessness of the rebels as they try to stay hidden and out of reach of the Empire, while simultaneously striking at them to hamper their progress and gain support throughout the galaxy. Sending out your heroes to complete missions or lead your fleets. Playing this game felt like playing an alternate version of the movies.

The catch is, I don't feel like that makes for a very good game. In the movies there are many situations where blind luck or circumstance drastically changes the way things go. Obviously in the movies these situations ultimately play out in the rebels favour. The game has done a good job of translating those kind of situations through the use of card play and dice rolling, but for a game that usually clocks in at 3+ hours, I feel like it is ultimately unsatisfying to have the result so dependent on these moments of luck. What works in the movies makes for a frustrating experience in the game. The gameplay equivalent of Han stepping on a twig and setting in motion the events that lead to the Ewoks joining them and helping get the shield down vs him not stepping on the twig and things ending in likely doom for the rebellion does not make a satisfying conclusion to the game as far as I'm concerned.

So, ultimately, this is a game I really want to like, but that I just can't. If I want a Star Wars experience, I recommend watching the movies.

Game really needs better rules books.

Fantasy Flight is notorious for their crappy rulebook *remembers the crappy Arkham Horror and Mansion of Madness rulebooks*

Because of the really hastily made rulebooks that has not been playtested at all... seem FF doesn't know that you need to playtest the game AND the rulebook before publishing... speaking of publishing, the publisher did not do its job by releasing a game with such poor instruction manuals.

It's a good game, but the poor attention of FF to the rulebooks is hurting it badly.

I'm forced to drop the rating to a 7.5 instead of an 8.5.

Great 2 player game, and we had fun with 3 today.  I like how Koznieka has, in this game and BSG, captured the feeling of hidden traitors and stealth vs power, respectively.  The combat cards are a little weak in terms of drawing dead ones pretty often due to chance with lightsaber rolls. maybe the expansion will change combat for the better.  

It's tough, because the game would lose a lot by being shorter, but I think this game is just an hour or 2 too long to be a total hit with my wife, and she is who I usually play 2 player games with.  Still, I will check with my friends to see if it is worth shelling out for.

I will be very surprised if this game doesn't win any awards for 2016. It's so close to a pure 9 for me; the only reason it's not there is the time requirement to play it combined with the lower player count. It's proven difficult to get plays of this in, but every one has been worth the effort.

played a couple times. A well put together game. you will never just win but with a couple abilities the rebels can draw out the game a little bit. not much but a little bit. I did enjoy but I was a little intimidated at the start just from the amount of minis in this game. but you soon learn that the empire needs them all, and maybe a few more if the rebels are froggy.

Love it. Feels like you get to play the Epic version of Star wars original trilogy into a board games.

Says it plays with 4 but they are just splitting the fun with shared duties. This is, at its heart, a 2 players games. An Excellent one with lots of bluffing and epic moments. 

Must have for any star wars fans.

Really like the replayability of this game. The fact that you can choose the Empire or the Rebel Alliance to play and have totally different strategies to win according to wich side you're on is really cool. The miniatures are really good, quality plastic. This game is for people who love strategy. It is not fast paced and requires some thinking and the turns take some time. Also there is the possibility of not having enough miniatures to play if you are conquering a lot of systems.

El gran juego definitivo de Star Wars del año (en este caso, del 2016) :D

Este es un 4X (ya sabeis... expansion, exterminacion, etc). En castellano: dominacion, combate contra el enemigo y conquista. Es 1vs1 (aunque se puede jugar en equipos de dos) y asimetrico. cada bando (imperio y rebelion) tiene sus propios objetivos y varias rutinas de juego propias. 

El objetivo del imperio es localizar, cercar y exterminar la base rebelde, y el objetivo de la rebelion es "aumentar su reputacion" cumplimentando diversas misiones "anti-imperio". si el imperio localiza la base y la destruye: gana. si la rebelion consigue aumentar su reputacion hasta el punto de coincidir con el marcador de tiempo del juego y lo hace antes de que los imperiales localicen y destruyan su base, entonces ganan la partida. 

Todo ello por supuesto amenizado con epicas batallas estelares (bueno, no son tan epicas, pero dan un buen nivel en el genero) y un festival del plastico: destructores y superdestructores imperiales, cazas de ambos bandos, e incluso tres estrellas de la muerte, una de ellas "incompleta" igualito que en la pelicula. Un puntazo. 

El juego basicamente representa el arco de las tres peliculas originales. y lo hace bastante bien. no es del todo teledirigido y cada bando tiene cierta libertad de accion dentro del guion establecido. la jugabilidad es variada... ¿que puede salir mal? 

En mi opinion donde falla un poco es en la movilidad de las flotas imperiales. se mueven como flotas de barcos. muuuuuyyy despaaaacio, de un sector al siguiente. es mas estrategico y le da un puntillo de facilidad al jugador de la rebelion... pero en mi opinion no es realista. me parece logico que el juego "obligue" al jugador imperial a tener varias "flotas" y le impida moverlas como le salga del pitoto (incluido "fusionarlas"), pero que una flota requiera 2, 3 o mas turnos para llegar a un determinado sistema porque se mueven como tortugas artriticas por el mapa me parece sinceramente un cachondeo. hay alguna carta "cheta" que permite saltarse esto (moverse a un sector cualquiera como si estuviera adyacente). pero eso en mi opinion deberia ser una opcion de movimiento, no una carta cheta. 

En fin, dejando aparte el "rage". es un gran juego y por supuesto, merece mas partidas para valorarlo adecuadamente :)

SW:R dethroned Spartacus as my favorite game. Star Wars holding a special place in my heart will always win over Spartacus just on theme alone. Add in some hidden mechanics, cards and characters oozing theme.

Add in a player who can quote as much of Star Wars as I can and the hours playing the game feel like 5 minutes.

I never thought this game could be beaten on the enjoyment factor for me... until I played KD:M.

7/8/16: First play-through ended fantastically. The first four turns were pretty rough, especially considering my cousin and I (both seasoned gamers) had read both manuals and watched a few videos prior to playing. The different card types (and their lack of deck title or symbol on the back of the cards) threw us for a loop paired with questions about resolving the turn phases.

The manuals included (How to Play and Rules Glossary) really left a bit to be desired, namely that there was no two-page spread simply showing turn order and/or starting components. We found that when questions arose we had to read both manuals me piece together the information to get the answer.

Aside from that slight annoyance once we got the hang of it the game played beautifully. It's fun as hell and we spent the hour after I lost talking about the cool shit we just did.

Okay, so this is only based on one play. I was not "blown away" by the game, but I think this needs repeated play to be properly assessed. I will say this - I felt a lot of pressure as the Rebels. The game swung violently when the Imperials captured and released Leia with a homing beacon - because of fortuitous probe deck draws, the Imperial knew almost exactly where my base was. 

I liked it, it was very tense. It definitely has that Twilight Struggle of feeling of damage mitigation, at least from the Rebel side. 

I will also admit that my experience may have been somewhat hampered by poor play on my part. I was really focused on getting planets that would help me build more units originally. Admittedly, it is unwise for rebels to even attempt an arms race with the Empire. Instead, they seem to need to focus on specific objectives and misleading the Imperials.

This is a tentative 7.5 with the possibility of going as far as a 10. I think I will enjoy being the Imperial player more, so once I get a chance to do that, I will update my rating!

Edit 1: Have played a second time now, although we didnt quite finish. I can safely say that it is more difficult to play the Rebel side, mostly because those objectives are just hard to actually complete! Rating now an 8 because I am thinking about potential strategies for this game after playing and in between plays.

RATING: 9.26
If you like Star Wars you will love this game.  Only knock on the game is that it will take you about 3 hours to play once you have all the rules memorized.

Our first play through took 6 hours because we constantly checked the rule book for various things.  We didn't even realize we had been playing for 6 hours though.

The game is dripping with Theme, has all the characters you know from Episodes 4, 5, and 6, and has defining moments you will recognize.  

The best part of this game is how you can rewrite Star Wars lore and have stories to reminisce about.  For instance, in our game Obi Wan got captures, put in carbonite, led the Imperials to our secret base at Tattooine.  The Rebels were able to narrowly escape to establish a new base on Dantooine.  Later Princess Leia got captured and was rescued by Obi Wan, who, was again captured on a future mission.  The Rebels finally were able to curry enough support from the galaxy by destroying a Death Star that was underconstruction in the Dantooine system.

RATING: 9.2
Gorgeous components. I'm in love!
A really strategic game with its very unique "leaders assignment & reveal" mechanic to "hint" at what actions a player plans to take in a turn, forcing to plan your full turn in advance, and yet try to adapt just a little bit.
Full of the tension that would have inhabited both factions, one thriving to just stay alive and hidden, the other one desperately trying to find the base and crush the insurrection. Not to mention - plenty of true-to-heart Star Wars moments.
It really takes a long time to play. But it really is a blast.
I just wish combats didn't have so much randomness (dice + tactics drawing - the tactics part is addressed in the expansion). Mission resolution also really uses a lot of dice, which feels only half OK. I guess it is what makes this game "sort of a little lighter", compared to what would be a purely strategic game.
I wonder if a no-dice variant could work...

Finally had a chance to play it. I still think opportunities to play will be few and far between given player count and time, but man this game is all of the awesome that I hoped it would be. Really well encapsulates a lot of the feel of the PC Game from back in the day (enough so that I think it really had to at least be some part of inspiration), and even if not, I really enjoy it. Only managed one play in, but not only did the game play out very well, but a lot of what happened was totally thematic. Not sure if that's coincidence or just a game doing a really job good of making sure that it's theme is implemented...

Star Wars:  A New Hope was the first movie I attended as a kid.  Almost 40 years later my wife and children all have a passion for all things Star Wars.  This game does not disappoint and feels like a good balance between X-wing and Imperial Assault.  Not purely combat and not scenario driven, just bring it to the table and see who can outwit the other.  Easy to teach and not a lot of AP between turns so it moves a little faster than the lower end of the 180 minute time shown.

Never before has a game so quickly descended into a serious of "fuck yous". 

I like the asymmetric gameplay (The Empire is a Military power while the Rebels are more on the Diplomatic side). Things are tipped slightly in favor of the Empire, who can curb-stomp anyone who doesn't think ahead a few steps. 

The only thing I dislike is the boring combat, but a good player can minimize that

"Star Wars in a box."  This game captures the tension and grand story behind the individual action scenes of the original movies.  The characters are all there, but the events will play out differently each game, making for fun stories and "Holy Cow!" moments.  The mechanisms have just enough to tooth to be engaging and the game is tense for both sides the whole time.  I can't recommend this game enough if you are fan of the franchise.

Even though it doesn't feel as epic as War of the Ring for me, this is certainly the most epic Star Wars game we'll ever get. Very thematic and the mechanics are well implemented. The only 2 things that should stop you from at least trying this game are 1) money and 2) hating Star Wars and 3) disliking rules-heavy games.

What I like the most : the missions and assigning leaders to them. Thematic and fun.

The expansion really fixes the issues I had with the base game (i.e. combat).

RATING: 9.75
I love playing this very long game. It's engaging and stressful as both the Empire and the Rebels. Very little occurrence of "do the obvious thing".

Each game has felt different but also very thematic. I connect to SW:R so much better than I did to Twilight Struggle despite growing up in the midst of both dramas.

Combat could be better, I think it's adequate but not as satisfying as I'd hoped. The strategic tension however makes up for the small shortcoming of combat.

I'll play it as often as I can!

RATING: 8
Nice area-movement adaptation of the almost 20-year-old strategic computer game set during the original Star Wars trilogy.  Unlike the computer game, the sides are nicely asymmetric, with the Rebels hopelessly outmatched in the military contest overall but with some nice opportunities to create local superiorities and deliver setbacks to the Empire.  Combat is aided by an interesting system that simply captures differences between troops and vehicles on the ground and fighters and capital ships in space.  The overall game experience is also enhanced by some truly excellent production values.
This is, however, a Star Wars themed game, not a game about Star Wars.  The characters are familiar, but don’t expect them to behave in familiar ways.  Characters that you would expect to work together (like Han and Chewbacca) will operate on their own, and there is no difference between force-sensitive characters and others, a key omission from Lucas’ creation.  The worst offender here though, and the one that takes me out of the Star Wars feel of the game, is the movement pace.  With the exception of leaders and a few missions, units are limited to a sluggish pace of one area per turn.  I was really disappointed by the lack of a hyperspace rule.  The general construct of the game itself also creates narrative problems.  The overwhelming military advantage of the Empire means that either a similar advantage needs to go to the Rebels on the diplomatic side, or a time limit needs to be applied.  The latter was chosen.  The objective of the game is therefore for the Imperials to find the hidden Rebel base before time runs out.  It’s Clue meets Battleship with a time pressure on the Empire in a manner that does not seem consistent with the movies.
Overall, this is a good game, and it’s amazing that it has taken more than three decades for somebody to do this.  I had hoped for more of a “simulation” of Lucas’ galaxy, and created a variant to make the game closer to what I was hoping to see.  But it’s a fine game as is if you’re not too picky about the narrative details.

Well... Not what I was expecting.

I was waiting for an Star Wars War of the Ring, and it tries to be that, but...

Find the Empire too boring, you only move, and move, and move. Missions are completely a secondary part of the game for them, only to avoid Rebels completing some objectives.

Combat is long and boring between big fleets or armies.

I can't feel the theme in most of the game mechanisms.

It's not a bad game, but don't think that it is the great game what Star Wars deserves.

I was a bit afraid to play Rebellion, that I wouldn't like it and it would take too long. It was a long game with numerous references back to the rule book. I played the Rebels and felt like I was getting beat most of the game even though I was scoring lots of successes in missions every turn. My rebel base was discovered round three. The game took eight hours. I was so cranky in the middle. I imagined playing other games. Then the last two thirds of the game, the lightbulb went on and I could really understand what I needed to do to eke out a victory. The objective cards that reward you with an increase in Rebel reputation are key. Do everything you can to crush the clock downwards and minimize the number of turns the Empire gets to discover my hidden base. This game was a blast! love the miniates. Love the combat system with the tactical cards. Rebellion is an awesome game. It does take a long time to play. Understand that. It's the game of that day. Star Wars Rebellion took a lot out of me, but I thoroughly enjoyed playing it and I am eager to try with the Empire.

Only played once (as Rebels), and I enjoy the SW universe. I played a partial game (~2.5 hours) and got to blow up the death star, so that was great! Interesting asymmetry, though I'm not sure it feels exactly right that all the rebels need to do is hide their base. In War of the Ring (another epic, asymmetric game), it really does feel right that all the world can be war-torn, as long as the ring is destroyed. But in this, it doesn't feel right that everyone can get annihilated, planets destroyed and subjugated, but as long as the rebel base hasn't been found yet, the rebels win when the timer is up. That's not actually the right win condition - it should be blowing up the death star twice, or defeating the emperor, or something like that. I could imagine that nearly the whole galaxy could be controlled by the dark side, but once the emperor is killed, the rebels win. Or once the death star is destroyed again, the rebels win. But simply staying hidden long enough... nope. So the whole game feels wrong, since the win condition is wrong.

Based off of one play, but I feel the mechanics speak for themselves. Everything about the missions and secret location are awesome. It's just that combat feels a bit lackluster. It all pivots on a die roll with almost no way to manipulate the rolls. Situationally of course, with one of the few recruit cards you recieve, but we just didn't feel like it was enough to really sway battles in your favor. Going to keep this one around and try it with 4 players, I feel like splitting up the priorities might make for some interesting decisions/strategies. Definitely worth playing/owning, I mean it FEELS like Star Wars for sure. It just could have been a smidge better in that area. Was hoping for something akin to X-Wing miniatures pilot abilities, they just gave you that extra little control so you don't feel all your efforts are for nought.

One of the best merges of mechanics and theme that I have played.  I'm a huge Star Wars nerd, and though I normally cheer for the Empire, I actually really enjoyed playing both sides on this game.  Fairly tightly balanced too, my main opponent and I each have a 50% win rate on both sides.

:thumbsdown: :bd6-1::bd6-1: :shake: Dice typically emphasize drama at the expense of balance.

I can't justify sitting down to a game that is so convoluted that it takes 3-4 hours to play to find out if I enjoy it or not, so unless I have an extremely well-versed teacher and I'm trapped in a room with said person and this game and nothing else to do, I'd be hard pressed to try it.

I do not rate the game as 10 because I am still waiting for the perfect game, but this one is very close to perfection. 
It is absolutely thematic, the system is asymetric but perfectly balanced, replayable, it is an epic game with plenty of different valid strategies. You do not need to do always the same thing, many paths can take you to victory.
If I have to say a couple of possible improvements, I would say that the battles may become a bit messy if you start a dealing cards frenzy. I have not played the expansion system. The other issue is, more than in other games, a new player needs 2 to 3 games before being really competitive, you need to know what type of cards the other player may have. There are some combos that, well played without the other player being prepared, can kill the game. 
But, even when you are defeated you enjoy the game. If you like this kind of complete and highly strategic games, you have to try this one.

Ambitious and decent design, but:

1. you need dedicated players to play this game (this narrows down the opportunities for regular play significantly)

2. there are too many options  - absolutely splendid as far as flavour of the game is concerned, but if you play optimally (or just rationally) you just won't be using them.  Why on earth (as the Empire) develop terrifying technologies (like Super Star Destroyer) or annihilate systems with Death Star when you should focus just on moving your units and searching for the rebel base.  The Rebels likewise - why bother with Sabotage mission for example when the Empire will have enough of production anyway (removing the sabotage marker sporadically),  
There are so many options for both sides and that is great, epic, immersive and all dandy, but they turn out to be just unneccessary decorations if you play SW:R competitively.  This is especially troubling in case of the Empire which should ignore its missions to great degree and focus on searching the galaxy for rebel base.  The military advantage will be there no matter what...

Still, I love plenty of ideas implemented in the design and that's why I can play the game not only without much fuss, but even with pleasure :) (assuming _someone_ would have and bring a copy).

RATING: N/A
Watched the TV Playthrough (admittedly on and off)

FINALLY FFG gives us an all original SW game, that to me is the biggest plus here, and to me its a big one and I don't see any close comparisons really and only small shades of others, like the cat & mouse of FoD, etc (though as discussed in many threads months ago it seems it may have been heavily influenced by FitG & the PC game). Another couple of pluses are being able to use the actual characters as Leaders, secret missions, asymmetry, and the Rebels having a hidden base which can possibly be moved. 

I was quite excited for this game on that premise, and the rumours it might be a wargame a little similar to WOTR (which imo IS only a little similar), however after watching the Playthrough I think it is most likely off my to-buy list for now anyway (price does not help at all esp. CDN price where FFG screwed us all 2 years ago [b]dictating[/b] a strict list-price only policy for all retailers across the board, commie arseholes, so much for "the free market") where it was at the very top before watching (thank goodness for playthrough videos). IDK, it just seems even though this looks VERY streamlined for a FFG game (except combat which looks unnecessarily fiddly without return on it), the mechanics still 'seem' to overshadow the theme a little not unlike many of their other titles, maybe a little too much abstraction not sure. I could (hopefully) be off on that, and it could be that "specific" play-though just didn't seem that exciting but it also seemed tension was lacking a little for a war-type game, less the cool Rebel elements mentioned before however which also add some nice Intrigue and Bluff as well (sweet). I was also hoping for multiple win conditions vs. just one for each side (possible houserules for this maybe).  

At any rate I'll have to watch a different play through or better yet play it, and I [i]definitely[/i] want to being a big fan of the Movies since being knee high to a grasshopper, my first impression is it won't reach the epicness that is WOTR but hopefully I'm wrong

Edit - Early reports are showcasing the theme and story moments do come through, and also DO show some tension and even excitement building towards the ending here. 

My Resistance to the DARK SIDE is failing....(and of course was surely futile, anyway)

After spending a lot of time researching the hype I finally took the plunge and the game is fantastic. Can't say enough positives that weren't illustrated by others. The rule book is a bit annoying to sort and the box is probably only the size it is because it needs to accommodate the board. 

I think the Rebels have a small advantage, but even still the game really captures the feel of the original trilogy. I was looking for a Star Wars game for a while and definitely think I made the right choice.

The epic, thematic, large-scale, choke-full of miniatures Star Wars game I have awaited for all my life. It is a very fun game, with many hard decisions. Sadly, the game is not perfect, it runs a tad too long, perhaps, and the common complain that the combat is bland or boring is pretty justified, especially concerning the combat cards. As is usual in Corey K. designs, there are a few rules (luckily, they are minor rules in this game) that make no thematic sense whatsoever and that seem totally gimmicky. They hurt especially since the theme is so strong in this one and they can come off as dissonant.

***UPDATE***
This game has real staying power, and is surely Corey K.'s masterwork. Once you accept the minor flaws and idiosyncracies, the game unveils itself as rich, dense, complex and exciting. A true challenger to War of the Rings' throne of "saga in a box". Up to 9!

Personally the game didn't live up to the hype for me. Takes quite a while to play due to some lengthy combat sequences at times.

The bluffing is hard to pull off for any extended period of time as you're being tracked down and you always feel at a huge disadvantage as the rebel player which while it is thematic doesn't always make for fun gameplay.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2016)

I was a fan of Star Wars right up until the last movie (The Force Awakens which I despise but that’s other topic :D) but I still have fond memories of the books, the PC game and previous movies. Besides, Star Wars: Rebellion is a game well regarded here on BGG so I was keen to play it.

As is usual from FFG, the game components are outstanding, the miniatures are very detailed and they look great on the board. The art is very good as well.

The theme is great as I love the original trilogy.

The game´s rules aren’t very complex, but there are many rules. You can explain them under 20 minutes. Both rulebooks seem intimidating at first, but they are far easier to understand than I initially expected. Gameplay is around 3 and a half hours.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t trivial, but aren’t that hard either. As the Empire you have to move your armies through the galaxy looking for the Rebel base. As the Rebel player you have to hide your base as best as you can. Both players have to decide which mission to accomplish and whose leaders to assign (or oppose) to each mission (that’s the best part of the game). I also enjoy the cat and mouse dynamics between the factions. The Galactic Empire is very powerful military wise while the Rebel Alliance has very meager resources. In my game, the Rebel Alliance didn’t win a lot of combats but almost win the game nonetheless. Combat isn’t as important as I initially thought. Star Wars: Rebellion is a deception game.

The feeling of playing and controlling both Death Stars is amazing!, it has an epic feel to it :D.

Combat is ok and easy to understand. There is some luck with the dice, but most of the time the expected result happens, that is, I don’t feel the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck, you can prepare for it. There is much more uncontrollable luck with the cards (missions, projects, tactics).

To me, Star Wars: Rebellion is only a two player game, with more players the game slows down and the downtime increases to unmanageable levels. 

On the bad side, from my very limited perspective, it seems winning with the Rebel Alliance is much easier than with the Galactic Empire due to a mission card that the rebel player always has at hand (the one that lets him move his base to 4 or up to 8 different systems if you use two leaders). I need more plays to verify this claim, but if true, that could hamper my desire to play the game many times. It seems playing with the Empire requires a lot of finesse while playing with the Rebel alliance is easy and straightforward. I like asymmetric games, but so far, it seems to me both factions aren’t balanced. I need more plays to see if this is an issue for me or not. The rebel victory doesn’t feel very thematic, they can get away with lots of mistakes and, as moving the ships through the galaxy is so slow, time is on their side.

Bottom line, Star Wars: Rebellion is a good Ameritrash game. These days I no longer enjoy that genre as much as before but I enjoyed the game. For now, it is a borderline 7.0 to me and I have not yet decided if I should keep it in my game collection or not. I need more plays to see if the rebels can escape as easily as they did in our game. I want to play it again soon. Much better than War of the Ring though.

Fantastic game.  Very thematic and well done.  I have a bad attitude toward FF when they bling out a game, but then skimp on the game play.  I'm looking at you X-Wing and Imperial Assault.  This game delivers the game play AND has the bling.  It is a little unnecessarily fiddly at times which is the only thing that has kept it from a 10.  Probably only a matter of time before I cave in and give the 10.  :-)

This game combines a lot of cool elements. There's a worker-placement like mechanic, or maybe best thought of an action point system with completing missions, then there's managing the map and finding/hiding the rebel base, and then there's combat and hidden objectives.  The game does a great job at capturing the theme of the first Star Wars movie (episode IV).

RATING: 6
Tantalizingly close to a great game.  Most of the mechanics are solid.  Sending the heroes and villains from the Star Wars Saga out on missions feels very thematic, and the hunt for the Rebel base is a blast.  Combat is a let-down, however.  It's buckets of dice and stupid tiny cards.  Because the Rebel player must pick his battles, 95% of the time combats are hopeless for the Rebellion as the Imperial steamroller can't be stopped.  So why do we need to roll the dice and play the tiny little cards each time a huge Imperial invasion force faces off with a Y-Wing and two Rebel soldiers?  It might be important if the Rebel player can pick off a unit or two...but it usually isn't.  The designers seriously couldn't do better than this?

With a better combat system (or even without one and the game focusing on the political/adventure side of things), this game could have been a classic.  What a shame.

This is the Star Wars game you're looking for! The various elements of the game work together elegantly, resulting in thematic gameplay that captures the feel of the original trilogy brilliantly. Smooth mechanics and an accessible, intuitive ruleset provide an excellent framework to deliver this exquisite experience. The cat-and-mouse chase emulates the Empire's struggle to locate the Rebels, and the disparity in military power between the two sides reflects the situation in the films. The missions, objectives, and projects provide layers of strategic elements: deciding when to attempt missions, whom to send on them, the order in which to execute them, whether to oppose your opponent's mission (and with whom), etc. These cards fuel the story of the game as each side strives to gain the upper hand. The combat system is simple and fast without being rudimentary, and the tactic cards give both players some tricks up their sleeves. The innovative building mechanics necessitate precise planning and make certain systems advantageous to control at key moments. The variety of leaders and their various abilities are yet another way that the theme and essence of the Star Wars universe shines through. Add to all of this the superb production value of the components and you have the quintessential Star Wars game on your hands. This game is the ultimate power in the Star Wars universe, and fear of this technological terror will keep all other Star Wars games in line.

Good, but flawed. The heroes/missions system is great, and really makes the game. However, there are a few problems. First, combat is too very random, drawn out, and boring - the players throw dice at each other with little actual thought. There are combat cards, but just a few and they aren't interesting. Second, since missions are drawn randomly, you can find yourself unable to do what you want. Last, I don't feel the game has enough replayability - I feel I'll be done with it in 2 or 3 more plays.

However, my son LOVES star wars, and he'll love this in a couple of years, when he learns to read english. So I'm keeping it to play with him in the future.

Great game!!! But has anyone else noticed watching playthroughs or by actually playing that the Imperials tend to make really arrogant and boneheaded moves that cost them the game.  I guess that it makes it fit the theme better, but it feels like I'm watching Spaceballs with all the idiocy.  It seems like the Galactic Empire should have a huge advantage, but they just squander it away turn after turn.

I really like the arc to the game - how the leaders gradually increase so you are getting more and more missions and activations done as the game progresses.  Also, how the rebel objectives become worth more points as the game progresses and the empire gets closer to finding the rebel base.  The whole thing is nicely thought out - like, with rapid mobilization, it protects against the Empire accidentally stumbling upon the rebel base early on.  Rapid mobilization becomes less effective the longer the game goes on, but it doesn't matter as much becomes the game has developed sufficiently anyway and the rebels have had time to become competitive.  The whole theme is very well implemented, with the overpowering empire, and the rebels doing hit-and-runs and sabotage here and there.

Notes from 2nd play: 
Love the game of Cat-and-Mouse, and from the rebels side, balancing objectives with hiding the base and with building the units you need.  Also, the map is really brilliant - the non-adjacency areas are really effective at suggesting a 3-D galaxy area on a 2-D board.

Well, first euphoria is gone. The game can be very frustrating for the Imperial player.
The missions give the game very cool Star Wars atmospheric but the Imperial player can't try to fulfill many of them because he has to hurry up to search for the RebBase. After a long (unlucky) search the RebPlayer can easily move the Base away and the Imp Player starts again to search for it.
In the meantime the RebPlayer attacks a lot of just light defended Imp Systems (by missions) and move his Time marker down. The Imp Player cannot defend all systems well because he needs most of his troops to explore other systems.
Hurray, finally he found the RebBase but now it’s not enough time to move his fleet there.
The movement system is very chewy and constrains the Imp player a lot.
10 Points for the Star Wars atmosphere, 5 points from a bugged Imp player.

RATING: 10
Currently my favourite game, you're basically in the co-directors chair re-telling the Original Triology with your opponent. Behind the theme there is a solid, asymetric game with a lot of depth which only shines through on repeated play. It does requires a large investment of time (& willing opponent) to learn & occasional play to stop you getting rusty. The hardest part is finding other plays who are as entheusiatic about it as myself! My least favorite part is the combat, which uses card randomness to add to dice randomness.

Overall (with two experienced players) both sides feel like they are loosing for the duration of the game, instead it's that rare beast, a truly balanced game where randomness plays little part. My worst game was one where I drew good cards, had a good position, strong builds, but wasted it all through poor strategy. Conversely I've won games where all the dice gods seemed against me, and both leader & card draws were poor.

Excellent game that makes you feel more immersed in the Star Wars galaxy than most video games even.  What I love most about this game isn't just the fact that it is a Star Wars map painter; it's its wonderful asymmetrical gameplay which makes playing as the Empire and the Rebellion feel unique and distinct from one another with their own unique challenges.  

The Rebellion is entirely objective oriented as you have to achieve very specific goals in order to increase your reputation and bring the galaxy that much closer to freedom.  This can lead to some wonderful mission planning as you try to maximize your moves and heroes to achieve the most objectives per turn.  One particular play that stands out in my mind was one turn where I had Chewbacca lead a strike team from the Rebel base to a world occupied by the Empire.  I won the fight, thus lifting the occupation.  The next mission I played then allowed for me to safely return all of the ground forces back to the Rebel Base.  It was like my strike team was never there - a true hit and run mission.  At the end of the round, I got two objective points: one for lifting an occupation and another for winning a ground combat that round.  These are the most satisfying moments when playing as the Rebellion.  The moments where everything aligns to hit the Empire just right and advance your reputation towards victory.  Then the other half of your game is focused around throwing the Imperial player off your trail through misdirects and a good poker face when there are Star Destroyers the next system over.  

The Empire plays almost like a detective game of some sort.  Losing Stormtroopers and Tie fighters doesn't matter to the Empire, only finding and destroying the Rebel Base.  Everything the Empire does, whether that be capturing and interrogating enemy heroes or spreading your forces to occupy regions of space, is geared towards finding and eliminating the Rebel base.  In this way, playing as the Empire almost feels tenser than playing as the Rebellion as the turns fly by and your desperate search continues.  Though you have the superior numbers, you have to be spread out unlike the Rebel Alliance which can attack with its full force at seemingly any place and anytime.  However, nothing is sweeter than sleuthing your way to figure out the Rebel player's location and bringing down the might of the Empire upon them.

Another aspect that really makes this game shine above others of its type is the previously mentioned mission card system which allows you to lovingly recreate scenarios from the films or craft unique adventures of your own.  From a diplomatic battle of wits between Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin or the Emperor trying to turn a captured Luke Skywalker to the dark side, you really can forge your own Star Wars story.  These actions of subterfuge and tactics will really stick with you long after the generic battles of other games are forgotten and the characters go a long way to help that.  I'll never forget the time that I lost the game as the Empire when the Emperor was killed by Luke Skywalker in the Battle of Mygeeto where the Rebel Base was located in the last turn of the game.  My friend used the Return of the Jedi objective card to end the game in the grandest fashion possible, and, even though I was on the losing side, it speaks volumes that a loss in this game was more fun and memorable than a victory in many other games.  Star Wars Rebellion will always hold a treasured place in my collection.

Beautiful game with a huge amount of stuff in the box. Nice asymmetric game play. For the price, it would have made sence to get it prepainted which would have increased the feeling. One disadvantage is the game length, four hours is a little too much for the gameplay even if it doesn't drag during the game. However, after four hours of game, a coin flip decider for the victory feels strange. Also, the imperial side is much of a guessing contest with no information what so ever.

Great game for 2 or 4 players star wars fans, works very well in teams, even if the game is for two.

Brutal deployments, cool components and visually fantastic.
Very themed game, asymmetric with very well differentiated goals between the two sides.

Highly recommended for star wars fans who want to relive the original trilogy of the saga.

Thoroughly enjoyable game with a moderate but not terrible learning curve.  There is a lot going on but it is nicely broken up into stages that aren't too hard to get your head around and when it clicks, you're in for a fantastic time with a variety of missions, iconic characters, and great potential for some spectacular moments and memories.

After four plays, I'm satisfied with dubbing this a very enjoyable asymmetric game.  The Rebels' strategy is not one of confrontation, but of delay, and they have a surprisingly ability to come back from a weakened position.  Overall complexity is quite low for an FFG game, with most of the rules & flavor being snuck into the Mission Card deck.  I really like the black/red dice distinction in combat (which optimizes most units to fight their own class) and thought it the right mix of dice and card accents.  The whole package feels lovingly crafted and clever, which is just how I like my games.

RATING: 7
One of the few FFG big box games I could imagine owning myself at some time. It's a good mix between strategic look-ahead and tactical optimization. While featuring dice, choosing the times when to use them in combat or on a mission is more decisive than the luck involved in the outcome. The theme is well-implemented and contributes to my enjoyment. A rare case as usually theme in this type of game is used to cover insubstantial mechanism. Star Wars: Rebellion is different. Decisions matter, clever hand management and an action plan where to assign leaders each round are of importance. The only thing where the game can break down is a premature lucky discovery of the rebel base, which, while thematically appropriate, can force the rebel player into a defensive mode where resources needed for buildup have to be burnt for escape if at all possible.

I've played three games of this so far with three different people. Each game has come down to a situation where both players were close or relatively close to winning. In my third game, for example, the Imperials, discovering the Rebel base with a more substantial force than that defending the base but who had to win that turn (to avoid losing to the time and reputation markers meeting in the refresh phase), lost because the Rebels had the plans to destroy the Death Star, blew it up, and got the two objective points needed to finish the game instantly. I'm guessing this last-minute thing will reduce somewhat if/once we gain more experience and move to a free setup. Everything about the production is good except for the plastic bases that chew into the cardboard leader standees. The combat is maybe not as bad as you've heard, but it's not great; even after having played the game three times, I still have to look at the combat sequence, the experience is not all that fluid, and you kind of just want it to be over. My one real wish for an expansion is a dice-only combat variant in which the foundation is either different ships have different to-hit numbers on the same die (say, a d10), as in Twilight Imperium III, or there's a static to-hit number and different ships have different die "sizes" (d6, d8, d10, etc.), as in Dungeons and Dragons Conquest of Nerath (and probably many others).

Great game!  I am a big Star Wars fan.  It feels just like the movies with the rebels being on the ropes the whole time face an enemy that is way more powerful.  I have had a lot of fun the the game play.   I enjoy the deduction of finding the the secret base.  It was not as difficult as I thought it would be to learn.  This game has decent replay value.  My wife and I both enjoyed it and will be playing a lot more of it.  I would recommend it to a lot of people.  Its a bit of everything from resource management, area control, battle and strategy.  SIDE NOTE: Having some John Williams music blasting from some speakers makes the game a bit more intense!

RATING: 8
Wow.  This game really is as good as every one says.  It definitely feels like they took Episodes 4, 5, and 6 and smushed them into one epic game.  I can't see how this theme could be slapped on anything else.   It is uniquely Star Wars.

This is a long game.   Plan a date to play this game, and do your homework first - watch the how to play video before gametime.  It says 2-4 players, but It would be incredibly frustrating to play more than 2, and it would only make it take longer.

So far so good. Players play on 2 teams trying to either find/destroy a base or keep it alive. The gameplay is a touch fiddly, almost reaching the point of too many cards to keep track of, but remaining just manageable. Components are wonderful and amazing. Overall a great Star Wars experience.

This feels somewhat like a streamlined version of War of the Ring in the Star Wars universe with equal thematic devotion to its subject matter and elegant game mechanics.  I'm a much larger Tolkien fan than a Star Wars fan personally so I ever so slightly prefer War of the Ring, but if you like War of the Ring, you will most likely enjoy Rebellion, especially if you're a Star Wars fan.  It is in essence the (good) Star Wars trilogy in a box through which you will most likely tell a different overall story made up of parts from the movies.

I've only played one game so far but it was amazing. The stories you create in the original trilogy are what make the game. Some people have been complaining about the combat system but I found it really satisfying. The only complaint I had with the game was the length but I think as it becomes more familiar the game will pass quickly and be more fun because of it. Can't recommend it enough.

I cannot say much bad things abour Star Wars: Rebellion. It feels mostly like playing Chess with Star Wars characters and I think the game is quite fiar in a way that either one of the teams could win. If you want to complain something perhaps that the rules are really long and takes some time to learn how to play.
But again I think it can be a plus too.

The combat is typical FFG: Takes too long and is too random (It's not the dice, its the mismatched power of the cards). The recruitment deck is also quite strange and overly unnecessary - I feel this design could have been streamlined to two hours just by changing those two things and this game would have been amazing. 

As it is, however, there's still a lot of game here, especially once you know the varying ways the light side can steal objectives. Especially interesting is the character activation and how the dark side kinda needs to let a lot of them go in order to be more mobile.

A game of one-sided Stratego where one player is knocking down pegs in a dwindling array hoping to hit the flag. The plastic components, the attractive board, the characters and their abilities and affinity with various events all contribute to a sense of grand scope where elements from the films are organically mixed and remixed as you play. It also helps (and hurts) that both sides are constantly fighting (and gaming) inertia in terms of production and movement. The rebel player needs to stay on a curve of systems held and ships owned in order to accelerate time and gain more ships. The imperial player needs to disrupt this curve and draw the right probe cards to reach the point where pure stomping is all that's needed. Downsides: playing time (could take six hours, could end at any time), multiple sources of randomness that add up rather than even out.

Escape the empire while you do missions to overthrow the government, or join the empire to destroy the rebels base.

Top notch components, art, theme integration, truly an exceptional production job by fantasy flight.

As for the game play, I enjoyed the game and want to play it again.  I didn't even mind the length which for us clocked in around 5 hours (for a first game).  However, there was one major negative for me.  The tactics cards are WAY WAY WAY too swingy... they should be nerfed or limited to one per round or something, they really detracted from my experience, I would have probably given this game a 9 if they hadn't drastically effected the combat in almost every round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I've always wanted to have Empire-at-War-like board game. Or to be precise - a well developed Star Wars board game, with many things to do and for hours of playing. With this game I'm able to put Han Solo into carbonite, seduce Luke Skywalker and crush the rebellion with one swift stroke. 

Do not believe this game "is not for noobs". I've never been really into board games, this one was my very first "serious" board game, and we catched the rules very quick - instruction is well and clearly written.

 I hope there will be expansion sets soon - only thing this game needs to be better is to have more Target Cards. The game could become schematic with only fifteen of them. But for now it's not the problem yet, game takes 2-5 hours of playing (depends on many things, if you'd like to play fast you should be able to and in 2 hours, but if you'd like to relax, talk, take breaks - could be as long as five hours).

This game is absolutely amazing. Strongly recommend.

Most epic and climatic experience in star wars universum, that boardgamer can have. 

Easy to learn. 

My opinion could change in time.

 Gra ma prostą lecz nie prostacką mechanikę, opartą o karty. Już rozkładając grę klimat Star Wars wylewa się z pudełka. Figurki, planety na których działy się kluczowe wydarzenia z filmów. Mało tego, w trakcie gry na tych planetach "rozegracie" spinoff głównych wydarzeń. Przykładowo, w trakcie rozpatrywania misji, Imperium pochwyciło i przeciągnęło na ciemną stronę mocy Luke&#039;a. Albo imperium posiada dwie w pełni sprawne gwiazdy śmierci w układzie i niszczy przykładowo Kashyyk uniemożliwiając bunt wookiech. W grze jest dużo taktyki, trochę strategii, sporo dedukcji i masa radości z połączenia tego wszystkiego. Jeśli nie jesteś psychofanem Star Wars, też warto w grę zagrać, ponieważ ma tyle klimatu i tyle niezłej mechaniki, że czyni to z niej jedną z moich ulubionych dwuosobowych planszówek.

Great game. Currently my #1. The unbalanced forces between the Rebels and the Empire fit perfectly with the theme. The missions from characters adds even more flavor and a fun mechanic to the game. Haven’t played the expansion yet but looking it over it looks to add to the experience. 
The only downsides are the long play time (3-4 hours) and the price point might be high for some at 100 bucks. 
All that being said if you love Star Wars and board games I can’t reccomend this enough.

Rebellion is a terrific and Epic Struggle for control of the Star Wars galaxy. Simple and thematic play from round to round, each side maneuvers and schemes to achieve its specific goals.  Combat can be clunky at times and epic battles become Dice chuckers (Then again so was RISK and we ALL used to love that).  The Game oozes theme and with some well played missions and plans, it echoes and captures some of the magic that make the movies of the original Star Wars trilogy so compelling and exciting. A huge table hog, it's worth the time and space it takes to play the game, especially when on your last turn as the Empire is about to destroy your base (its goal) you run a mission that sends Luke Skywalker on a run to destroy the Death Star, and with a die roll and a well played card, you get enough point to secure a Rebel Alliance victory. (True Story)
Highly Recommended

Good game, but a bit too long with four players.
Our first game (with default setup and without action cards) took probably about 5 hours in addition to maybe 1 hour of explanation.

A disadvantage of playing with four players is the fact that the amount of leaders per player can become lopsided. As the Rebellion Admiral I only got Ackbar, while for the General we chose Chewie (we needed his skill for several missions), then Luke (obvious, since we had the Dagobah mission), and the last recruit was no choice at all, because we drew Luke (again) and Obi-Wan.
The Imperials also had 3 Admiral leaders and 5 for the General, and picked those because of their set of missions.
I'm not sure if the missions are generally designed more for the General leaders or if it was by chance of drawing the missions.

I wouldn't call the combat system bad, but it was more tedious than I wished. The tactics cards are an interesting idea, unforunately they were often useless in the specific situation.

Building units was also a bit frustrating for the Rebellion. We didn't manage to build strong units in the beginning (we lost Utapau before we could use it), then managed to field one Mon Calamari cruiser late in the game and put two further ones in the pipeline in the same turn through the use of two missions on Mon Calamari, but those weren't ready before the game was over. We could have even put another cruiser in the pipeline, but the Rebellion only has three available.
The Empire started production of a second Death Star as well as a SSD, but both weren't ready before the game ended (at the end of turn 8).

This is without doubt my most favourite game ever. This is a game of epic proportions and is simply amazing for creating a narrative that is just like the films which includes tension and nailing biting finishes. Simply amazing! A game I will return to again and again both at the table and away from it.

Update: Wow! I have played this game more than 15 times and the replayability is immense. Also having played it with a lot of different players and each player has pursued a very different path each time. It is just an incredible game! Where are those expansions?!!

Świetna gra, jednak zniechęca ilość wszystkich zasad i czas gry, ładne choć malutkie figurki (nie mogą być większe bo już i tak plansza jest bardzo duża. Będzie dodatek który wprowadzi postacie z Łotra 1, nowe pojazdy, kostki oraz chyba poprawia karty taktyk z podstawki (talia ta będzie miała większe karty?). Chyba trochę reguł z podstawki zmienili.

This game has so much potential, and I can tell why people like it, but so many things about it turn me, personally, away from it. If you think you will like it, you almost certainly WILL, don't let anything I say prevent you from buying it, but it just makes me not want to play it.
The combat feels like a drag whenever it happens. The rules for it feel like they needed to have some combat mechanic and they made the most ridiculous system imaginable. It is both slow and clunky, AND offers no decisions to either side! Random, but makes you have to carry everything out anyway.
Every single action you can do in this game can be denied by a single roll. I usually make the argument of luck averaging out throughout the game, but in this game some crucial actions that need to happen for the game to continue or end, all come down to one or a few rolls.
The cards you get all reference the movies... but a bit too much. There is no room for imagination when every card is literally just a scene from a movie. It feels like the game is asking you to imagine this galaxy with all these planets and telling you that you can have your own version of it... but you end up just following the events of the movies, at random orders, in random places, with random people.
The idea of the game is so good! Hide and seek, good theme, big setting, gorgeous components... but the mechanics of it all fall flat.

First impressions: surprisingly fun hide and seek Ameritrash with the Rebel player trying to fulfill hidden goals to score fame, and the Empire slowly expanding to crush the meager rebel troops and desperately trying to locate the rebel home planet before their fame grows too much. The fame score working as a game timer is a nice touch and the combat didn't feel too lucky despite being a bucket of dice with some one-off cards thrown in every battle. The battles could perhaps be a bit quicker.
Though there is luck in combat as well, the card draws are far more crucial for how the play turns out. So far it has mostly played quick enough considering the luck factor, but can also drag past its welcome.

Game made me a little frustrated, i can't quite grasp why, maybe becouse we were playing it 3 players and i was playing rebels agains 2 imperials.

Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players!

Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:

As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.
As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. 

However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.

Asymmetrical Twilight Struggle-type two player game with unique game mechanics, creativity, and excellent aesthetic design and component quality. Impressed by the balance considering the extent of the asymmetry here. 

Although this prominently features some Ameritrash game mechanics i normally hate: dice rolling, rewarding decks of unique 'event' type cards, with the right mindset (and while watching the trilogy in the background), I found this to be a fun, but deep casual game experience. Just need the right mindset - for any dice-rolling ameritrash game, theme comes first. Can't be overly-competitive. 

Gf liked the theme but found the rules, numerous rule exceptions, and the sheer number of possible strategies and actions to be overwhelming and unfun.

Big, beautiful game with a lot of theme and emergent storytelling. The assignment phase carries some difficult decisions since you need to make stuff happen but revealing your play too quickly could spell doom. The game feels very asymmetrical, but it works. In such a dense and intense game, playing with 4 players is a good idea to tone the weight down a bit.

Weird, I though I commented this game. Anyways, first, those are comments only on the rules and reviews I have seen. I was very excited at start because I actually asked for such game to exists, but there are a few things that turned me off.

First the price of the game, it's above 100$, so it has to be very awesome for me to acquire a game at that price. Second, the fact rebels can simply camp and wait for victory to come by itself.

Now there seems to be a lot of variants out there, even solo variants, that could potentially fix this. But again, do I want to pay 100$ and search for a fix.

I don't know, Maybe I'll just wait and see if I could get it cheaper.

A fabulous production from Fantasy Flight Games.  A lot of cool minis and game pieces.  However, the cumbersome and clunky game play takes if from a fabulous game to a simple box of toys.  If it wasn't Star Wars I would probably never play it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I've only played once thus far and was part of a team. I believe I would prefer it with just two players but it can work with 4. The combat system leaves a bit to be desired and I wish they had kept that simple but the cat and mouse aspect of the game is quite interesting. Rebels will have a hard time militarily as is to be expected - theirs is mostly a delaying and distraction action to keep the Empire guessing wrongly or slowing them down.

What a fantastic strategic game this is. Don't let the price point, or the number of pieces and the rulebook intimidate you. What you will find in this box is pure gaming genius and very approachable right from the get go. I have come to love the FFG model of having two instruction booklets that lets you get setup and playing quickly with adding rules that you may need during game play in the extended rulebook. This will definitely come in handy while playing your first couple of games of this. The mechanics of the game are really straightforward, and allow for two different gaming experiences depending on which side of the table you are playing on. The Empire is trying to destroy the Rebels utterly by finding their hidden base and wiping them off the mat, using a Death Star or two if need be. The Rebel player on the other hand is just trying to last long enough to draw enough sympathy to their cause to overthrow the Empire. Its a cat and mouse game wrapped in a Star Wars theme draped in awesomeness. I just wish they would have inlcluded enough minis that I didn't have to buy a second set of the game to play [gameid=3548] with miniatures instead of standees.

Very good two player light wargame with some elements borrowed from the Scotland Yard genre of hide and seek games, relatively simple combat somewhat in the Axis and Allies style, a little bit of Twilight Struggle area control/card management and some unique resource allocation elements of its own.  It also manages to incorporate this medley of mechanics into the framework of a fairly thematic game with a lot of neat touches from the Star Wars franchise. My only slight gripe is that the tactic cards slow down the combat (in a fairly long game) and make it significantly more fiddly although they do add tension.

A bit over burdened with fiddly bits (there's not too much elegance here)... but the leader committing/bluffing process is excellent (chess on steroids!) and this game ABSOLUTELY FEELS CINEMATIC.

Game time ran long on the first play-through - 4.5 hours plus rules and component overview, but there were no moments were it felt like it was dragging.  

Great game.

RATING: 7
The Assignment turn of each player, where we choose Missions, can be too long (10 missions at a time). 

The game play is more tactical than it creates a story arc: events are tied to the theme but quite generic in flavor. Twilight Struggle has more story. 

This game reminds me the most of Nexus Ops, with its Rebel objectives and the short term effects. 

The rules are quite simple and clear and well laid out. However, there are many of them, and it is a bit hard to set them all in movement, during the first game. Furthermore, a few important details are left to the reference rulebook: the problem is that sometimes we don't know that we should look there. I feel that the game is not too hard to go back to, though, so the situation is not bad. 

The rules make sense thematically, as do the card powers. This is nice. 

Overall  solid game that did not wow me but that I could play again—even if our first game took 5 hours.

Geiles Spiel. Gefällt mir echt gut. Die Spielzeit (3h) ist etwas abschreckend, aber das Spiel macht echt viel Spaß. Als Rebellenspieler direkt vor der Nase des Imperiums zu sitzen und schön Zeit absitzen ;)... Immer schön auf falsche Fährten locken und kleine Missionen vorbereiten. Es hat mich immerhin 3 Anläufe gekostet diesen drecks Todesstern zu zerstören. Hatte am Ende echt nur noch zwei Einheiten. Wenn die hops gegangen wären, wäre die Mission zu Ende gewesen... Wenn ichs in der Runde nicht durch bekommen hätte, wäre noch ein System zerstört. Echt cool wie knapp es sein kann. Auch die Missionen in denen mein gefangenen Anführer mit nem Peilsender nach Hause geschickt wird und ich ihn vorher befreien konnte... Da könnt man echt ne alternative Star Wars Geschichte draus stricken ;)

Beim 2. Spiel kam ich schon viel besser und schneller ins Spiel. Wusste was ich machen kann/will und habe den Gegner schön an der Nase herumgeführt ;).
Diesmal hab ich Standortzettel für den imperialen Spieler ausgedruckt, ich denke dass das viel bringt und den Memoryeffekt herausnimmt. Muss auch zugeben dass ich beim ersten Mal mehr "Angst" hatte. Der Todesstern hat einen Planeten zerstört um Einfluss auf einen anderen zu bekommen, ganz Imperium-Style halt. Was jucken mich 5 Milliarden Einwohner, wenn ich dadurch Einfluss auf ein anderes System bekomme?
Naja, ich finde es ein super Spiel und würde es gerne noch öfter spielen.

Star Wars Rebels n'est pas ce que vous attendez de lui au début. Compte tenu de la taille du plateau et du grand nombre de figurines, on pourrait penser que Star Wars Rebellion est plus un jeu comme Battle of the Five Armies, peut-être même Risk. Cependant, l'accent est beaucoup plus sur les missions de jeu. Vous devez réfléchir aux leaders que vous utilisez et aux leaders que votre adversaire peut utiliser pour contrer la mission. Vous devrez penser tactiquement et l'ordre de vos actions déterminera le résultat de la bataille. Vous ne voulez pas non plus déployer tous vos leaders en mission car vous ne pouvez plus contrecarrer les missions ou déplacer des troupes.
À chaque tour, vous obtenez plus de cartes de mission et plus de leaders avec vous donnant plus de choix et au début cela signifie simplement que vous devez lire beaucoup. Au fur et à mesure que le jeu est joué, vous connaissez mieux les cartes, ce qui rend le jeu un peu plus fluide. Cependant, il reste un jeu de société où vous devez passer les heures nécessaires. Avec un peu de chance, vous trouverez rapidement la base rebelle, mais il est possible que les rebelles puissent ensuite déplacer leur base et ainsi recommencer. Eh bien, pas encore tout à fait, parce que le joueur rebelle choisit 8 cartes du deck droid de la sonde et c'est pourquoi il doit choisir. De ce fait, le pont de la sonde devient naturellement plus petit à mesure que le jeu progresse.
Pour le joueur impérial, il est donc très important qu'il / elle recherche rapidement la base rebelle et que les rebelles veulent saboter et reporter autant que possible. Le jeu vous donne les bonnes cartes et joue aussi très différemment en tant qu'impériaux que lorsque vous jouez avec les rebelles. Ceci est bien sûr bien fait thématiquement. L'impériale est grande et puissante, tandis que les rebelles sont beaucoup moins nombreux et doivent jouer astucieusement!
Les règles ne sont pas difficiles au début, mais là aussi vous devez revenir régulièrement aux règles pour rechercher certains termes, commandes et devis. Graphiquement, tout est beau et bien organisé. Le thème de Star Wars correspond bien, mais quand il a été choisi un thème différent avec, bien sûr, d'autres missions que cela aurait fonctionné en principe.
Alors teamplay. J'ai vraiment aimé jouer en équipe. Vous devez vous consulter et donner à un joueur l'avance sur les généraux (troupes au sol) et l'autre sur les amiraux (vaisseaux spatiaux) avec leurs propres tâches, c'est plus que jouer le même jeu avec plus de joueurs. Ce que nous n'avions pas vu en première instance, c'est que l'ordre est important dans le jeu en équipe. Cela signifie: d'abord les amiraux des deux parties (missions et batailles), puis les généraux. Cela donne au jeu encore plus de tactique et donc il est également nécessaire de consulter. Il est même vrai que je pense que le jeu d'équipe est aussi beau que 1 contre 1, contre mes attentes.
Dans l'ensemble, Star Wars Rebellion est un jeu où vous devez plonger pendant un moment, où vous devez prendre quelques heures et le thème devrait vous plaire. Secrètement, j'espère déjà une expansion avec de nouvelles missions et des personnages d'autres films, mais jusqu'à ce moment-là, je vais encore avoir assez de plaisir avec ce jeu de plateau épique. Est-ce que tout ce qui précède vous ressemble et êtes-vous fan de Star Wars? Ensuite, avec X-Wing, c'est le jeu de plateau ultime pour vous!

Nine year old me would be shocked and appalled at now year old me's absolute disinterest in Star Wars, having had my initial saw-it-in-1977 enthusiasm gradually beaten into submission. As with Lord of the Rings, Star Wars has almost become, instead of a tempting beacon, a giant red flag for me. Coupled with its asymmetric deploying troops and leaders and doing combats and such, I wasn't sure it would be a thing for me, but I wanted to give it a try.

And nope, it's not. I lost, as the Rebels, on turn two, after making a stupid error on where to put my base. It was enough, though, to confirm my fears.

Wargame mislabeled as thematic.  Adding names and miniatures/standies is simply not enough to convey a theme.  Dice rolling and random setup provide huge swings in the game.  It did not feel like anything to me more than mechanics with names attached.

An asymetrical wargame marketed as a storytelling game which it is not.

Doesnt work as a storytelling game

The war itself is diced out in a boring & bland mechanic so you have interesting choices building up in your mind and then the execution is just a big failure.

Doesnt work as a war game.

It works as a game with heavy fluff text use that gives you a thematic star wars vibe ingrained in a convoluted dysfunctional gameplay mess. It can build up nice storylines from time to time but if you are not a huge star wars fan there are just much better games out there.

RATING: 7
I really like how assymetric the Imperial and Rebel sides are. The Imperial has many more units but needs to find and destroy the Rebel base before time runs out and so need to sweep the galaxy quickly, whereas the Rebels can stall out the game and have more specific tasks via various objectives that can speed up the end of the game. I do wish the game was a little shorter for what it is, but it does give off a feel of a grand epic space hunt. The pseudo-action programming with the leaders is also pretty cool, and you can really counter your opponent's stuff if they don't add extra leaders to bolster. It also adds a layer of strategy via timing your actions so that you have multiple leaders in one location, thus having a higher chance of success. It is kind of annoying at end of game when you have like 8 leaders and need to boost everything to have a chance to do anything, but I like how the game weans you into having more options once you have an idea what you're doing. The actions themselves while having a bunch of repeats also seem to give a good amount of flexibility of how you can play (e.g. I played the Rebels, and I was mostly content to sit back, build up my forces, and snipe opportune objectives, but could have instead played a more risky strategy of trying to end the game quickly via trying to complete them en masse, and fishing for the ones I am close to finishing). My only main negative of this game is the fiddliness of the combat. Between the tactics cards (which are a good idea, but add more overhead), the possible multiple rounds of combat, the two types of damage/health, and ground/air, combat can take quite a while to resolve.

The Rebellion is at an disadvantage but always active applying guerrilla tactics.
One is never sure if an attack is just to pin units or to fulfill an objective, like the destruction of an star destroyer.
Rebell can feel tightening grip of the Empire. Didn't get a game straight yet. Always discovered some minore errors in play. Quite some occassions the rules are unclear and require some digging in the reference. Not sure that could have been improved in the development phase. 
In contrast to War of the rings the Rebellion player feels more active deploying key strikes against the overwhelming empire.

A little disappointed after my first play, as the game felt like it was progressing much too slowly. As many others have stated, combat is the low point in the game.  I realize things will get smoother with more plays, so I'm hopeful my enjoyment will increase over time.
Update: Apparently I enjoyed this more than I thought, as I keep reflecting on the game, and can't wait to get it to the table again.  Bumping score from 7 to 8.

RATING: 7.5
I had everything planned as the Rebel player... I had surprise deployment so I could take anything from my still hidden rebel base and make one last, desperate attack toward the Death Star, securing me two objectives and winning me the game. All the pieces in place, everything I had at my disposal versus the most terrifying force known to the galaxy, it was all riding on this... Then I rolled straight blanks and my army was wiped...

Mediocre combat aside, i actually really did enjoy my time with Rebellion, as the rebel player I was legitimately feeling incredibly anxious and stressed out due to plans simply not going my way. I did end up winning right as the Empire figured out where I was, which was the perfect timing for a dramatic conclusion to this four hour epic.

Other than the combat and the rather lackluster 4-player support I really did have a ton of fun and would love to play again.

This game brings the events from a New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi to life.  It can be played 2 or 4 player.  It is really a two player game though.  One player plays the Rebellion and hides the rebel base and wins if the turn count and the mission markers meet on a track.  The empire wins if ground forces are in the Rebel base at the end of the turn.  The Rebels seem to have an advantage for inexperienced players.  

Players either play missions or move troops.  Also, they build new units and gain information about Rebel base locations.  

Many of the events and missions come from the movies.  I really like the game and will play it any chance I get.  It has been called "Star Wars of the Ring".  And I can see the comparison, due to the asymmetry of play, but in general, War of the Ring is a better game. However, this is excellent.

RATING: 3
Wow, I was not expecting to dislike this game so much. I find it very boring and way too long for what it has to offer.

I find the core mechanic of the game not very engaging or interesting. It consists of assigning your leaders/heroes to missions, rolling dice according to your leader's skill level and checking whether you succeed or not. While I am ok with this mechanic in games like Eldrich Horror or Runebound, I very much dislike it here. While this mechanic adds to the feel of adventure and exploration in the former mentioned games, to me it feels misplaced in Star Wars; Rebellion, which at least claims to be a somewhat tactical game. The majority of the game consists of flipping cards and rolling dice. It is not that entertaining and highly random, too. And there are no (or close to no) mechanics that offer you any methods of mitigating that randomness either, like character development/leveling or items or anything of that kind.

The other part of the game looks like a typical area control war game, but it really is not one. You have a bunch of cool looking miniatures, but the game does not play like a miniature war game. The rebel side is hopelessly outnumbered, which makes thematic sense and all, but it feels a little frustrating as the rebel player to be outmatched like this. And on the other side it feels very unsatisfying to fight the rebels as the imperial player, since they are much weaker. On top of it all, the combat system is extremely fiddly. This is especially annoying, considering how little tactical choices you have during combat, if any (and you will hear this complaint even from fans of this game). 

I was surprised that there are no upgrades for your units and that your leaders don't improve in any way (with one exception being Luke who might become a Jedi). In other words, there is no mechanic in this game that allows you to individualize your faction, not even a tiny bit.

I also dislike the fact that you have no choice when to build or what to build. Every two rounds, the building phase triggers and you can only build units, that your loyal or subjugated planets provide. This is one more missed opportunity to individualize your play-style. What if you prefer building more ground units instead of Space units? Well sorry, the game does not allow you to make that decision.

Another point I want to mention is the replayability. After 2 or 3 sessions of this game, you will have seen most or even all of the objective and mission cards. Once you have seen them all, the flavor of the theme gets dull, too. The above mentioned mechanics, boring as they are, will then not even offer any appealing theme or surprises anymore. Also, the board is not randomly set up like in comparable space games, which is another point that lowers the replayability of this game.

Considering how few interesting mechanics this game offers, it plays WAY TOO LONG, too. If it was over after an hour our so, I would be somewhat ok with it (though it would still be a boring game). But flipping cards and rolling dice for 2 to 4 hours is pretty dull and boring.

Bottom line is, for a 3-5 hours game, which kind of wants to be a tactical game, it offers almost no meaningful or interesting decisions or game play options. it is highly restrictive in almost every mechanic. and the only thing it may have going for it is the theme which will be exhausted after 2-3 plays. I mean, how often will it be interesting to capture han solo?

I am puzzled how this game managed to climb up this high in the ratings, but than again it says Star Wars on the box.

After so many disappointments, it seems Corey Koniecka has finally managed to produce a decent game, one that does not rely on endless repetitive dierolling. Even though it relies on constant cardpulls from seven card decks...

The figures are of course nice. Love the little X-Wings and Y-Wings. Black stormtroopers and Star Destroyers are inappropriate though. Come on...

Seems like im the only one i know who doesnt like this game. The production of the game and the feel of the the game are great but the game play just doesnt do it for me.
Alot of the Rebel objectives are military based and with the empire having the overwleming military advantage and the fact they can easily capture one of your leaders just makes this game too unbalanced - Played 4 or 5 times each time the empire won. Each play seemed very samey - Will probably sell this game and put it towards something id play and enjoy more

I was really hoping I could play this 2-player game with my son or wife, but its exceptionally long and they both couldn't finish it. With the base game you tend to play the same card a lot (each side has a group of missions that they can play each turn, and you end up playing these a lot of times). I really like the game but cant rate it higher due to these issues.

Great 2-player strategy game. Not quite a war game but very close. It's really worker placement with BoD combat and Twilight Struggle style CDG "gotchas". Highly thematic as well. My only criticism is that the tactics cards are a disaster and should be totally reworked.

+Fantastic game.  Veteran of Star Wars: Rebellion, the PC game of yore, here.

RATING: 7
in comparision to war of the ring it feels less like a story which is emerging while you play but more like a collection of story-quotations. also it feels more clumsy and "interrupted" because of a lot of smaller steps and stuff to do which are not really developing thematic mechanics. immersion and connection to what is going on on the board seem to be secondary to me. at the end of the day it is a very ff-ish game with a lot of (often unnecessary) cards and dice. it's a game which tries to keep you busy to detract from what it is actually missing: thematic mechanics which make the game fun and interesting at the same time. apart from that: a good game, especially for star wars-fans. but not epic nor excelling in anything gamewise. I'll play it each Christmas when I am hungry for Star Wars.

Excellent 2-player Star Wars experience. When reviews say it's "Star Wars in a box," they're not exaggerating. Gameplay is rife with strategic and tactical decisions and the amount of content is staggering. I really like the use of "hero" units like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader to accomplish or challenge missions and how those mission benefits combo with other in-game mechanisms. The fact that it's 2-player and takes a few hours really limits opportunities to play it though, and it rarely hits the table. When it does though, it's fantastic!

Combines things I love about Risk, Fury of Dracula, and Blood Rage. Truly excellent title. That being said it won't be for everyone. Large play time investment and uneven play will alienate some players. For example, some play can be tense and "edge of your seat" for the rebels as they nervously watch the hunt move past them hoping it doesn't come to their base, and that same play can be tedious for the Empire feeling as though they have reached a dead end and having upwards of an hour go by without seeing any results sometimes. I still stand by it being an incredible game and as such my rating, but you should know going in that it just flat out won't appeal to everyone. For those who it does, it's the Star Wars game of your dreams.

Rating will probably go up after a few more plays. The game tells surprisingly well the greater story behind the story of the original trilogy of Star Wars. If I may say so it's the History of Star Wars in a game. 

Great implementation of the theme with an unexpectedly streamlined and easy gameplay but not at the expense of both strategic and tactical choices.

RATING: 8.5
Great card-driven asymmetric area-control game which requires some patience to get used to be mostly inferior in military terms when you play as the rebel. And quite unsettling if you are the military powerhouse on the other side that does not come good through despite of that, because the rebels use their power of influencing the people. Great and very thematic thats is grounded on the usual very good component quality of Fantasy Flight.

RATING: 9
Ok.  It's another Corey Koniezca game, and to be honest, the mechanics feel a [i]lot[/i] like Runewars in space.  But that is not a bad thing, because Runewars is amazing!  (Original Runewars, not the new Runewars miniatures game.)  There's always a lot going on and you'll never have as many actions as you'd like to take.   Tough decisions every round.   It does deviate from Runewars in that the powers and victory conditions are asymmetrical, and boy, do they perfectly capture the feeling of Star Wars.  This game is So Much Fun you barely notice 3-4 hrs flying by.  

Now, that said, it's not perfect.  It takes a couple reads of the rules, and inevitably some searching online for a FAQ and unclear interactions, to really have a solid grasp of everything.  (Same downside as many FFG games, like Runewars or BSG or AGOT (2d ed) or the GOT card game.)  It's always frustrating to get bogged down in minutiae when you're trying to focus on the overall flow of the game.  The minutiae can be terribly important, so you have to.  Yes, it makes the first couple games tough (so get someone who knows it inside and out to teach you, if possible!).

Overall, I love it.  Have only played 3 games but I'm hoping we'll see much more play.

I like the Star Wars theme. The game play is engrossing and there is plenty of scope for varied tactics and strategies. Learning curve is a bit steep to begin with, but don't worry too much if your first game goes awry because you may have missed a cardinal rule. You won't care, you'll be having too much fun. And your subsequent games will be memorable! Be prepared for a long session, it does take time to play. But you won't notice the time passing.

Recommended for 2-player or Star Wars or Themed (covers many bases)

After 2 more 2P - the play is great right up until the game ending combat.  2 hours of strategy with 2 minutes of dice chucking.  Might as well flip a coin.  The end is SOOOOOO anti-climatic.  With an interesting combat system this would be a classic for me, as it is, it is one of those 'what could have been' games.

This game perfectly captures the feeling of the original Trilogy. It's not an area control game per-say, however gaining an holding territory is needed for goals and advancement. It's more like a PvP hidden movement game, where the Empire attempts to locate and destroy the Rebels (before they can gain to much glory, or run away). 

Gameplay lasts only 7-9 rounds, but playtime is in the 3-4 hours. The central aspect of each round is playing "mission" cards to get better control of systems, learn information, or advance the game clock. Dice are central, but its strongly mitigated by leaders abilities or cleaver misdirection. Besides time, the downside is combat, which is clunky and feels removed from the theme of the game. Combat is fixed with the expansion.

Rating based on a single play as Rebels.

FUN:  it's genuinely exciting to elude the ever growing fleet of the Imperial player and snatch up minor victories under his nose. 

UNIQUE: captures a lot (heroes, missions, politics, warfare in multiple theaters and asymmetric gameplay) in a very sensible rulesset and still feels epic.

NEGATIVES: the game is long. The combat feels slightly off. Either it should be just the dice or lean more on the cards.

This is easily the most overrated game I own. It's a fine wargame on it's own right, but it's an hour or two too long for what it is. 

Because of the Rebel's objective throughout the game, it feels more like a "wait it out" than a "bring down the Empire" kind of story.

As with most Fantasy Flight games, I want to love it. Has everything I should love in a game, especially asymmetry and the Star Wars theme, but man, mechanically is this game dull.

A tense game and I'm sure it would play very differently for both sides.  Combat is rather ordinary / predicatable with the attacker usually handing out a beating unless they are a much smaller force.

Great production values, deep game play.  A good game that I'd probably rate higher with future plays.  Prefer war of the ring for a long 2 player assymetrical game with theme.  I think there are more options for the rebel (fellowship) side to win, and more interesting choices in war for the ring

Thoroughly tense and enjoyable asymmetric area control game.

Absolutely one of the best Star Wars games ever made, it does an incredible job of capturing the feel of the movies while letting you rewrite events in order to lead your side to victory. The totally asymmetrical design means playing each side is a completely different challenge but both are fun in their own way. The only real downside is the combat can feel a little clunky and slows down the pace of the game a bit, but it's a small price to pay for such a great overall experience.

I really like this game. The only downside for me is the long time it takes to play. The beautiful thing is, that AP is also calculated in the time. Truly a game that fits me (I also really like Star Wars).

I played it with a friend who isn't so much into Star Wars (we didn't even talk about it, we just played the game) and he liked it and wanted to play it at least one time more (he was imperial, I believe he wanted to try the rebels with the next game). So the game is suitable for players who don't like or don't know Star Wars all that well.

The game works perfect online (with help of Vassal en BGG), so you can save and continue the game almost in your own time (and don't need to take the 3-4 hours immediately). I'll wait for my first PBF to end before I comment on the 4-player online... :)

Edit: played a couple of games PBF-style. And 2 of them were 4 player. I love the 3-4 player teamplay of this game. Especially the planning gets another dimension: you can make 2 actions in a row, but you also need to watch what leader goes where, otherwise your plans will fail.

Love the game and upped the rating!

Successfully evokes the atmosphere of the original Star Wars trilogy. I enjoy the mechanics of using leaders to play missions or move units. (The latter is reminiscent of Twilight Imperium III to me.)

I am not all that convinced that the game is balanced. As the rebel player, one needs to be extremely cautious about not getting leaders captured in the first half because it costs an action per turn and because the follow-up missions for the Imperium are very strong (some more or less force to reveal the location of the basis).

The fighting system is rather boring. Especially the cards are annoying because very often one does not have the required die symbol to use them. Also, there will be few battles that are not predetermined.

I've heard this game on several occasions be called "Star Wars in a box" and it really is. There are many moments in the game both big and small that feel as though you are playing out your own eerily familiar story that just seems that little bit off.

In my last game Boba Fett and Darth Vader caught Han Solo on Sullust and when Leia came to save him the trap was sprung and she was taken before the Emperor in an attempt to turn her to the Dark Side but she refused to turn and escaped, Little did we know that Luke was headed to Dagobah to complete his training. Shortly after Admiral Ackbar lead an assault on the Death Star as it hung above Malastare with the entire fleet being wiped out expect three small Y-Wings one of which tool that fateful shot to take down the Death Star. The Empire would not give up however and had narrowed down the Rebel Base's location and an evacuation was called, saving their skin in the nick of time.

In terms of the mechanisms they are actually fairly simple but the depth comes in the choices you make, what missions you send your team on, where do you allocate your resources. One hint though. If you are the Empire and want to win "don't get cocky" because you may get all caught up in the fun of your huge fleet and destroying your enemy while they tick down that timer to victory, hidden away.

This is War of the Ring but for the Star Wars franchise

Except my only gripe (as with WotR) is that the outcome of battle being decided on dice... I hate dice...

Still, an epic (ong) game that really captures the tension between the Rebels hiding out and trying to turn more systems to their cause, and the Empire ruthlessly hunting down the Rebels and trying to destroy them wherever possible

Great game and will definitely play again, but wouldn't want to own it...

A deep and engaging strategy game. Not for newer gamers. The gameplay is long. Most of my games have taken around 4 hours so if you don't like games to be long you won't like this one. But the theme is very well executed. The tension is high and, for an asymmetric game, the game is so well balanced.

Ignore the face it says 2-4 players. It's a two player game. the 4 player version isn't very good.

RATING: 9.9
I knew I was predisposed to like this one with plenty of high quality miniatures (and other superb components, much as you'd expect from any Fantasy Flight Games game these days), asymmetrical conflict, interesting game play and an epic theme.

My first play was not a disappointment. I was the imperials trying to track the rebel (scum) throughout the galaxy and destroy their hidden base. I had an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces but my opponents were wily - hard to find and difficult to engage as they prefer hit-and-run attacks to stand-up slug fests, though occasionally they can be engaged in a conventional manner. As the game progressed, I had narrowed my search to five planets, but the rebel (scum) has managed to quietly achieve a number of their secret objectives cutting down he time I had left. The game climaxed in an epic battle bot on the surface and in the space surrounding the recently-relocated rebel base. My attack was hampered by their commando squads who destroyed our walkers before they could be deployed. This, and some truly lousy work by my stormtroopers, lost us the surface battle even as the sky was alight with burning rebel ships. Jedi Luke Skywalker saw his chance and killed the emperor toppling the Empire and bringing in a new era of peace. Very epic and very true to the ethos of the films.

I really liked the way the game played, plenty of decisions to be made around allocating priorities, assigning leaders and deploying forces. The leader mechanic is particularly entertaining. All of this leads me to conclude there is plenty of replayability in what I am sure will become a classic.

I had very little hesitation in picking this up from a local FOLGS and have every confidence this will get plenty of use for years to come.

Highly recommended.

Still in honeymoon period, so rating might drop after a few months...

could not recommend it enough! I will always play this when I have the chance. 

I prefer the 2 player setup right now - we played one match with 3 players and not only was the game much longer, but the 4 player setup seemed sort of artificial to us. It's still a great game, but 2 player runs a bit more smoothly.

When you play this, don't focus on conquering the whole galaxy. Empire needs to find the rebels, rebels need to gather sympathy.

Perfect fit for 2 player game (well made by designers). Enjoyable game mechanics with lot of atmosphere.Playing this game you are writing a story. But, imho, playing time could be shorter and replayability is not on high level, because the strategy of both sides is every time similar (of course, there is a lot of events/task etc. that made every game little different, but the core gameplay is similar). I could recommend it to players, who are fan of Star Wars and want to play an epic game once a month.

Enjoying this game more with each play. The one glaring flaw for me at this point is how weighted the game is in favor of the Imperials. I've only seen the Rebels win once. Even with novices, it seems like the Imperial player has stumbled their way into accidentally winning on multiple occasions. Aside from that, this really is the best Star Wars game on the market. The leader-driven system is very interesting, and I love how you're constantly having to balance missions and troop movement. I'd really love to see this system used in the Game of Thrones universe.

RATING: 10
Amazing game.  I think the references to Twilight Struggle are appropriate.  This game provides 3 - 4 hours of strategic tension from the get go.  Players have a hand of cards, and each play is a small piece of an unfolding cat-and-mouse on the part of both players.  Just as with Twilight Struggle, hands have to be carefully managed.  Important missions need to be couched in such a way that the opposing player can not appropriately counter them. Like a game of hearts, how a player structures their turn is incredibly important. But regardless of one's best laid plans, the other player will, on occasion, have a play that "wins them" that turn.  A leader is captured and turned to the dark side.  A fighter survives and with a card drop, takes out the Death Star.  With multiple plays, the cards become more familiar, especially those that recur and serve to define the playing style of one side or the other.  But this only deepens the strategic weight - reactions become anticipatory precautions.  Still, given the random draw of cards, sometimes you lose a turn, look at the upcoming turn, and think, "Oh crap, how am I going to get through this one?"  These are experiences very reminiscent of Twilight Struggle.

But the game is not simply Twilight Struggle in space.  It is very much a Star Wars game.  And the reason for this is that the game VERY COOLY focuses on characters.  The most important element of the game -- what players spend most of their time doing -- is assigning characters to missions.  Really, this is just an action selection mechanic, albeit one that is somewhat fluid, but which also wonderfully references the fictional Star Wars universe.  It's not a meeple assigned to "infiltrate" or "sabotage," it is Leah or Chewie.  And further, Leah or Chewie is selected because their abilities make them a slightly better choice for that action than any of the other characters.  So, on any turn each player is assigning a stable of characters to a set of actions that thematically create and reference the StarWars storyline.  Additionally, a few of these characters will become the "stars" of a single game play's unique story.  The reason for this is that in addition to action selection, each player has a few cards that provide a one-off special ability for a character.  There is a modicum of choice about which characters will have this focus, but only just.  So, at a crucial point in the game, it is Wedge who suddenly blows up the Death Star, or Chewie who returns to his home planet to lead an uprising against the Empire garrison.  What I find interesting about this mechanic is that it takes the character-focus of the game, and makes it cinematic.  Players leave the game recalling the memory of how in *that* game, Luke was captured and turned to the dark side.  In *that* game Admiral Ackbar enabled a carnage on both sides of a battle that weakened the Empire just enough to save the Rebel base.

It's for this reason that I also don't mind the combat mechanics.  I've read reviews that assert that the combat mechanics bog down what is an otherwise slick game.  I initially felt that way, too, and it's true, the only weakness of the game for me is the iconography on the dice (it is not intuitive).  True, the combat *does* jerk the rest of the game to a different "place."  Most of the the game consists of "across the universe cat and mouse" with the ominous movement and counter-movement of military forces that gather like storm clouds...and then a battle brings in overly particular elements like dice, choices of ships hit, random card draws, etc.  The thing is, though, I've come to find this to be a very cinematic experience.  It's as if there is a movie that cuts between the goings on on this planet, and the character encounters on *that* planet...but when a big space battle occurs, time contracts to "real time."  There is a bit of tactics, but mostly an actual battle is luck with the strategic deployment being vastly more important.  So, my advice is appreciate the battles as a cinematic moment.  You might get lucky and win, you might get unlucky and lose...but *mostly* whether you win or lose the game is going to come down to strategic selection of actions across multiple turns.

One last comment on the game, I've played other FFG 'IP' games - Battlestar Galactica, War of the Ring, Game of Thrones, etc. As a company, they are pretty good, I think, at deconstructing narratives into games.  That said, many of their other attempts have struck me as fiddly.  The game will contain mechanics that don't flow or are gamist - clunky attempts to reference the features of a story line.  In my opinion Star Wars: Rebellion is the best 'IP' game that FFG has produced.  When it gets down to it, the rules are dirt simple: assign actions (missions), resolve one at a time, refresh.  Any complications are pushed out to a few decks of very clearly worded cards.  There is no need to know the ins and outs of everything on the first play. Just look at your current hand, and wait to learn about additional possibilities when they show up. Also, the board does a great job of providing relevant information (this planet produces x&y which get placed on build queue 2.  Very, very smartly designed system.
  
So the game play is fantastic, and it is a wonderful narrative system.  But what about StarWars?  I'm not a StarWars "fanboy." I don't own the movies; I did not collect the cards (the blue series, orange series, etc. that came in packs of gum); I haven't read a single book or comic; I didn't ever have a Hans figure... but I have friends that did all of this.  And I do love the shared fandom of StarwWars.  I love seeing folks dressed up as Storm Troopers at cons, just like I love that someone took the time to create a single 2-hour movie from the 3 prequels.  I totally get that passionate attachment to a narrative - its possibilities, its familiarity, its sense of participatory, creation.  Like I say, though, StarWars was never quite my thing, even though I will never forget the first time that I saw the original film when it was released back in '77.  And the characters are deeply embedded in the sinews of my cultural body, probably in a way that is similar for Harry Potter to the millennial generation.  So regardless of whether I approach the game as a fan or not, I can't escape the cultural and identity laden vibrations that surround it.  *This* game reignited the feelings of wonder that I experienced when I first saw the original films so many years ago.  It managed to clear out the dreck of branded Happy Meals, branded thermoses, and other cheapening crap.  All in all a fantastic achievement.

Own Rise of the Empire
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One side is the Galactic Empire, the other side are the Rebels. The Empire has to find the rebel base and occupy it, while the Rebels need to acquire reputation to prevent the Empire from winning. Each side has leaders which allow you to move, attack and undergo missions. 

Combat takes place in space and on the ground. You roll dice to get hits and cards are used to supplement the combat. 

It's a fun, thematic game. There is luck with the dice, and it can be a bit longish. But the tension in having the Empire discover the rebel base, then try to bring their forces to bear is a worthwhile experience. There are a few different things you can try. It will be interesting to see if future games are filled with this tension.

This is star wars in a box.

Theme and mechanics mix superbly but combats are a pain and don't scale well. We never had any fun with the final combats, they aren't tense, they don't offer interresting choices and it's just very clunky with all the dice, ships and ground units of two factions. Everything else is designed well. 

EDIT: After 6 or 7 games with the same opponent the game finally starts to shine. Only complaint I'd like to add is the time it needs to be played. I'd play it much more frequently if it was 30-60 minutes shorter.

Just not a game for me... I think it has some clever design choices (the assigning of leaders) pushed up against some terrible ones (dice + card combat), and while I prefer this to the game it most readily recalls (Twilight Struggle), that's not saying much. Too long by half, saddled with a theme that I feel no personal investment in, and ultimately a lot of chrome obscuring a thin amount of bluffing, luck, and convoluted cardplay. There are simply better ways for me to spend my time than this.

It was good, but I could have easily played other shorter, more enjoyable games in my collection.  However, for a Star Wars fan (I'm a casual fan) that also happens to enjoy thematic games, I can see why they would fall in love with it.

A really cool hide-and-seek game, disguised as a war game. ...in Star Wars environment!!! The battles are a necessary part of the game, but not the best. They remind me a little of RISK Europe (only slightly better). And the tactic cards doesn't add anything. It's the Empire's search for the rebel base, and the uneven distribution of foreces that builds up the tension the closer you get to the end. Playing the Rebells you are really hanging on the ropes the last rounds. Will you be saved by the bell? That's what makes this game really awsome.

Dripping with theme, I find this to be a fascinating strategy game that creates tense confrontations as one side seeks to ellude the grasping imperial tentacles. Battle is a touch clunky and longwinded, only occasionally generating the drama and excitement of a closely fought conflict.

Schöne spielerische Umsetzung von StarWars nach Art des Ringkriegs (auch in Bezug auf die Dauer einer Partie) im Wesentlichen als Zwei-Spieler-Duell. Das Material weiss auf alle Fälle zu begeistern und der Touch der Filme wird gut abgebildet. Für den Rebellenspieler etsteht aus meiner Sicht etwas zu viel Zeitspiel; die sonstigen Möglichkeiten sind arg begrenzt. Der Imperiumsspieler hat es da etwas einfacher und insgesamt mehr Möglichkeiten.

If you want 2-player game and you have 3-4 hours to spend - this is the game. I'm not fan of Star Wars but you can see that theme is really strong in this game. Excellent miniature quality as well as other components.

When I heard about Star Wars: Rebellion I thought, 'I've already played that, it was a PC game in the late 90s'. I liked the PC game, in fact I miss playing it, as not even Good Old Games has a fully playable port of the original. I was intrigued, would this board game play like the PC original?

Yes, yes it does. Fantasy Flight didn't create a new board game so much as successfully port a video game to board game format. The basic gameplay is identical. They simplified the units, unit production, space battles, and trimmed down the character and unit variety, but the core game I loved is still there, now in versus mode!.

I predict FFG will release the trimmed Expanded Universe characters and some other ship types in a future expansion, as they're known for that, and for once I don't see it as just a cash grab, the trims were made to simplify play while not removing many elements from the original trilogy that fans would miss.

SW:R is still a long game, epic in scope, on par I'd say with War Of The Ring. The events of the original Star Wars trilogy are able to be recreated to nostalgic effect and fun.

There is a real lack of interesting Rebel missions to attempt, especially when compared with the amount of neat things the Empire player can do.

I bought this game because of a super sale, not really thinking I'd find anyone to play it with especially my SO. Lo and behold I got him to play and it turned out he loved it! We played 4 games over 2 weeks. Definitely enjoy it, but there are some limitations that keep it from a higher rating from me personally:

1. It can be a bit of a bear to set up. So it's not a game I want to pull out all the time. Typically, a single game can span several after-work evenings, so playing it is really a commitment over several days.

2. For players on the more casual side I think it's really hard for the Imperial player to win. I played rebels pretty poorly in some instances and still managed to win.

3. Some cards, once played are easy for the opponent to avoid in subsequent games, rendering them useless. For example, there is an action card for Obi Wan that if captured I can remove him and gain reputation. My opponent now knows to never capture Obi Wan.

Typical Fantasy Flight game where the critical details are mentioned once and difficult to find. I've played twice now and have gotten many rules wrong. How can you ever teach this game, if there are so many rules not stated anywhere that are easy to find. For example, max 5 dice for combat, max 10 dice for skill checks, only draw cards for one leader for each battle, rebel system vs system with rebel loyalty. Love the story elements, love the minis, love the bluffing. Also, if I pay a hundred bucks for a game, you can print all of the cards at full size. Dropping to a 7.

RATING: 9
This is about as good as Star Wars games get.  I love the tension created by both sides as the empire tries to find the rebel base while the rebels just try to last as long as they can using sabotage and garnering loyalty from other systems.  Love the minis and the overall pace and tug of war mechanics.  Solid, solid, solid!

Gran bel gioco, soprattutto per gli amanti di Star Wars. Il gioco si incastra perfettamente su un meccanismo fluido, ma non semplice, e ha il pregio di riuscire ad essere abbastanza aderente all'ambientazione. Il gioco rende meglio in 2 giocatori dove un giocatore interpreterà l'impero in costante ricerca di dove si sia nascosta la Ribellione nel tentativo di distruggerla. La Ribellione invece cercherà di risolvere i propri obiettivi personali e resistere contro i più potenti e organizzati nemici. All'interno tanti piccoli obiettivi come attirare al lato oscuro Luke da parte dell'Imperatore o provare a distruggere la Morte Nera con i caccia della ribellione. Un gioco ruffiano che farà però la gioia degli amanti della saga. Il tutto con miniature e materiali adeguati.

A fantastic orgy of miniatures, strategy, and space opera drama! There are a plethora of mechanics that intertwine, but players adapt the roles of the sides they choose with Rebels acting like rogues and the Imperial player performing pompous acts with massive displays of force. There is a twitch of delight the first time someone utters the phrase about a certain, "fully armed and operational battle station."

This is a long game with a lot of mechanics. I haven't had a game under 3 hours, yet. Expect to read the rules, then find the official FFG rule clarifications, and then play a few rounds to hone the gameplay. After three or four games, the setup and turn-based action do achieve a certain flow.

RATING: 9
A nearly flawless 2-4 player thematic recreation of the original Star Wars trilogy that rests on the shoulders of tightly designed mechanics which reward careful forethought and planning while still allowing enough randomness to make combat and the undertaking of critical missions feel exciting and not scripted.

There is never a boring or dry turn, with every action you take needing to be seriously considered against the myriad (but not overwhelming) number of options available to you every round.

The only minor criticisms I can level against the game are: 1) Large-scale combat tends to drag a bit and be overly fiddly due to the combination of rolling dice and drawing/playing cards. 2) The game is very long, generally clocking in at 5+ hours, despite the box claiming it is a 3-4 hour game.

The ultimate gaming experience for me. Now I can't enjoy any other game as much as before because none of them are closely as good as this one.

Probably wouldn't enjoy it as much if it had a different theme or if I was not a Star Wars fan, but it still is a solid two player game. Can't wait for expansions

Edit:  The main criticism the game gets is its combat system, but it not bad at all. Is good, actually, but as the game is great, maybe "good" doens't feel as good. You can make decisions with the tactic cards that will end up defining lots of things, like, for example, you let a capital ship be destroyed to save some fighters, knowing that you will be able to use those fighters later to destroy the death star that is getting closer and closer, even though in the moment it may seem like a bad idea.

I've played 5 times now, and the replay value is great too. Once you know what kind of cards can appear in the game, you can shape your strategy in ways you couldn't have ever thought before, and your opponent can do things that will have a purpose in the future because he knows that at some point they will. This can make it even more fun than the first couple of times you play it

Asymmetry is always valued in a balanced game. Can't speak to the overall balance, but can speak to the really nice decision matrix the game provides. It has an eerie sense of LotR LCG. There, leaders choose to quest, defend, or attack. Here your leaders quest (do a mission), trigger a move/attack, or hang back to defend. This similarity is a good thing - it's driven 500+ games of the LCG. It makes for continual hard and interesting decisions. These are influenced by how much energy you're putting into your strategic vs tactical imperatives, and there are different strategies to employ which will certainly engender replay. I also like how the space/ground theatres in combat drives what systems you want to "colonise" so as to build the units you want and when you want them. And the components are top class, as you'd expect from FFG. All good stuff, and looking forward to more play.

Great game! Really enjoyed playing this. So far only one game with the Empire and it's nice to see the Empire's conveyor belt unit production and how quickly the Empire gets units onto the board. I like the system for the characters as well. Missions really make the game interesting and add an element of tension as players try to decide whether they want to use their leaders to oppose missions or to activate fleets. I suppose the Rebel will use more leaders for Missions whereas the Empire needs to expand quickly in search for the Rebel Base.

Excellent game that's close to War of the Ring (but not quite there).

Very thematic and fun, but battles drag on and make an already extremely long game even longer. Took us two days, 4 hours a day, to finish the first game. A lot of nitpicky rules that need to be processed. Probably gets one more play and then sold. Also a table hog. Tried a variant to shorten the game by 7 turns but was still too long. Ending is boring. Die roll decides if you win or lose. Set up is excruciating and the thought of that work, and the time involved, keeps it from being played.

I absolutely love this game.  For me it captures the Star Wars universe and makes me feel as if I am rewriting the original trilogy! There are only two negatives for this game IMO, but they are not significant enough to affect my rating.  I will list them just in case they could be a deal breaker for others. One is the games length.  I have not played a game in under three hours, but I enjoy it so much that doesn't matter to me. The second negative is closer to the end of the game when the fleet is large combat is kind of slow and tedious.  Totally avoidable if you just blow up the base with the death egg! LOL

I played it once so far, and I immediately felt it was a Star Wars clone of War of the Ring, a massive Lord of the Rings game that I've played several times, and while fun is mostly a trial for the good guys to HOPE they can win, but usually don't.  And while in my one game we did actually win it was more from sheer luck and amazing draws/rolls than anything else, and only did it on the last possible turn.

Very well done in capturing the flavor of the original trilogy. Major plot points available as missions played through cards.

Combat seems crap.

Combination of long, 2 player, and Star Wars makes it unlikely to be played a lot. Definitely think I would get War of the Ring before this, and even that is sketch. Maybe something to get when the boys get older, if they get into Star Wars.

Long play time but very engaging and fun as you have opportunities to do things even when it isn't your turn.

Highly recommended.

Could use a player aid sheet though.

Played my first game against my son. I played as the Alliance, with the basic rules. It was really tough to play as the Alliance. You just have to slow down the Empire, but you are basically just using speed bumps. All Alliance Objectives cards required me to attempt something that was difficult. Most Alliance missions require "attempts" which can be opposed by the other player, whereas the Empire's mission are "resolve" types (automatic success). The Empire's army is massive, and the Empire produces strong units regularly. The Alliance doesn't get much, and the units are weaker. I got destroyed in all battles I have attempted. It wasn't very fun playing as the Alliance. Though my son enjoyed playing as the Empire. The game looks great though. I just thought the game took forever to finish. I'm not sure how soon I want to play again....

Impressive looking and exciting asymmetric game. Tho' it has the semblance of a war game, it is essentially a worker placement game: the 'generals' are assigned for the actions that take or enable. In this game, the Rebels are completely outgunned and cannot hope to defeat the Empire militarily; what they have to do is survive to the end of the game (which they can try to hasten), while the Empire needs to find and take control of the Rebels' hidden base before they run out of time.

From all the Star Wars games that I have played (LCG, Imperial Assault...) this is by far the one that best captures the experience from Episodes IV, V and to a lesser extent VI. The asymmetric goals create a very thematic experience for both Imperials (where the f*#*#*# is the Rebel Base) and Rebels (this is hopeless...). Setup is a bit long, but once you get the gist of it you can have a game up and running in 10 minutes. Overall an excellent game.

(5+ plays)  Once you get into the Star Wars mindset, and pay attention to your characters, and imagine the story each character is playing out each mission - this starts to feel like the best questing game around.  Unlike countless hero questing wargame hybrids before it, every mission MATTERS, both on the battlefield, AND for the individual plot developments on which the hero character missions hang.  They've nailed this, and it's only a matter of time before some decent fantasy games finally achieve what this game has.  

The epic strategy and leader decision trade-offs make the core of the game fun and set up some dramatic events.  I think it was more fun to play the rebels.  My Imperial opponent commented that the strategy for him was pretty straight-forward, and he was just waiting for me to annoy with cards to frustrate his plans.  In some ways it did feel like that, where I was saving cards and planning out moves to destroy the Death Star and push forces back just as they were approaching the rebel base.  Is the inevitability of the Imperial conquest just as fun as the Rebel spoilers?  I'm not sure yet.  My first game was the dark side, and I've played 4 of 5 games as the Rebels.

I have mixed feelings about the combat system.  On the one hand, I've decided I really like the balance and results.  If you go into a battle well-prepared with a good leader, things are very likely to go well.  When you are fighting an important battle on which a mission or objective is tied, the combat is fun and dramatic.  The dice rolls and card play make sense, and concentrating fire (or not) seems a tactical battle decision that is thematic and works well.

However, it's particularly frustrating when you attack a location with an overwhelming force, and it takes three rounds of combat to destroy one X-wing.  There is a lot of bluff and double bluff going on in the game.  That one X-wing might take out a tie fighter or two or three.  And in certain systems, with certain conditions, that could make all the difference now or next turn.  More often, there are other systems where it doesn't matter at all.  BUT if I make that clear, and shorten the combat - I'm giving away some information.  Sooooo, even for the entirely meaningless battles, I play out the boring 5 minutes, because I am giving away information if I don't.

Overall, this is a personal favorite that I wish I could play over and over again.  Right now, it's not a 10 because I think an expansion or a second edition could improve a few things slightly (and that probably will happen).

The big box game many Star Wars fans have been waiting for. A truly epic game with phenomenal production value that you will be thinking about days after playing. Rebellion is more tactical than strategic and you have to be able to adapt. This is not a risk like game since the Rebellion military forces are primarily used to delay, feint and surgically strike not overwhelm. If you expect otherwise you will likely be disappointed. Don't waste your time with the intro game and jump into the advanced setup, you will not be disappointed.

Pros:
* I cannot say enough about the component quality.
* Destroying planets with the Death Star never gets old.
* Huge game board with a clean layout.
* Tons of miniatures.
* 4 players worked flawlessly.

Cons:
* Games can run long.
* Setup can take some time.

Only played one game, but that will probably be my only game ever.  I played the Empire and I liked the first 2/3 of the game where I had to sweep the area to find the rebel base. But when I found it, Wim simply played a card by whom he mysteriously disappeared. That gave me a big Fury of Dracula-feeling (a game I dislike a lot) for the same reason. You're building up an arc of tension and when that reaches his maximum ( aka finding what you're searching for), it suddenly drops to 0 without a blink. That gives me the feeling of having wasted 2 hours of my live.

Very good game. Quite easy rules, good mechanics, thematic, nice components.

Compared to Forbidden Stars, my favourite, but as 1vs1 player game which SW:R really is (3/4 player is a joke):
1. easier rules... (+) 2. ...but combat far less interesting and more random... (-) 3. ...but troop transport makes more sense and are intuinitve (+) 4. minifigures not as good as FS (-) 5. graphics - as above (-) 6. playtime - about equal 7. random factor - SW:R is far more random than FS 8. tension and fun - about equal

Theme and lore are very very subjetive, I like SW but prefer WH40K. SW:R also gives the feeling of much larger scale of operation - whole galaxy - meanwhile in FS you only fight in one part of it, and of course FS is more about combat, SW:R is more about mouse-and-cat game. Both are excellent games. I just won't buy mine as I already have FS and my buddy has Rebellion.

What a game!!! The crown of Ameritrash, a must for everyone who loves great games and liked the original trilogy! It has all, everything, it is complete. All characters are there, attempting missions, leading ships into battles. AT-ATs, AT-STs, Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, Super Star Destroyers and of course Death Stars (yes, plural!). 

A grand strategy cat & mouse game, with tactical battles and a phantastic deep theme - everything in this box is STAR WARS. Everything in this box is a truly "10" on the BGG rating scale. This game might be frikkin' expensive, but it is worth every cent. So much replay value, such a great game play!

This game is now one of my three desert island games, beside ASL and 1830.

A simply fantastic game. And not just because of the Star Wars theme which is very strong and well integrated--it surely helps but the game underneath is still very good in its own right. The hidden Rebel Base mechanic is great fun and the leader mechanics give the game a strong frame to work between as both sides have plenty of chances in this one. It is a massive box which takes a ton of table space and tells a great story in the Star Wars world. Haven't played the team game yet, and suspect this mostly will shine at just the 2 players, this is one of my favorite new games in 2016 and look forward to many more plays in the future. To anyone who is mildly interested in this, I suspect it will not disappoint.

This game definitely lives UP to the hype. Very much does. Don't let Polygon's article fool you... because they never played a single FFG game it seems like, or even a game outside of Catan it seems like. Anyway, the manual is actually very good and rarely ever had to go online to look up a rule once. 

Strong theme, strong gameplay, the tension is there.. you feel the imperial side dominance and the guerrilla tactics of the rebellion. The game is slightly hampered down by the very very clunky dice rolls but it isn't enough to stop this game from being very good on my list.

An excellent game for two players. At first glance, the game isn't balanced properly, but when you apply the playing style that is needed for your faction (e.g. Rebels fight guerilla style, Empire tries to fight big battles) the game feels really great! Both players have different strategies and mastering both will take some time. Playing time is a bit long, taking 3-4 hours for most games, excluding setup time.

Excellent epic two player strategy game. Certainly on one level with War of the Ring, for me actually a bit above.

Many say this, but it is true: SW Rebellion is Star Wars in a box. The theme is just excellently captured in this game. The card driven actions are very enjoyable and yield  a good combination of strategy and tactics. The asymmetry between Empire and Rebels is huge, but still it seems balanced to me. Combat rules are simple, which fits perfect for a game of such a greats scope. Components are very good (even though too much air in the box for my taste). 

I am of the rare breed that actually enjoy the combat. There is quite a bit of randomness with rolling dice and  drawing cards that may work  perfect or are currently useless. But for longer fights there is enough randomness to even out to some degree, but still has the chance to generate some drama. The card can be quite relevant and hence a leader that gives you two or three cards (while you opponent chooses not to send a leader) can have a significant effect. However, I am not into wargames and  may be not aware of battle systems that are much more engaging.

My biggest complaint is the box which could really be a bit flatter to require less shelf space.

This is an overall excellent asymmetric head to head strategy game. It takes quite a while to set up and tear down, with also a very long play time. However, the payoff will be worth it if you have the time to invest! With some tweaking to the combat system (I heard an expansion is doing just that!) I feel this would be a solid 10/10. Almost every game I've played has come down to one or two moves that were easily identifiable as game deciding when examined in hind sight; to me this is a great sign that choices matter.

RATING: 7
Impressive integration of Star Wars theme with engaging mechanics. Secret objectives, desperate missions, terror in the galaxy, heroic last stands,  all driven by characters from the movies. And it all hangs together in FFGs overwrought, shambolic manner. Of course there are eight decks of cards - I honestly believe FFG sends any designer of a big box game back to the drawing board if it doesn't feature at least eight decks of cards and 10 different kinds of tokens. 

But you knew that already. This is a game of card draws, dice pools, and hundreds of bits, calling to mind War of the Ring. However the scope of strategy isn't as narrow as that game. There's more going on across a more widely dispersed arena. 

Still, this isn't a game where you go back and think about how you would approach a problem differently next time, or employ a dramatically different strategy. The game, especially for the Rebellion, is going to be driven by your objectives, and often your course of action will be obvious. And if you don't draw the right missions or objectives... well, you just hang on desperately hoping that the card draw swing back in your favour. 

It's fun enough if played for the narrative experience generated - Leia sneaks into the Death Star to rescue Chewbacca! But I don't know that there's enough genuine game heft to warrant 3-4 hours, especially if the luck of the draw starves you of genuine options.

RATING: 10
So it got here.  And I've played three games with my family.

I love it.

I haven't rated it a 10 yet, because I need more plays to figure out if it's a ten.  It needs time for me to see if there are multiple layers of strategies and interesting interactions.  I think they're there, but I'm not 100% sure yet.  If it holds up to the test of time it's a 10 for sure.

But boy, it punches every one of my original trilogy buttons.  It's got epic battles.  It's got characters pulling underhanded stuff.  It's got Death Stars, and Death Star trench runs.  It's got that cat-and-mouse feel between the Empire and the Rebellion.

It's everything I could ever want from a Star Wars grand strategy game, in a terrific, beautiful package.  And there's all kinds of tension in the decision-making in the game system.

I'm looking for players for this one, and I'll play it anytime someone wants to come over and have fun with it.

Update, 1/3/17: Yep, it's a 10.  It's got replayability, too.  Everything about this one is so very well designed, and I don't feel like it lacks for anything.  It's tight, and there are strategies and counter-strategies.

And it's got a strong play-by-forum community here on the 'Geek, which is wonderful.  And it plays well in that format!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Art is supreme, the game pieces are top-notch, and the game is fun. The game does not lend itself to much replayability; it's the same thing every game (find the Rebel base), and so it becomes a bit routine after a while, but the game gets high marks for staying true to the original movie's story line. And, it is mercifully free of any of the stupid new Star Wars 'Force Awakens' retardation.

Meh. Too long for what it is. Battles are over complicated. The missions are fairly uninteresting.
--------------------------
Played again and came away with the same conclusions. Really don't see what the hype is about. It has some interesting ideas, but the execution is lacking. The tempo of the game is just all wrong. Military actions are too slow developing to be interesting. As the Empire, it does't feel like you're scouring the galaxy trying to find the Rebels. Since 75%+ of the missions are randomly drawn, single-use missions, player agency over the course of the game is minimized. It's all about figuring out how to do something with the missions you're dealt rather than to really set up something. Missions that reveal the vicinity of the Rebel base often also tip off the Rebel that you know, making a relocation of the base, if viable, obvious to both players. 

For a heavily thematic game, the narrative isn't there. It doesn't feel like a story is building. Characters appear where they're needed on that turn. There's no set up to them getting there. If I play a mission in system X, I know which of my opponent's leaders might appear there and because the choice is made to respond after seeing the mission, the narrative link of the opposing player having to choose before hand and thus creating some sort of story as to why the character is there is completely absent.

The things that both players might actually want to talk about to build the narrative are the things that are secret/hidden and can't be disclosed. If the Empire gets close to the base, the players cannot discuss to create any narrative. Missions are either an immediate success or failure, so they have no story arc. In certain limited circumstances you can chain multiple missions together to create some semblance of a story arc, but those are the exception rather than the rule and are generally unsatisfying anyway. Ultimately the mission resolution mechanic is completely flavorless:   each player counts a type of icon on their characters, rolls that many dice, and then counts the successes. Rinse and repeat for the rest. One mission feels exactly like every other. There's nothing to make me feel like I'm actually executing the different mission types. 

The core of the problem is that leaders magically appear wherever and resolve their mission. If, for example, you had to put a rebel leader on a ship and get him or her to the necessary location to even attempt the mission, then it might be interesting. You could have small rebel fleets passing through Imperial controlled systems with detection checks or something to see if the Rebels are discovered. It also seems like it needs some sort of baseline to roll against. Auto successes are boring. The two players' leaders that are committed should modify the baseline chance, but there should always be a chance of failure. Missions should not be randomly drawn but always available to the player to choose from. The more difficult missions should have prerequisites. Make the player complete several missions that leads to completing some big objective. For example, you could have some sort of Rebel spying mission that has a chance of recovering the death star plans, once the rebel player gets the plans, then they'd have to work to set up the conditions to exploit the weakness, then they'd finally be able to attempt to destroy it. By giving the player agency in actually achieving it instead of it being a matter of opportunity, the narrative is slowly built and its final destruction would be much more satisfying.

Great game that really encapsulates the feel of the struggle in the movies. Yes the militaries are unbalanced, but that's the point. I love that both sides have a totally different feel. Only knock is the playing time is usually 3.5-4 hours. Every time I've played though, it really did feel epic and victories were savored while losses really stung.

-kompetitiv 2 bzw. 4 Spieler
-sehr thematisch
-lange Spieldauer (kann in den ersten Spielen sogar extrem lange sein - mehr als 5h)

Ich habe es bisher zweimal in der 2-Spieler-Variante gespielt.
Aufgrund der vielen Figuren ein absoluter Hingucker und quasi ein Muss für alle Star-Wars-Fans die gerne Strategiespiele gegeneinander spielen.
Ein wirklich sehr gut gelungenes Lizenzspiel.
Die Spielzeit wird vermutlich mit weiteren Spielen kürzer werden, die ersten Partien haben bei uns mehr als 5 Stunden betragen.
Man muss sich halt von den verfügbaren Karten die Texte in den ersten Spielen öfter durchlesen.
Ausserdem ist es anfangs schwierig den Überblick 
über sinnvolle Aktionen zu haben. Hier hat man zwar sehr gut mitgedacht und die Aktionsanzahl zu Beginn eingeschränkt, trotzdem ist gerade der Einstieg nicht einfach. Im Verlauf des Spiels bekommt man weitere Charaktere hinzu und somit auch mehr Aktionen.

The game felt way too long. Most of the time was spent counting ships and searching production spaces you own. Battle felt very random. I would have expected more star wars from the game.

The production wasn't spectacular also for a game this expensive. You get cardboard characters.

I would't play the game again. I would much rather spend the time playing Eclipse for an epic space battle.

This is the Star Wars game I always dreamed of. Rather than focusing on combat, Star Wars Rebellion focuses on the actions of individuals and the story that comes from success or failure. The game produces amazing variety in its narrative without a copious amount of rules nuance. Besides the terrific themes, it's a great two player strategy game as well,requiring smart play and favoring experience. This is the best Star Wars game yet made, and possibly Fantasy Flight's finest work too.

Finally got through a full game over the weekend with my friend - it was a freakin blast! It literally felt like we were playing the entire star wars saga from beginning to end, however, we commanded the eb and flow of the campaign. I was the empire, let's just say the tone of our run through was like The Empire Strikes Back for the entirety of the game. By the end, Chewie was captured, Leia detained, the rebel based was revealed on Tatooine but had previously been revealed on another world where all their troops were so their new base was basically undefended.

RATING: 7
I really respect the overall design of this game.  It's solid and dripping with theme.  I didn't even mind the length that much, and it gave an appropriately epic experience.  Yet, there's one thing that bugged me so much in this game that it caused me to sell it out of my collection.

The combat.  Oh god, the combat.

So long and so needlessly fiddly.  Combat is a critical part of the game and I found myself dreading large battles.  Dreading them worse than doing my taxes.  I absolutely hated the combat.  Win or lose, I was just glad it was over.

The combat soured me so much on the game that I just didn't want to play it again.  Maybe if they streamline it in a future edition I'll come back.  But for now, hell no.

great game. thematic, exciting, cat & mouse. I don't really like star wars, but it doesn't matter so much here. 3hr game after a learning game which will be ~ 4 hours. unfortunately, got too good for my initial opponents, so have had to stop playing for the time being. 

contrary to whiners everywhere, neither side has any real advantage. I've won multiple times with both, you just have to try a little harder (i.e. not expect good play to be immediately obvious). Or you could lose your first game and take your nerd rage over your indignity to the interwebs to protest how unfair this feels, I suppose. You wouldn't be alone.

I don't know why people complain about the combat of dice & cards--this isn't a squad level tactical game. It's more nuanced than WotR, and that doesn't generate as much whinging. It's neither overly random, nor overlong. 

Good work, Corey! I've played most of your games, and this one feels to be your best work. I look forward to playing it for years to come.

Great game, even though I still have not watched the movies (except for Episode 1, which was pretty bad). However, given how saturated American culture is with Star Wars, one does not have to watch the movies to know the broad plot lines and appreciate how well they are reflected in the game. 

Even though I want to play this more, I have had a surprisingly hard time recently getting this to the table. It may be a combination of longish play time and me having either a knack for this game or luck on my side (probably the latter). Playing either side I have an unbeaten record against the three opponents to whom I have taught this game, and these experiences may have been too disheartening for them to want to play again. But hope springs eternal and hopefully I will find an enthusiastic opponent again!

I enjoyed this overall, but found the combat to be very clunky and slowed the pace of the game.  Also a lot of upkeep in adding ships to the board que.  The story and idea of the game is fun, but is slowed down a little too much by that upkeep.

RATING: 8
An immensely fun game that, while a little complex for the subject (it is a movie, after all), sticks very closely to the story line. Play balance is good, and there's nothing quite like destroying a star system with the Death Star. The miniatures are great and the graphics and quality of the components are superb. Best of all, the game can be finished in a weekend. My only real complaint is that I wish there were more characters. This game almost makes up for the stupid "Force Awakens" movie.

Dudes on a map and much more. A few minor complaints are that there likely only a few dramatic battles for all the marbles. The rest of the time they are rather ponderous bookkeeping exercises screaming for a simplified combat system. Also, the game really grinds to a halt in the build phase and the board becomes a difficult-to-read spreadsheet. But apart from that, it's my go-to for big and epic dudes on a map.

RATING: 8
Four full plays so far, two as Empire, two as Rebels. Rating based on that so it may change with more plays, likely settling out to 7. 

A fun game and very tense at times. Plays well with two, three or four, with minor mechanical changes per the rules. Slightly different feel with three or four since there is a limit on which leaders can be played in which order. I will probably home rule that either player can execute a mission on their turn, regardless of whose leader it is. That will allow for same tactical flexibility in missions as single player and prevent a player from having to pass for a few rounds.

I really like the unit construction in this game, I usually really dislike this part of most games as I want to be the general, not the quartermaster general. Here, units are built automatically on certain turns based on the systems are loyal to you. Perfect.

I was originally going to praise FFG on a not horrible rule book for a change. The players guide gives a good overview of how you play the game during each phase, with the deeper detail rules in a rules reference arranged alphabetically. This is great because one gets a good sense of how the game is actually played, but can easily lookup any questions that arise. HOWEVER FFG, put both sections in a single rulebook and for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT put a KEY RULE in a SIDEBAR in the players guide and not in the rules reference!!!!

A little concerned that the Rebel side Objectives do not align with what works play-wise (loyalty and sabotage) and force the Rebel player into combat before they are ready. And there are only five or so objectives in each level (I, II, III) so the Empire will have a pretty good idea of what the Rebels are up to or capable of. But I've only played them once, so perhaps viable strategies will reveal themselves. 

And despite the denials, some new objective and mission cards are a no-brainer for the inevitable expansions. I mean, just look at that box, it was made for expansion. I fit the entire game comfortably in a Star Wars LCG box, including a plano box.

RATING: 10
There are enough reviews telling you about WHY the game is amazing, about why there is so much hype to this game. Truth be told, if you're a Star Wars fan, and you love complexity, this game will easily become a top 10 for you.

I will however, address some of the common themes for negative reviews, or the cons about this game.

"Clunky Mechanics/Bloated Combat/Long Combat/ Overcomplicated" Many people complain about the complexity or the clunky mechanics of the combat. But, in actuality it is the most simplified version of a more realistic version of combat scaling. Furthermore, it's not clunky even in the smallest bit. Combat is only "long/clunky" if you don't know the value of your choices, or don't appreciate what the Dev's did. It's completely balanced (in a way that gives the Empire a just edge) and if you've played more than 1 game, combat takes about 1-2 minutes per battle with larger battles taking 5-10 minutes simply because it's 20+ units. It's not hard, it's not clunky, but it might be long, but it is because you want to account for all tactical possibilities. And that's fun.

"It's all about Luck, Card Combinations, Dice Rolls." What game isn't? Anyone who ever makes this argument, ask them what their favorite game is. I guarantee you it has any one of the 3 combined. A reviewer said "It's all about Dice Rolls" and subsequently, one of their top games is Cube Quest. What? STR does have these elements, but most importantly, it's mitigated by STRATEGY. You alter to the meta of the game. You mitigate dice rolls with sheer numbers. Common sense people. I guarantee you any card combination, or outcome of battle, can be overcome with more than just luck, but strategy.

"Game is unbalanced." No, the game is actually perfectly balanced in my honest opinion, but there is a caveat. Experience goes a LONG way in this game, and whoever has played more, has an amazing edge to the game. Players might say one side or the other is overpowered, via mission cards or certain rebel objectives, but they're designed to be powerful. There is a way to counteract all the mission cards, or play around missions and objectives, and if you do this well, you're going to have to mitigate that power.

Negative values the game has I will acknowledge:

"Not a 3/4 player game" FFG tries to make this a 4 player game with admirals and generals, but being realistic here it doesn't really work out in an enjoyable experience. The only way I see this working, is if the players are more casual, or less strategic intensive and this is a great way to alleviate the burdens of many tasks to one individual. HOWEVER, I feel like most of the fun IS controlling everything in a game. Take for instance most RTS or Strategy games, you don't want to do all the macro and none of the micro or vice versa, otherwise you'll feel like it's a waste.

"The game is too long!" Yeah, it certainly is, I agree. Gametime easily hits 4+ hours in every run I've done, and that's with me feeling like the game is flying by pretty quick. But, I think it's worth it in my opinion. Certainly harder to do "in a pinch" though.

Corey's own take on a War of the Ring style game has grand scope and vision. Fight in two arenas (military vs. the hunt which is actually a hunt) with extremely streamlined rules that take on many nuances via cards. My only complaint right now is there are too few cards, rewarding familiarity. I much prefer biting into a small piece of a large deck each game.

A War of the Ring élmény. Jól működő, asszimetrikus kétszemélyes játék a SW Lázadás. Ennek a témának se vagyok rajongója, így nem tudom mennyire áll, hogy ez a legjobb SW játék, azért én ezt nem biztos, hogy kijelenteném, bár a karakterek és az egyes küldetés lapok, a lázadók rejtőzködése, a birodalom hatalmas ereje mind erősen hozzájárul a beleéléshez. A fő mechanizmus, azaz, hogy nincsenek fix akciók, hanem kártyák adják őket és az egyes szereplők alkalmazásával aktiválódnak nagyon tetszett. Nagyon jó, hogy a talonban tartott arcok tudnak a másik fél akcióira reagálni, ezért fontos döntés, hogy kiket vetünk be egy-egy küldetés megoldása, kikkel támadunk és kiket hagyunk talonba a reagálásokra. Tetszett az eltérő cél is. Az első játékunk 1 órás volt, mert olyan hamar sikerült a birodalomnak egy véletlen kártyával beletenyerelnie a lázadók rendszerébe, de gyanús, hogy ez óriási szerencse és az első játék ismerkedő mivolta miatt sikerült ilyen gyorsra. A második játék már sokkal izgalmasabb volt, de még mindig a birodalmi oldalt éreztem erősebbnek. Teljesen más a két oldal játéka, a véletlenszerűen feljövő lapok miatt változatosak lehetnek a partik, de nem biztos, hogy jobban, mint a Gyűrűk Urában. Szóval nagyon hasonló élmény volt a két játék, ezért a pontszám is azonos. Ha a lázadókkal is sikerül majd játszanom emelkedhet a pont, jelenleg nagyon erős hetes, de azért a top6-os helyet erősen túlzásnak érzem.

Prior to playing SW: Rebellion, I've played Warhammer Forbidden Stars. The mechanics are similar yet different at the same time. At first I thought it was a combat heavy game, but after the first game we realized that it was a good mixture of combat, and trying to outwit your opponent and figure out where the Rebel base is.

Great 2 player game would recommend to any star wars or board game enthusiasts.

The only downside is that we don't see this as much fun with 4 players.

Incredibly good, possibly the best integration of subject matter and mechanics I ever played, with an obviously engaging theme. Minor, but still significant, gripe: Luke's storyline is marginal, and I wish it had been adorned by a mechanics that would tempt him into using the force, making it more or less easy for him to be turned to the dark side based on how much he did that. The force is, in general, very weak with this game (and others in the FFG SW franchise).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Enjoyed the asymmetric setup in the game: the Empire is a menace and the Rebels are on the run. Yet the game is deep, remains balanced, and on a perpetual knife-edge.

Star Wars theme really shines through. Rebels won one game with Luke drawing an ace shot against the Death Star. In another, Palpatine turned Leia to the dark side after the Death Star blew up Alderaan.

One minor negative: the combat system can slow down gameplay. Players have to take turns throwing dice.

The production quality of the miniatures and the game board is excellent. Unlike many other Star Wars games: everything you need is included in the box! No collectibles/gadgets removed from the game to be sold separately. In fact, the game is such a complete experience and so well balanced that I don't see much that could be added without diluting the base game (maybe another set of dice? combat revamp?).

RATING: 8
Game is good, will need further plays to evaluate more because my first play took about halfway through the game for everything to click.

Will probably have a lot of positive things to add later, but the negatives stand out to me more for now and are unlikely to change:

The combat is a bit of a weakness I think. The card play during combat is pretty boring, and I don't think the red/black system is terribly interesting either. So you're left with "just" dice. That's not always a bad thing, and I know a lot of people have been calling for simpler combat with FFG's games, but for such an epic game it'd be nice if the battles had a bit more to them. The combat is simplified compare to FFG games with great combat systems (Forbidden Stars, Middle Earth Quest, etc), but is still just convoluted enough that I want some more depth for the effort.

I also wish I felt the characters and their doings more. They seem like numbers and stats to me which seems wrong.

Finally, the cards -- there simply aren't enough. This applies to almost everything -- missions, objectives, etc.

(4 Design + 4 Enjoyment)

Not impressed by my first play of it but I think I need to try it again to understand some more of the strategies involved. Seems possibly quite luck-based for such a long game?

This is it, the Star Wars game that I have always wanted.  Rebellion is grand scale depiction of the original Star Wars trilogy that captures the cinematic moments, epic conflict, and tension of the movies.  Components and art are the usual Fantasy Flight excellence, though much of the art is reused from their previous Star Wars games.  Gameplay is a mix of strategy, tactics, and dice rolling.  There is some serious strategic depth to Rebellion.  Gameplay time of 3-4 hours on the box is accurate.  The rules of not overly complex, so it is easy to learn and teach.  Combat is good, but not unique in any way.  The beauty of this game lies in its asymmetrical wins conditions and evocation of the original Star Wars films.  No fan of Star Wars or strategy conflict games should fail to play this one.

RATING: 4
Play the game once and you've seen 95% of what it has to offer. 

This is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played. You go through the same motions every single game. Perhaps this repetition can be diluted with an expansion or two but at the time of writing it's unacceptable. Especially for a game this expensive.

Luck can absolutely ruin this game. The Empire player can land on the Rebel base planet accidentally and that does not scream quality design to me.

Combat is just rolling dice and hoping for the best.

RATING: 10
I've played this game a few times now and I'm in love. I am biased in that I am a huge fan of the OT, but I feel that this game captures that theme perfectly.

As a rebel player, you are desperate and always feel like you're losing - and yet, when you pull out that incredible objective to win the game it's a momentous moment and you realise that you are playing for the guerilla tactic - hit and run techniques, inciting rebellions, picking and choosing your battles where possible. You aren't playing for board control or for supremacy, just to survive!

As an imperial player it's easy to assume that this will be easy. Your navies and armies outmatch theirs. Your strength in combat is usually unstoppable. But... as you slowly spread across the galaxy, constantly having the rebels undermine your every move, you begin to realise that your huge navies and armies aren't enough... probing systems or getting boots on the ground and still, you haven't found them. The clock is ticking, and you feel a lot less confident as you realise that it isn't about controlling the galaxy, it's about quelling this damn rebellion before they get too much traction.

Inside of all of this, there is so much narrative to be had. Leaders engaging in epic combats is just the least of it - Chewie leading a rebellion on his home planet only to be captured and frozen in carbonite! Han on the brink of capture only for Luke to swing in and save his friend! The empire maliciously captures one of your generals only to send him home - with a tracking beacon! 

You probably won't play out the events of the OT but the events that play out are stories that you and your friends create together as an alternate Star Wars story, and that's a great feeling. Combat is the only 'weakness' in this game as it does not feel as smooth as everything else, but it's still a working system that simulates a real battle in a simplified sense. 

A must have for a Star Wars nerd!

RATING: 10
The most complete Star Wars experience around. Epic retelling of the original trilogy in unique ways every game. Win or lose, I love this experience. Ameritrash at it's finest - deep strategy is in place for you to work your mind over, but the rolls can ultimately screw you over. I have a friend whom I play regularly and I've won once out of 7 or 8 games, and yet I would still go back and play more with him because every time we have a funny story to recount about some ridiculously cinematic moment during the course of the session. 

Fantastic decision to buy this, if you are considering it!

1 play, 2er (as Empire)

Fun game of hide-and-seek with a lot of chrome on top. The chrome is pretty cool, though! You've got the same weird Star Wars space science, where people can pop up willy nilly all over the galaxy; the same emphasis on key leaders and what they can do; the same feel of a huge, oppressive empire trying to crush the struggling little guys. The combat system is nice and simple, with enough card play to keep it interesting but still not heavy. 

Very enjoyable, hope to play again!

RATING: 8
This game is a little hard to categorize.  I guess more than anything else it is an area control game with light skirmish combat.  But there is also political intrigue and hide-and-seek to be had as well.  One thing it absolutely is, is Star Wars.  There is certainly a lot of theme here from the detail of the miniatures to the locations events need to take place in.

The game itself isn't too terribly complicated in terms of overall structure.  Each round you assign leaders to missions, resolve missions and activate spaces on the board, then cleanup and do it all over again the next round.  The complexity and depth comes in with the breadth of the missions and actions that you can take.  The overall goal for the Empire players is to find and conquer the rebel base (or wipe it from the map with the Death Star).  The Rebels basically have to keep them from doing this long enough to garner enough support in the galaxy, this is done with private objective cards.

I liked the head-to-head gameplay a lot that involved a lot of intrigue and predicting and out-maneuvering of your opponent.  I also like the very different status and viewpoints of the two sides.  I played the Rebels in my first game and they are COMPLETELY outgunned.  However, some of the ways they can garner support are through combat, so that involves precisely picking your battles to find winnable ones because at the end of the day you just cannot compete with the Empire player in combat.  Planning in this game also very much involves competing with your opponent on a mental level.  Planning of missions is done by both players prior to resolving them and once you are in the resolution step you cannot go back and plan a new mission.  So some missions like rescuing a leader you may want to plan even though you currently don't have a leader captured in case they are during that round (because next round you would be short a leader and therefore also an action).  However a leader assigned to a mission cannot be used to oppose an opponents mission or activate a system even if that mission is not performed.  And especially from the Rebel point of view if the Empire player can get his Death Star in your hidden base space and fire it in the same turn, you lose.  You can always move your base but you have to plan it and do it BEFORE it is destroyed.  There's a lot of layers and nuance and that's the best part of the game.  In fact, I kind of thought I liked this game less than I did until I started writing about it and convinced myself how much I actually did enjoy and appreciate it.

Finally, the game looks amazing.  Especially the figures.  There are close to 200 figures in this game of everything from Storm Troopers to Death Stars both "fully operational" and under construction.  They all look just like the movies and really help with the immersion.  The map is a sprawling two-board affair filled with planets you remember from the flims.  Tattooine, Naboo, Hoth, Dagobah, etc.  It is a little disappointing to have so many well-made miniatures and have to use cardboard standees for the leaders but it is also more functional since they have a lot of printed information on them.  Overall a beautiful high-quality production for a reasonable price when you consider everything that comes in the box (although I personally received my copy as a gift, not a purchase).

I wrote just briefly ago I thought I liked this game less than I did and I think the reason for that is definitely the playtime.  Not simply the playtime but the playtime compared to expected playtime.  My first game took over 4 hours.  Which is reasonable when you consider the estimate is 3-4 and I was playing with a non-boardgamer, it was both our first times, rules were revisited frequently, and most of the cards had to be read and re-read to understand and remind ourselves what to do.  A further play might take closer to 3 than 4 which is more manageable but I do wish it was a bit shorter.  I don't inherently have an issue with longer games, I will and have played a game of Duel of Ages for 6 hours.  But I always judge games in terms of my desire to keep them on the shelf and I was very close to putting this one in the trade pile despite how great of a game objectively I think it is.  Because I have other 2-player only games that involve area control, skirmish battles, and mental duels.  But those other games also don't take 4 hours which is a hard time slot to fit a game into.  Especially when you consider setup itself can tack on another hour, even in this first game where we used a recommended setup, just finding spaces and placing the necessary figures on the board took quite a while and cleanup isn't a ton better.  So I worry about how often this game will get played.  But for all the  other games I have that do what this one does, it does one thing none of my others do as well.  Star Wars.

The game was AMAZING! I have only played it once, at the time of writing this, but I am definitely planning on playing it more at my earliest opportunity.

Rebellion was just okay for me.  I like the game pieces, and I'm a sucker for the theme.  On the other hand, a lot of the missions are uninteresting, the game is really long for what it is, and a lot of what happens is owed to luck rather than interesting strategic moves.  No system or idea in the game really jumps out at me as especially original or interesting enough for me to want to play more of it.  I enjoyed blowing up Kashyyyk with my Death Star and turning Luke to the Dark Side, but I didn't get much out of any of the decisions that made those things happen.

I won as the rebellion because I was able to play a bullshit objective card during the refresh phase that thematically made zero sense. Have troops in 5 systems at the beginning of the clean up phase... That was enough to run out the clock on my opponent who was about to crush my secret base the beginning of the next turn. 

The win didn't feel good, it felt cheap as hell. I will probably play this game 1 more time as the Imperials. I hope the ending isn't as cheesy the next time.

I wanted to like this game. Not because of Star Wars, I don't like Star Wars particularly, but because I like asymmetrical 2-Player conflict games.

But there's not much in this big box gamewise. It's a Hide and Seek and comes down to a race of luck with very few relevant decisions. This lack of involvement is hidden under a thick layer of plastic miniatures, beautiful cards and extremely clunky mechanics, mainly for the battles. Most of what you do lets you think you are doing relevant stuff but in the end is for nought. It doesn't really matter if you blow up a system or build a death star. But it should.

This is a terrific game.  Very reminiscent of WotR in the sense that it's playable in an evening (sometimes twice) and does a great job of modeling a much-loved world.

Wow. Make your own Star Wars movie kit. There is so much to like here, and for a fairly straight forward game it achieves an incredible amount, from dramatic missions to tense space combat, with the Imperial forces edging ever closer to the Rebel base, as the Rebellion fight desperately to gain galactic sympathy. The rules are easy to understand, and although I normally hate FFG rules and dual rulebooks, for once it really works. Well done all round.

The hide-and-seek nature of play is not really my cup-of-tea, and overall the game feels a bit layered on to me.  There is a lot of luck here. The military discrepancy between the two players is really huge.

Jointly owned with Phillip. A magnificent sprawling space opera StarWars based epic of a board game. I would give it a 10 if it were not for the appallingly clunky and out of place combat system. The rest of the game just flows so beautifully that a two to four hour game just sails by due to the fact that you are fully immersed in this world (other than when combat yanks you out of it temporarily). So for now, after 2 plays I will have to rate it as an 8. Must get this to the table again.....

Aszimetrikus 1v1 játék, tematikus, rengeteg minivel, hatalmas (HATALMAS) táblával, Darth Vaderrel. Mi kellhet még?
Az oldalak hozzák a tőlük elvártat, a Birodalom hatalmas hadigépezet, elképesztő tartalékokkal és fegyverekkel, a Lázadók közben az árnyékban bújkálnak, bújtogatnak és ahol tudnak keresztbe raknak. Csatában azonban nincs esélyük.

Theme is nice for Star Wars fans, and the production values are good, but the game is essentially a rip-off of WotR. The asymmetry isn't very balanced, and the game can be unnecessarily long (and somewhat boring), especially for the Imperial player.

Picked up a used copy for $25 at the HPB.

Tentative rating based on a single partial play. I'd like to try it again, fixing the mistakes we made during the first play.

Update: Rating stands after a second play, though we failed to finish. I'd recommend setting aside 5 hours to play.

Update 2: Rating still stands after a full play. 6 hours total, with a couple of new players.

RATING: 9
Completely sensational game in every respect. The box is filled up with components up to edges, thanks to which one has the feeling that players will be clashing on a galactic level simply by unpacking the elements from the box.

The art on the board, cards and other playing pieces is fantastic, although the quality of the plastic playing pieces seem to be inferior when compared to those in Forbidden Stars.

The instructions in the rule book are very accessible and intuitive, and the compendium clarifies  individual situations which can present problems in the interpretation of the rules. But most importantly, Rebellion gives so much pleasure in playing as hardly any game. The asymmetry of the factions, the search for the rebel base, the controlled randomness and the attempt to counteract the unknown, covert actions of one's opponent; those elements keep one in tension and uncertainty all the time increasing the experience and fun.

Furthermore, the game focuses on the events known from episodes IV-VI and provides the players with the means of telling a different story each time, different to the one know from the films. This is another pro aspect of this game which puts it high on my list, as the replayability is ensured not only by the game's mechanics but rather through it's strong emphasis on story-telling with the possibility of creating countless new versions of the events from many a fan's favorite movies in the Star Wars franchise.

This game is a real jewel.  I tend to not rate lengthy games extremely well; I always have HUGE expectations for long games since they need to be worth the chunk of my time they take.  Furthermore, I generally do not like 2 player games because I don't get much of a chance to play them, and I lost horribly on my first game, but I still came out liking this game a lot, that should show you just how good it is.

I am a major Star Wars nut and this captured the feeling of Star Wars so extraordinarily well.  The rebels are crazy lacking in tech and ships and the empire can pump our Star Destroyers like nothing, it is scary as hell to be the rebel player, but it makes it all the better putting you in that mindset.  If it sounds like it is imbalanced, I don't think it is.  The rebels aren't trying to defeat the empire, just hold out a certain number of turns before their base is discovered, and they can do a number of obnoxious hit and run missions to delay the empire, many of which are references or very believable things the rebels would be capable of.  Additionally you can do missions to turn luke into a Jedi while the empire can try and turn your own characters against you!  In my first game Luke became a jedi, mon mothma turned to the darkside and Luke vs Vader ended in a final showdown over my base.  I also made a failed attempt at blowing up the deathstar!  

It is rare when a games mechanics matches its theme, and even rarer when the game turns out to be good.  This does it all and remains amazing.  Definitely on my top 5 best games of all time.

It's the Star Wars trilogy in a box, no question. I love playing this game from both sides of the conflict, and each game always has amazing moments of standup die rolls to see if some mission or battle is going to swing one way or another. I'm not sure I want the expansion, though, because some of the things I've heard about it actually seem LESS interesting to me.

The perfect game for any Star Wars fan. As you are playing the missions you can easily imagine how it would look in the movies. The Imperial player uses their military might to hunt down the Rebel base, while the Rebel player relies on hit and run missions and diplomacy to slow the progress of the Empire. The asymmetry also contributes to the theme. The Rebel player feels hopeless on turn 1 because the Empire appears to have a huge advantage, but by turn 6 or 7 the Rebellion starts to see a path to victory. The four hour play time just flies by. This is one of those games where even if you lose, you have a lot of fun playing.

RATING: 8
I pan a lot of Fantasy Flight games as overly thematic with too much chrome and not enough gameplay. Not so with Star Wars Rebellion. Here FF turns its weaknesses into strengths. To do so, however, FF exercises restraint. The game amounts to a standard battle system layer on top of a giant game of cat and mouse. Or to put it another way, it's [thing=438]Scotland Yard[/thing] combined with a war game. This basic premise is the key to the game's success because it cleverly encapsulates the three original Star Wars movies. It all boils down to a question that is ever-frustrating for the Empire: "Where is that damn Rebel base!?" If the Empire finds and destroys the base, victory! On the other hand, if the Rebels outlast the Empire and end the game before the base is found, victory for them! Gameplay is asymmetrical, but of course it has to be, and it works.

What FF does right is leave well enough alone. Rather than complicate the game with unnecessary rules, they take a lesson from games like [thing=12333]Twilight Struggle[/thing]. The thematic details are all in the cards. Both players have mission cards they can play to take special actions (necessary if you hope to win). So instead of simply moving troops around on the board, you have to launch plans that involve a bit of setup and luck. In addition, the Rebel player has objective cards (goals that allow him to speed up the game and therefore bring him closer to victory). All you need to "feel" like you're playing Star Wars is right there in two systems: the basic premise of hide and seek and the player-cards. Well done, FF.

I only hope the Rebel and Empire sides are balanced enough for longterm enjoyment. There's no way to know now, but it's a concern I have with any asymmetrical game.

What's missing from a typical FF production are things like random events and unnecessary rules. That's not to say the game doesn't come close. There are leaders, which you must use to perform actions like moving your troops and carrying out special actions. Each leader has a host of stats that dictate how many you dice you roll in different circumstances. There is no reason to have so many different stats when just a few would do. Having so many options only serves to confuse players. Likewise, some of the cards contain additional rules that new players won't know about until the game surprises them. Knowing the cards and all their strategic implications gives an experienced player a serious advantage -- but this is a trade-off you make with any card-driven game. Neither of these criticisms are enough to sully the game, but I feel a bit of extra honing would have done the game well.

Finally, I have to mention FF's rules, which I historically can't stand. I love the new split rulebook approach, dividing the rules into a reference book (for experienced players) and a learning manual (for new players). Awesome job there. But like so many FF games, they play it fast and loose with terminology and fail to understand the importance of using precise and consistent language. This leads to rules ambiguity that could (and should) be avoided. I don't know why FF has so many problems with their terminology, but I'd love to see them put as much effort into their writing as they do their plastic miniatures and illustrations.

Overall, though, Star Wars: Rebellion is fun, tense, and interesting. That I'm a huge Star Wars fan helps, of course, but being a fan has never helped me enjoy a FF game in the past. The gameplay is the thing.

I felt that the Empire game play gets a bit "samey".  The Empire needs to build a lot of units, spread out to take away rebel resources and get probe cards to narrow down the rebel base system.

Then a smart rebel player has a special mission to get back some of those probe cards, and the hunt begins again.  After 2 hours, the game play gets tedious.

There are several things to like about this game, but overall, I am disappointed in Fantasy Flight Games.  I wanted to love it, but now I just tolerate it.  There is lots of cool chrome, but the there is not much replayability in my view.  Initially, I rated this game as a solid 8, but after several plays, it drops to a 6.5 for me.

This game combines my two biggest passions, board games and Star Wars.  My absolute favorite board game.

When we first bought the game we played it over a three day weekend and logged 35 hours of playing time!

Hugely thematic.  A lot of very cool mini stories are told through player actions throughout the game.

Overall, the game is surprisingly simple.  Unfortunately, the combat is a bit of a mess in that they're a completely unnecessary annoyance.  The differentiation between red and black dice in terms of what can hit what should have been enough.  I'm surprised those cards got through playtesting.  A blemish on a very good game.

UPDATE: At first blush, I much prefer the changes to combat provided by the Rise of the Empire expansion, which basically replaces the random card draw with the "house cards" from A Game of Thrones.

RATING: 9
While I really, really enjoyed my one session so far, I think this is a very preliminary rating, which is likely to go down if I get to (have to) play the rebel side. Like in Android Netrunner I have the strong gut feeling that the asymmetry in this game only has one desirable side for me, which is the imperial side. In ANR I played as the corp and I pretty much hated it. Not the game per se but the very defensive nature of the play style which was forced upon me. Same here, the rebels are so drastically inferior on the military level it doesn't seem like a viable option at all to even consider trying to build up armies. I could spot thesame expression on my opponents face than the one I had when playing ANR (mind you I always have a mirror with me for gaming sessions to study my facial expressions) Personally in that regard War of the ring did a much better job. Sure, the Fellowship Player doesn't really stand a military chance but at least it IS possible to conquer enemy strongholds if you go for it. 
That being said I had such a blast pursuing vile plans. Even more so with a great sound track and waiting for the dramatic parts to carry out the most evil actions.
______________________________________________________________________________
And here I thought playing the Rebels wouldn't be as fun as playing the imperium. I was wrong. It's much more tense and offers a different kind of gaming satisfaction. The game is amazing. Only letdown is the rulebook. Why explain crucial rules somewhere in the reference guide instead of in the actual rulebook?

Game says 3-4 hours, that's if you know what you're doing and you're not playing with an AP player.  That being said, I've enjoyed this game very much (and I'm not good at it, lost both times).
It really is Star Wars in a box.  One game the empire kept quelling my uprising and based on my actions, the empire had a good idea where my hidden base was and the death star approached Tatooine to destroy it.
Another game the empire kept gaining planets, but the Rebellion sabotaged production wherever it could and won some important battles.  The empire captured Luke and converted him to the dark side, but then the rebellion found the death star plans and destroyed it with 1 lone X-Wing and a lucky roll.
This is a game that tells stories.  All of the cards compliment each other.  Some are very specific, but the other side's cards will do that very thing that you are good at blocking.  Lots of back and forth.

I think this game is great and I have lots of fun whenever I play it. The mission cards are full of surprises and constantly having you going "WHAT?!".

However, the whole 're-write the Star Wars saga' selling point (if there is one) is non-existent. It in theory just becomes a jumble of different Star Wars events happening in a random order - WHICH IS FINE - but it's just purporting to be something it's not. Also, the novelty of the mission cards will no doubt wear off after a few plays once you've encountered a great many of them. Nonetheless, I love this game and I love playing it; I'll keep my rating under review to see if the novelty wears off once I'm more familiar with all the mission cards!

First Impression: Oh my, what an exciting game. This is THE wet dream of every star wars fan. Either commanding fleets of star Destroyers hunting down Rebel Scum or making daring strikes against the overwhelming empire to keep the hope up as the brave rebels this is the entire Star Wars spirit in one great boardgame, much more than any other board or card game has achieved ever before.

But is it good as a game? Does it hold for those that don't care for the Star Wars theme? And the odd answer is yes! This is space opera at its finest, with the focus on the opposing characters, each with his own strengths and weaknesses, and a gameplay that is both simple, elegant and completely absorbing. There is assymetrical gameplay here, also at its finest, just the right amount of economy thrown in, an amazing pacing, a ton of bluffing and outguessing and it creates an amazing story every time.

So is there anything wrong with it? Well, it is long, and even if you'll be absorbed by it and never feel the pass of time, you still need an afternoon to play this with full comfort. Other than that the only thing I can say is that as with all 2p skill based games this one will be an autoloss for new players that face veterans, but to the game's credit they will still last long enough to fully enjoy themselves and won't really realize their doom until the veteran moves for the killing blow(s).

RATING: 9
This game is a lot of fun. You have to be ready to play for three to four hours but it is worth it. The game does not drag and it is fun until the end.

Focusing on leaders as the main drive for all actions is what makes this game feel so epic. Star Wars is all about the characters and the actions of a few changing the Galaxy while the war rages around them. Star Wars: Rebellion captures that with a few very simple mechanics based around the use of each player's leaders. 

On a mechanical level the back and forth between each player is great fun. Trying to anticipate and counter your opponent is a very fun kind of stress. Every turn is full of meaningful decisions and derailed plans. You never have enough resources to do everything you want. You will always have to delay or forgo something that you want to do in favor of something else. It's great. This leaves a lot of replay-ability and shows that there is not just one best way to win for each side.

Decisions are not as meaningful in combat but the choices you make do matter. Whether or not to over assign damage, where to assign damage and how to play your cards are all can decide how a combat is won. There is a slight disjoint as you go from space combat to ground combat to space again when the natural instinct is to completely resolve all rounds in one before moving to the other, but you get used to it. I especially like the simplicity of the dice system for differentiating between light and heavy attacks what they are effective against.

The production system is simple and quick and makes it very clear what each planet is worth to either cause. The inclusion of remote systems that have no production really adds to mind games of the hidden base mechanic and your limited actions. The Imperial player wants to check these locations, but it always feels like it's a wasted action. It's a fantastic tension.

This game is full of different tensions. Do the Rebels want to deploy units around the base to protect it, or to be a distraction and pull Imperial units away from it? The Imperials want to spread out but must always keep forces together to not leave themselves open to Rebel uprisings and surprise attacks.

The team version of the rules is just as fun as the head to head. The additional complication of having to work out which order your leaders will need to activate in makes it shine.

A must for fans of boardgamers and  Star Wars. Even for someone not familiar with Star Wars this is an excellent game. It's just good. No movie knowledge required.

It's been said by a lot of other people but this really is Star Wars in a box. Every time I play this games it feels just like playing in my own Star Wars film.

The different sides feel really fun to play and are both equally stressful to play against. As the Rebels it's all about the mind games and keeping the Empire off your back. As the Empire, you're constantly trying to find out where the Rebels are hidden.

While the game touts being a 2-4 player game, it really is 2p only. The 4-player option chops the game in half and adds a clunky turn mechanic to the game.

About [thing=187645][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=187645][/thing] is a heavily thematic game using area movement, hand management and some light bluffing. It is mostly made for 2 players, one playing the Empire, other the Rebels, but it can be played as a 4 players game, dividing the factions, much like in [thing=115746][/thing].

This is a heavy game, both literally (as the box is quite huge and there is plenty of components, cards, tokens and several miniatures), and figuratively, as though the main mechanics aren't hard to learn, there is plenty of special cases with their own set of rules or exceptions - and since this is a game with lots of secrecy in both sides, simply asking something during play can give a key information, making learning these little situations important, and, also, a hassle in first play.

The components, as expected, are all very nice: the miniatures are well done, the cards and tokens are standard, and the art works well, as it allows the use of characters from different media to participated in the same game.

However, it is in the translation of mechanics to theme that [thing=187645][/thing] shines the most: it brings a lot of Star Wars to the table - the setting is there, alongside with its characters, situations and overall feel.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The basics are: the Empire wants to find and conquer the Rebel base, and the Rebels want to fulfill objectives, in order to advance their influence, which makes the time for the Empire shorter, and also needs to delay the Empire as best as possible, while the Empire use mostly brute force in order to speed things up.

Both players have a hand of mission cards, and do use them, they must assign a Leader to each of them. Missions have requirements of ability, which restrict who you can send. Missions do all sort of things and the important to know right now is that some have the word "Attempt" and others the word "Resolve" - in the first case, the other side can send an unassigned Leader to oppose the opponent Leader, with both rolling the appropriated attribute. For the "Resolve" there is no opposing.

As I mentioned, while picking Leaders to send on missions, keeping some behind may also be wise, since these can be used in the hopes of trying to foil some actions done by the other side.

At the start of some rounds, players draw new Leaders and/or produce (planets give out ships or ground units for their controlling faction). Also, two new mission cards are drawn - there is a limit of 10 mission cards in hand. The Empire player draws two probe cards (these shows planets that the Rebels base isn't in - as the home world of the Rebels base is out of the deck). The Rebels player draw two Objective cards and chooses one to keep.

At the end of the round, the time token moves 1 space - when it meets the Rebel marker, the game is over, and the Rebels win. The Empire wins by fiding and conquering (or destroying) the Rebels base before the times runs out.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are plenty of them, the main ones are:
- Which mission to use and which Leader to send to it;
- In which place to do a mission (as Leaders prevent units of the same side from moving from where they are);
- Which Leader (if any) to keep and possibly use to act against missions of the other side;
- Where to move units - important for both sides, but matters more for the Empire;
- Where to allocate new units;
- Picking new Leaders;
- For the Rebel's player: which Objectives to keep and how best to fulfill them.

The first two are the most relevant, as they direct many of the others. Keeping some Leaders behind can make the other side to rethink what they will do, or, at least, when, maybe trying to push the opponent to use a Leader that stayed behind sooner, maybe in a less important mission. It is also important And picking missions to do us the heart of the whole game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Dripping with theme - it is the universe of Star Wars in a box;
- Excellent production value;
- Several decision points throughout the play;
- Great tension for both sides: with the Rebels advancing their goals and the Empire getting closer and more sure as time goes by.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Convoluted rules, as there so many little rules for several special situations, making learning everything a chore;
- Combat isn't very exciting;
- There is an important learning curve, for both sides, which makes playing against a veteran (or newbie) a bad or lesser experience.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a game of cat and mouse, but the mouse is Jerry: you know both sides will get out with bruises. The Empire is stronger, yes, but its machine can be slowed down almost to a halting point due to diplomacy and sabotage, and at the same time making the Rebels stronger. However, there isn't t that beautiful dwindling hope the Free Peoples go through in [thing=115746][/thing], facing almost impossible odds, as the Shadow rarely falters in their great military power. But, yes, the Empire have the Global Universal FriendShip.

In the end, [thing=187645][/thing] works very well, specially in bringing the theme to the surface with its mechanics. There is so much to like: the options, and bluffing, the timming, the tug of war, the growing tension. Yet, I'm not the target audience for it: I usually avoid lenghty and confrontational games for 2 players, and I play to relax and these tend to give some stress to me. Also, the I'm neutral to the Star Wars universe: I know it well enough, as almost anyone breathing, so it is a hard sell to me a 3 to 5 hours game without the backing of the theme (and is why I like WotR so much). Still, I can understand the value and fun many see here, as I see both in WotR.  Therefore, it goes recommended.

I've read the canon novels and watched much of the animated series in addition to the movies. As such, the nuanced story bits between the cards really came to life. The expansion added to this greatly. Very satisfying strategy, even with luck of the draw and dice rolling. With the expansion, it is perfect.

The only drawback to this game is the time commitment. This is a 4-6 hour game when you know it will. 

That said, every game is worth yet. You really feel the scope of the Empire, and the scrappiness of the Rebellion. Leads to some super tense exchanges.

The combat can feel like it interrupts the flow a bit, but is serviceable. And the new combat options in the upcoming expansion look like they'll add a bit more strategic flavor to it.

SW: Rebellion is an epic game with lots of moving parts, and yet it is suprisingly simple to learn. It is not so easy to play well, however - the two sides play very differently and deciding where to commit your resources to offers hard choices (especially as the Rebel player). It looks the part and the narrative on the cards give it a very cinematic feel - much like War Of The Ring does. Quite an experience.

Was (Luke)warm on this one after my first play, but had a better experience the second time around as the rules started to make more sense. It really is Star Wars in a box, which was awesome to experience.

I wish the combat mechanism was approached differently though. It's too fiddly for my taste as you end up having to roll way more dice then the box provides and do too much accounting during the large battles.

I can't play this game enough! People love the game because it feels like Starwars and it does. The rebels are pesky and annoying saboteurs. Meanwhile, the Empire is incredibly powerful! The two concerns people have are replayability and the combat system. As for replayability, there are so many different avenues to victory on both sides that you could play as the Empire dozens of times without getting bored or even trying the Rebel side! Do I focus on building my fleet? Exploring the board for their base? Interrogating and sending droids for intel? You can't do it all! Or as a Rebel, do I rush objective card? Build a powerful base? Where should I hide my base?!? There is just so much to do and try differently each time you play it - let alone the differences in leaders and mission cards you'll get each play! As for combat, it is a little clunky but there is still a lot of fun and strategy. The last match I played ended with an assault on the Rebel base where the Rebels survived with two Y-wings on their planet. Additionally, there is some strategy as to which troops you decide to build and how you acquire them throughout the board. Overall, an amazing game!

just not my game. I always think that these games last way too long for what you can do. 
Basically you just choose a mission for a hero, do your action, resolve a fight if there is one, and then you repeat this.

This could be fun but the problem is, it lasts about 3h and the downtime is absolutely huge.

RATING: 9
An asymmetrical space combat game that borrows heavily from the mechanics of Twilight Imperium (leader activation, fleet combat) with great results. The Empire spreads out through the galaxy, desperately hunting for the hidden Rebel base, while the Rebellion tries to win small victories and destabilize the political order of the Empire. Like TI3, this game requires a commitment of several hours, but getting to re-live the memorable events of the original Star Wars trilogy while engaged in epic space combat is worth the time spent.

The game is much more straight-forward than I expected.  Much more card play with a bit of combat thrown in, which was a nice surprise. Definitely as much theme as you can pour into a box.  

Stepping away from the Star Wars fanboy influence though, it does feel too long for what it is.  It starts to feel repetitive and the tension is so drawn out that it loses it's edge.  It's supposed to be a race to find the Rebel Base, but there are soooo many planets, and it takes soooo much time to move fleets around that it's almost like a nuisance rather than an urgent chase like in some cat and mouse games. 

There are also some clunky and lacking bits.  Using damage counters to keep track of who produced.  Using leaders as a mark to limit chaining movement.  Both felt a bit like makeshift fixes.  Wish it came with printable maps for the Imperial player to keep track of planets he's checked because I found constantly shuffling through probe cards to be a big problem.  I made several mistakes because I kept getting planets jumbled in my head.   Combat could fee like a chore and predetermined by card draw.

Personally, War of the Ring felt more like a memorable, epic experience.  I was surprised to discover that the 30 minute experience in Risk: Star Wars felt like a similar game in 1/10th the time.

I like a lot of what is going on here, I just wish it moved at a quicker pace and a bit less fiddly.

Played once, really enjoyed it and clearly a well designed game.

I love it when games incorporate thematic storytelling elements seamlessly into game play mechanisms. This game does that all over the place and it really creates the feeling of playing out the movies.

Whilst the game is 11 out of 10 for theme, it felt like only a 6 or 7 out of 10 for creating interesting game play decisions. A lot of the game play is pretty simple and the combat in particular feels a little light for my tastes.

Had fun and would play again, but didn't leave me with a "must play again" feeling.

Suffers from the usual FFG syndrome of being over-fiddly, component-heavy, and unnecessarily complicated at times (combat). A really fun game that would see more playing time if it didn't take 4+ hours to play.

Too impractical. And unfortunately, I can confirm that the trendy criticism of this game that combat is clunky is true. Maybe I'm too old school and am biased toward Axis & Allies-style combat, or Warhammer-style combat. But using tiny decks of cards that constantly need to be reshuffled and that block dice rolls was not something I enjoyed. After one play, sadly decided that this game doesn't have much of a place in my life: don't have a friend that wants to play regularly, and no one in my family likes Star Wars. Sold.

The theme really comes through in this one, and there's a strong sense of narrative arc as the game progresses. While I'm not the biggest fan of the (among other things) time consuming combat system, the deduction/chase element appeals to me, not to mention the ever present tension I relish in games. Like any CDG it's very important to learn what cards are in each side's various decks and play accordingly. I'm generally not a fan of CDGs because of this but Rebellion does enough I like to overcome my bias.

Rebellion is the Original Star Wars trilogy in a box. Everything is here, from desperate battles to Jedi training, bounty hunting to games of hide and seek with the Empire's relentlessly searching probe droids. The game runs like a well oiled machine, mechanically simple but strategically complex, character driven yet operated at a grand military scale. It's quite an achievement in game design.

Also, the bits are amazing. So much detail, yet easy to handle and quite sturdy. It's not often you can say a game is worth every dime of a hundred dollar price tag...but I can say that about this one. Drop what you are doing and get it, ASAP. You can even blow up Naboo with a Death Star. Need I say more?

This game is Star Wars in a box.  I love how the empire is searching for the rebel base and has to tactically move their units in order to find that rebel scum.

RATING: 8
Only 1 play so far because it's hard to get on the table. I normally either don't have time or I have more than 2 players and I won't play this with 4 players. It has the option to do it, but in reality it just splits the duties of 1 player into 2 people so it's still a 2 player game with 2 heads on both sides. And there are a lot of nuance rules that called for me to be referring to the rules periodically to clarify so by the time I play again i'll have forgotten all of those and need to either re-read it all or just suffer through a game of constantly checking the rule. 

That all aside. Super fun! Very rich in theme and fun twists on the original story. I played as rebels and i was on my toes the entire time freaking out as the Imperials fly right by adjacent systems to my base but luckily didn't find it. Then a 2nd time I bailed right before they got there but sadly all my options at that point were systems right next to imperials everywhere so it was a quick 1 more turn before they found me and destroyed me. Oh well. I recommend it still.

[i]Preliminary rating after one play as the Empire:[/i]

Epic and fun. I really enjoyed playing this game. I love the asymmetric objectives, both sides really have to use completely different strategies (in fact, they play two totally different games). I think that the Rebel player has more fun things to do, the Empire has to focus on the logistics of movement and exploration a little too much.

There are tons of cool decisions and things to consider here, but oftentimes I was paralyzed by everything I had to keep track of when planning my moves. The game can reach the point when it gets a bit too overwhelming. That feeling should go away once you go past learning the basics.

The theme is really strong and glues together all the mechanics perfectly. I'm not a big fan of the combat system though, there's nothing interesting about it (and it's very fiddly). Also, the unit production and deployment can be a little hard to manage at times, it's easy to forget about something or make mistakes. 

You just have to know going in that luck (rolling dice and drawing cards) plays a big part in the game. But although the randomness can be frustrating, at the same time it makes the game unpredictable and exciting (you just need the luck factor in games like that).

It's hard to for me to fully appreciate Rebellion as I played it only once and the rules were explanined to me in such a way that I did not understand every tiny detail of the mechanics (and there are many little rules that are easy to forget). I'm guessing that if both players are of equal skill and understand 100% of the rules the game becomes a whole different beast and a true battle of wits. I would love to play it again.

By the way, the game should come with a minimap with a screen for the Imperial player to mark the areas indicated by the Probe cards - keeping track of all the planets is a nightmare and really slows down the game! A simple map with tokens would do the job...

RATING: 8
I like Star Wars. I like Risk-like games. I like games with asymmetry. With Star Wars: Rebellion, we have a game that provides a sense of all these elements.

Rebellion is a sort of "cat and mouse" game where one player (Rebels) is trying to avoid or distract the other (Empire) long enough to run out the clock. Of course, how the cat and mouse play their chase is much more involved than that but if you boil the game down, that's what you've got.

The Rebels are trying to draw attention this way and that. The trick is, if the Empire wants to stop their shenanigans, it will slow down their search. On the other hand, if they don't stop them, the Rebels will speed up their own progress or eat away at the Empires resources.

But make no mistake, the Rebels are very much the "mouse" here...and if they get cornered by the cat, chances are they're gonna be lunch.

This game might be higher on my list but for two inter-related problems. First is it's length. Barring really bad luck on the part of the Rebels, the game will take a minimum of 3 hours and, more likely, 4 or 5 hours to finish. There's nothing objectively wrong with a lengthy game and it's length certainly contributes to a sense of it's epic scope. But this is compounded by it's second problem, which is that it isn't a very satisfying experience for more than 2 players. Yes, the game technically supports 3 or 4 people but it doesn't really do so in any way that's clever.

It also has the misfortune of carrying a combat system that, while competent, isn't all that interesting or rewarding. But it constitutes such a small portion of the experience that I wouldn't really call it a detractor.

So, if you want to play a 2-player, competitive Star Wars saga for an evening, this is the best place to turn.

First, let me get my butthurt out of the way: don’t play as the Rebels in your first game against an experienced player. Thematically, the Rebels are supposed to feel against the ropes and hopeless, but someone who has played the game before will know that’s more of a feeling than the reality as they figure out ways to punch holes in the Empire’s armor. A new player, however, will feel doubly hopeless and they’re unsure of how to play [i]and[/i] the game is sending them signals that they’re not doing well.

Okay, with that out of the way, the game is really interesting. It’s not at all what I expected when I first saw it. Leaders are really workers and missions are basically the work they’re doing. It’s a worker placement game. At the same time, the Rebellion is trying to hide long enough to achieve their goals while the Empire stomps around the galaxy trying to find and destroy their base. The [i]feel[/i] of the game is just right.

I’m looking forward to playing again and hope my frustrations from the first play go away.

Tentatively recommended.

Only played it once, but I loved how the sides were thoroughly different, yet (felt) balanced. It's clear the designer payed close attention to linking the game to the theme - Star Wars.

It's a bit heavy perhaps for some people, but I didn't mind at all. The production quality is also top notch I think.

I have been a Star Wars geek for a terribly long time. Since Time is relative, let's just say I've been a fan of Star Wars since before I was allowed to play outside without parental supervision. 

Star Wars: Rebellion is what I've always DREAMED a Star Wars board game would be. In fact, once someone masters the learning curve and understands game play, it's not difficult but rather truly immersive and streamlined. I enjoy that each part fits well together. from the mission cards and the various heroes, to the miniatures and the flavor of the two separate forces. Finally, the premise of the game creates the atmosphere of the original trilogy perfectly.

It does not scale exceptionally well for three or four players, but that's my only qualm. Even long play times aren't as large of an issue if you truly are getting into the game you are playing. For me that is not a problem.

Positives: Star Wars Episode IV-VI in a box. It captures the empires hunt for the rebel base whilst the underdog rebels muster what limited resources against the imperial machine and use cunning and guile to overcome such odds perfectly. As a 2 player game this is outstanding. Stunning production of all components. 

Negatives: Lots of rules! It will take at least 1 or 2 play through to appreciate the complexity and options available to you. 

Conclusion: If you are even slightly a fan of the Star Wars theme and you like strategic games, this is probably the best combination of the 2 on the market in 2 player format

The rating isn't a measure of [i]Rebellion[/i], which is a sharp design for fans, so much as it is a reflection of my interest in the franchise.

My affection for Star Wars has been in steady decline since 1985.  The epilogue: The Force Awakens was OK and Rogue One was an unwatchable disappointment.  Characters in the Lucas universe should be memorable and charismatic, and Disney delivered the opposite.  Even the [url=http://www.etonline.com/news/205245_exclusive_meet_k_2so_the_rogue_one_standout_character]fan-fave robot[/url] wasn't funny to my ears, though with a crack cadence and inflection he could have been.

Anyway, lots of people will enjoy this game.  Please do!

I'm enjoying it very much although the tactics cards system is mostly an exercise in frustration. More often than not I wind up with a hand of cards I can't use.
Edit: With the addition of the Cinematic Combat System this game gets upgraded. NOW it feels like a really good game where combat is not a must but definitely delivers on the thematic without bogging the game down.

This is a reworking of SPI's Freedom in the Galaxy (1979) done by Star Wars: Rebellion (1998) computer game (off of repressed S&T memories at the least) then reworked by the Star Wars Rebellion board game.

I've since played it. I like how its become more streamlined and yet hate how so much detail and sense of character has been taken out (gone are different strategies to formulate -- replaced with making the best tactical plays to the cards you get -- like all of Corey's games your main competition is with the deck you have not your opponent). The Axis and Allies bucket of dice combat doesn't help.

Good tactical combat game; excellent thematic game. There's quite a learning curve and the game itself is fairly long, and it's definitely best with two players, so it's not very easily added to a collection unless you like tactical war games. 

While I'm not usually a fan of dice rolling to resolve combat, it didn't feel as arbitrary in this game as it does to me in other games -- maybe a consequence of damage types and tactical cards. The different objectives and play styles of the rebels and the empire makes an interesting game dynamic, and optimum troop movement/deployment is tantamount. 

Definitely recommend for any star wars fan who happens to like tactical games.

Good game, though not so thrilling gameplay as war of the ring or ts for me. Long time planning is not as important as in the others since rebels only try to achieve some small tasks and imperials are just searching in the fog for the base. BUT it gets better the more you play and learn the game.

Loads of miniatures, the board looks truly awesome with everything set up. The two rule book system is great as usual, every question I've had is answered in one of the two books.  The gameplay is fun, except for the combat. I thought it would be ok but it's actually quite irritating. Everything just comes to a halt for 5-7 minutes while each player rolls some dice, plays some cards, and then does it all over again. Certainly not enough of a detractor to make me dislike the game, but I definitely think there is room for improvement.

RATING: 9
Strategy game with asymmetric player powers which manages to capture the feel of a star wars story in an excellent manner.  This is not a wargame.  The actual conflict on the board, despite the large number of minis, is actually a minor sidebar to the main action.

Pure and simple, this is a hide and seek style game, in which one side (Imperial) is trying to find the objective (rebel base) while the other is attempting to run out the clock (Rebels).  It is a race game, and the leader mechanism is actually reminiscent of WP mechanic.

It is really a fantastic game which owes a great debt to War of the Ring, a comparison which is often cited.  It is like, yet unlike.  However, it does not seem to have the same capacity for replay as WotR.  Although it may not be as good a game as WotR, there are many, many titles for which that same claim can be made, but which are still worth playing.  This is definitely worth playing.

Finally...the HUGE, non-miniatures, self-contained Star Wars board game you've been waiting for ever since Fantasy Flight got the license. And I'm 99 percent sure it's totally NOT the game you're expecting to get, especially if you go into it thinking it's just a souped-up version of Risk. Way more an abstract version of Star Wars than I thought it would be (your "leaders" just instantly "appear" wherever you need them to, and they are represented by skill icons), learning the game is a bear due to a ruleset larded out enough totally arbitrary rules that I'm sure you'll be playing it wrong for at least your first ten games. Still, it reminds me of old standbys like Arkham horror in that there's something rewarding about leaning into the game's rules and taking your time with it. Sort of a mix of dice challenges, secret missions, hide and seek, and more traditional capture resources and deploy troops stuff, it may not be for everyone, and people who've played it a lot will start to have an advantage (they're more familiar with the decks of possible missions) but still...as THE (current) big Star Wars "event" game, it can't be ignored. Also...the space combat system is just fine as is, by the way. The last thing this game needs is to be made MORE complex in anyway.

I enjoy playing this so much! It is, at least initially, quite fussy in terms of rules and exceptions (without actually being that heavy from a thought process point of view). Not enough to be a problem though, and once we'd worked our way through a very lengthy first game and worked out how to best do combat it all became much more intuitive. Very thematic - love how each game ends with us running through the memorable moments and inevitably making comparisons to the films. Thought I would much prefer playing as the rebels, but I had a great time as the empire too. And from a purely aesthetic point of view, the thing looks brilliant. I'm a total sucker for the illustrations and all the minis!

Very long Team-based war game. 2 players per team in a game up to 4 players. 2 people try to find the rebel base; the others try to either hide, or get their influence up as rounds increase.   I am not a war game player; I found it quite interesting in some respects.  I like the Red Alert style "building" timeline, but it didn't really make sense how stuff got into the building timeline before it moves.

However, I didn't like the really long down-time, the really long game play (at least 4-5 hours), I didn't like how fighting took 15mins per player.   I found it very tedious and repetitive.  Also it did feel like a very expensive game of hide and seek.

Maybe Star Wars fans will like this one, but its not for me.

RATING: 8
Epic game that reminds me of a two-player Twilight Imperium. Although I prefer the combat system of the latter, there is plenty of theme in this game and the components are awesome.
Unfortunately, there are also a loot of loops and situations that are not addressed in the rulebook that ruin a little bit the gameplay.
Altogether, a very nice asymmetrical game with wonderful components that suffers from poorly written rules (and the hated "half rules here, half rules there" typical of modern FFG rulebooks) and from the fact that it is very, very long (especially the first few games).
Another thing that bothers me a little bit is the fact that sometimes the endgame can be a little anti-climactic, in contrast with the epic things that happens during the gameplay.

My good friend has a copy and we played it. Not a bad game but has a few spots that aggravate me. The plodding nature of movement of ships is particularly irksome but I can get around that.

I'd be willing to play this every now and again but not on a regular basis. It doesn't have the intensity that A Few Acres of Snow has in terms of game play. 

Again, I think a big part of this game's appeal is the minis. I have to admit it's cool to see the Death Stars etc out there, but the game isn't that great but it's not horrible either.

The Salt production in this game is off the charts.

You can't play until you know EVERYTHING in the game, AND have the main strategies of BOTH factions memorized to the point that you can identify them before the first move is taken if possible. because if you didn't you will spend a full turn doing nothing to stop or deter your opponent.

If you are bad at reading people as the empire you will lose. If you have a bad poker face as the rebels you will lose. Both of these situations will have you sitting there for 3-7 HOURS waiting to finally see this happen.

There cards and plays that WILL negate whole rounds of moves you made/make that will occur mostly randomly.

This game is a pain for new players, asking way to much for a frustrating slog of a game that lets your opponent shit in your breakfast.

The Empire of course can instantly win on round one if they accidentally stumble across the base with a fleet movement, and optimal starts where used.

FFG nailed it with this game. This breathes SW-movies all over and is a joy to play. I love the overwhelming presence of the Imperials yet their despair to find the base. I love the counter-insurgency gameplay of the Rebels making precision strikes and doing destabilizing missions all over the galaxy. This is also a game of leaders. Where to assign them, which mission will they take, which fleet will they command or do they stay on guard to counter the plans of the opponent. It makes for a good amount of decisions in the game. 

The game takes a long time to play but honestly that wasn't an issue since I felt so drawn into the game. Afterwards I can tell a good memorable story about the game just played and that's a big plus. 

On combat: the system works and yes there is luck involved but it's not bad at all. It fits the game. I do love how fleet movement works (Twilight Imperium-like), very clever. 

Played both sides and they seem (this is always a big hurdle for FFG) balanced. It would have been near perfect if rules were having more detailed examples.

After a few more plays, the length does not come down. It seems like a valid Imperial strategy is to focus many leaders on movement, downplaying missions because they're not as useful. That seems a shame.

---------------

Two plays in. It's fun, and tense. It's not super deep (compared to a heavy strategic wargame), but I think it has more replay value than some think, given that what missions and leaders you see in each game will vary quite a lot, and the game is all about how those play out. There is also a semi-random initial setup (although use the basic fixed one on your first game), which helps a bit.

It's definitely thematic, especially thanks to being so leader-centric; we were frequently joking about what the characters were going through. Combat is also good; just dice-y enough and card-y enough to get some nice slugs in before continuing with the strategic game. The hidden base mechanic is very nice, as is the way the rebel troops can pop out all over the place. The unit production mechanics are very streamlined.

The miniatures are great quality, as are all the components, as expected.

There's not many cards in the Rebel Objectives deck, and it's a tiered deck (I,II,III cards), so the Empire player usually has a pretty good idea what various things the Rebel will be up to. Perhaps if there were more open-ended, constant things that always garnered reputation (how the Rebel runs out the clock), it might feel like there were more options for the Rebel player. But I'm not sure; maybe the alternatives would be too gamey.

The order in which you get your missions and leaders can have a very big effect. Not sure how much this can be countered.

The rules are pretty straightforward, only a few fine-print points, for example the defensive card-play timing in the combat, and some of the rules concerning the Rebel base and captures/rescues.

Coming in pretty long, 4 hours for admittedly slow players, maybe too long for the luck involved, but this might improve as I play with more experienced players and less new players.

4 players might be fun if both players know what they're doing and are invested, but the actual 4-player mechanics feel clunky and unnecessary. 2 player is better, or playing with teams without any actual split in control. This really is a 2 player game.

Knowing the cards/objectives can help a lot in this kind of game. Using the Rebel objectives reference sheet (in the files section) is probably a good idea until you get a feel for what's in there.

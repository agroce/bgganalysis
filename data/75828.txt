Fun experience, but not completely polished.  Feels like some of the areas should just be ignored, but it would leave some people with nothing to do with.  There's potential here, but it's not quite there yet.

Looks like a faithful adaption of the film and I look forward to trying this when ArtsCow have one of their special offers. The only drawback (as far as I understand the rules) is that the 'Thing' player is known at the start.

This is another geeks attempt at making a game based on one heck of a movie. Unfortunatly the game play didn`t
invoke the same excitement as our own homemade game and
we felt the game dragged. The graphic design is excellent,but they dropped the ball on simulating the paranoid feeling that the movie really invokes. Prefer playing our own game to experience that creepy paranoid feeling.

For all of the neat options here, the game is a complicated exercise in allocating people and rolling a lot of dice. The buckets of dice detract from the paranoia aspect of the game, in my opinion.

The Things (Expansion)


It's a little rough around the edges, but this is certainly one of the finest print-and-play games I've ever seen.  I think with some refinement, this could be a blockbuster licensed game for any company.  Question is, with the remake doing the tepid business it did, would anyone even bother?

I wish there were something that humans could do against another human player who was obviously a thing and is just sandbagging cards.  That's probably the only part missing from the game.  Of course, everyone knows they'll either be fighting that player or burning him in the end, so it might even out.

First tentative rating after one play. I really had the impression of watching the movie again, but this time I was in it! 
Combat with the Thing(s) is epic, I'm really digging our next game. :)

UPDATE
AMAZING GAME!!!
In my last game as a Thing I was stomped upon by the Outpost. I failed everything. BUT in the end the Humans blasted each other out in the sky! Giving me a nice win! :D :D :D

UPDATE
AMAZING PLAY

I found myself wanting to play this quite often, so I believe this is a 10!

Played it at the club (1st Mn) last nite - check our guild for the AAR: not bad. Thanks, Gordo, for putting the game together for us.

Basically, a Battlestar Galactica. 5 of us played and we did have a good time. The remaining two of us humans managed to burn the damm thing. Humanity saved.

Had a great time with this. As a simulation of the movie I think it's brilliant and totally captures the paranoia.

As a game it's fun but does become a bit repetitive and I have mixed feelings about the ending - it mimics the end of the movie very well and it's tense but there's something unsatisfying about getting to the end only to lose based on one decision when a PC-thing doesn't have to sabotage anything the whole game to earn trust and win. Contrast with BSG where the cylons have to sabotage/reveal at some point.

Decent paranoia game.  Can be real fun in the proper group (or boring experience in another one).  You'd better cover up the mechanical activities in words and lively discussions to increase the odds.

After 1 play I cannot quite judge the balance between The Thing and the humans or if the mechanics works without any cracks, because the game (and especially triggering the final resolution) is multi-dimensional.

Played for the first time on 4-Mar-2015 with five players.  Since we were unfamiliar with the game, we spent about a half hour to 45 minutes getting the game set up and going, but paranoia quickly gripped the team.  The Thing player was moving fast, killing off NPC's, and handing out suspicion cards.  In the final confrontation, 3 players remained and decided to "Wait and See..."  A bad move.

I must say that I liked it.  It plays alot like a "Battlestar Galactica-Lite", i.e. Crisis management. The final decision to Burn or Wait was interesting but sort of anti-climatic as there weren't too many clues about some NPC behavior in our first play. (It was a NPC in the toolshed who was infected 1 turn before being locked in the Tool Shed after being left in the Rec Room the prior turn, so the only "clue" was whether he attacked in the Final Battle or not).  I would play again in a heart beat & the quotes make the game.

Bravo to the designer for making this game. It feels like the Carpetner movie of the 80s, especially with a bearded Kurt Russell floating around for the entire game. And you can calso tell that the designer is a huge fan of the movie as well, almost too much of a fan. Designers who set out to make perfect simulations of those things that they love will always end up with a muddled and over bearing design that can suffer from all sorts of maladies. While this game is quite fun in parts it is also suffers from this bloat. Too much of a good thing can nearly ruin a game and I kind of feel like that is what happens with this one. First off there are WAY too many decks of cards. I'm talking more than 10 different decks if I am not mistaken. Secondly having 5 different ways from the alien player to win just makes their play jumbled and non focused. What this design really needs was/is an editor. Someone who looks at the game as a whole and balances out the designers fandom with the needs of what makes a good game good. I am positive this would turn this game into something that could rival BSG for hidden traitor mechanic games.

OK, I have taken my Big Boy Pill (TM) and managed to get a copy of the games ordered from Artscow. Many thanks to Mark for assistance and help!

Already starting to drool for the game now! The original movie is my absolute all-time fav and the Kurt Russell one isn't bad either! 

My rating is a placeholder until I feel justified in putting a better # up. 8^)

Totally thematic and will appeal to fans of the movie.  Sure it's available on Artscow but even all the fans won't end up getting this so it would still be a unique game to have in any collection.  Still, a 150 owners for a PnP game is a pretty good indictor of a solid game.  I like the different possible victory conditions (see description) allowing for a few different card play strategies.

I like games with hidden allegiances and the potential for traitors but you'll notice that there really aren't any (except maybe BANG! The Dice Game) on my list. That's because most of games that feature these things don't end up delivering an overall experience that wows me (or, I simply haven't played them yet). It's either too long and overdone (BSG) or too "airy" to be anything more satisfying than filler (Resistance or Spyfall).

Of course, The Thing was an easy sell for me because it's based on one of my favorite films of all time. The fact that the theme and setting of the film lends itself perfectly (and I mean perfectly) to a game about hidden traitors or the threat thereof is the icing on the cake.

So, if you're unaware, The Thing is about the crew of an Antarctic research outpost who discover an alien life form. This life form has the ability to absorb and perfectly imitate any living creature it touches. It doesn't just look like you, it acts like you and even thinks like you. Realizing this, the crew slowly begins to distrust each other. "If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know if it was really me?"

So, you have one player who begins the game representing the titular "Thing" and enacting it's machinations: either kill/assimilate the rest of the crew or escape Antarctica altogether. The rest of the players are members of the "Outpost Crew" and their job is to survive long enough to figure out who's infected and then get rid of them.

At the beginning, all of the players are still Human but every turn, the "Thing-player" might pass a card to someone. That card means one of two things: either the player is just being made to look suspicious but is still Human...or the player has been infected and is now secretly working for the Thing! No one is allowed to show their cards. People can beg and plead their innocence (or grind their axe by pointing fingers) all they want but you never quite know for sure who you can really trust.

There's a great deal of nuance and subtlety to the puzzle of this game, so much so that I won't go into detail here and that it takes a couple of plays for players to really see how everything comes together. But it's an easy game to play at surface-level. It just takes time to come to know how every decision impacts the big picture.

Also, being print-and-play only, it's not the most accessible game for many potential players, and I think that's a real shame. When it all comes together and you've got a group willing to put themselves into the theme, this is one of the most interesting and memorable game experiences I can imagine having.

"This is U.S. Station 31. You read me? We found something in the ice. We need some help down here. Can anybody hear me? We found something! We found something."

Quality horror films are a delicious treat when you can find them - including this game's namesake.  I can't count the number of times I saw this movie on Showtime as a teen. This, of course, had no effect on my adult development, as we all know how perfectly normal I am.

So yes, we can respect the alien inside all of us and agree that John Carpenter's original is an edgy, oozy masterpiece.  But everything about the game screams "home movie".  No doubt the author and his pedigree have their hearts in the right place, but his labor of love is savagely underdeveloped and undertested.  I never once felt like I had a significant decision to make, and [i]The Thing[/i] managed to do the one thing that no other game has ever managed to accomplish - it literally put me to sleep.  Now THAT is saying something.

[b]Man is the warmest place to hide.[/b]

The Thing was an incredibly difficult game to design, that required me re-watching the film countless times (which I thoroughly enjoyed). It's surprising how much you miss on the first 20 viewings of a film, and it's only when having to make a game about a movie that you must focus extremely hard on the detail - more so than any "normal" fan would ever need, or wish, to.

Due to the nature of this game - one player against many (initially) - when the shit starts, the sides change suddenly and in unexpected ways. This leads to a game that is protean and intricate. Virtually all team games shape themselves by having a known number of players on each side - my Thing game has sides that may change every other turn, or every turn. Think about it, balancing a game may be the hardest struggle of all in the crafting of a game. So, a fair criticism of this game may be that at times it swings - yes, it does. That's the nature of the organism. It bats out of the park more times than it does not, however. My Thing game also features a 'controversial' funnelled ending, which is not to all tastes, but, after reading the huge number of negative comments on a similar Thing-inspired game, feel that my game-ending fixes the problems that others have encountered. Though I only now see this in hindsight, as my game crashed from outer space first into BGG's frozen PnP wastes.

My goal was to design a great "Thing" game, and have it give the players the "Battlestar Galactica" treachery zing, but have it play in 60-80 minutes (not 3+ hours) with 5 or 6 players - which it does. And pretty consistently, I might add. It also plays well with just 2 players (much less psychological warfare, obviously), and I find that a rarity in this form of game.

I'm fascinated by players' thoughts and comments, so feel free to leave them publicly - which I'm sure you will (you don't need my permission!).

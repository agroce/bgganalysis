[I]tl;dr - Flick 'em Up is ambitious, and a great way to spend two hours, but can sometimes drag on for longer than the game is fun.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Flick 'Em Up is a dielightful game that's just begging to be played to a sharp Western soundtrack. In this game, you are competing teams of cowboys trying to shoot each other down and take control of a western town. But as a dexterity game, you will be actually moving your cowboys around, and actually shooting grey disks to take down your opponents. 

The components are all wooden with high-quality standees for the buildings. I love the little cowboy hats that you flip over to show activity. The game ships in a big wooden box that's absolutely gorgeous with some nice artwork. I did find the rulebook confusing in spots but it is nicely laid out and constructed. 

Overall, this is a nice game if you're into the dexterity element. Some of the scenarios are pretty great, while others are too complicated or too slow. [b]Overall, the game drags on too much for what it is, though I enjoyed it and probably wouldn't turn down a game.[/b]

Pitch car with a western theme! Excellent! Like Pitchcar, this really is a toy with amazing production values. Brilliantly elegant ideas such as duels and entering/exiting buildings. Everything is just lovely here and it *feels* like a western showdown in every way. For kids and adults to play together, this is a winner.

Fun in a box. Really good for a big group as it supports up to 10 players. I didn't think I would enjoy so much the whole dexterity thing and was pleasantly surprised. The game is not without its problems, you will need a big area and I don't mean just a big table space, but als space aroind the table for players to move around. It's possible that players inflexible with rules will feel some disconfort as it is dead certain something will get knocked off and repositioned in a different manner and they will feel harmed. It is a game where everybody wins when there is fun and everybody loses when someone wants to win at any cost. Great components

The cities in the West are not the safest place to be. In the disc-flicking game Flick 'em Up!, you can become an outlaw and rob banks, free prisoners, attack innocent bystanders... or you could become the Sheriff and try to protect the people of your city from these bandits!

Relive the great adventures of the West, face your enemies in street duels, use different guns and tactics to get what you want. You can follow the scenarios or create your own—the choice is yours, cowboy!

Played this in a board game cafe and got a lot of attention from the other customers. You need a largish smooth surface with space to walk right round so you can shoot from any angle.

Played the wooden version and own the plastic version and there's very little (beyond aesthetics) to pick between them. The plastic is solid and dense and weighty enough.

This is my go to "party game" in the sense that this is great to play with a group of friends while enjoying some drinks. Very quick to pick up and extremely engaging. Takes a bit to set up and requires a decent amount of table space to play "comfortably", but an amazing game either way.

Can be a very fun game, but there are a lot of caveats.  The game takes a long time to set up, you have to be willing to make up your own rules and scenarios, and you have to have a group that isn't super picky about making sure the rules are followed perfectly.

Fantastic wild west themed miniatures war game that is played with dexterity instead of a fistful of dice and an encyclopedia of rules. Teachable in five minutes or less and fun to setup while teaching. Be warned to not play near any holes in the ground because I promise you will lose a piece into the hole as the pieces gets flung off the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dexterity games tend to fall closer to abstracts than to themed games... that is until Flick 'em Up! rode into town.  This game fully embraces its theme and drips with it.  Components are top notch (and justify the price) and really set the stage well.  Game play - regardless of player count - runs smoothly thanks to the activation tracking with hats and gangs.  The different scenarios make the game take on vastly different objective feels while using all the same basic rules.  And it turns out its a well done dexterity game to boot.  This is a game that benefits from table talk and fast play.  You're flinging bullets in a shoot out - not maneuvering chess men - so get on with the action and keep it going.  Expansions for this are surely to work and integrate well and there is just so much more potential material out there.  Ah heck, you even make your own Wild West Show scenario and it'll be a smashing hit.

RATING: 7

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It should not be possible to make a game bad that's about flicking little wooden bullets at tiny wooden cowboys and cacti. But they somehow managed to make all the interesting things impossible (ricochets for the most), while coming up with very specific rules on how to flip: basically, if there would be a way to make it impossible to reach the bullet/disc with your hand, that's the way it's gonna be.

And while the frustrating chaos is fun for a few minutes, so is flicking around other board game pieces, i do not this game for that. On top of that, the somewhat unbalanced scenarios are made worse by turn timers which take the remaining fun out of a silly game like this. Gah!

Initial Impression: This is probably my favorite of all the dexterity games that I've played so far. The cowboy-meeples are large and chunky, the buildings are very sturdy. The game is light on rules, which actually works well for a game of this nature. My only concern is that most scenarios boil down to "last man standing". If you're naturally a better shot than everyone else, you'll win. Also the game can get a bit fiddly, with the various counters and having to flip cowboy hats. Overall, this is a wonderfully produced, thematic, dexterity game that I would love to add to my collection.

RATING: 8
Carabande as a semi-strategic game? Looks ridiculous, but it isn't. You have the fun of a flickering game and actions that has to be well-thought. Still skill is most important, but it gives something extra that you have to think about your actions.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game, but it is definitely a game for those times when you and some friends are hanging out, having a beer (literally or figuratively).  It isn't complex, and it can sometimes be annoying if even one person gets frustrated at their flicks (find out who those are and keep away if you want to play this game - they can suck the soul out of it!).  But if you and your group get in the mood, it can be a very fun night!

- op basis van één speelbeurt, enkel het basisspel -
Twee teams nemen het tegen elkaar op om mekaars cowboys uit te schakelen.
Dit doe je door ze te raken met een schijf die je wegschiet.

Nogal wat wachttijd als je met meerderen in een team zit.

Ziet er erg leuk uit, maar een eerste speelbeurt maakte mij toch niet warm.
Is dit een party game?  Dan zou je met veel moeten zijn, en is er redelijk wat wachttijd.
Of is dit een beter spel voor met 2 ?  Dat kan wel, dan speel je gewoon tegen elkaar.

Misschien geven andere scenarios een ander beeld.

Maar goed, het is niet mijn genre spele.

I love this game in my collection for the fact that it's so different. It's light, intuitive, and  it satisfies my childhood itch to flick things across the table. And there's actually a bit more strategy involved with playing than initially thought, at least once you get past the first couple scenarios. Such as who's going to guard this bank while who's going to dash into the saloon to steal some phat loots? 

It'll never be something I'll suggest as the main-event-game of the night (unless it's a heavy drinking/children involved kind of night maybe) but lighter games I enjoy are few and far in between, so it'll certainly see it's fair share of play.

Got the plastic version and it's worth the thirty buck retail...I don't know if I would think as highly of it if I had paid retail for the wooden component version however. For things in the $50+ dollar range (my local game store sells it for like 65 plus tax), I demand something much more heavy.

After 2 games I'm disappointed. The rule and scenario books look impressively huge but on inspection they are simply bulked out with multiple languages. Even then, the few English rules are sparse with blank spaces and unnecessarily huge leading between the lines of the text itself. They are vague in content as well and upon playing I was instantly confronted with confusion and edge cases. 

The main problem I think is that it requires more table space than what I had as everything became instantly chaotic. I was chasing bullets around the room, and an assortment of other pieces were flying all over the place. This would probably work better if scenery pieces were made of cast iron. As it stands it's an exercise in frustration with little guiding structure.

EDIT: Five plays now, and my rating's gone down a bit after my immediate excitement, as I have found what others have, that some of the scenarios aren't amazing. But it's so easy and fun, it's a gorgeous production, and right now my go to gateway game as it gets people so excited when the see it set up on the table, not to mention when they find out that they don't have to learn any rules. Only knock against it on that front is that it doesn't introduce anything to new players mechanically, but it does show people just how silly and entertaining games can be, and true to the company's name, is a great "beer and pretzels" game.

Pretty much pure fun!  A bunch of flicking dexterity games using a wild west theme, and a bunch of different scenarios to introduce new, fun, elements to every game.

You'll be doing all the things you'd expect to be doing in a wild west game: shooting, drinking, dueling, horse riding, etc, and it's all done very cleverly and intuitively.  I can really think of a dexterity game out there that has this much theme, which makes it really fun!

It doesn't take much to get me to love a flicking game, but this is a tough game to love out of the box. This looks like a silly party game, but I actually think it works best as a light tactical combat game - this is partially due to the fact that there are a LOT of wonky rules surrounding movement, which is offputting in casual play. There's much more to consider than is evident at first blush - how to make the most of turn order and when and how to use cover are crucial for success.

Coming from other flicking games it's quite hard to adjust to NOT being able to use your thumb as part of your flick. There's a few reasons it makes sense for this game, but I have to say I don't find the low-power flicks nearly as satisfying. Oh well.

And ontop of all that, the included scenarios are mostly garbage. Honestly, just do straight team deathmatches or make your own - the ones in the book are just an exercise in frustration and imbalance. 

Speaking of the rulebook, it's not great. Turn order in particular is worded poorly. But essentially it's this: 
>There is "player order" and "cowboy order".
>Player order is decided for each team at the beginning of the game. The starting player rotates each round in player order.
>>e.g., Bob is player 1 on the two-person lawman team, Rita is player 2. Round 1 Bob goes first, then Rita. Round 2, Rita goes first, then Bob.
>At the start of a new round, the cowboy with the initiative token MUST be activated first by that team's starting player.
>On subsequent turns, players are free to activate any cowboy they choose who has not been activated yet this round.
>The initiative token only moves when the cowboy holding it is killed - his killer immediately claims it.

...But when you've got all that down and buff out the rough edges, this is a REALLY fun and unique flicking game. The theme shines, and you can just enjoy the tense showdowns and feeling like a cowboy. There's nothing else quite like it.

And on that final note, the real reason I think this stinks as a party game: I absolutely prefer this as a 2v2 game or 1v1 game. Unless you have REALLY on point players and no distractions, a full compliment of 10 can easily double the game's length. And while I like the harsh movement rules because they allow the fun cover system to function, it sucks when you only get one shot at moving someone per round and blow it. This is a great 2p game full of psychology, and as for multiplayer 2v2 has - to me - the best balance of team strategizing, satisfying control, and speed of play.

Silly good fun. I love Crokinole and that is probably the king of dexterity/flicking games, but I'm instantly hooked by this dex game with a theme.

Only played the first scenario, but that was enough to have me pleased with this pickup. It works perfectly fine as a two player game.

Sure, the rulebook is a bit vague in areas, but if you rules interpret on the fly and don't take this too seriously I bet this would be an instant hit with most casual gaming groups. And with fun-loving heavy gamers too :)

Just a wee bit boring. Feels more like child's play than a board game. Not sure why. I love dexterity games, especially Crokinole, but this is just a bit of a letdown.

Best dexterity game ever.  And with a western theme.  Great packaging with the wooden box and you get lots of top notch wooden components for the price.  My only quibble is with trying to fit the bag from the Stallion Canyon expansion into the base game's box as it recommends to do in the exp's rulebook.  No big deal though as the canvas bag is very nice.

Gorgeous looking dexterity game.  Production quality is over the top.  Gameplay is fun.  Not a deeply strategic game, even though there are a few positioning tactics to enable hiding, cover, etc...  but the amount of fun in achieving a really hard hit or the relief not to get your guys hit on easy mark makes up for it ten times.  A lot of fun, if you're into party games, if you want a game that creates a general fun mood or if you like light/medium weight games with a lot of replay value, Flick 'em Up is a perfect fit!

Because the gameplay is not THAT engaging, not on the same level as PitchCar.

Requires a lot of space to play and the special events and items require some digging through the rulebook.. but when you can put it together.. hoo boy!  This was a surprise hit of my collection.  Cheering for your team's shots and moves and strategizing how to go about achieve your goal turned this into a BLAST of a team game.  The best laid plans can fall apart with an errant shot or move forcing you to be constantly working with your team to choose angles and strategy on the fly.  Best played with desperado accents and lots of cross table taunting and joking around.

Repeated plays find us teaching the game and playing the opening few scenarios over and over. This is fine, as the later scenarios we have been able to play take longer and longer to play, especially when there's a larger group of players. We had trouble getting it to the table, and our big table having a leaf in it made it difficult for play at home. Traded away, but would play someone else's copy, as it is fun every once in a while.

Fun game. Very light in strategy (it's dexterity game after all). If you are hard core gamer and don't like games that are just fun for an hour or so, skip this.

Played some scenarios where you have task to do, things that need to be done to win scenario and yet we just chose to kill each other. Moderate fun, mainly for kids, I would say.

Components: Awesome, sturdy components. I dislike the cowboy artwork; the faces look hardly human. I dislike having to flick with my finger without using my thumb; seems like a disadvantage to kids. Would be better if it came with a little flicker.

Experience: Amusing. There are tactical opportunities depending on which cowboys have the most/least health, and what objects are nearby for cover. But the flicking makes it random enough that it doesn't seem to matter much.

First dexterity game I bought and it is hilarious. It's tactical and turn based but also skill based. We played with mixed teams of varying skill level and everyone enjoyed it. The compnents are good quality and nice and chunky and there's even building, scenery and cover in the box. I have the plastic version that is literally half the price of the wooden one and I'm glad I didn't splash on that one. Great game.

A wild west themed game where you set an old town up on the table and have a shoot out. The only catch? Everything  (people, bullets, dynamite) in the game is wooden and you have to flick them to use them. I've made a house rule that we have to listen to Will Smith's Wild Wild West soundtrack while playing. Not the whole thing, just the main theme. Over and over and over again. Awesome.

Western themed flicking game, very much in the Carabande, Elkfest, Catacombs area.  Players play on two teams - the bad guys or the lawmen, and play through one of several scenarios included in the game.  Game play is simple, and the scenarios are quite interesting.  The rules are a little loose in edge case situations, but it's the sort of game where this shouldn't stop you from having fun.  Production is off the charts - solid pieces, and a great wooden box.  Great fun.

I don't generally get excited about dexterity games, but Flick 'em Up is a near exception. The various scenarios and well produced obstacles help develop the western setting, while useful tidbits like the rifle (a piece of cardboard that helps you shoot straight) make for some exciting finger flickin'. There are a surprising amount of rules on what you can and cannot hit, and how you can and cannot flick, but for the more casual crowd, just let your fingers fly and have a good time. Overall, a pretty good package, just not something I'd like to consistently spend time with.

Played at DTC 2015. It's a scenario based tactical miniatures game, the twist being it's a dexterity disk-flicking game. I don't like tactical miniatures games in general, and this one is no exception. It was boring and fiddly. I actually do like most flicking dexterity games. I already own and love both Crokinole and PitchCar. This game does nothing better than those two and is very expensive. Pass.

Not your typical board game as its a game based more on physical skill rather than the usual boardgame fare. Rating based on playing the beginner(first) scenario with 4 players.  The pieces are of a high quality wood variety that should hold up after a lot of flicking.  There is some strategy in how you move and who you attack but in the end its all about how well you can flick the little "bullet" ala some kind of new school marbles.  Its definitely a fun party-style game and I'd like to try other scenarios.

I finally got to play this latenight (at the WBC) and it did not disappoint. What a hoot to play a cowboy and face off against others in a gunfight. The game creates great tension with missed easy shots and unlikely made long shots.

I like that there are different scenarios that create goals beyond just killing each other. The one I played was about grabbing money from the saloon/bank and taking to the bank/saloon. Once in the same building as an opponent, you two face off in a duel. Each time you miss, your opponent moves closer to you for his shot. Ai ai ai!

It's not a game I need to own and probably will only play at conventions, but it hits a unique spot perfectly. Would probably be even better with some beers.

I'm not normally a big fan of "flicking" as a mechanic -- I don't like Rampage/Terror In Meeple City at all -- so I figured this would be easy for me to dismiss. Wrong. Whereas Rampage over-complicated a lot of game elements, with multiple different dexterity mechanics, power and superpower cards, player screens, etc., this was a simple western shoot 'em up, and I love it.  Also, the components are amazing, and the entire production really brings out the theme.

Only played a complete game of Flick Em Up once, and found it to be too fiddly, complex, and drawn-out for what it is.  I don't feel a strong need to own lots of dexterity games, so this was replaced by the vastly superior and more fun Junk Art.

I do think it would be better with fewer players, but I prefer the simple laughs from a flicking game like Pitchcar to this one.

It seems like I don't enjoy dexterity games. Because this one has the coolest possible theme and components. And the rules actually make up a game that works well. The rest is on the players, and it sadly fell really flat for me. The whole time, I was thinking about how much fun kids could have with this game. But for me, it was sadly nothing but a distraction and not a very effective one either. I can't make up my mind about how to rate the game: I think that if someone likes dexterity games, than it's probably awesome. If you don't - and I was really surprised to find myself in this latter group - than it's no fun at all, except if kids are also joining in too.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

Thematic dexterity game.

Only tried the first scenario so far so my rating may go up once I try the cooler ones with buildings and different objectives.

Components are very cool but I wish there was more neutral stuff like cactus included. Also requires you to have a nice big SMOOTH table for the game to work well

It's light and fun.  We played 4p and 8p.  This game suffers at higher player counts due to down time between each person's turn.  It's hard to stay engaged in the fun of it all when you have to wait 5 minutes before you can do anything again.  No more than 4p for this one.

UPDATE: Played a few more times. Once you get past the rules and understanding how the game works and can stop thinking about that, this game gets hilarious.  Even when you accidentally hit the bullet, there's a thematic explanation, you misfired and shot your own foot.  Duels are great.  Long shots are amazing fun.  Running from building to building is great.

This game lived up to the hype. I had a blast playing this with my family. The only caveat I would say is that I enjoyed this much more as a 2 player game than a 4 player game. I kind of equate this to playing pool head to head with somebody or in teams. When you play in teams you have to wait awhile between turns and it can get boring. I had a lot more fun head vs head as I was constantly in the action. Overall though I think this is a great game. I would choose it over Crokinole any day of the week!

A dexterity game that feels to me like a replacement for beer pong.  the down time between turns vs the activity of your turn really feels like something that should be set up for people to wander in an out of while they do something else.

Más accesible y casual que Catacombs. Se puede jugar en un sitio pequeño y tiene reglas muy narrativas como los rifles o los duelos, a los peques les encanta.

Estos juegos es lo que yo denomino chorras para un rato, la verdad es que yo los tengo por el crío, pero ya no me veo comprandolos por mi mismo. Son divertidos un par de veces, pero luego ya no te apetece jugarlos, acabas saciado enseguida. ahora, mi hijo y yo estamos acabando con todos los escenarios.

Los componentes en la edición de plástico están muy bien y aunque hay gente que se ha quejado de que se mueven y se caen, es que el juego es lo que es, no esperes que los escenarios no se meneen.

For my money, I feel that Crossbows and Catapults delivers a very similar experience and one that actually offers more strategic decisions. If you strongly favor flicking over rubber-band powered propulsion, this is a fine choice though. 

I feel in a sense that the rules of this game had some of the fun playtested right out of them. Flicking by using your thumb is not allowed. Ricochets are not allowed. You can only knock one thing over at a time. No opportunity to change shooting order of your figures. No hitting guys when they are down. All of these things feel like rules that didn't start out in place at the beginning, but were then added in to avoid anything "broken" happening. See, this game about flicking cowboys is very serious. 

There is a fine line between curtailing degenerate strategies and removing all opportunity for clever play. I feel this game toes that line a bit. 

Complaints aside, I'm always happy to play this and it works great even as a party-style game for large groups of players. Certainly the components look fantastic on the table as well. It's a very approachable experience.

Vadnyugati témájú pöckölös játék. Két 5 fős csapat próbálja kilőni egymást, így akár 10 ember is játszhatja a játékot. Két akció van mindenkinek. Lehet a nagy koronggal pöckölni mozgáskén, vagy a kicsivel lövésként. Ha az ellenfél figurája feldől, veszít egy életet a három életerejéből. Ilyenkor az egyik akcióját a felállásra kell elköltenie. Vannak szalmabálák, kaktuszok, hordók mint fedezékek. Vannak különböző épületek, ahová bemenve különféle feladatokat lehet elvégezni. Szerintem a 6-12 éves fiúknak való játék, akik biztos nagyon élveznék a játékot. Nekem ez nem jött be.

I'm biased towards liking dexterity games due to being proficient at them. They are generally focused around uncontested-skills, making them fun for those that excel at them, and not for those that don't. No matter how good your strategy, you will not win if you can't flick a disk well.

I prefer Catacombs(& Castles) which fills the same niche, but with more strategy.

Awesome dexterity wild west dexterity game. Have a shootout in the middle of town while trying to rob the bank and get the money back to your hideout. Good amount of scenarios for just about any type of game you want to play (basic deathmatch, stealing objectives, etc...).

From what I've played it seems like the game can snowball a bit once one team has killed one of your cowboys since they effectively reduce the number of turns that you can do per round.

Overall really fun and really good components. It's worth getting the fancier wooden edition.

The rulebook does have some parts that are a bit hard to read as a result of translations.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2015)

In theory I should love flicking games, but in practice they almost always bore me very quickly. Flick´em Up! is an ok game with a strong thematic setting.

The game components are gorgeous and very well done. The rules are very easy to learn and teach.

It is a very thematic game, but it isn’t a theme I particularly enjoy.

I feel it is best with 4 players, with more the downtime begins to be too much for me.

The gameplay is very light and obvious, you need to kill your opponents before they kill you, and that´s all there is to it.

Bottom line, I think Flick´em Up! is among the best flicking games I have played, but it is still not enough for me to buy it, I find it shallow and repetitive. I’m open to play more scenarios but in general, it is way too light for my current tastes.

I have to admit that my rating of 4 is after playing only 1 scenario (the first one). I really wanted to like this game, so I am hoping this rating increases after playing a couple more scenarios. Unfortunately my first play left me loving the production value of the game but kind of bored with the mechanics in general. Also, I felt like the game lent itself to a run-away leader since losing a cowboy means that you lose 2 actions a round. That can be huge.

With a beautiful production and spot-on theme, Flick always draws a crowd. Is great as an event game. 

A few minor gripes: potential for lots of downtime when playing more than 2v2; set-up/tear-down is a bear; the cardboard tears easily. Otherwise this is a nice, light, fun dexterity game for gaming events. While certainly not a brain-burner, executing the perfect flick can still be quite stressful, in a good way.

I thought this game would be a homerun with my 7 and 10 year-old daughters. It wasn't. It is beautifully made (wooden edition) and the theme shines but the dexterity challenge doesn't engage them and they get impatient with all the fiddling with hats and tiles etc. I might enjoy it more if I played with adults who are young at heart. Rating may improve if I get a chance to play under different circumstances.

Fun game, but not quite as fun as it looks. It is really easy to lose the "bullets" and other pieces. A bit too hectic of a game for any real strategy and can be a bit too long between turns for 5+ players (recommend with 2 or 4). I still rate it very highly, but it probably gets a bump due to the lack of similar games (Terror in Meeple City being an example). I suppose I overrate games with little competition, but I think that's only because I enjoy new experiences.

I do need to keep in mind that the lip of the table, and the amount of space I don't have to play this game are significant factors.

Funny little game were you are trying to hit other players with your flicks. It is nice dexterity game.

2016-08-03 - 7 - It's pretty funny and I would like to try different scenarios. Sometimes even the easiest shot is misssed, which adds some tension to the game! I wonder though if this game has long legs. I played only with 2 players and maybe  more players makes it better.

2016-10-30 - 7->5 - After 4 player game this one went down for me to "if there is nothing else to play I might play it once". But I expected it to be better with 4 than with 2! My worries about legs, which occured pretty short, were justified. I got bored by it pretty quickly.

Great dexterity game where you play as a gang of outlaws or as the law in a wild west town.  Tons of wood in this game.  Flick "bullet" cylinders to try to take out your opponent's team or succeed in a mission before they do the same to you.  Great fun!  :-D

Nagyon jópofa játék, leginkább a hangulata erős, vicces partikra lehet számítani. Nyilván a fa kiadás sokkal szebb, de szerintem rendben van ez a műanyag kiadás is, nem azt mondom, hogy top kategória, de ezért az árért elég korrekt tartalom van a dobozban, szóval ilyen szempontból nyilván érthető a költséghatékonyabb megoldás.

Stratégiát azért nem sokat lehet belevinni a játékba, csak pár apróság van, amitől úgy érezheti az ember, hogy na, számít, hogy milyen sorrendben aktiválja az embereket, így egyértelműen teljesen ügyességi játéknak nevezném minden más egyéb elem nélkül. :)

I like this better than other flicking games I've owned or played such as Catacombs primarily because having to knock over pieces is a better mechanic and the whole 3D look of the game both works better visually plus adds mechanics to enter and exit buildings, shoot from inside and other elements that change things up.  At a very basic level the play area is so much larger than catacombs and this is a good thing.  Also the Winchester rifle launcher works well and the theme really comes across well as even kids can get engaged with it.

Hard to go wrong with wild west meeples, cute plastic cacti, and a card board standee town.  Although, I do admit that like most flick-y games, it made me hyper, and I ended up shooting my own meeples in the back.  This was a ton of fun and more strategic than I was expecting.  Being able to hide and shoot out of the buildings created some interesting moments.  It's really tough to root someone out.

Great dexterity game with a western theme. Each team has a group of either outlaws or lawmen and your goal is to shoot each one with bullets to accomplish the objective. The components are top-notch and the gameplay can be nerve-wracking, but all-in-all its a pretty fun game. Be prepared, though for someone to make that annoying western call by whistling it.

A new take on dexterity games that seems so simple it is a wonder why no one did this prior.  

The theme and gameplay of shootouts tied in with quality components (including the box itself) make Flick 'Em Up one darned tootin' good time.

When push comes to shove there is a lot of whitespace in the rules for positioning.  But the game is not serious enough to matter. 

Wooden box is awesome.

The cities in the West are not the safest place to be. In the disc-flicking game Flick 'em Up!, you can become an outlaw and rob banks, free prisoners, attack innocent bystanders... or you could become the Sheriff and try to protect the people of your city from these bandits!

Relive the great adventures of the West, face your enemies in street duels, use different guns and tactics to get what you want. You can follow the scenarios or create your own—the choice is yours, cowboy!

So far my wife keeps kicking my butt on this.  I need to practice my flicking abilities.  I actually had a couple family members say they hate this...they were half joking, half not...if you're not good at flicking, you might have a bad time...if you're ok at flicking though, it's really cute and fun and feels thematic in its own cute way.

The setup takes forever. 


It's trying to tell a story in the scenarios but I'm not so sure that comes across strongly.  But I'm still glad it's there to give you something to talk about in the game.

The theme does evoke a fair amount of jokes as you play the game.  I appreciate that.

It does feel like a game takes a long time.  Unless you only played with 2 players, but that wouldn't be fun.  IT feels best at 4 players but still takes too long for some reason.  There's nothing to do between turns and your turn all boils down to the action of flicking.  Maybe my group just takes too long.

This is a satisfying flicking game that seems as niche as Pitch Car. With a willing group, the game is fun and offers more decision points and strategy than you might expect at first blush.

There seems to be a ton of hang ups about the lack of definitive rules. I found it as refreshing as Pitch Car; you make the distances and other aspects scale to the skill level of your group.

Jeu de Flick, dextérité à la western spaghetti.
Le matériel est d'une grande qualité, les règles sont simples, le jeu prend un peu de place sur la table.

Le jeu parait enfantin, mais on se rend compte rapidement que les déplacements sont hautement tactique et on retrouve des sensation de jeux d’escarmouche. Bien entendue, ça reste un jeu d'adresse, donc ça ne se passera pas toujours comme prévue à moins d'être un As du Flick.

Un jeu terriblement amusant, quoi qu'il en soit.

Interesting game. Need a large space to make it interesting, as too closed a space will just eventually results in tons of consecutive hits and pieces flying all over the place. However, large space will mean that younger players might stretch a lot, and have difficulty with their shots. Still, the interactive aspect of the game makes it very interesting.

Somewhat disappointing and not sure why.  Seems like a great idea and I can't quite place what is missing.  For one thing, it does not seem like it is well suited for multiplayer, which just introduces downtime more than anything.  I like the scenarios.  I am hoping with more play it will become more straight forward and then engrossing.

This is a really fun game and a GREAT game for my non-gamer friends, younger kids.   It's a simple flicking game... but then it adds some strategy.  Very cool, very original.  My biggest criticism would be the box.  I really love the wood box and the idea but there are two issues.  First, the lid warped and it doesn't fit properly now without some  finagling.  Second, when the building are on their stands they don't all fit in the box well, very difficult to place them without detaching each time.  Constant attaching/detaching really wrecks the bottoms of the buildings.  So I love the game, but I wish a tiny bit more thought went into storage once it's assembled.

This is a clever game and the scenarios and rules give it a nice element of tactical thinking that goes beyond the basic dexterity. That is, good tactical thinking and mediocre dexterity can usually beat great dexterity and spotty planning.

So easy to get into/teach, with awesome wooden components and so much thought in the attention to detail everywhere. The game idea, the rules, components, scenarios and the way things work together.

[b]Top-notch components. Very cool to look at.
Rules are a bit more complicated than for some other flicking games. There are also more interesting decisions to make than in, say, "Rumms" - like which cowboy to activate when, whether to hide or move into attack position etc. Or first game took quite long, but that'll get better with more flicking practice.[/b]

Kind of works but not really.  Flicking is funish, but the game is not nearly as entertaining as the similar games my brother and I made up when we were kids.  Still, it codifies some of that stuff with concrete rules, and adds lots of little bits to allow a variety of game setups.

The plastic version is nice. Flicking is fun, no doubt about that, and the basic idea of the game is good. What I don't like is the rule book that's full of gaping holes – in order to be able to play the game, you'd need a proper FAQ, but there isn't one, so you need to come up with plenty of house rules. Ugh. Also I can see this being quite intolerable with lots of players, and probably best with just two.

Indifferent.

Dexterity game based around different scenarios in a Wild West town. Two players, each control 5 cowboys. Every round each cowboy has two actions which can be either shoot or move.

Great thematic dexterity game. Looks brilliant and has a simple rule set. Definitely needs to be played on a big table otherwise it can become a little fiddly. I own the plastic version but have played the wooden version as well. Although the components aren't as good quality, the insert and small box more than make up for it. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, they play identically to one another. 

It hasn't dethroned PitchCar as my go to flicking game but I can see Flick 'em Up! remaining in my collection for a long time.

Good game. Lots of fun. The wooden pieces are great and it's a lot of fun to flick bullets at cowboys or robbers. A bit of a set up requiring us to take some leafs out of the table. Certainly not a heavy game by any stretch (unless you're talking lbs!!)

We found games can run a bit long and were bit of a runaway do to the skill of one player at dexterity games. Still, very fun and the scenarios keep it interesting.

An all-time classic and easily the best dexterity/flicking game I have ever played! Here are some reasons why:

1) The rules are easy to understand and intuitive (except for some ambiguity here and there).

2) The gameplay is utterly captivating and requires skill as well as some basic strategizing in order to win.

3) The whole production is lovingly crafted and of uniformly high quality.

If you have even a passing interest in or enjoyment of dexterity and/or flicking games, you truly owe it to yourself to check this one out!

Have mostly played this with nieces/nephews that enjoy the idea of shooting down the good/bad guys.  Eye hand coordination is definitely a bonus with this one -- as is table size.  We've been playing on a pretty tight little "board" area to make it a bit easier for the kids, but I think enlarginf the table space would makes things a little better -- force a little more precision into the flicks.  Have enjoyed it enough to start picking up the expansions.

RATING: 6.5
規則:
*將玩家分成兩個隊伍，警員和匪徒，每個隊伍有1～5五個角色卡，每人拿腳色卡跟米寶跟帽子根據腳色卡拿對應血量指示物
*起始玩家，帽子顏色跟時鍾根據劇本調整，然後也根據劇本擺建築物障礙物跟起始位置
*從起始玩家開始執行動作，之後換換另一個隊伍的1號玩家，然後換另一個隊伍的2號類推，3個動作可選擇，可執行兩次行動(可重複)，回合結束，將帽子翻面
1.移動  先將米寶移開，將白色移動指示物放在米寶原本的位置彈射，彈射的時候只能使用食指，沒有撞到其他建築物或障礙物的話將米寶放在該位置並決定方向，若掉到桌子外或是撞到其他建築物或障礙物，則將米寶放回原位，障礙物放到原本的位置
*要進入建築物，必須將移動指示物彈射進兩個底座中間，只要越過入口線就成功，撞到底座內側不算失敗，要離開則將移動指示物放在建築物後方，只要從底座中間彈射出去超過入口線則成功
 2.射擊  一把手槍就可以使用一顆子彈，兩把以上最多也只能一次射擊兩顆子彈，將子彈指示物放在米寶的左右任一側距離一顆子彈的距離彈射，若兩顆子彈，則放在左右兩側，撞到視為擊中(反彈不算)，如果射到倒下必須維持倒下的狀態，且扣一滴血(沒有倒下無效果)，輪到該米寶才會站起來，倒下的不會再被擊倒，打中隊友效果相同
*如果一次兩個以上的米寶，只算第一個米寶，其他立刻站回原位，建築物中的米寶只會在決鬥中被擊倒。
*如果死亡，角色卡翻面，露出墓碑那一面，持有的物品放到殯儀館的底座上，如果有起始玩家指示物，殺死他的獲得
*建築物中的射擊必須將子彈指示物放在建築物後方，從中間彈射出去
3.拿取、丟棄、交換物品  當玩家進入建築物時，可以消耗一次行動來拿取或丟棄物品（武器、炸藥或文件），若拿取物品，將其物品放到角色卡上的物品格中，如果物品格已經滿了，必須將已持有物品丟棄在該建築物的底座上，替換成要拿取的物品
*若拿取的是面朝下的，可翻到正面看再決定是否要拿，不拿面朝上放回去行動次數消耗掉
*當這所有玩家都行動完，將時鐘指針撥到下一格，指針所指的顏色對應帽子的才能行動
**不同劇本特殊規則***
1.決鬥 不同陣營在同一建築物時，在另一個區塊來決鬥，各自的米寶面對面放置，距離遠近自行決定，輪流射擊，後進的先，第一發沒擊倒，另一個玩家可以將米寶往前一個移動指示物的距離，然後再進行射擊，進行到有玩家被擊到扣一滴血為止，被擊倒的會被趕出建築物，獲勝的彈射出去決定戰敗玩家的位置
*若有兩位以上的玩家進行決鬥，則是讓同一個陣營的玩家們先進行射擊，才換另一個陣營，當只剩一個陣營的米寶未被擊倒，決鬥才結束。
2.溫徹斯特長槍 使用溫徹斯特長槍，拿取長槍板塊放在米寶左右任一側，把子彈放在板塊的軌道上彈射
3.炸藥  使用炸藥時放在米寶左右任一側，一樣彈射停下來後會發生爆炸，範圍是一個移動指示物的距離，範圍內的所有米寶會被擊倒，扣一滴血並且處於擊倒狀態，範圍內的物品會被移除。
*若爆炸發生在建築物內，那只有建築物內的米寶會受傷，被擊倒的米寶會被彈射出建築物並處於擊倒狀態，建築物內的物品也都會移除。
4.協助罪犯  當米寶與中立角色距離一個移動指示物的範圍，可以花費一次行動來傳遞物品給中立角色，物品會被放在中立角色的下方。
*移動時，碰到中立角色但是沒有撞倒米寶，視為移動成功。
5.投毒與淨化 當米寶與木桶指示物距離一個移動指示物的範圍，可以花費一次行動來對木桶投毒或淨化，並將水滴指示物翻到有毒的水或乾淨的水那面。
*若玩家在移動時，碰到水桶但是沒有撞倒水桶，視為移動成功。
6.目擊者與證物  目擊者是由警員陣營中的其中一個玩家扮演，目擊者也會戴編號帽子，一樣可以進行動作，但是目擊者不能拿武器，所以無法使用射擊，目擊者可以拿取的物品就只有2個「證物」。
*當目擊者和一個匪徒在同一個建築物時，不會發生決鬥，目擊者直接扣一滴血，然後被趕出建築物。若目擊者與一個警員、一個匪徒在同一個建築物時，警員和匪徒會正常進行決鬥。
*證物都會是面朝下放在建築物上，只有目擊者可以拿取面向下的證物，若其他玩家拿到面朝下的證物，必須面朝下放回原地。目擊者也可以花費一次行動揭露證物，將面朝下的證物翻成正面，而其他玩家可以拿取面朝上的證物
*若持有證物的米寶被擊倒了，證物會立刻掉落，而距離倒下的米寶最近的米寶可以得到證物。如果持有兩個證物，距離最近的兩個不同的米寶各拿一份。若沒有米寶符合條件，證物會被放在殯儀館上。
7.人質  人質永遠跟在護送他的米寶旁邊，若護送人質的米寶被擊倒，人質將會移動到距離最近的米寶旁邊，若護送人質的米寶與其他米寶發生決鬥，人質會交給勝利方。
8. 絞刑台  匪徒首領（中立米寶扮演）會被綁在絞刑台上，匪徒方必須使用溫徹斯特長槍才可以解救首領，若子彈彈射出去將木桶上的首領撞倒下來，視為解救成功。若距離首領最近的米寶是匪徒，首領將會跟在該米寶旁，開始護送。若距離最近的是警員，首領會重新綁回絞刑台上。
*警員若要將首領綁回絞刑台，必須擊倒護送首領的匪徒，再帶著首領回到絞刑台（距離絞刑台一個移動指示物的範圍），並花費一次行動將首領綁上絞刑台。
**遊戲結束 達成劇本條件先獲勝，當時鐘指針指向12：00時，遊戲也結束，活下來的隊員最多的隊伍獲勝，若平手比倖存成員的血量總數

I love the purity of Crokinole, but every themed flicking game I've tried (Carabande/Pitchcar, Catacombs, and the like) has left me cold. I think it's something to do with having to get up and walk around - but you can add excessive downtime, little derived satisfaction, no interesting decisions, minor groan/cheer rather than major, and basically just the fact that flicking something for 45 minutes gets darned boring (well-themed or not). I mean this is as nicely themed as the genre is probably going to get, and it has nice evocative table-scape components. But we ended up abandoning halfway through our first game due to a rising lack of interest in the process and in the result, with too many rules and too many grey areas. Probably the most damning thing about themed flicking games is that (in our neck of the woods) no one cares if they win or not. So this game languishes as a mediocre rating in our sea of disinterest.

I wasn't sure I made the right decision when i bought this game. I wasn't sure even after unboxing it and held the beautiful components in my hands. 

...but the moment I flicked my first bullet and struck down a white cowboy I fell in love. It works great. You have complete control over the movement and the shooting. So it's not just the aesthetics of the game. It's mainly the feel of it. I just can't stop flicking!

Can get a bit fiddly with all that flipping the cowboys hats from red to blue. 

...One major complaint. The box should contain a second movement disc. I am constantly afraid that I will lose it and then my game will become unplayable. Please Pretzel include one more in future expansions.

Got a lukewarm response from the game group.  I think it's because we tried to add too many people, so it didn't have a very cohesive feel to the game, since someone would take their turn, and then walk away for a bit.  This needs to hit the table again with a more dedicated group of people who want a fun flicking game.

There is an awesome game here, hidden under a ton of clutter and unnecessary fluff. The rulebook is a piece of **** and the included scenarios are usually unbalanced and convoluted. The setup already takes some time and all that just makes it worse. Don't even think about adding expansions.
The great pieces compensate that and make it the most physically satisfying game of its type. Just play it quick and simple.

Played 1, 2v2 game so far.  Awesome game and a ton of fun to play.  I can see this being even more fun with a larger group and a different scenario.  The one problem I noticed with the one we played (it was basically capture the flag) was that we could completely ignore the objective and just kill each other.  Either I'm going to have to skip some scenarios or make house rules such as re-spawns, to encourage going for objectives more.

I got to play this game today at my local meetup.

This is a group-dependent game. My group was trying to rule-lawyer and min/max a dexterity game. It pretty much drained the fun out of the game. I can also feel the confrontation between this guy and girl in the game and it wasn't a pretty sight when a couple of times it feels like they're about to argue over this silly game.

As soon as I heard about this 'realistic' American West game, I knew the variable scenarios and visuals made Pitchcar boring and redundant (sold).

Seems like I will need to look elsewhere now for simple flicking game Ice Cool or Hula Hippos maybe.

Well, it's gorgeous, that has to be said. A single play saw me take it off my wishlist, more from a reduced desire to purchase than any fault with the game as I was a little underwhelmed. Perhaps that would change after playing some different scenarios, but it felt a bit 'Plan A'. I accept that's an odd criticism for a dexterity game, because generally they are one-trick ponies. In short, I'll stick with Pitchcar and Tumblin' Dice for now.

Dexterity game, lots of great toy bits, the rules are simple but meant to keep things chaotic. Teams take turns exchanging flicking pieces around in old west town. 10 scenarios for setup (but it may be better to invent your own), lots of objects and buildings. Need a large smooth play area. Really doesn't work as well after you get above 4 players or so.

RATING: 7
This is a very entertaining flicking game with lots of beautiful components. The game is always 1 team vs 1 team, so it plays well at either 2 or 4 players. It can go higher, in even numbers, but the larger the group, the longer your downtime between turns. The scenario book comes with tons of different setups, but most seem to have an unreasonable timer to complete the level objective for either team. Maybe once you've mastered flicking this is less of an issue? That being said, the process of play is extremely enjoyable so these issues feel very minor.

A fun, light-hearted dexterity game with a strong Western shoot-em-up theme. It's very fun and brings a lot of laughs when players get into it, and the dexterity challenges are just hard enough that people will fail fairly often, which is usually the funnest (and funniest) part of a dexterity game. The rules are not as clear as they could be on some points, so you have to be ready to make a fair-seeming house rule on occasion and not get too rules-lawyery.

This is the dexterity game I've been waiting for. The wild west is a perfect theme for flicking disks at opponents. I love how easy it is to teach and get playing, even with a full group of ten players. TEN! I've never seen a game get a group of strangers cheering and high-fiving eachother faster than in Flick Em Up. Then, watch everyone go dead silent as two players face off in a duel that builds in tension as the cowboys step closer and closer after each miss. The experience is worth every penny.

This game deserves its '8' from me. The way you get to flick-move your cowboys genuinely allows you to exploit cover etc (because you can position them anywhere, in any facing, touching your flicked disc). This opens up proper tactical play and is great fun. 

The only detractor of this game is that it is very hard to referee how players are flicking. You're not allowed to use your thumb or the table in combination with your flicking finger, yet in practice it is very easy to find yourself cheating by accident. And if you are doing so, it becomes much easier to win because you can get much more power behind your flicks.

This is a funny thematic experience of a game.  However, it should not be taken seriously.  The game can be frustrating because the flicking rules are specific and can be difficult for some.

This game is fun. There was actually a lot to the tactics of a gun fight. Moving, shooting, and then moving again to gain cover. Picking the right targets and concentrating fire is also something that shouldn't be overlooked. It did take a while to get out and setup, but would be fine when playing through more than once and also probably much better with more people playing.

Gets pretty boring with more than 2 players. Not being able to use your thumb makes for weird flicks. The rules leave a lot to be desired. Tons of vague things or things just not defined so sometimes you don't really know how to play. For example, there is no defined length to place figures for duels. There is nothing about if you use 2 guns in a duel or not.

Rated 29-11-2015. Rated after 3 plays. Dexterity meets miniature game. In the game, you play one two teams, you can play as a cowboy or as an outlaw.

Each turn, you activate one of your models. This model can walk or shoot. If you walk, you can put a disk in place of your figure and 'flick' it to move. If you hit something, you're reset but lose your action. So you try to be careful. 
If you shoot, you place a smaller disk close to your mini's side and flick from there. If you directly knock over a figure, you deal one hit. If a figure has gotten 3 hits, it's dead and removed. However, downed figures cannot be shot and only be are set straight during their activation.

The downside is that the box is to small to store the figures pieces whole. So you're constantly reassembling the parts and that is relatively difficult and easy to damage the components.

(Sept 2017) I have mixed feelings about this. Fell in love with it at Essen 2015, bought it there with Stallion Canyon. I still quite love it, and would like to play it more. The problem is that it is seemingly for children. But setup takes long, the game runs long and can be frustrating for children with limited dexterity. Considered getting rid of it, but having second thoughts, because I do know this could be a blast with the right group.

RATING: 10
Excellent game for everyone.

The casual gamer will love the simplicity of you hit it, you got it combine with a strong thematic. 

There are stories to be told after each games, which make it even more enjoyable.

For more *serious* gamer, the tactic element is there because the positioning, even though base on a flick that might not (will probably not :-) ) be all that precise. 
The elements in the scenarios make it really interesting and make you think before you act because you could end up with one life point and forced to enter a building because you are cornered and it will finish in a duel... 

The duration is quite fine, 
great to play with 2, 4, 6, not sure i would play other numbers because it's a rotation on the 5 guys you control, so basically you play like 1/2, 1/4, 1/6th of the time. That would still be fun to watch, but i prefer actions.

A definitive keeper. I just bought the stalion expansion, waiting to try it!

Beautiful components, though.

RATING: 4
I have played hundreds of games, my comment count on BGG sits at over 1100 and is probably missing another hundred on that.  I've played these games thousands of times, my play count here is over 1200 and that's short by at least 3 or 4x.  This is the only game in my play history that I quit without finishing.

Now, I have played much worse games and have had much worse experiences but there was just a perfect storm of situations here that caused me to just pack it up and it's because in the end I think this is an over-hyped and overpriced play-set without enough polish to be a good "game".  Here's my story:

I'm not the biggest fan of dexterity games to begin with.  I want to be and I have owned many over the years.  Catacombs, Dungeon Fighter, Ascending Empires, etc. because I like the ideas behind them but usually end up finding them falling flat.  They're usually just too...fickle, is the best way I can describe them.  That's not to say there aren't some I enjoy, I really enjoy Rampage (aka Terror in Meeple City) as well as Tumblin' Dice.  This one had so much hype, and to its credit, looks awesome so I was quite interested/intrigued.

The game started out fine too, we played the scenario where one team plays the bad guys trying to get gold from the bank to the saloon and the other team plays the good guys trying to do the opposite, like a game of capture the flag.  The rules to this game are pretty simple if you aren't familiar.  You have a certain amount of rounds, at the end the team with the most gold between their base and person wins.  Each team can activate each of their 5 pieces once a round and can take two actions on that turn, either move or shoot.  You shoot by flicking a small disk and knocking over another piece and you move by flicking a larger disk.

Early on the lack of clarification in the rules became obvious but we were able to move past it.  One such issue was about exact placement of your piece after moving and when shooting.  A player on the other team wanted to turn his piece sideways to shoot easier without his piece in his way.  Between the buildings and other pieces there's already enough stuff in your way that nobody else had an issue with this.  But then we agreed it is only fair when finishing a movement you have to place the piece with the broad side facing the opponent or at least the direction you moved, so you can't stand them on their side making it harder to shoot them.  Not clearly described in the rules but common sense prevailed and we continued playing.  However it didn't take long to get to a rules disagreement that we couldn't move past.

Like I said, the goal is to get into the bank or saloon, acquire gold, and bring it back to your base.  There is also a rule that if you touch anything during a move your move is negated AND you can't shoot someone more than once a round.  Once they're shot they are laid down and still obstruct movement, and I actually like this rule, it wouldn't be much fun to be machine gunned down in this game and instantly find yourself outnumbered because the enemy focused fire.  But then we found ourselves in a situation where our opponents had positioned a guy right outside of the bank, our objective, and we couldn't get by them.  I said this blockade was fine as long as they were standing, that made sense, but if I shot them and knocked them down I should be able to pick up their piece and move into the bank.  To me this both made sense from a mechanics and thematic perspective.  Mechanically it would be nonsense if a team could just pile up 2-3 guys in front of an objective with one way in or out because of the blocks movement/one shot per round rules and thematically if I shot you and your bleeding on the ground, why wouldn't I be able to step over you to get where I need to go.  I didn't even want this to be a staple for the game, just within a reasonable distance of the objective.

Our opponents disagreed with me and we both argued the issue stubbornly for about 15 minutes.  They said that I just needed to be able to maneuver around or shoot him in such a way that knocked his piece away but both of these were difficult and if I messed up they managed to, with one piece, completely block me from the game's objective for one round or more in a game with limited rounds (so I couldn't just try to slowly shoot him once a round until he died either).  They also said they would eventually move him but admitted it would be the last person they would activate that  round...again this eats up a whole round by preventing us from achieving the objective.  It got to the point where I just realized this is a simple family/party-style dexterity game, we weren't getting anywhere, and if I gave in the rest of the game would be incredibly not fun so the only option I was left with was to quit. I wasn't going to play for another 30 minutes where I couldn't achieve the one objective in the game because of a loophole or lack of clarification in the rules and nor was I going to continue to argue about such a silly game.

It could be argued that this was our fault.  A group of stubborn guys unable to compromise to get through the game, but we are gamers.  Gamers want to win, that's the objective, and if that's not supposed to be the objective in this game it kind of reinforces my main point.  This is a toy set, a bunch of admittedly pretty and solid pieces that you can play with.  And if that's what it is it is severely overpriced and over-hyped as a "game".  There are scenarios and rough rules in the box as well but they are really not polished and if this game was playtested I find it so hard to believe that this issue wasn't encountered when it came to this scenario...so why wasn't it clarified?  Laziness?  Apathy?

I kind of resent this game now for putting me in a position where I felt my only option was to quit, after like I said, thousands of plays.  I criticize and dislike others who quit games due to what I feel are poor reasons like they don't believe they can win or they simply aren't enjoying a game they committed to already.  But to me this was enough to make the game broken and impossible for me to continue playing through and now I have that black mark on my record.

Gorgeous game! The little wooden cowboys and cactus and all - awesome looking. Flicking gameplay is fun, but I feel like the system could be funner.

Flick 'em up is a pretty charming little dexterity game and there might just be enough going on to make it worthwhile. But I can't say that I really had that much fun playing it. It all works well and makes sense, but I can't honestly say I'm desperate to play it again.

The rules are pretty clear and the production is very good, even if some of the tokens are just too small.

I don't understand the title of the this game...."Flick 'em up!" ???

some problems with the game: 

1. why can't i hold the flicking finger with my thumb ? 
2. why ricochet bullets doesnt count ? Ricochet bullets cant hurt anyone in reality ? 

I don't want to house rules it. Coz this is the decision of the designer. Thus i felt it is poorly designed.

I picked this up as a family game.  I thought my 6 year old would love it and it was even hoping my 3 year old would get in on the action.

First the positives.  This game scales well.  By that I mean its easy to insert a reverse handicap, so to speak.  For example, my wife and I get two actions per turn (as the rules state).  My 6 year old gets three and my 3 year old gets four.  Makes for a more balanced experience.

Now the negatives.  Fiddly doesn't even begin to describe this game.  Remembering to flip the hats after each turn, knocking your cowboy over in the process.  Remembering to take hearts off the board after each hit and knocking others off on the process.  Hitting a building, barrel, or cactus with your elbow while trying to take your turn, knocking it over in the process.  

I feel like this game has potential, but we spend more time 'correcting' the board or updating administrative portions of the game than actually playing.  I'm sure playing with kids highlights these issues, but I don't see my wife and I playing this alone.  

So far 2 games under our belt, will give it another shot or two.

First impressions are that it's way too fiddly. Depending on the size of your play area, there are buildings and obstacles everywhere, you have to try to stick your hand into the middle of everything and flick a disc without touching anything else. Rating could go up or down with more experience.

Update: Played more, still really fiddly and just not very fun.

RATING: 6
[thing=169124][/thing] is a dexterity game, based in scenarios, in which players form teams in order to fulfill goals (kill the others, prevent a robbery, save someone, etc). Gameplay, as expected, is quite simple.

It is hard to avaluate [thing=169124][/thing] with just the play I had, considering the simplicity of the scenario, and, from what we could see, there are others much more attractive. Going only by what we saw and play, [thing=169124][/thing] seemed better than [thing=97903][/thing], but still weak - little in terms of positiong and use of the terrain features, it was just a straight up shoot out.

The set up of the scenario was rather long and tedious, and controlling the position of the meeples - something pretty relevant for the gameplay - is near impossible to be done with precision: almost all actions made changed the place of them slightly, and it was hard to know the precise spot a meeple left the table (when this happen, it should return to this point).

Overall, [thing=169124][/thing] does give a good tool for fun moments - I would recommend skipping the basic scenario and go straight to the others. As the game left something of a sour taste, coupled with the boring set up, I fear that its chances of returning to the table, based on an unfavorable first opinion, are quite reduced. Thus my advice.

My current rating for it is based on what I know and experienced as up to now. It could increase when - or if - I get to play better scenarios, which offer more and are fun to play.

Flick em up is an excellent game. The rules are relatively simple and the scenarios create lots of tactical options on how to best take on the opposing team. It's definitely a skill-based dexterity game where the better player will have an advantage, but it's possible to get better with practice. There's nothing quite like pulling off a plan, or shooting one's way out of a bad situation.

RATING: 6
Played the most basic scenario. It was undoubtedly fun and came down to the wire. With the right group of gamers, this is a hoot. This will also work well with kids. There are several downsides and some are quite pertinent and could be a deal breaker. First, not all people are good at flicking discs, to the point that it impacts game play. That is fine in general if you split teams according to flicking skills. Still, you start noticing that people who are not good at this get sidelined quickly and just aren't having fun if the game becomes serious. That is not cool. Sometimes, it makes sense for you to assign targets to skill set and perhaps folks with better skills should aim for the longer shots. Nonetheless, this disturbs me quite a bit and leads me to not wanting to pull out the game unless the right mix of people are around.
The second issue is that the game can drag. With 6, for first scenario, it probably took us around 2 hours. At times, overthinking is a killer. There needs to be a certain flow for the game to be fun. Overall I would say this is a good sandbox-style dexterity flicking game and with the right mix of people, is a blast!

It's very fun to flick this thing to "shoot" the other players.
The problem I see is that it has no replayability. I wouldn't be really interested in playing this again since you just flick a wooden piece against a meeple. That is all, no tactics, no strategy.
It is also very difficult to hit it and can be frustrating after a while.

16 Feb 16. This game is a blast! Lots of fun although the more players you have the more downtime there is- 30-60 secs per player- but you're having so much fun watching players' turns and whistling Good, Bad, and Ugly, that you just don't care. Two points to consider: 1) people with big hands/ arms will have difficulty with some flicks (obsticles will be in the way), 2) although small children can play the game, a certain amount of hand-eye coordination is required.

I’ve always wanted to enjoy a dexterity game, but both of the previous games that I tried I really didn’t enjoy: Catacombs and Ascending Empires. Both were too long and fiddly with lots of little rule problems caused by the odd flick here or there. However, I didn’t like the idea of playing what I felt should have been a light game for over an hour, it just felt dragged out.

Flick ‘em Up on the other hand plays in a about a half hour (not including setup) and that feels about spot on. In addition, team play works perfectly for two reasons:

1. You can balance a poor player with a good player
2. You can commiserate and celebrate with your teammates instead of plotting by yourself or working against the overlord (as in Catacombs)

Now, I’ve only played once and it was only the first scenario, but I really enjoyed how this game played and I’d love to try it again.

Flick 'em Up won't knock Catacombs (1st ed) off its barstool, but the scenarios and gameplay are as much fun as you can have while hanging from a California collar.

Though the lack of an official firing surface is a mark against, as table ridges and divots can nudge a crack shot in a diagonal direction.

Still, this one's a smooth piece of calico 'neath my saddle.  Until the cayuse startles a rattler, comes apart, and skedaddles while I chew gravel.

We have so much fun playing this! There are a few wonky issues (tracking wounds with those tiny chits, remembering to flip hats), but pretty minor stuff. Would rate it a 10, but felt it needed dinged a point for the crappy rulebook.

***Revised rating seriously downward. There’s simply too much vague stuff in the rules and at least one scenario that we’ve played so far is off. No idea why it exists. Skipping ahead to the duel is your best option. My kids and I really want to love this game but, as it is, it’s hard to.***

I have mixed feelings on the components: they are wonderful once assembled (3D elements are always great in a dexterity game), but the quality of the cardboard used is not great. Instead, wooden pieces are quite good.
The game is not cheap (base game + 1st expansion at Spiel'15 were 100 euro), but it is silly fun.

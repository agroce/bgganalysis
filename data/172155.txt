GAME: Ascension: Dawn of Champions
RANK: 1892
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
*Rating based on iOS app.

After loving Realms Unraveled, I was looking forward to Dawn of Champions (DoC) with much anticipation.  Sadly, I found it very disappointing.

DoC introduces Champions, which are faction-specific role cards that remain separate from your deck.  You can gain reputation by spending runes, buying cards of your faction for your deck, or defeating monsters of your faction (faction-specific monsters are another new addition to this set).  When you accumulate enough reputation, you gain a special hero card into your deck.  Additionally, when you reach 8 reputation, each time you buy/defeat a card of your faction, you can "rally" (see below).

When I read the rules for Champions, it initially sounded very cool.  However, I found them wanting in a few regards.  First, the special hero cards are decent, but they're not as special as I would have liked them to be.  Second, I would have liked to have seen more ways to gain reputation.  Instead of all factions spending runes to gain reputation, I would have liked to see the Void champion spend power, and the Lifebound champion get reputation by playing Unite abilities, and the Mechana champion get reputation by destroying a construct... something that would make playing the different champions feel more unique.  Third, as I will discuss below, I dislike the rally mechanism and would have preferred some other kind of bonus for reaching the maximum reputation threshold.

Speaking of the rally mechanism, that brings me to my other main gripe with the set.  The rally keyword is paired with a faction name (or "monster") and means that when a card is flipped from the main deck to be added to the center row, if it matches the rally type (e.g. Rally: Mechana), you immediately gain/defeat that card for free AND continue rallying to the next card.  This mechanism is entirely random.  It's complete random chance whether the next card off the deck will match the rally faction, and this can create some incredibly unfair chains.  I've seen 4+ cards rallied in a row.  This creates wild swings, which completely unbalances the game.  I hate when the Ascension designers add unnecessary randomness to the game, and I absolutely despise this mechanism.

Many of the individual cards in this set are pretty cool, and I like having the factioned monsters, but the two major mechanisms introduced in this set just fell so flat for me that it ruined the whole experience.  I still play with this set combined with Realms Unraveled, but I am always left thinking of how much better it could have been.

RATING: 8
This is yet another great expansion. There seems to have been an outcry regarding rally, but it's an exciting mechanic and I haven't seen it really break any games yet. If anything, this continues the feeling of tighter gameplay they started in RU, but WITHOUT the broken turns produced by multi-unite. The champion mechanic kind of guides play to some degree but is a somewhat nice addition as well, though dhartha seems to be the best by a large margin imo. Willing to play this mostly whenever at this point, it's the first set I've bought physical and I'm happy to have it.

RATING: 6.9
Fiddlier than basic Ascension.  Turns are more complex with rally and unite effects.  Also the cards have more secondary effects.     Box isn't as clean as the base game either in that cards won't come out without turning the entire box upside and you don't have the nice slots to keep the 10 starting deck cards.  Part of what makes ascension great is you can just pull it out, set up in seconds and have a quick game.  This edition loses that virtue without really providing enough value over Dominion to justify the extra fiddliness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Takes Ascension into a direction I don't prefer, with so much interaction and chain effects that I was dizzy by the end.

Mixed in with other expansions might be okay, to add a bit of spice. But I don't like this standalone, just like I don't like directly eating spoonfuls of spice.

"Full" standalone game.  (NOT part of a "Block").  Adds "Reputation Points" and the "Rally" ability.  

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

This set plays really well mixed with Realms Unraveled.

ASCENSION: DAWN OF CHAMPIONS
Same game we all know (and love), but now with champions, reputation, and what I think is the best art of the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The pre-set Champions for each faction remind me somewhat of the Cerberus Engine DC Deck-Builder, only with a slower progression of abilities that ramps up over time.  Combining this set with Realms Unraveled and leaving the Champions out gives this release an even greater boost in variety, and you can still use Multi-Unite and the Rally ability (based on Rally being used in Portal Deck cards).  Leaving the Champions out cuts down on Runaway Rally issues.

RATING: 6
I didn't like the Rally key word because it's horribly crazy random. You can get a 8 cost hero for free in the early game and there usually isn't much your opponent can do to compete. When wonky things with Rally doesn't happen, it's decent. I say this because I like when a set provides something to do with access runes with the leaders. Overall, better than Realms Unravelled, but there are better sets out there.

I own the app and have played it a lot.  This is one of my favorite versions/variant/set of Ascension.  The hero sheets add a real identity to each faction and help ensure some added variety (without forcing you to go their route or be OP) and in general it is a well balanced set.

The Champions are neat and add some diversity and direction at the start of a match, which is fine. However, the new Rally effects are absolute insanity and it doesn't feel rewarding when it goes heavily in your favor... But, it can still be fun. I still enjoy a lot of the other card interactions and have some new favorites within the set. So even though I'm not a big fan of Rally, I like that they are trying some crazy new things with each set.

RATING: 2
The worst Ascension expansion so far. Really, really terrible.

The avatar you're assigned at the start of the game reduces decisionmaking by creating many no-brainer decisions (your faction = good buy). Both the avatars and the new Rally mechanism massively increase luck of the draw by making many card flips heavily favor one player or the other. Lots of the other guy's faction coming up but few of yours? Yeah, you're screwed. The other guy hits an early rally for a high-cost card? Yeah, you're screwed.

It makes the game way worse thanks to insane variance from Rally. Getting, say, a 7 cost hero on turn 2 or 3 can happen, an then we already know who is going to win here. Remember how an early Mistress made St. Petersburg a silly game? Same thing here, but this is a core mechanic. Avoid.

This is my second expansion to Ascension, after Return of the Fallen. I like this one a lot. You can make some really interesting combos.

It's more tolerable when it's played with at least one other deck shuffled in. By itself, the Rally power is too powerful and susceptible to luck factors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
My favorite set so far. The mechanic for this set is that each player gets a champion and a card corresponding to the champion. In order to earn your champion card you must gain reputation in 1 of 2 ways, you can get it by buying cards that match your champions type (mechana, lifebound, void, or enlightened) or by paying 2 runes once a turn.

Champion abilities later on can be very powerful with the rally mechanic that allows you to obtain the card you replace when buying/defeating cards in the center as long as the type matches what the rally type is.

Gives you a good sense of direction when you're unsure of what cards to buy in the center row.

The rally mechanic can lead to some crazy turns if you happen to get lucky enough especially if you've maxed out your champions reputation. This can make the game a bit swingy at times but after having played it many many times overall the better player will still win a higher percentage of the time.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2015)

Ascension: Dawn of Champions is one of the worst Ascension iterations I have played. Its new mechanism Rally adds lots of uncontrollable luck to an already high luck game, this  is bad for me. If Rally triggers it will be purely by luck, not skill and worse of all you can acquire/kill a high value card on turn 1.

It also adds new champion cards, I’m not opposed to this, but when you get one, it practically nudge you into a direction as you get bonuses if you acquire cards of the same faction, that is, many of your plays are telegraphed even before the game begins. 

Other than that, I like the new cards and the art.

Bottom line, I feel the luck is too much on this one.

I am a big fan of the whole Ascension line. I love playing the individual sets. When I want to play them all, I play on my phone. This game is great. I love playing it stand alone because of new hero mechanic that is involved. I like having to play around a certain faction, especially when it is the enlightened or lifebound.

iOS. Like the other Ascension games, I don't think it's a great game but the app is well made and I can play it with friends over the course of a few days. This variation gives each player an incentive to focus on a different faction. The Rally mechanic can be very swingy.

This set adds a bigger importance on what factions your cards are, monsters included. The rally mechanic is definitely luck based, but isn't broken. The champions, which have hero counterparts, were implemented pretty well and gave incentive to try new factions every game to shake things up a bit.

This set is pretty good. I do like the powers given by the Champion cards, though I feel like this is done much better in the DC Deck Builder. I also wish that there was more variety with the Champions. Maybe if they had put champions that fed off two different kinds of cards, that would make things a little more interesting due to increased competition for stuff. I'm not a big fan of railroading people into a particular strategy though, so this is definitely one of the weaker Ascension sets for that reason.

The "planeswalker"-like role cards make the game a bit more linear. People have carved out territory and don't fight over the same cards so much. And the "rally" pulls can swing the game too randomly. So overall it feels a bit more gimicky than well balanced as a set, but it is fun.

RATING: 4
I've enjoyed every previous version of the game (with the exception of Rise of Vigil), but so far this one is leaving me cold. The number of conditional triggers for effects makes the game seem to drag out more than it should, while simultaneously making me feel like I have little to no control over the outcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ascension is a very well balanced game where with a well thought out and executed theme. Each expansion adds more and more randomness and powerful cards that can make or brake the game, that I don't like. 

I also don't like that I have to pay for a full game with hundreds of cards, plastic tokens and a board that I don't need.

Since I like to combine all expansion I'd like to see extras such energy shards and events sold separately. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I liked what I saw. It felt more balanced than RoV and when combined with Realms Unraveled, it smoothed out both sets. The new heroes are fun, but don't make you feel drastically different. I will say, this set has been growing on me quite a lot lately as it just plays so smoothly.

RATING: 9
I'm playing this a lot online, both as an expansion and as a separate game. The new "reputation" system is nice; it provides an interestinig choice if you want to go for your own faction in a big way, or just buy the best cards.

The rally effect can be very swingy. That might get annoying in real life play, perhaps.

The Champions are a great addition to the gameplay as they give some specialization from the start!  However, poor luck in center deck options can make an individual playthrough way too onesided.  Also the rally mechanic is interesting but offers WAY too much randomization.  An early epic level free grab can ruin a close match.  An epicly long rally streak (especially when it seems undeserved having not invested into cards that make it more likely but it just keeps going anyway) can totally crush the fun of a play for the players that didn't get it (and for those who love competition even ruin their victory by making it hollow).

I'm not a huge fan of Champions softly shoehorning you into a faction. Perhaps I'll try out a house rule where the Champions are all up for grabs and each player tracks their experience for each faction? Still, there were fun cards in here, being somewhat of the companion of Realms Unraveled.

I enjoyed the elegant design, but with seven players downtime was massive and the game dragged (even playing only 2 rounds instead of the suggested 7!). I would not try this again with more than 4-5 players, but I hope it will be more fun at that player count.

Essen 2010 purchase.  From the 6 Nimmt! family. Each player starts with ten cards and tries to discard those cards first.  Players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher but not more than ten higher, than the current top card.  The game is simple, fun and brilliant.  Possibly even better than 6 nimmt!  Well done Wolfgang!

Beetje meer invalshoeken dan take 5.

Afleggen met een getal dat max. 10 groter is dan het vorige.  Indien niet mogelijk: stapel pakken.
Indien stapel van minstens 3, krijg je een stierenkaart, en vanaf dan mag je series afleggen....

Het leuke is dat je de gepakte stapel meteen weer kan uitspelen.  Hier dus geen definitieve strafpunten zoals in take 5.

RATING: 4
More strategic than 6 Nimmt!, but way too long with 1 round per player.  There's a lot of downtime due to individual turns compared to 6 Nimmt's simultaneous card selection.  Also, the game just isn't much fun because there are too few choices each turn (i.e. too few real decisions)... you either have good cards or you don't.  

A certain amount of group-think is needed because if you have even one player who is not trying to avoid giving bull bonus cards to other players, it can tilt the outcome of the game.

RATING: 4
Very strange game, not quite sure what to make of it. Just on reading hearing the rules, it sounded completely dumb - but it's not quite. It's not so much about getting rid of your hand, a la most climbing games, as it is about tuning your hand for one huge play where you can dump everything. A bit of push-your luck (if you tune too long before dumping you can get really hammered with negative points), but its weird that picking up huge stacks can have almost no downside as long as you get another turn (if you pick up the right huge stack you can get an "everything connects" hand which can automatically play itself out the next turn).

Anyway, I think there is something there, but not enough to interest me in playing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another entry in the very long line of card game fillers.

In this one, players are trying to be the first to unload their hand of cards by adding cards to card piles on their turn.  In order to add to card pile, you must be able to add a card to a pile by playing a card in ascending order to a pile without it exceeding the previous card by 11 or more.

If you can't do this (or don't want to), you must pick up one of the piles and add it to your hand.  If the pile you pick has 3 or more cards in it, you also get a bull card which allows you to play more cards in future turns. So, picking up a pile can sometimes be advantageous, as it can allow you to go out more quickly in future turns.

Overall, a light card game that you probably don't need given how many of this type of game already exist, but fun enough if you're really into card game fillers.

The tension between playing cards to go out, or picking up cards to become more powerful is the most interesting aspect of this game. However, other than this decision (an sometimes it is not a decision but something you are forced to do), the turns play themselves.

Simple game of trying to empty your hand of cards by playing one each turn on top of a stack as long as the card played is within 10 of the stack you are playing on.

RATING: 5
Quite a different game than 6 Nimmt since each player takes their turns in order.  This time you can actually take piles on purpose to get a benefit.  By taking piles, you open more piles.  These additional piles give others more options to place to play their cards.  This is important since the object of this game is to shed your hand, like some kind of bastardization of trick-taking.  I wasn't fussy on this one.  It wasn't bad, but I'd rather play some other games of cards and numbers (Parade/Sticheln/David & Goliath).

The game has little in common with 6 nimmt! other than the name and that having bull heads at the end of the round is bad. While it may have a little more strategy than its smaller brother the tactical decisions are much less interesting, interaction is much reduced, and with higher player counts it becomes quite a long game.

Luck is still a significant factor although the punishment is usually less severe than a bad run in 6 nimmt! Regardless, I'll take 6 any day over this.

Incan Gold is better, especially with more people.

Trying to get rid of your 10 cards first, 11 nimmt! offers more tactical choices for cardplay than 6 nimmt! You can opt for the slow road with playing one card per round. Or you grab one or two larger (>=3 cards) piles and corresponding bull cards. This allows for more cards to be played each round, in most case effectively raising your chances to win.

However, compared to 6 nimmt! this game is far inferior. It lacks the "screw your opponents" factor of its older brother. I'll prefer 6 nimmt! anytime over 11 nimmt!

11 nimmt! might be in the "nimmt!" family, but it plays as a completely different game than 6 nimmt!.  The only mechanics that are similar are having to play in ascending order and the scoring of the bull heads on each card.  I really like how when you take a pile with 3+ cards, you receive a bull head card which allows you to play multiple cards on the same stack.  This adds a nice bit of strategy and can turn something bad into something good and change the game immediately in a drastic way (for your opponents).  Awesome little card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It does not feel like there are a lot of decisions to make in this one. Yes, you can make yourself take bull cards when you don't need to in order to increase your flexibility for discarding later, but that really seems to be the only truly strategic decision to make. As a light, pretty brainless game, it works well.

For more players the downtime can get too long, and it's also maybe a bit less fun, less about screwing your opponent's plans so for 5 or more players 6 Nimmt! wins. 6 Nimmt! is more a party game, it's more a cardgame with a "traditional feel". So - experience shows - it's not really for gamers either.

LIKES:

* This is a different twist on 6 nimmt and you are primarily looking at placing cards on a pile that is within 10 points of the top card on the pile.  The game is easier to understand in many cases than predecessor 6 nimmt.
* The bulls are an interesting twist allowing one to play multiple cards on multiple stacks.  The bulls are sort of a compensatory reward for taking a stack of cards (which usually is not a good thing but if you can take a small stack grants greater versatility in the future.

DISLIKE:

* Game doesn't have a lot of decisions.  For a game with limited decisions, this one tends to take too long to play.  


Ultimately, I'd just rather play other card games in the same time frame.

Like its ancestor 6 Nimmt, this is a filler card game in which one is trying not to take points.  There are decisions to be made as the game progresses but they are not terribly engaging.  Still I think this plays better than 6 Nimmt with a larger group.

More tactically interesting than its big brother 6 nimmt!.

I shudder to think what will happen the first time I play 11 Nimmt! with a card counter good enough to track what's going on. Even without that, you can play tactically to reduce other players' choices and/or preserve your own.  For example, do you play the 83 on the 73 or the 82?

The game is less chaotic than its predecessor, 6 nimmt!,  plays well with 2-7, and lasts about 15 minutes per round. In it, players either play a card to a stack in the middle of the table within 10 of the card displayed, or pick up a pile and get a special card that enables them to play one extra card on subsequent turns. The first to run out of cards wins. There's a sly strategic element as a result of these bonus cards that makes the game into more than it first appears. A solid filler.

I liked the aspect of rewarding a player who draws more cards into their hand and the potential for tactics in doing so (as this allows you to discard multiple cards).

The gameplay is turn based instead of everyone-at-same-time like in 6 Nimmt! Not a long game but it feels much slower because of turns. Probably best when played with 4-5 players.

Simpatico party game di carte della serie nimmt. L'obiettivo è quello di svuotare la propria mano di gioco. Durante il gioco potrebbe capitare di esser costretti a riprendere in mano carte o a volte scegliere di riprendere in mano carte perché quando si riprendono in mano più di tre carte si avrà diritto a dei favori.

RATING: 6
A memory game, where the only thing in common with its predecessor (6 Nimmt) is the deck of cards. Your aim is to get rid of all your cards first. Turns are clockwise. You can play onto a stack if the card played is higher but within 10 points of the stack's top card. Or you may pick up a stack into your hand, which will then be replaced with 2 new stacks, creating more opportunities to play. You'll want to pick up stacks that have 3+ cards in it, as you then earn a bullhead, and each bullhead you earn gives you the right to offload multiple cards onto a stack (all within 10 of the original top card) each turn, allowing you to get out quickly towards the end, especially when there are lots of stacks out and a lot of cards will be playable. It can be played lightly, but to do well it's a memory game. You want to know what's in the stack you're picking up (you want cards close together to allow you to play them out quickly later) and you want to know what others have picked up and what they have left to play (if there's a chance that you can add to a stack so as to disallow them). Good luck on that though. Obviously the game is totally unlike 6 Nimmt, which ain't a bad thing. It's decent enough, turns are quick, there are decisions to make, especially around how many bullheads you want (none seems rarely winnable), but the game feels more workmanlike than fun, relying on memory as its key skillset as it does, and the suggested 1 round per player overstays its weight and welcome.

Very chaotic. Typically, every round there's one player with a lot of points, while the other players are below 5 or 6. So the winning tactic is never to be that player who takes the first high stack of cards.

But it's a quick game that can be played in large groups; I've played it with 8 (dealing 9 cards each round). So I don't mind playing this once in a while.

A quick game of trying to rid yourself of cards, and taking cards into your hand when you have no valid discards. A little less information to track during a round than you have with its sister game and predecessor, Category 5 / Slide 5 / 6 Nimmit! Can play 7, but that makes the game 7 rounds long. 4 Players may be closer to the right ballpark.

第一次玩11nimmt是在BSW，感觉相对6nimmt技术含量更高一些，不过也有可能是因为我更喜欢可以连击的感觉....
总的来说牛头还是很欢乐的，仅仅数字可以玩出这么多不通的感觉，卡牌美工不错，人数容差也大。
希望能玩到这个系列的后续作品。
I first played 11 nimmt on BSW which I fell has more technical content than 6 nimmt. But maybe it's just I like combo feeling ...
Overall it's a good game series for bull head which give me so many different experience for just 104 numbers.
I'd like to play more for this series.

I've been in love with Category 5 for a really long time, so I was very interested when I first heard about this variation on the theme.  While I don't think this will replace the former, it is certainly good for a change of pace.  I do like that there is some incentive to actually pick up cards in this version of the game instead of always looking to dump cards.  I really like the balance struck between picking up cards to earn bull heads (and make it easier to get rid of your own cards) while at the same time creating new discard piles (making it easier for opponents to discard).  My only gripe is that there seems to be a difference of opinion in the game forums about the permanence of the bull head cards, though I tend to lean to the idea that they are picked up each round.

RATING: 5
Pretty simple little filler, really. The ability to play onto multiple discard piles speeds things up a bit, but that's countered by the fact that although you can usually plan your move ahead of time (for faster play), you may have to rethink it if someone plays onto the pile(s) you were hoping to play on yourself.

Played on BSW only. After 2nd game: it just takes too long (even with the Brian factor) because you have to evaluate your entire hand and all the discard piles every turn.

--- Summary ---
Cards 1-100, with bull head on them (different distribution than 6 Nimmt!, I think). Everyone starts with 10 cards, and there's one face up discard. 

On your turn, either:
- pick up a discard pile and add it to your hand (if that had 3+ cards, take a BULL card; replace the discard pile with 2 new discard piles by drawing from the deck)

OR
- play onto discard pile(s). May play onto as many discard piles as you have BULL cards (but at least one). Legal plays are any sequence of cards where all are higher than the top card of the pile, but within 10 (wrap around from 100 to 1).

The round ends when a player plays their last card; everyone scores a negative point per bull icon on the cards still in their hand. Then shuffle all cards and play again, most negative player goes first each round.

The game ends after n rounds (1/player). The player with the fewest negative points wins!

Update [8-21-10]
Drops to a 6 after only two plays. I think a 6 is pretty generous, actually. The whole time I was playing 11 Nimmt I was thinking, "boy I'd sure rather be playing 6 Nimmt." Many times when I'm playtesting one of my own prototypes, I'll be thinking that, yea, it works pretty good, but it's not that much fun and WHO CARES? I started feeling that way when playing 11 Nimmt.

--

A solid 7, but I was hoping I would enjoy it more. It's a fun cousin of the brilliant 6 Nimmt, but it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of that landmark design. There's still some "groan factor" here for sure, but the game becomes prone to AP the farther in it goes, due to having many piles to choose from. The fact that you're taking turns one-at-a-time (instead of simultaneously) slows things down a bit compared to the original as well.

All in all, a good game that I wanted to like more than I did.

That said I'd still play this with family or light game playing friends.

RATING: 6
Another interesting twist on playing your cards and trying to avoid points. There seemed to be two powerful strategies, with one being about one point per round better than the other.

That said, what a fun game and one of the better options for 6(+?) players.

Update: I'm not 100% there is much to this game - it's incredibly difficult to separate yourself from other players with each round being about trying to eke out an extra point lead or so. Combined with the luck factor here, this might be a bit of a miss for me.

Rating down to 6 from 7.

11 Nimmt! occupies the exact same niche as its predecessor, 6 nimmt! On the plus side, it's fairly quick, accommodates a large number of players and is fairly easy to teach as a "gateway" game to newbies. On the down side, like in 6 Nimmt!, players don't have a heck of a lot of control over the proceedings and choices are usually pretty obvious. Really just an OK game that may find its way into some collectins because up to 7 people can play or because it's accessible to non-gamers ...

There seemed to be a bit more strategy and variety to this than Slide 5, and I liked that players take turns instead of playing simultaneously. With one round per player it seemed to run a bit long and there were some pretty significant point swings from round to round, but these were minor problems that didn't bother me too much.  There also seems to be some question as to whether bull cards are held from round to round.  Although the official answer from Wolfgang Kramer is that they aren't, I actually prefer to play with them being held onto throughout the game.  It gives a bit of an interesting decision if you don't have any/as many as other players...pick up extra cards to earn the bull and the ability to play multiple cards on a stack or try your luck without one?

Ok filler. Do you go for multiple bulls or none?

Silly fun for three players.
Too long with many players.

11 Nimmt! is not a bad game; I enjoy a play once in a while. I have a number of these sort of card games though, and it doesn't stand up to 6 Nimmt! which is similarly random but more surprising. Out of the three Ox-card games I own, I've decided Hornochsen! is the most interesting, so it's the one I'm keeping.

Fun little card game in the nimmt tradition.  Easy to learn and light rules.

play within 10 of number on top of pile. Wraps round fromm 100-1,2,3. If take pile, create  new piles so options ebbing and flowing as game rolls on.

Okay game, with cards similar to Take 5, but quite different game play. Like Take 5 better though.

Related to 6 Nimmt! but not too similar. I think I still prefer 6 Nimmt! but this is a quick and enjoyable game.

Ok game but , other than deciding when to get a bull, its a bit repetitive and not really any fun...

Puedes jugar cuantas cartas quieras en una columna siempre que sea mayor a la superior, pero no más allá de 10. Quien se descarte primero de todas sus cartas obtiene 0 puntos y el resto pierde tantos PV como cabezas de ganado tenga en su poder.

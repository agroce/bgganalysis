RATING: 6
1 play / 2 players

LIKE: Turning over cards and seeing what would come out was fun. Rolling dice to kill monsters was ok. Trying to grab two good things in a row.
DISLIKE: Very light game, not much interaction. The dice can roll against you when fighting, but plenty of ways to mitigate. My wife found the theme a little dorky (I did not).

OVERALL: Felt like Kingdom Builder a little bit. I also feel 3-4 players would make this game very tight. Overall, the game may be too light for my tastes, even with the majority-scoring (number 3) scenario.

I'm not sure the game is going to satisfy most hobby gamers.  It's JUST this side of family gaming.  Few decisions, little tension.  It does flow nicely, but I can't see how the game will have a lot of staying power.

Great game that honors its pedigree, Wolfgang Kramer is, almost always, a homerun. This is part of HABA's first incursion into the family game genre (I also recommend Karuba, a bit lighter). three game modes provide a lot of fun and are sufficiently different to give you the good felling of getting 3 for the price of 1, and you can even shoot for the expansion and get 3 more game modes. Recommended.

A perfectly competent design, as you would expect from Kramer and Kiesling.  A grid overlays the map of the land.  Each turn new stuff appears on this grid.  It may be evil fog monsters, brave companions or other things that help defeat the fog and score points.  Each player is represented by multiple pieces that criss-cross the board picking stuff up or doing battle.  Multiple scenarios vary the victory conditions a little.  I found it undemanding and mildly enjoyable.

The artwork by Franz Vohwinkel, another old pro, is very appealing.  Production quality is to HABA's usual good standards.

Great game to play with kids. My daughter (7) loves this game and I love playing it with her. Have played with older kids and it was a hit then, too. Adventure 3 is interesting enough to stand on its own as a game for adults. I like this better than Karuba, though that game is a keeper in this family category, too. 

The components are truly fantastic across the board! Chunky wood and beautiful fantasy art. The cards are a little thin (I sleeved them).

A light game similar to Carcassone in complexity and level of abstraction. The actions are simple (draw tiles, place resources on the board, move your adventurers) but the decisions are surprisingly meaty. A family game with real gamer appeal, especially if you're looking for a fantasy theme.

Neat game, you can really feel those elegant Kiesling and Kramer hands in this, a somewhat abstracted Euro grid game with fantastical trappings. Move, collect, combat, score. About the only thing I would have liked to see was their attempt at variable player powers and different heroes, perhaps some more flavorful enemies, but barring that eventuality, I'll settle for some fog creatures and a Water Sprite. Possibly the heaviest HABA game to date, as it's a little thinky for the really young ones.

Expansions:
- Adventure Land: King and Princess

Adventure Land, a game about moving down and to the right... And only down and to the right! Fairly straight forward game about moving your pieces, collecting items, killing bosses and picking up "companions". Scoring is based upon the particular quest your playing, but based upon the quests that come in the base box their isn't a huge amount of variety. Gameplay was quick, the rules were well laid out but worded poorly in a few instances. Overall a solid game that I'd play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little abstract game with a bit of randomness from the card draws. It's kind of like playing multiple games of "Chicken" all at once: you're always waiting to see where your opponent is going to decide whether you should make your move now or later, lest they grab that item before you can. 

Yes, it's very, very light and does get a little repetitive after a while, but it is very short and works nicely as a filler. I like how the different rule sets allow for variability in strategy.

Very enjoyable light German family style euro.  It has an adventure setting which kind of shines through, although the way you move pieces and interact isn't at all thematic.  It's a relatively light game but has some solid approachable depth with a fun costume.  I really dig the scenario-based play as it twists the usage of components in interesting ways (almost like a very infantile, baby 504).

I quite enjoyed Adventure Land. I like that there are different sets of scoring rules, and I like the variety of set-up. 

There is randomness but really just to the setup and replenishment. It is possible for someone to land a windfall by chance but doesn't seem to happen often, and you can position for it. Mostly, players are competing with the same setup. Even the die rolling is OK by me. 

Simple rules, plays fast and plays smooth, with interesting decisions. And just a high fun factor. Nice. Could easily see playing with my family.

"Adventureland" already spoils its own lack of imagination, since the game's fantasy setting is just as generic as the title. I don't need mechanics to "make sense" in regard to the theme, but working with coordinates and moving your meeples only into two possible directions really kills any atmosphere for me. 
It's misleading to call the three variants that come with the game "scenarios". They don't provide a story, they only slightly change the rules and the scoring system. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An excellent family game, with an elegant main moving mechanism and a reasonable thematic grownding. The game is mainly tactical (but has some nuances that become apparent after the first few games), and sports a non-negligible memory component. The 3 different setups (adventures) feel distinctly different, and are a hallmark of the quality of the game's design team. Wonderful to play and easy to teach. Although it has a bit too kuch luck for my liking, the game is highly recommended for its audience. Well done.

Played game #1 which gave us a good feel for the game.  I think from now on we'll play #s 2&3 which appear to have more interesting scoring options.  I ran away with the game primarily by collecting companions and avoiding conflict (fought 1 fog monster).  I see great potential in the game, though!
Game 2 (The Magnificent)  I preferred this to Game 1, I think.  Scoring occurs at the end and swords & herbs count for points.  Once again won by grouping a large number of adventurers and companions.
In both games, my group generally avoided the fog monsters - game would likely have a better feel if we tried for more combat.

And then you tell them they can roll dice to fight monsters. It's just great. 
It's staying in my collection for the foreseeable future.

Players take turns moving their adventurers across a 100 space or so gridded board, collecting items at locations they stop at on the way.  Simple, accessible family game where players are trying to pick up items that will help them fight and defeat the fog monsters.  Items appear in spaces at the flip of a deck of cards (one card per space on the board), and once a space has been cleared you know there will be nothing re-appearing there.  The other wrinkle is movement - pieces start in the "north-west" corner of the board, and can only move east or south, so once a space has been passed, that adventurer will not return to it.  It creates a very interesting push your luck feel to the game.  The other nice feature is there are three scenarios, with different objectives and scoring rules.  I liked this one.

RATING: 6
They did a great job of making a very mathy game somehow feel like a thematic fantasy exploration game. Winning is all about timing. You get to choose between a proactive and a global build action, and while I get the necessity of the second, it always rubbed we wrong feeling I was setting up another player. The one time I played was with 2 players and I felt it went longer than it needed to, though I imagine it was more tactical than at a higher player count (which would have to be far more difficult to plan a turn). Still the game is a refreshing take on the genre, and I would be happy to own a copy at the right price.

This is less about the "adventure" and much more about the puzzle mixed with a little bit of risk management. The decisions are surprisingly interesting, if a bit "on the surface".  There is a little bit of push-pull that can force your opponents hand or cause them to rush, which may not make this sustainably satisfying long term, but I'm enjoying it for the moment.

Nagyon, szinte absztrakt játék. Ám ennek ellenére egész jól hozza a kalandozós feelinget. Bárkinek tanítható, és gémerek is simán leülhetnek mellé, mert vannak benne nehezebb döntések. Persze ezek szinte mindig esélylatolgatásokról szólnak, mert a szerencse szerepe, hogy mi hova mikor jön fel, igen nagy. De ez nem zavaró a játékidőhöz és fajsúlyossághoz viszonyítva.

After one play, I think this has a very classic feel. I love that it has a way to play that even total non-gamers should be able to grasp, while still being fun for those who play games. And it has two more scenarios/modes which add more to think about for a seasoned gaming family. 

The English translation of the movement rules is awful. Just do this: Move one adventurer twice, as two separate moves, doing whatever you like with each move. Or, move two adventurers one time, again, going as far as you like with each (just following normal movement rules whether you move one adventurer two times or two adventurers one time).

I really do like how versatile Kiesling and Kramer are. Adventure Land is a big, colourful game (done wonderfully so by artist Franz Vohwinkel). And nice big, chunky pieces by HABA (who have always had some of the best components and yet are relegated almost solely to the children's market). At the end of the day though, Adventure Land is a little too random for my tastes and yet one too many rules for this to be the perfect family game. It sits almost awkwardly in the middle. The movement rules are neat and it plays almost abstractedly, but I found there were just one too many instances where a player got something very nice through sheer blind luck of placement. However, that is part of the game so I won't fault it for such things; it's just not my style of game. I think there is a definite crowd for this game, though maybe not so large a crowd if they went heavier or lighter with some of the ideas here.  (Note: we played with the most advanced rule-set, so I'm sure there is a lighter game here for children, but then it wouldn't be as interesting for older gamers.)

I was on the fence about getting this, because I love Fantasy themes and the board looks really nice, but the gameplay seemed very abstract and very random. Well, I got it and it is indeed abstract and random, but less than I thought. It is also surprisingly pleasant and even relaxing to play. The players' decisions are much more interesting than I expected. It's not something that I would play often with heavy gamers, but an excellent family game. The three different adventures basically change the scoring system, but this influences strategies quite a bit and adds replayability. The end of the game can be a little sudden, but that may be easily remedied by adding a round after it is triggered.

Interesting mechanic on having meeples that start at the top left corner of the board. On your turn you can do two movements going as far down or as far right as you like, but never going left or up.

However the game is more fiddly than I would like (every turn, you flip over two cards to randomly populate the board with resources) for a game with that high a luck factor.

Only played this with my kids. My six year old just loves it!! The game has different rules and ways to play based on the same placement mechanic. I have only played the basic rules with him as he is six but it's a game I don't mind playing at all when he asks to play it. It's also great that as he gets older or wants more of as challenge this game can offer it and grow with him. It's a game I'm glad is in my collection but if it wasn't for my kids I don't know how often it would hit the table. ... I need to play the more strategic rules and add to this report.

RATING: 7
Adventure Land features an unchangeable map of mountains, forests, bogs, and cities cut through by a river. The map is divided into a grid of coordinates that each correspond to a card. At the beginning of each turn, players draw two cards to seed the board with herbs (forest), swords (mountains), companions (cities), monsters (bog) or gold (river). Then the player can make up to two moves with his pieces, trying to collect the seeded items and defeat monsters. Rather than one adventurer, players control 8-10 adventurers that all start in the NW corner of the board. Adventurers can only move south or east, so as the game progresses your options shrink and you lose the chance to claim items that spawn behind or above you. When all companions and swords have been added to the board, the game ends.

The tension in the game comes from your movement limitations, which really have no thematic justification whatsoever. If you can overlook that, then you have a solid game of striking the right balance between advancement and holding back. Because you control so many pieces, you have a decent range of options on your turn. Variety comes through the card draw, but also by changing up the objectives. The game comes with 3 "adventures" that all play the same, but score differently. Different scoring leads to different choices and different play styles. I've played this with the kids and at game night and it was was well-received by both groups, but neither were super-enthusiastic either. I'll play a few more times with the kids and let them decide whether or not this is a keeper. I'm fine either way, but it's definitely a solid and somewhat unique title. Adventure 1 is strictly a learners game for kids, and even then my kids felt like it needed something more. I don't see myself playing that version again, but adventures 2 & 3 contain some nice choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Adventure Land is an odd bird. The game is simple to an extent of feeling played more than taking meaningful decisions. Often, the turns of a player are simply decided by what is revealed on the board by the cards drawn. Getting lucky is a relevant part of the game. Rolling high in battles against fog creatures is decisive as each pip less can be equated with losing a VP. Our scores were so close that the winner can be decided by a single lucky or unlucky outcome.

Having said that, a better focus on the VP conditions and the game end could - and should - have changed some of my decisions. These two factors are reminiscent of Palaces of Carrara. The chosen scenario determines what is worth VPs and can introduce new minor rules. The variable game end has to be taken into account to switch from collecting resources to fighting the fog creatures. Is there more than meets the eye?

Family game - fantasy
Fantasy-themed game for the family. I do not know how it plays with only adults, but as a family, with 3 boys, it is really great. We all enjoy it. 
Cons
- price
- no inserts in the box, just plastic (!) bags :(
- no Hungarian translation for the different scenarios, just the general rules. Luckily for us, English rules are included.
- we find the dice overpowered in the fight with the fog monsters. Dice should be numbered only from 0 to 3 for more tension.

Pros
- quality (except box insert)
- love the grid system and movement mechanisms
- tense, great fantasy theme
- quite enjoyable
- 3 scenarios, replayability

overall: a great family game, boys simply love it. A next step for them towards heavier games. Simple rules, nice tactical and strategical elements.

Valahogy ez kimondottan jól sikerült szerintem. Eléggé absztrakt ízű (a sakkszerűen betűzött, számozott tábla erősíti ezt az érzetet), de ez engem nem zavar, mert nagyon elegáns az egész. A szabályrendszer igazán egyszerű, kb. 5-10 perc alatt megtanítható, és bár van némi szerepe a szerencsének, vannak mélységei a játéknak. 3 "kaland" van, ami gyakorlatilag annyit tesz, hogy három pontozási rendszer van, van ahol azonnal megkapjuk a pontokat játék közben és csak 1-2 dologra kell figyelni igazából, és van olyan is, ahol csak a játék végén járnak pontok, és már a többségi aspektus is megjelenik, még komolyabbá téve az interakciót. A tábla folyamatosan változik, mert minden körben új lapkák, figurák, szörnyek bukkanhatnak fel, folyamatos verseny van a játékosok között, hogy ki mit szerez meg a másik előtt. Szerintem ezzel még a nagyon gémerek is tehetnek egy próbát. ;)

I really wanted a fantasy theme game to play with my children. I think this one fits the bill.

I love little things like the water sprite following the gold around and killing anyone she crosses. So you can go after the gold in you dare, but you better get out of the water ASAP.

With the 3 different quests, it's like you're getting the base game and then two expansions. And the base game would be good enough to sell on its own.

About the only thing I can fault is that the rule book reads like it was written by a non-native speaker, but you can make sense of it. Just read the examples. And if you're reading this review, you can look at a few of the forum rules discussions to clarify.

Also, the first quest is by far the weakest. The 2nd and 3rd are quite clever, but the first quest feels repetitive and there's not much strategy involved. I hope people don't try the first quest and assume they don't like the game.

Karuba seems to be the Haba gateway game everyone is talking about, but I think Adventure Land deserves its own share of buzz.

In Adventure Land, King Agamis rules from his castle. Rich cities, vast forests and rugged mountain ranges dominate the country. The large river is known to be lined with gold and the forests filled with medicinal herbs, but dangers lurk beneath the fog! Only the bravest adventurers dare to face the challenges. When you move your adventurer tactically and bravely fight the fog creatures, you'll win the favor of the king. Illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel and designed by acclaimed duo Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling who between them have won the highly coveted Spiel des Jahres award 5 times.

The strange thing about talking about this here is that what I played was not the normal version of this game. I hosted a game day with a theme of cooperative games and we played a co-op scenario of this that's included in the expansion. 

My friend brought it because his two kids really enjoy the game as a whole, and he does as well. It's a Kramer and Kiesling design, and it's very cleverly done. The movement system (you start at the upper left of a map and can only move right or down) makes for some tough choices, and it's fun collecting goodies as they pop up. It's a charming family game that is also interesting for grown-ups.

Very enjoyable, quick to learn, strategic game. Theme is pasted on, but works well enough. The game will change after one play as you find out where all item types are located - then you will be much more strategic about which adventurers you move and when. This scales very well, and is easy to set up and take down. Will likely see the table often.

Adventure Land is a great family weight game that feels like more than that. The rule set is simple and easy to understand, but you are constantly given choices. More often than not, your choices will rob you of things you might have been able to acquire later on in the game. I think the best part about this game is how endlessly possible expansions are for this game. With the core game coming with three different "modes of play", new boards and rules could mix things up without having to learn/teach a brand new game. I would say this is a good essential game.

A játékban nagyon magas a szerencsefaktor (lapok felcsapása, dobókocka a harcokban, de mindkettőre fel lehet valamennyire készülni).
Gyönyörű kivitelű, jó hangulatú, könnyed családi kalandjáték, a végső verdikt előtt azért a többi küldetésnek is neki kéne ülnöm, de egyelőre igencsak túlárazottnak érzem..

A solid design, with three radically different scoring systems in the box. The game both encourages you to hold back and gather resources and charge ahead before your routes get blocked, making most decisions interesting. The rules are so light that you're almost surprised that there's anything to it at all, but Kramer and Kiesling are total pros, so it should be no surprise that they've turned out yet another game that stretches a single main mechanism into a test of opportunism.

[b]Adventure Land [/b]was sold via auction 4/8/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]My kids burned out on this one quickly, they were focused on killing monsters which isn't a viable strategy for the game. It is more of an introductory area control game and that didn't sit well with them. The theme is great, but really doesn't shine through iduring game play since most of the time you are trying to get majorities of knights in certain areas. I enjoyed it, but there wasn't much variety game to game so I ended up trading it after a few more plays. 

I still think Adventure Land's a great family game if you are looking for an introductory area control game. Although I would probably be more likely to recommend Royals unless your kids are younger (under 8).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent family gateway game: great theme, art and components.
- Quick to set up and play (under 45 minutes for 3 players), perfect weeknight game.
- Multiple scenarios offer increasing levels of difficulty and will help keep the game fresh.
- The movement mechanic offers a fun puzzle to solve and a bit of push your luck.

Great introductory family game with great components. There are three different scenarios included in the box which change the game up quite a bit, hopefully there will be more scenarios released to help keep things fresh. My kids really enjoyed this game even though my son gets caught up slaying monsters and not necessarily focusing on the most efficient way to score points. The mechanics of the game are fun, you can only move left to right or top to bottom any number of spaces you want with the caveat that you can never back track. This definitely makes for some interesting decisions and adds a push your luck element because you are never sure what the other players are going to do and what tokens will appear on the board. I'm happy I added this game to our collection and imagine that we'll play it every couple of weeks and have an enjoyable time. I'm really looking forward to breaking out out Karuba since this game was so good; Spookies has also been added to my wishlist.[/i]

Another solid design from the Kramer/Kiesling design duo!  It's that kind of game that feels abstract with simple rules, but gives your brain plenty to think about each turn in terms of what is the most efficient move.  I love that feeling!  And it's the simple rule of only being able to move right and down, and never left or up, that gives it that nice "crunch" (but not too much by any means).  I also appreciate the 3 game modes, which allows me to play it with different groups!

Wasn't highly rated from Essen 2015 but I still wanted to try it out. I ended up trading for it and finally got to play it. Just played the basic scenario and I was less than impressed. It is all very samey, and I can't anticipate wanting to play it again. There are other scenarios so maybe those are better but the main mechanic of the game is one that was uninteresting to me. I can't say this is one I want to play again but I would give another scenario a chance if requested.

Reminiscent of Madame Ching's movement restriction, Adventure Land's main schtick is to move your few knights only east and south across the map, picking up items, acquiring 'squires' and defeating fog monsters. Three scenarios allow for some variability in scoring. Would like to try more with age-appropriate son, but he goes a bit bonkers over this game.

This is a cute game where players start with their meeples at the top left corner of the board. They flip two cards, which spawns things into a random square, and then they can move one meeple as far as they want in a straight line, or move 2 meeples one space. The catch is meeples can never move up nor left, so you are sort of playing some minor push your luck, as if you rush to the bottom of the board too fast you might miss the best powerups. The game scores differently depending on which of the three adventures you chose. There is some dice-luck but the items you collect from the board mitigate it nicely.

A pretty good light strategy game. It's pretty close to an abstract, with a few tie-ins to the adventuring theme. There's enough variety in your options and goals to give you interesting things to think about, but also a fair bit of randomness in which options come up when. The interaction between players is good and I often found myself hoping another player wouldn't take some juicy move that I wanted for myself or block me in some way. Overall it's solid, but doesn't quite rise to the level of being remarkable.
Note: This is about the most complex version of the game. There are also simpler versions of the rules meant for kids and family play.

Great gateway/family euro! The fantasy theme appeals to kids better than other gateway games like Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne. There are three levels of play, each one adding different goals for victory, increasingly more challenging than the previous. The movement mechanism feels fresh, not just a rehash from other games. The board is a grid, typically you would expect to be able to move North, East, South and West. In Adventure Land all characters begin in the Northwest and may only move South and East, but they can go as far as they like in either of those directions. This makes for some interesting choices as items appear on the board throughout the game and if a character moves too far in either direction, they could miss out on some good stuff. That said, each player gets 8 characters (10 in a two player game) to manage. This isn't just for families, gamers who enjoy medium weight euros will appreciate this on the more challenging levels. Gamers who are looking for heavy, meaty, strategy games will look elsewhere.

A simple game with respect to rules but has some really interesting strategic and tactical aspects to it.  This game has an interesting tug and pull with respect to when you want to move your pieces aggressively because once they move a far distance it really limits when they can be moved again.  Almost has an abstract game feel or even chess-like but actually fun.  The different adventures really change the aspect of the game without really changing the rules which gives it great replay value.  Feels a little like Kingdom Builder it that aspect.  Probably the best Haba game I've played.

I can't say that I was having a lot of fun with this one. It was OK. I think the 2nd time around would be much more fun now that I have a feel for how fast or slow I should be moving through the board. I was trying to hold out too long and ended up not doing as much as I could have. I also think that the other adventures would bring some much more interesting game play, goals, and some end game scoring. There's an expansion that recently came out for this. I'm curious as of what it adds to the game.

Highly recommended for 2+ players.

Kramer and Kiesling go IKEA - a modular game that can be various things. But build around somewhat squarish premise or a squarish grid on which your dudes start up left and can only move down or right. But it's framed as medieval sorta fantasy adventure. Ha! (Well Torres was kinda squarish as well, must be a sort of signature). 

Modules a.k.a. scenarios: 
1. Kids game. Basic planning of getting stuff to fight monsters. 
2. Family game. Somewhat more spatial coordination, but main trick is that some items you need to fight monsters (points) also themselves give points. So: has some risk taking of sorts (dice rolling matters!). 
3. Gamer's family game. Err. I think this one's too complicated for what this game can be, but anyhow - it's majorities (who would have thought?). Yes, everything you collect is scored via majorities, same for end positions of your dudes. Snore. (Didn't we do this in Alhambra?) 

So far I've soloed all three (liked #2 the best), but played only #1. Interaction is pretty much zero (i.e. blocking of plans), but might be highest in scenario #3 (for what it's worth, still pretty much passive aggressive). 

P.S.: Kids are drawn in by the theme (so the squarish gameplay doesn't turn them off, it's ... a miracle!)

El juego consiste en moverse por una cuadrícula con tu grupo de héroes para ir recogiendo objetos que te dan puntos o bonus para los combates. También puedes luchar contra enemigos que están en el tablero. Todas las cosas salen con unas cartas que te indican unas coordenadas de donde colocarlas. El primero que llega se las queda. La gracia está en que empiezas en las cuadrículas superiores de la izquierda y que puedes ir moviéndote solo hacia abajo y hacia la derecha pero nunca puedes subir ni ir a la izquierda, por lo que al final llegaras a la última cuadrícula de abajo a la derecha y con ese héroe no podrás mover más, así que tienes que decidir bien con cuál de tus héroes te vas moviendo cada turno. Sin embargo el juego se hace bastante largo y aburrido pese a durar unos 40 minutos. Quizás con niños funcione bien.

tl;dr: excellent family strategy game

Haba puts out a strategy game from [person=7]K[/person]&[person=42]K[/person]? WTF? I guess they are going in a new direction!
Anyway, any K&K game goes on my radar, so I was happy to finally try this game.
I didn't play just the base game, I played it with the brand new expansion, but that just adds a couple new scenarios, so the basic game play is the same. It's mainly the victory condition that is changed.
The rules are very simple and family friendly of course, and there's a good dose of luck involved. But there is also some solid planning and strategising needed to pull of a victory.
I must say that I was very happy to see this game is very successful at doing what it sets out to do. Yes, yet an other solid design from K&K!

With the 1st scenario could not convince but with the 2nd and 3rd scenario an excellent family game with high replayability. Looking forward to an expansion (not only new scenarios) - perhaps including a cooperative variant.

Adventure Land is exceptional family fare.  The turns are fast and the scoring is tight.  This is an unexpectedly straightforward and interesting title from the designers.  The stock English translation has a few gaffes that even made their way into several videos, so you'll need to defer to the Geek.

RATING: 8
Fun game, very simple to play. I've only played the first scenario so far and while it's fun, it does seem like the winner can be determined largely by luck and the last turn can be anti-climactic because there is no end-game scoring. I'm expecting the other scenarios to change this because they have different scoring conditions.

[b]A note for learning the game:[/b]
On your turn, you essentially get two movement points. You can move one meeple as far as you want, stop on a space and collect/fight, then move that meeple again and collect/fight on the new space.
Or you can split up your two movement points. Move one meeple in one direction and collect/fight, then move another meeple in one direction and collect/fight.

The rulebook is a little confusing about that.

Still, a fun gateway-level game and my rating could possibly go up depending on how the other scenarios play out.

Update: After playing the second scenario, I don't think I'll go back to the first scenario. The second scenario is more dramatic because the scoring is at the end of the game, and you really don't know who's winning until the final totals. The addition of needing to get a large group, and your resources (swords/herbs) now counting as victory points makes for some much more interesting decisions. Rating could even go up with more plays, and considering the jump in quality between the first and second scenarios, I'm eager to try the third scenario now.

An abstract with a little pinch of risk-taking and memory. That's really what Adventure Land is. But the adorable theme rounds off this easy and quick to play game, in which most turns consist of no more than two moves. Bought it right after my first play at a convention and look forward to playing it more. Multiple scenarios/goals should ensure replayability.

RATING: 6
After my first play I gave this a 4 because I only played the first  scenario which is a total bore.  I falsely assumed that's all there was.   Then I realized the scenarios got more interesting so I skipped to number 3.  After my first play of 3 I gave this a 7.  Felt like a typical K&K design - old school design with some depth.  After three plays I'm dropping my rating down to a 6.   

I'm skeptical of replayability without expansions.  After three plays I feel like I'm just about done.  This is a Haba game, a company known for making games for kids.  As a family game this is pretty good.  Can't fault it for that.  But it's not as elegant as Ticket to Ride which is more simple, but better for its intended audience.

I hear expansions are coming.  Maybe I'll raise the rating after (if) I play those.

Wow what a dud. I was expecting light when I played it but I underestimated how light. Very abstract feeling. The theme was there but it could have been anything. The components were solid and the rulebook was good. I like the fact there was 3 different adventures for variable games. But that is about all I liked. I normally really like HABA games. This one missed the mark. It may play better with more. I played with 2.

Had a great first play. There are plenty of paths to victory and choices to be made as the board continues to change and your opponents position themselves. Better yet many of the choices have great almost Lost City/Keltis like tension as you know you can never turn back and you may be handing over a huge number of points to your opponents.

Fighting fog monsters also gives some great exciting moments or loud groans which also adds to the fun.  

The only knock I have on it is the setup and number of peices... it can look very intimidating for a new player.

Fantasy themed, light or family weighted area placement. Workers start at upper left corner of the game board realm and advance towards the big city in lower right section. Each turn, items, followers or monster tokens appear at random coordinates of the board. Workers can only move down and right. Collect items and defeat monsters for points while moving into the cities with as many workers as possible. The uniqueness and fun comes from the hunch-playing that rests on how fast to advance workers across the board to collect goodies at the risk and expense of leaving unspawned goodies permanently behind or moving too slow and not making it to the city at the end.

RATING: 7.5
The mechanics for moving your people take a little while to get used to as I feel like no other game I've played restricts you in that way of only being able to move in 2 directions and not all 4. Once you can wrap your head around it though you start to see the strategy open up and then it becomes really fun.

Nice gateway game! And "yes" it's by HABA but it's no kid's game, you'd like to give this a try. It deserves it, more it's by Kramer-Kiesling, so where can you go wrong?

I love RISK, but the rules were always lacking. Then came LOTR RISK, and that stepped it up, a lot. Unfortunately, we used to many house rules to try to make it even more dynamic. Now this version adds a lot of things we were doing and makes it cleaner. I've played it a few times and loved every minute of it. Can't wait to play it with a lot of people.

If you think war starts with a "first shot", you really don't know very much about war.  But our cause is just!  Anyone claiming a moral justification for sending 1000's of their most courageous citizens across a border to die in combat is usually doing it from the comfort of their living room.  Bombs for democracy!  Why win the war of ideas with reason when you can send others to die for your beliefs?  If we had the means, we'd probably all agree to bomb Pluto. After all, there may be people there to dumb to realize we're smarter and more righteous than them.

Yes, the card quality is very bad. Thin and flimsy, with many cards stuck together that when peeled apart, left the black cards with white marks.

It's blind secret mission risk. First to 10 VPs wins.
Thematic. A pretty good use of the Westeros map.

RISK: GAME OF THRONES

SUMMARY:
Risk, but with a Game of Thrones theme. It's... exactly what it says on the box.

PROS:
• The game comes packed with two main game modes that can be used on different combinations of the Westeros/Braavos maps that come in the box:
(1) "Skirmish", which is basically the classic Risk ruleset using the Game of Thrones map and forces, and
(2) "Dominion", which adds objectives, individual character abilities, victory points, Maester cards, and gold used to purchase the aforementioned additions. 
• The components are all good quality - the cards are perhaps a bit more flimsy than they could be for the price, but they are usable. The game pieces are beautifully molded (the Targaryen/Dragon pieces are especially pretty), although the Tyrell/Rose pieces have more difficulty standing up than the others. A slight jostle of the table will tip them over.
• The gameplay is fun and challenging when playing "Skirmish", and territories with ports are much more inter-connected than in regular Risk, so there is nowhere on the board where someone can feel "safe".
• In "Dominion", the extra cards/abilities really add an extra layer to the game that genuinely makes you FEEL like you belong to your House, as each of the abilities you are given as so incredibly well-themed with the show/book... some Houses produce more gold, while others are better in battle, and others are better in acquiring territory.

CONS:
• The first complaint is the color of the game pieces. The Tyrell/Rose pieces are allegedly supposed to be bright green according to the promotional materials, but in the version I played (and photos I've seen online) they appear more of a grayish-green that made them difficult to distinguish from the gray Stark/Wolf pieces in duller light. 
• The colors used on the game boards are a disaster - they are all very dull and washed out, making it very difficult to distinguish boundaries. The worst offenders are Dorne/Stormlands/Crownlands which all use nearly identical shades of putrid orange-brown, making that area of the map hard to navigate.
• It's also incredibly annoying how not all of the character pieces have the same colors as their canon-territories, embarrassingly evident with the Ghiscari/Turquoise pieces which are associated with the orange (more orange!!) Slaver's Bay on the map. I really don't see how such an oversight was not corrected before release.
• In terms of the artwork used for the cards, I was very disappointed. Honestly, everything looked like a rush-job. Character portraits were screenshots from the show, and no effort was taken to make sure the actors were comparably well-lit or color-coordinated among houses. By way of comparison, in "Game of Thrones: The Board Game", each character has beautifully-painted portraits, wonderfully illustrating their personalities and powers. On the other hand, the Risk artwork is completely lack-luster. At least in the "Battlestar Galactica" board game (also based on a tv series), the character portraits are cropped out and overlaid on a stock background that is the same for all the cards... that is not the case here.
• Gameplay-wise, games last a looooong time when using >4 players.
• In Skirmish, (with 5 players, only the Westeros map) our game lasted over 5 hours. I think this is a common issue with Risk games, but just be aware of it. Fortunately, turns pass somewhat quickly since there are not a lot of game mechanics to keep track of, and the Game-Ending card in the deck puts a timer on the gameplay.
• The same cannot be said of Dominion. In Dominion (with 7 players, and both maps), the game also lasted 5 hours, but with only 4-5 turns being played! This means it took me about 1-hour from the time my turn ended to the time my next turn began. That's a lot of waiting around to make a move in your favor. This was the first time we played Dominion so I can see that being a contributing factor, but I think the main culprit was the addition of all the extra cards/abilities, which made the amount of player-options enormous. Perhaps due to these extra abilities, there seemed to be less forces on the board at any one time than there were in Skirmish, so armies tended to cluster together a lot more, or be very sparse and ill-defended. In addition, the House abilities are definitely poorly-balanced (about 3 of the 7 Houses are significantly over-powered and will dominate the game very quickly).

CONCLUSION:
• "Skirmish" mode is good for introducing people to the game and is overall the superior experience in terms of raw gameplay mechanics, while "Dominion" adds more thematic layers to the game. Dominion is (on paper, at least) more "fun" than Skirmish, but in practice I had significantly more fun while playing the standard Skirmish mode.
• The gameplay components are good quality, but several decisions made in the art-direction of the cards and game boards make the experience less captivating than it could have been.
• Overall, the game is enjoyable and worth the price-point. However, if I am invited to play this game for 5 hours of my day, it's a toss-up whether or not I'd be in the mood to join.

Not to sound too negative, but this was much better than I expected. Numerous special abilities and objective cards break up the staleness of risk (I am not a risk fan!). The game is also much faster (1.5 hours for 2 players, I'm guessing add another hour for each extra player). The board and pieces are very well done.

My main gripe is that the rulebook has a couple typos (none that are confusing, just annoying) and the cards are low quality (also including a few typos and typesetting issues, as well as being made from unusually cheap cardstock).

Played the Skermish edition. It is bog standard Risk with a random end game card mixed into the deck. When it shows up, players total their number of territories adding in castle and port spaces to determine the winner. The map works well with the points per "country" and the access points to countries being nicely balanced. The colours on the cards and the faint type on the board make finding territories tricky. Overall I can't go more than a 5 on this but I do enjoy the occasional game of Risk and I like the Game of Thrones world so it is not all bad. Jan 2016

RATING: N/A
Need to balance out starting player. Played 2 player Dominion, all over before turn 3 

Fixes - do Reinforcement phase at the same time. What about Deploy?

Risk rules have changed with time and do seem to favor luck to strategy.

The old risk rules were played in rounds and not turn-by-turn. It worked like this,

ROUND 1
1. Everybody receives his reinforcements
2. Everybody puts his reinforcements on the board
3. Player 1 starts to play, followed by player 2, followed by player 3

ROUND 2
1. Everybody receives his reinforcements based on territories & regions controlled at the end of ROUND1.
2. Everybody puts his reinforcements on the board
3. Now Player 2 starts to play first, followed by player 3 and player 1 plays as last.

ROUND3
1. Everybody receives his reinforcements based on territories & regions controlled at the end of ROUND2.
2. Everybody puts his reinforcements on the board
3. Now Player 3 starts to play first, followed by player 1 and player 2 plays as last.

ROUND4 (same as ROUND1)
...


The purpose here is to have attacking and defending strategy. You won't play the same if you play first or last.

This tends to add a strategic dimension to the game and for me playing risk in any other way doesn't make any sense.

Other extra rules that add lots of strategy,
- When you conquer a territory only a maximum of 3 soldiers can be on that country, others need to stay on the invading country. You roll with a max of 3 attacking dices not more.

- You can always retreat in battle but if you lose you can't attack anymore

- Moving from armies from country to country at the end of a ROUND1 can only happen to an actual neighbor country.

- 1 country card per turn if you conquer at least 1 other country

Beautiful components. We've only played the Skirmish mode, but the full Dominion game looks like it adds some fun objectives and character abilities. Biggest problem, besides the usual luck factor, is that some pieces are very close in colour (i.e. Stark and Tyrell). This is the first game I've played where my mild colour blindness actually impacted my ability to play the game. The bigger pieces are sculpted and easier to distinguish, but the single army pieces blended together even for some of the other players at the table with unimpaired vision.

First approach to the Risk board games... I've had tons of fun with my friends and we don't want to stop playing, but the time needed for each game is too high (240mins aprox.).

Since I liked this board game I've been investigating other Risk versions and I've come to the idea that no other version offers as much fun as this one:
-2 players map
-3-5 players map
Combining them, we can play a 6-7 players mode

2 types of play:
-skirmish (traditional Risk, I guess)
-dominion (with heroes, maesters and objectives)

When we started playing this board game we couldn't stop, so now we hang out every weekend to play board games.

Really enjoyed the dominition mode at first, because the victory points system pretty much eliminates player elimination (+ i love GoT theme). After 20+ games i can say that the game is still Risk at its core, as lots depend on luck (dice rolling, card drawing etc), but this time diplomacy plays a bigger role (because of the victory point conditions). With tokens and master cards you can mitigate the threat and defend areas you really need for your victory points. Victory point cards are bit unbalanced, because some of them are quite easy to achieve and some of them you definitely will never achieve.

My first try of the game was the epic 7 player domination with all the extras (Maesters, Characters, Objectives, special units). Made for a really thematic game that was a lot of fun, with lots of epic stories to carry you through the downtime. 

Melisandre's Blood Magic killed Brienne, but the Tyrell's retaliated with Valar Morghulis to kill Stannis. 

My Lannisters won out in the end by taking the west of Westeros and the east of Essos for back to back 4 point objectives.

I'd absolutely play again, and had no interest in regular Risk since the 80s.

A great gateway game for Game of Thrones fans who might not be gamers, but DO remember the glory days of Risk. 

There are better strategic games out there, but for an easy to learn multiplayer war-game, this GOT implementation of Risk is everything we could ask for. 

Variants Used:
200 to buy first maester card this turn. 500 for two. Same price for objective cards. 
One initial objective is hidden, all other objectives are public. 
Knights need a boost. Knights help attack siege engines on offence only?
You need a siege engine to attack a fortified territory

Extra variant: Hidden objectives
100 to draw one objective card, 200 to draw two objective cards, 300 to draw three objective cards. You always only keep one card though. 

You can also keep your objective card hidden if you draw two less cards. (ie. Pay 300 and instead of drawing 3 cards and keeping 1, just draw 1 card and keep it hidden. 

Only one objective may be completed each turn.

Each seat of power is worth 1VP. 

Use wood cylinders on the player mats. 

Slavers Bay should be BLUE?
Westerlands is wrong color?

This is THE version of Risk to own. Better than 2210, better than Lord of the Rings, and better than Legacy. Well, for the most part. It's tough to beat a game that evolves as you play. Still, this is my favorite version of Risk out of the box.

There's actually multiple games in the box. You can, of course, play classic Risk using the Game of Thrones map and forces, but you also have a mode with objectives, victory points, individual character powers, etc. Both modes can also support up to 7 players using the Westeros and Braavos maps. There's even a competent 2-player version of Risk in the box, which is reminiscent of Plants vs. Zombies Risk, which I very much enjoyed. Couple all this with some great, high quality components, and you have a really nice version of Risk on your hands.

Granted, this is still Risk, but if you're someone who enjoyed Legacy and other recent versions for what they try to do to modernize the system, I think you'll appreciate this as well. Along with the unique characters, there are special maester cards that give you special actions, and there is a transportation system using ports, which keep people from turtling due to the fact that you can attack across pretty long distances. 

I'm still trying to decide if I prefer this or Legacy the most, but I think that after the magic of Legacy is gone, you don't have a lot you're left with besides a board that was uniquely modified. For a quality Risk game out of the box, I have yet to play anything better than Game of Thrones.

Also, I MUCH prefer this to the Game of Thrones board game from Fantasy Flight. If I wanted to play Diplomacy, I'd play Diplomacy. This is a light, approachable way of seeing the intrigue and backstabbery of this universe from a broad perspective.

I love Risk and I love Game of Thrones, so I love this game. We play many house rules on this one and I almost always ignore victory points and go for world domination. Board could be easier to read, Seige Engines, Fortifications, and Knights are OP (so we limit to 2 per territory), wish more troops were included, and restricting houses to their given home is annoying (so we start with 3 rolls: 1 for House choice, then 1 for 1st placement, then a final one for first turn). But overall it is the most cutthroat (and fun) Risk I have ever played.

This game randomly showed up on my doorstep and thrust me into the world of modern tabletop gaming. While my gamer group is not as hardcore as me, I very much appreciated all of the gameplay options (i.e., attaining objectives, missions and the opportunity to include up to 7 people in gameplay). We typically played traditional risk rules. My only complaint is that some of the team colors are similar, making it hard to decipher. The board is also very dark and it is easy to misjudge a land borders.

Several ways to play, there is a lot in the box. I prefer the conquest game as it seems to have the feel of Game of Thrones.  Movement is very fluid for a Risk game because of the ports. 

The second way to play is very much a Nexus Ops with a GoT theme. It is fast playing as everyone is attempting to complete a variety of secret missions. Missions, based on their difficulty, are valued differently. 

There are 2 games in the box and the components are FFG type. Cards are a little thin but I would rather have them thin and readable than think and tiny.

as a risk and game of thrones fan i can't express how happy this game has made some of my nights, the aesthetics and quality in the material and board are incredible, the box have everything so that you have all in order, from coins to cards, easy to pick easy to throw.
 
the only issue i have with the risk's game its their time, 5 hours and sometimes we dont see the end, but that is the beauty of this GoT version, the mechanics changes and make it a 2-3 hour game at most. even so it have some issues, like the fact that some house are overly power, like tyrell and targaeryan, or some just have 1 character that are actually usefull, this disadvantage is only  at the begganing of the game and then the maester card makes it even, but it can make all the difference it takes if using them correctly. 
the other issue is the color, on the board, the cards, and figures. the figures actually just have one problem, the stark and martell are easy to confuse, at least on the board and when you have fewer numbers of them, that is actually really common, this is actually really easy to fix, just paint the martell's base or the helmet in pink, it works, the cards in comparation with other risk games dont  concur in the color of the region, at least not in all of them which is kind of annoying and finally the board, which is great and all but as i just mention the colors dont concur with the cards and in the region of the finger and the vale are kind of confussing

My very subjective review - best Risk theme ever! Absolutely hate the original theme, this one however made the game exciting for me.

Solid two-player rules and a second map are also included.

A real missed opportunity. Love the theme and westeros board but no house greyjoy even though this is meant to be the war of the five kings. Also the Ghiscari faction is boring and illogical to anyone who knows the show. Essos map has no appeal either. Character cards seem like an after thought and don't add to the game just more complexity for little if any fun added. I wish they had added a wildling and white walker element. Also needs a neutral bribing mechanism like Risk Europe which is a far superior game. Hopefully a second edition will come out once the series ends.

I own several versions of Risk and this one is by far my favorite.  In fact it's the first board game I ever preordered.  I have played it several times since it came out, first starting with Skirmish and then moving on to Dominion and one time playing World at War.

The modular boards add for some great game-play choices based on player count.  One of the major attractions is the fact that the boards are not renamed versions of Earth like all the other risk versions I have (even though they are Sci-fi based).

The ports/castle, Maester and character cards and some nice variety to standard risk.  Overall great theme and a refreshing take on an older game.

A truly more perfect themed risk and an amazing game. I have played many varieties of Risk, with Risk Legacy being the most recent, and 2210 A.D. being another great staple. However the version manages to balance out all the previous games mechanisms, such as even starts, more and smaller regional/continental bonuses and fixed troop deployment. It also employs special units as in Star Wars: Clone Wars Risk.

With two main ways to play, skirmish makes for a quick fun battle, while Domination shows the intricacies of the "Game of Thrones".

Also it helps one learn their "The Known World" geography, with the exception of Sothoryos, but it is "said to be a haven for plagues and dangerous animals" so who wants to go there anyways.

The only negatives are, firstly, the original version lacks card, board and box quality, with several errors between the rules and units, poor or misleading wording (castles vs fortifications, battles vs invasions vs rolls) and a crazily confusing rule book. Once you get the hang of it however it all makes sense.

And secondly, it is truly a "Game of Thrones" Risk, rather than "A Song of Ice and Fire" variant; it is starts with characters and settings as they were in the first and second series, with a few changes to add balance. It was produced between series 4 and 5 of the show and several characters who are in RGOT are no longer with the show, for one reason or another, or have changed their alliance, and seem out of place for a true fan. That being said, it is so good I would purchase a ASOIAF version is made after the series concludes.

After one play (!!) of 2-P version of Dominion (the GoT extras - Characters, Maester cards and Objectives), I'm pretty sold on this. I will say upfront that I have enjoyed but never loved the last-man-standing elimination game styles of the classic Risk (but also Monopoly and others). This version provides a clear winning criteria, and the objectives add an unexpected dimension as the players now have unexpected strategies that can change turn to turn. Classic Risk strategy works as a general strength base from which to work, but individual territories get taken and abandoned according to the flux of the objectives. I'm really looking forward to playing a lot more of this and seeing how the strategies evolve with experience on how to support this much more dynamic play.

The game is heavily text based with reading the rules / powers described on the card only. Thematic association with GoT is strong, but not essential for play. The characters for each House have definite themes and it will be interesting to see how this develops into differing styles of play when you play each House, and may drive starting game selection on which House you choose (players select on highest dice order).

Some niggles: 3 attack dice (d6) are provided, but on two d8: we played a card that lets you swap all attack dice for d8 and had to scrounge around for another dice. There are also a couple of rules contradictions between the rules and the pieces that I hope have been addressed in an errata or forum somewhere. Both of these are solvable but a little annoying. Less solvable is card stock quality: cards don't appear to be hard wearing, and the rulebook already looks like I slept with it. The two boards are really thick, and the counters (House themed 3-army pieces, gold counters, +10/+20)

Despite this, a really good first impression. 9/10

In 2 player game lacking 1-army figures after some gameplay. Fun game to play, but nothing special that would keep me obsessed with it.

Good fun. The westerns map leads to some interesting tactical choices but having the game over random card can be a bit of a buzkill

RATING: 8.1
Love the books, love the HBO series.  Supports up to seven players on the big map but it's nice they put in a 2 player map as well.  Rated higher for the theme relative to all the other version of Risk I have but still Risk at heart.  Warning: the quality of the cards is total crap.  They flimsy with poor inking.  I'd recommend sleeving them.

Although it has the GoT theme, it is still Risk. I like the victory points and the card aspect of the game, but they don't add enough to make it playable on a regular basis.

The cards are rather thin and flimsy, so I opted to sleeve them (4x green Fantasy Flight Supply packets for 187 cards. Currently fastened with some very loose rubber bands to keep them in place when stored away).
The insert tray could allow for deeper and larger slots for playing cards, especially when sleeved.

The map is really the star of this edition of Risk.  The addition of ports and 2 connecting maps is great. Territories have a lot of connecting points you have to worry about but it isn't overwhelming. A lot of elements borrowed from other versions, but the balance was done very well with those elements. Games can get tense the way a good Risk game should.

Played a 7 player game, win by objectives. Took about 4 hours and only got three turns, but it was fun; thanks to the various purchasable cards and house powers you have a bunch of options, even in reacting. The difficulty of the various objectives vs their reward can vary a lot given circumstances. It's a bit random that way, but it keeps the action going. Don't get the same cool feel as with Mass Effect/Star Wars Original Trilogy Risk, but then it is a 7-way free-for-all instead of a carefully orchestrated 3-way struggle. Better objectives would be nice, but not sure what exactly would replace them.

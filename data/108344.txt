Game is similar to computer game. Unfortunately late game is boring - like a  draughts. There is no balance in late game. However I like this game.

RATING: 6
Had high hopes, but now i want to sell it. Disappointed.
Game is poorly balanced.
4 different factions not really different, you can even finish the game before even trying to use factions unique ability (you can't get it from the start fast) - basically everyone buys the same things. In a whole game there is only few abilities which can make units seem different, but it is too few for me.
Everyone gets the same Hero talents to choose and sadly there is nothing too choose much - you can tell fast which ones are most worth to have, and if the game is long - you can have all those talents of might or magic, so you can't really choose to what your hero levels up - in the end you will not be a different magician then your opponent magician.
It can be hard to start with magic, but later or if you get lucky to pick a right skill - magic is overpowered (there is a time  where it does not matter what your hero rolls, you just always do damage (got max to 5 damage once) - at this point you just go clean the board).
Rules are terribly written - it seems everything is clear, but then are some cases where you really wonder what you can or not to do, rulebook does not cover complicated situations.

RATING: 6.5
I had high expectation for this one. The game tries really hard to capture the feeling of the famous PC games and succeeds partially. I want more abilities so that each army feels unique. As it stands the differences between armies are minor. I also feel that the battles are a bit too luck dependent, Especially the initial battles where armies are still small. Apart from the above complains, the game flows well, and it gives you that epic feeling of levelling up your heroes and monsters while finding powerful artefacts and spells. 

It a good game but it could have been a great one with a little more attention to the details.

RATING: 9
A very nicely worked game, seems the product of extensive playtests and hard work. I have to compare it to mage knight, although the mechanics are completely different. It is a lighter one, with much less explanation time. I did not like the brutal player interaction, nor the player area influence mechanic, I would like less territorial conflict between players or an official variant that supports it. It is a very nice transfer of the computer game and a game worthy to have in your collection. As I am writing this the game has a rank of 2000+ which must be a BGG algorithm fail. The game deserves at least top 300 rank.

Well they tried but HOMAM is too complex to get into boardgaming world.They captured the movement of HOMAM but its dicefest concept of combat is the problem where it falls flat.Combat is very lucky and unintuitive.It is also sooooo time consuming and its the primary problem with the downtime and the lenght of the game.We play it 4 like over 4 hours.I dont think its even for hardcore fans of HOMAM.I am one of them.For 40 euros you can get far more superior games these days.

Interesting combat system, although it does put a TON of downtime into the game with 3 or more players.  Also, the army / city building was interesting, however some of the symbology is confusing with these aspects.

Update:
Ended up getting rid of simply because of how difficult this game would be to get played again.  I can see this playing well with 2p (Only ended up playing 3p), but for the same length, there are other 2p games I would just rather play.

I'm a bit scared by the amount of luck in the game. You really need to go out with tons of units to be sure you'll survive the worst odds. Also: tooons of rules to keep track of. One of them (pretty important one) incorrect in the English printed rules, hopefully it will be corrected in future prints.

After a 3 player game: still way too long. Took it down from 7 to 6. I'd rather play Civilization instead.

There is too little information about units, places and buildings, making the thematic immersion rather thin, especially if you don't own the most current version of the computer game.

In addition, the mechanisms differ significantly from the computer game, in some aspects without need, although sometimes in an interesting fashion. Still, it does not feel like playing the computer game !

Finally, the more humorous elements (the weird week names) are missing, further reducing the enjoyment.

The modular board has potential for some variants, like exploration missions, though.

Like computer version of Heroes of Might & Magic? Well, this game has (almost) nothing to do with it :). 

It kind-of resembles the Mage Knight, but somewhat less balanced and interesting. It seems that the game was released with an expansion in mind, so maybe the expansion would fix it up a bit (although, in my experience, games usually get less balance and more bugs with future expansions).

I have played only 2 times, so maybe my mind will change after more plays.

RATING: 3
(Rating after one play)

I love Heroes of Might & Magic the computer game, mainly because of the tactical combat and the way you build up a huge army over time. There is not much of this in here. I played a demo game at Essen 2014 and even though I was basically just walking through the monsters and didn't lose a single fight, the game was not very exciting. I guess there's strategy involved, but the fights are no fun at all. The system is innovative, at least I haven't seen it before.

They did incorporate the boring parts of HoMM though. Lots of back and forth with no real progress when it comes to taking control of the mines and regaining control of them.

I think I would have preferred a streamlined, shorter version of a HoMM game that focused more on the tactical combat, maybe a 2-player only game. (Oh, wouldn't this be sweet!?) It's too long for me for what it has to offer.

Descent game. Too luck dependent for a strategy game especially for something that has to live-up to it's name. It's too far from the computer game in my opinion, especially in the combat division. Artwork is good.

Better than anticipated, but I will only play it with two. The first play took a while to figure out how it should be played, but the second time it was both quicker and not least easier to explain. A lot of nostalgia for me, otherwise I probably hadn't bought it.

Missing a chart with ALL icons so that you don't need to search into the book every now and then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are some nice ideas here, but the traps of adapting the computer game are evident.

First, it was a terrible choice to use the same icons. They work on the computer screen, where you can move your cursor over them to read the descriptive text, but in the boardgame, they tell you nothing and you have to constantly consult the rulebook. In fact, the whole graphic design is confusing, and the structures on the map are hard to identify at a glance.

I understand combat had to be made simpler and more abstract, but it feels nothing like the computer game, while still taking quite some time. And although the initiative track is one of the nice ideas, it doesn't really work as it should, because the initiative range of units and monsters is very small, so that it rarely matters.

However, the game still is too complex for my tastes, keeping some unnecessary stuff from the computer game, such as hero skills (when they already have abilities), elite units and weekly events that change the rules. I wish they had adapted the simpler and better third game in the series, instead of the sixth.

There are also some more objective gameplay problems. Neutral monsters are a little too tough, and losing a battle is often too punishing, as you can lose units and the opportunity to take control of a mine. Besides, with mines providing resources and being the main source of victory points, there is just too much focus on controlling them.

In the presentation of the theme, the production could obviously have benefited from plastic miniatures, but the wooden buildings are not too bad. The lack of names for monsters and units, in the effort to make the game language-independent, hamper the immersion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the Computer games and this is a good and kinda close implementation of it (the board is hard to read, though), but also very luck based which (as usual) killed my whole game.

Another design flaw is the combat. Away from the die rolls and all the luck you need there, it just takes way too long. A single combat can take some time while the other players can't do anything, which creates unnecessarily downtime.

If you don't mind die rolls and some luck of the draw and like the franchise, it is a good adventure game for you. 

It's not a bad game per se, it's just not my cup of tea.

Very light boardgame version of the classic computergame.
Components and board are in good quality. You do get the feeling of playing the classic game. BUT the game it self, takes very long for what it is. And what is it? It is Might and Magic Heroes... Light!
The game has too few options, and those options you have are made into no-brainer decisions. Here I was referring to thís game tech-style tree.
Also kind of dumb that your heroes can't exhange items nor troops.
However the game is still quite funny. Just expect a very light version of the classic computer game..

Try to look up some updated rules on the web. The English ones that are included, doesnt seems to have been edited for errors.

just got the game and we played a 4 player game.  It was easy enough to figure out but one player got sick about half way through.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While there are some finicky rules and lots of special powers to grasp, the game play is pretty simple and straightforward.  The battles do create quite a bit of down time and is quite the dicefest although I find the system interesting (if I'm involved in the battle).  Different units may have special powers, there is an initiative rating which determines when they fight in each battle round, troops can be regular or expert (expert can return to regular as a "casualty", and the different characters/heroes all have differing strength, powers, and abilities.  Is it balanced?  Hell if I know.  

There is an economy aspect to the game as money and resources are important for constructing buildings which aid players and money to hire recruits.  

I also like the treasure aspect of the game where winning conflict often results in treasure which is taken from four different choices on a single card which is drawn.  

================================

The games do play differently, but I prefer Rune Wars over this one after my one play of RW.  Both are long games.  Both involve heroes although MMH admittedly integrates the heroes better.

RATING: 6
The game mechanics are very near to the PC Game, but in PC Version you often try to defeat all enemy factions, here you need victory points you can collect without any interaction with the opponents. War against other factions is very often not worthy, better stay strong and make your VP with idling thats quite boring. The game needs a workaround where players need to compete more each other and the combat system is one of the worst i`ve seen so far. Some of our battles take nearly 10 minutes cause of very high to hit numbers and regenerating skills, thats not funny anymore. Its okay, when the units get a specific amount of garantued dealt damage to the opponent, we are still think about modifications. Rest of the game works fine and is nice to play.

I had high hopes for this game.
Rules such as week cards (Which I can't figure out when to play or how, are they revelealed each before the first player marker moves? do you play 1 action card per week card or all three?)

The rules are messy and poorly written. After 1 play through with incorrect rules I played it with 2 friends. It ran long AND short at the same time. Playing 1 action card per week card MUST be incorrect, but playing all three per week card seems like an overly long game.

The battles often is a dice fest and takes too long per player, when all the other player wants to do is gather resources/build/recruit.

Power Points are way to hard to get, but again, if the games takes three times as long as ours did (ours took 3 hours not including rules explanation with one action per week).
Even with cheat sheets and labels for the heroes quick explaining icon-rules we had to look up several rules for clarification.

I really hope that the expansion fixes the rules, clears things up and hopefully streamlines the game much more.

As is, this is only a 5.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Saying that it is an "abridged version of the PC game" is the best way to describe this game. The authors have made a big effort to simplify the gameplay of the PC game and provide a similar experience in boardgame format.

There is wide assortment of rules and icons and your first games will need constant pauses to check the rulebook. Also, there's a lot of tokens and tiles you will have to move around; very messy.

The games lenght is nowhere close to those 2-3 hours printed in the box. Our first game (3 players, short game) lasted 5 full hours.

Big balance issues:
-> Some monsters are far easier than others and provide the same rewards, and it can create unfair huge differences between players.
-> The player going last in the last turn has a big advantage, because he can steal sites that give points and the owners will not be able to react.
-> The Treasure cards are very unbalanced too: some provide artifacts, ultra powerful items while others are pure shit.
-> The skills are also very unbalanced: some are useless and you can create combos that convert your character in killing machines (the winner of my first game had a lvl 4 character with 2 artifacts that caused 10 wounds per round of combat with initiative 5 and resurrected 7 units).
-> The buildings's cost is not representative of their usefulness.

That makes a very random game, and for me, random game + 5 hours lenght = trash. Nonetheless, I gave it a 4 rating because the authors have managed to capture the essence of the PC game very well. Still, I will do my best to avoid playing it again.

The manual could certainly be improved: it errors and leaves many things unclear, and lacks something really necessary: an index or handout with all the symbols and icons.

It's very similar to the PC game and precisely because of this, I see no reason to play the board game instead of the PC game.

It's a great game. It shines in late-game when you fight your opponents for the sites. It's pretty lenghty (A short 2-player game took about 2h)and you can expect quite a lot of waiting if you're four players. The quality of the components is fair. While the artwork is wonderful the layout could have a lot of improvements (e.g. name of the buildings would be nice, everything seems way too cluttered and kinda illogical). All cons are however just minor details to a really fun game!

While fun in theory and I am an avid fan of the computer Heroes of Might & Magic series, it translates well into the board game with the exception of the luck involved in combat.

You see, in the PC game there is luck for sure, but it's just a small factor that becomes less and less important as your armies grow. In the board game on the other hand, the dice based combat really ruins it for me.

I am not a big fan of combat in this game. It's quite convoluted in the amount of dice you roll, and removing units. I think that there are better adventure games (Runebound/MageKnight).

While I think the game is fun. The combat is quite long for how small a role it plays. So, while I like parts of this game, I feel that I don't feel the need to own this game.

However, after printing out a few player aids found in the files section and finding two HOMM PC game fans (both girls no less), it turned out the be a good game after all. It will take you an evening but in the end I think it is worth it.

Good game really capturing the feel of the M&M Board game. However, it is a tad on the long side with 4 players, a bit unbalanced with 3 and a bit boring with only 2.

What I do like in the game is the fact that so far it is the only game to capture three mechanics in a working format: area control, civilization building, and army building. Can't think of any other game succesfully marrying all three of these great mechanics, so it definitely has appeal.

Combat dice system for elite and regular units. Combat can take awhile to resolve.

A bit of setup and solo play. Board is very cluttered and busy. Will be selling it on, I think.

A really good fantasy game to me and my wife.

HOWEVER ... the rules are terrible and sometimes (a bit) confusing. I hope they provide us with a new version of the rules here on the Geek.

Got it @ the second Társasjáték börze. (it was the first I have ever attended).
Costed 9000 HUF (no bargain, as I was snatching fast).
The game is in mint condition, and complete.

Didn't really work for us at all.  Tedious and fiddly and basically commands pvp involvement, but everything is riding on the first pvp battle.  Appears almost impossible for the losing player to recover after a fight.

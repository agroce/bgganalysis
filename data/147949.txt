My absolute favorite sub-10 player count social deduction/hidden role game. It's a logic puzzle with lots of possible different interactions. In particular, I appreciate that there is a timer that short circuits some of the thinking.

Plays surprisingly well at 3/4p and I'd prefer it there over 9-10p almost any day.

Have racked up most of my plays of this with an experienced group and man it's hard to get the hang of. On the flip side it seems like it might have the most longevity in the genre, but it's best if skill levels are roughly matched. Having one new guy as the lone werewolf can lead to an extremely flat round - speaking from experience! But then again, it's only 10 minutes. 

It also has a surprisingly different feel to anything else in the genre I've played. And I think it'll work well 4p which is a bonus.

edit: it took a long time but I am definitely sold on this. It has a more dynamic, puzzly feel than The Resistance and I definitely think it's worth owning both.

edit 2: Now my clear favourite in the genre and one that only seems to get better and better.

[thing=147949][/thing], 3-10 players, 4-10 min per game. Works with 3 players if you are careful with the role set, is very good with 4 players, and great with 5+. You can never play just one. Get the free announcer app!

Is also suitable for players that think The Resistance/Avalon is too long and/or requires too much memory (team suggestions and voting patterns).

RATING: 10
Excellent game. I've always liked werewolf / mafia and its many variants, but this may be the best one yet. What really makes this game stand out is how well the characters play off one another. Every single character In ONUW (except for perhaps the generic villager) adds something interesting to the game. If you find the villagers win too easily in your group, you can add players like "The Minion" and "The Tanner" who can make it more difficult for the villagers. If you find the werewolves are particularly successful, you can throw in "The Hunter" who can potentially trick the werewolves into going after him and still win the game for the villagers. You can make almost endless variants to the rules to play with this deck, as well. 

Overall, ONUW is a very simple easy-to-learn game, with a ton of replay value, and a lot of strategy. Also the app for the game is excellent and allows everyone to play without a "storyteller." About the only complaint I have is that the name is a bit of a mouthful.

By far my favourite hidden roles game. Love how quick it plays - 5-10 minutes of fun tension followed by a pay-off and then everyone wanting to play again. 

The app is brilliant. Can't quite put my finger on why but it really adds to it (maybe the tense music?).

Not as good for non-gamers as I'd imagined though. Some people really seem to struggle with processing all the information, and following the logic. Although in that scenario people can still play by guessing from social cues who's lying.

I don't like this game. My first play, I was the only werewolf and wasn't sure what to do. i don't like the feeling of being singled out and accused of things-- which could be some personal psychological problem, but nonetheless, it made my experience uncomfortable.

Plus, trying to lie properly made my adrenaline shoot up and I was too shaky afterwards to play again.

Overall: A bad reaction first play. Tried again weeks later, still didn't like it. The acting and lying is too hard if you aren't given a "role task" to help you (like Avalon for example).

Played two more games, and in both games it felt broken since someone knew who was werewolf right away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a good party game and I am willing to play it, but my biggest dislike while playing games is having to lie.  Since that is a major part of this game, I can't rate it very highly but I can see why so many people love it.

It has the feel of a middle school playground: whoever talks longest and loudest usually gets their way.  There is some room for clever play though.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Being not the biggest fan of social deduction games, I was pleasantly surprised by One Night Ultimate Werewolf. The reason of that being the fact that the game plays very quick and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Many roles in this package in fact are actually very fun to play! Also a considerable improvement over the classic Werewolf is the fact that there's no player elimination in here and everybody is equally involved in the game for the whole time.

Quick, fun little filler game. Nothing extraordinary maybe, but I wouldn't mind to play it again every now and then. Social deduction is still not my cup of tea, but this game is between the ones I enjoy the most of this genre.

1st plays: Played this 3p 3x in quick succession so I'm only counting it as one play. The game was a lot of fun for a five minute game. I really like these kind of social deduction games, and this one plays VERY fast. The roles provide enough variability and just enough information. 

I love social deduction games but It is very possible that this game gets played out quickly and could drop fast. Then again, that's what I said about Avalon.

2nd plays: played this 6x, tried out the drunk, insomniac and minion. The game is excellent and I'm glad I added it to my order. Fast compact social deduction game with an evolving meta. More depth than I'd expect from such a compact game.

Very fast game, quick to explain, startup and play to conclusion. Very suitable to introduce a group to social deduction games.

As usual, the game is a catalyst to unlock the bluffing potential of each player, and as such it's also a great game to play with a new gaming group and getting to know people.

I love trying to deduce what happened at night, which proceeds to having my worldview shattered by the resulting role reveals. 
Pro: You can try to be a detective or you can just mess around. Both type of players are enjoyable. You can also never lie and just hope someone switched your werewolf card for a villager.

A reasonably quick deduction game that is very dependent on the gamers response. With the right group it shines but than, it becomes a little too fast. With the wrong group, this will not work at all.

I despise this game, but I'm not being emotional/contrarian by ranking it a 2.  Let me explain why this is bad:

1. The game loses a lot of nuance by playing it over one night.  You don't get to build off the consequences of your decisions on who to trust.  You can't slow play a betrayal.

2. There are far too many roles.  They don't add much, they confuse people, they lengthen the nighttime phase far too much, and they cause drunken mistakes that ruin games.

3. There are much better hidden-role games that don't require a moderator (resistance and its clones).  Werewolf/Mafia just does.  Without a moderator you miss the slow reveal of who is dying with the chance for elaborate death stories (part of the fun of killing your friends).  You miss a neutral to police things and move the night phase along smoothly.  You need a moderator to know when to force a vote and when to let the debate continue.

4. Oh my, Eric's tone and the way he says "thumbs" makes everyone laugh in a mean way.

RATING: 10
Pros
- Plays quick in about 10-15 mins
- People have to figure out what role they are at the end of the night. Makes for fun conversation. 
- Plenty of roles to change how the game is played each time
- Best with 5 or more
- App is great to be used in the game 
- Same werewolf feel to it
- Lots of lying in the beginning. Truths might appear after. Depends on who wants to lie about stuff. 

Cons
- Hard to coordinate the card switching with bigger numbers like 8-10pm
- Have to be quiet during all the card switching
- Might get a little tricky with all the killing conditions to win if there are a bunch of roles

This is an odd one. It's very streamlined to give you a specific, interesting experience. So in that respect, it should be lauded. But, for me, it's not quite a satisfying experience.

In the first phase - the night - you're effectively just generating the scene of a crime. This is a big elaborate production - if you're using the app - like this is the important/interesting bit of the game. But it isn't. From a practical standpoint, you could just give everyone cards which tell them things that their character knows, and they'd then know what they need to know in 10 seconds, instead of 5 minutes of closed eyes and tapping on the table, waiting. Granted, there might not quite be the experiential impact of having actually done whatever deed or seen whatever information, but personally I don't feel like it would be a major loss, and you could get on to the game faster.

In the second phase, where everyone is trying to deduce what happened during the night, it can be easy for things to devolve into a bunch of people talking all at the same time, and it's hard to keep track of what is going on and what information is revealed. You really sort of need a moderator to run the investigation - but then you're going to win or lose based on what type of character the moderator is. Since it wouldn't work, as the game is, and since there isn't such a role in the game, ultimately the investigation phase is liable to end up as a big blah of noise and confusion.

So, for all the effort the designers put into streamlining the first phase, really I would have preferred they'd spent more effort on the second phase, instead of just burping us up and letting us fend for ourselves, after the night is over.

I wouldn't say that The Resistance is a perfect game, either, but between the two I'd go for that one. You perform the crime in front of everyone, so that part is far more interesting. And since we get/create information gradually over the course of the game, it's less liable to turn into a noise fest of nonsense.

Incredible, essential, go get it right now if you ever play games with 4+ people.

After a ton of plays, I can assert that this is one of the best values in gaming, the hilarity and enjoyment that come out of this small box is nearly unparalleled in the gaming world. In terms of bang for buck, there is almost nothing else in the genre or even overall that comes close to this. It's an absolute 10.

Great light bluffing game, in the vein of Coup and The Resistance.  A lot more information than in Werewolf, but it ends a lot faster.  You need to get a bit of a feel for which setups are optimal, since certain roles bias towards Werewolves or Villagers but it's generally not too bad.  The relatively high amount of randomness (due to role swapping) is there, but it's a silly five-minute game so it's not too painful.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf adds a touch more deduction to the basic Werewolf template.  Various characters peek at secret identities and/or re-arrange them.  There is no point in concealing what you saw and did if you think you're not a werewolf.  It also does away with the need for a moderator and gets the whole game played in  less than ten minutes.  This is all quite a feat.  Despite the added deduction, there is still seldom enough information to lynch a werewolf with confidence, so, like its longer cousin, the game does boil down to persuasion.

A fast game of social deduction.  Great to play as a filler while waiting to play other games at my local group.

The free smartphone app is also a must have as it automates the role of moderator, removes the need to remember which characters activate when and adds more atmosphere to the game.

First time I played this game I hated it, but it was because of the group as it turns out. This game doesn't do well with people that take it too seriously and will only act on confirmed factual information. When I played it a game with people that just wanted to have a good time it was a blast. I am just sad that the latter type of experiences happened after the one night vampire KS, so now I have to wait for it.

After my first play it seems to be at least as good as Avalon especially at the lower player count. The skill of the werewolf can make or break the game. It plays quick so if a game breaks and a werewolf is found out without much of a fight then you can very quickly reset and start again. I'm looking forward to playing this more and finding out if it does manage to take Avalon's place. 

The problems with hearing people moving cards, noticing your card has been moved etc can largely be solved but not entirely eliminated by the app and with some improvisation. 

My initial rating is going to be a shaky 8. I have a feeling it may drop if the wrinkles I found in the gameplay can't be ironed out. Only more plays will clear that up.

Some of my favorite games are hidden role group deduction games (Resistance, Battlestar, Old Werewolf), so this game was right up my alley. I love that they made a free accompanying iPhone app that takes over the moderator role, definitely take the time to get this when you play the game. It was incredibly quick (partially due to low player count) but it still had a lot of strategy. In one game, I was able to convince one of the two other Werewolfs that I had swapped my card with the 3rd player, so we had to kill him. This wasn't the case, but I was able to convince her for the win. It definitely boils down Werewolf in a way that captures its essence without losing the fun. I thought Resistance was a filler game, but this is a filler-filler game; though I still plan to substitute this for regular Werewolf for any group below 11. Highly recommend if you like these type of games.

A good, fast deduction werewolf game with no moderator, no player elimination, and a whole lot of organized chaos. I love how even a player on the Villager team has the freedom to lie and try to oust the werewolves and have them turn on each other. The companion app works great as well.

This is a great game with the right crowd. The misdirect, accusations, and mistrust cause really fun player interaction. With the wrong crowd however, it's difficult to jumpstart conversation and too many people just claim villager and try and stay quiet for ten minutes.

A normal game of Werewolf can be give or take based on the people you've assembled to play, and the chosen Moderator and his/her skill at running it. With this version, it takes out so much of that 'legwork' and makes for an extremely entertaining, concise experience that you can play even with a smaller player count (3+). The APP narrated by Eric Summerer is amazing for customizing what roles you use in the game, and this is just an absolute blast of a 'party game' which even manages to feel thematic. Bluff, deduce, crack open some beers and enjoy a half dozen plays in a row. Awesome.

There's an iPad app for this that makes playing very easy and quick.  Makes the game move fast and fun.  With that app this is a great 10 minute filler.  I think that without that app, this would rank lower.

No player elimination or moderator, but otherwise it's much like the Werewolf/Mafia games that you're probably aware of. Play with the app to ensure that you get through the roles in the right order.
My expectation is that using a lot of the roles will improve the game, having many villagers in the available roles will heavily limit the information that can be used to work out who is what.

Very dependant on who is playing, one of those in my normal group plays randomly regardless of what role he had.

In comparison to the Resistance, this game ends up feeling much lighter as players have less useful information to work with. In fact, much of the information you have is based on what other players say and their body language. Yet, I enjoy this game immensely. The fact it, it plays incredibly quickly and ends up being one of the best fillers I've played. Furthermore, the production quality and android/iOS support for this game really add value. Outstanding game as long as you're not looking for something too deep.

A traitor with deduction game. The key to having a good game is have lots of cards that give out some information out, so you don't have a game where the discussion just ends after three minutes with no talking.

Very difficult to get the discussion started as there is very little information available at the start. There is also no incentive to start revealing what your role is to others or risk a bluff as a werewolf.

An amazing alteration to the classic game Mafia. It is better than Mafia and has a great app that allows you to play without a narrator. Every game is different and attempting to lie or convince others you are telling the truth is only half of the fun. Though it seems to not require a lot of strategy it can be greatly enjoyed by both those using strategy and those just going with the flow. Top 5 party game for me and if played with the right people it will always be suggested on a game night! The Daybreak expansion is very good, but I wouldn't consider it great. It can be used as a stand-alone game, but I enjoy it more as an addition to the base. Recommended Players: 6-8.

There's a tough balance here because half of your games are gimmies where the wolf is instantly identified or someone moves at night and gives away their role.  However, when the game isn't a gimme, it's great... and this is much quicker to get to the good moments than Ultimate Werewolf.

One of my favorite fillers - could make an evening out of this game or just play a hand or two.  Streamlines social deduction and removes the need for a moderator or person to read out the roles.  If you play it a lot with the same group I think you would quickly want an expansion but even with the base game there is a lot of fun to be had here and it scales really well although probably is optimal at the 5-8 level.

[i]Posted: 8/4/17, Rated: 9[/i]

I've been playing [i]Werewolf[/i] on the forums here at BGG since 2004.  It is an amazing game of social deduction and deception, and I made many friends whom I have met in real life at BGG.con as a result.  Still, the most memorable games are the ones which come down to a final three, or some other form of "must win" for the village.  [i]One Night Ultimate Werewolf[/i] basically distills that experience down to a six-minute affair, ending in one vote, winning team takes all.

The idea of having an app be the moderator is a brilliant one, and also one of those "why didn't I think of that?" kind of moments.  The narration by Eric Summerer of Dice Tower fame is perfect (side note: newer versions of the app have added a woman narrator's voice as well, but we still prefer Eric's).  There are plenty of roles to include, and not a whole lot of direction; I suppose the real idea is to just try different things because each game only lasts a few minutes.

Since the game is so quick and balance is left up to the players, I would lean towards giving [i]ONUWW[/i] a rating of "8."  However, it has been a hit with every group to which I have introduced it, to the point where family friends of ours have purchased their own copy, and my son wanted his own to take to college.  A game that approachable deserves an extra point.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf has instantly become the go-to game for my group when we have more than 6 players for gaming.  The game does have a bit of randomness to it, but I have found that if people are willing to share clues (and that aren't lieing) that many times you can correctly deduce who has ended up with which roles.  And sometimes the randomness creates scenarios in which you will pull off the perfect plan to disguise the fact that you were the werewolf, only to find out you weren't the wolf as a result of the night and that you just fought hard to lose the game.  I normally am a very competitive gamer, but this game draws out a light-heartedness that makes losing (or winning) fun.

Dunno how to rate this game.. The game enjoyment level varies differently, depends on the players who play the game themselves. When you play this with cunning, liar, and talkative friends, the game gets very exciting. On the other side, if you play this game with honest, not-talk-too-much, and boring players... You'll soon feel like stop playing.

Besides.. there are already many variations of werewolf games out there, and some of them doesn't even require you to use any card.

After the unboxing, some of us (me and my friends) was like "Why we even buy this game? We can even wrote the roles in pieces of cardboard and have almost the same experience (except for the artwork)".

For a long time Resistance: Avalon was the undisputed king of social deduction games for me. Right now it's still the king, but no longer undisputed. One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a very strong contender. One of it's advantages over Resistance: Avalon is the speed of play. You have less time to sow seeds of doubt in your opponents or solve the big puzzle of who is who, but that tends to bring out a different tension entirely and helps to get people talking. Which can sometimes be a problem in Resistance games, where some people end up silent enigmas. The clock is ticking too much for this to happen in ONUW! Plus, the really big difference is you want to figure out what happened to you in the night, because you might not be on the team you think. Which is huge! It turns a "team" type game into a truly individual one. It's absolutely fantastic. The one downside is sometimes it's too easy for the village team to "solve" what happened and correctly out the werewolves. But experience with the game helps, as do different character picks.

[i]Edit[/i]:  Okay, fine. It's equal to Resistance. One is deeper, one is arguably more pure fun.

Not bad, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be any real strategy involved. You just go based on the role you knew you had at the beginning of the game.

I've played this six times now.  And still have a discomfort with the intersection of logic and hidden information.  Not knowing for certain what your role is makes it difficult to follow or advocate a path.  It seems to be more about picking someone to believe and following the logic of what they've told you.  And that's often the card-moving roles.  It's fun, but it's off the chart on social and low on game for us so far.  Needs more plays!

To start with I thought...

This was overly complex. Considering at the end of the night you don't even know who you are, until someone gives away too much information, then it's finished. Frustratingly long night stage, followed by an often very short day. Avalon is a far superior and easier to explain game, with a far better payoff.

Then I thought...

Score has gone up as found a better group (closer friends) to play with. Really needs the larger player count, 4 is doable but just no fun.

I’m no enthusiast of boardgames that require a computer or smartphone to be played: yet in One Night Ultimate Werewold software makes for a valuable addition at least, as this little game is as fun as the original but also plays way faster than the regular Werewolf, which is a welcome improvement in my book.

Part of the reason that this game is so fun for me is that it is a really a low stress way to experiment with all sorts of absurd lies. I can try something crazy and see how it works. If I blow it, I can try something else in a few minutes. I've found that this game works well in some crowds and doesn't work in others. You really want to play in a group where the players are willing to lie. Half of my games end in shouting and laughter.

The whole intro part of closing and opening eye's feel weird and corny for me. The major problem is the game doesn't give you enough of a reason to accuse one person over another. It's like the game just dumps you off at misinformation-ville and tells you to start lying to each other.

Really depends on the group. Have had evenings of this that were an absolute hoot, but with other groups it has fallen completely flat. With the right players who are happy to lie and argue it is a really fun game and one round will be followed by another and another.

RATING: 7.5
This game is hilarious, and it does well in attempting to fix the original Werewolf's problems. I highly recommend it to larger groups that are tired of eliminating people the first round, only to have them pout in the corner for the next 30-45 minutes.

VERDICT:

This game hits its intended mark, and I highly recommend it to all Werewolf/Mafia lovers.

More data is may still be required, even after 20 or more games over 4 different sessions. This game will see a lot of play because its so easy to throw down. It is a great werewolf alternative for smaller groups, its fast like spyfall, and it creates a lot of laughter for its zany games where everyones roles change. I like experimenting with its different roles ALOT which gives it an edge on other, simpler deduction games, but I still think I prefer spyfall which I think it is most similar to for its tension. Use the app tho, and probably make sure you all tap the table at night, and its a excellent 2 minute mystery. One of the best, just very light, with not as much tension as I prefer.

RATING: 7
Was dreading my first Werewolf experience and the first few rounds justified my concerns. I then started understanding that there is a dynamic deduction process that can take place depending how you mix up the cards which allows variety and balance. Need to play more but not as bad as I thought it would be. Update: The more I think about it,the whole experience just feels arbitrary and pointless. It is draining and futile trying to convince and negotiate on logic which may be corrupted in the first place. Its like standing with someone in a prison cell who has been there for a week with no windows and trying to convince them its raining outside because you saw a rain drop when you came in an hour ago. The time I won as the wolf I just sat there quiet and all I said is I am not the wolf expecting to be burned but I won. Other times I tried convincing people it failed. Nonetheless, a fun social party game experiment.

Good for a large crowd (plays up to 9 people).  Bluffing and deduction game much like Mafia.  It plays in about 10 minutes, so that's nice at times.

RATING: 6
Fun and short - almost too short. Overall I still like traditional Werewolf better, but this works as filler and for smaller groups.

Some rounds were over immediately without much discussion, e.g. when the troublemaker says that he switched two roles, one of which was a werewolf, the now-werewolf has to come up with a very good lie quickly or the villagers win right away.

I don't like that sometimes you may not even know which role you are (if you're the drunk, or your card was switched by another player) so you have no clear goal. Bluffing and deduction is fun, but I need to know on which side I am. It's not a big deal though, since it it only happens with a few roles, and the game is over so quick anyway.

Great for what it is.  With higher player counts it's not got a lot of structure, too  much has happened during the night phase, worse still with the addition of too many tile manipulation roles.

Not really a game as much as a fun activity. I had a blast on my first few plays. Then it started to get old. And unfortunately, when your 11- and 13-year-old niece and nephew are around, demanding you play it again, and again, and again, and again... you might find yourself ready to throw the damn thing out the window. 

Definitely great for families, though, and a nice game to play with non-gamers. We even had my brother-in-law and my brother's girlfriend play, who are both terrified of our games. Will be picking up Daybreak for a change of pace.

Game plays quick, everyone's involved in what happens and role add enough variety to play again and again. It eliminates the player elimination for the original werewolf game, which is a plus. If someone is targeted as being a werwolf it's still very difficult to change that as part of group dynamics (whether the targeting is correct or not), but since it's only one night, everyone can jump back in right after voting. Components are nice and thick.

Villagers try to figure out who the werewolfs are and win if they kill one.  The werewolves win if they survive.  The only trouble is a lot of mischief occurs during the night and you never know who's lying and who's not...

Standard favorite as long as you play with willing people.  Playing with actors and/or compulsive liars is a must. The silly music options on the app are great as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the most popular quick social deduction game. Players must attempt to determine everybody's role and kill a werewolf to win the game. The game is very quick and usually leads to a few rounds being played in a row. The many roles bring some replayability and the fact that some roles are left unplayed means that you can never be sure if players are telling the truth. Very light but the game is definitely fun with a large group of friends!

RATING: 8.2
Just stellar.  A crazy amount of depth emerges after several plays as people realize the intricacies of deduction along with the layers of lying the game promotes.  Maybe the best five minute game I will ever experience.  I wish I could have played a game now instead of writing this review.

This game is just ok. The fact you don't know which team you are on after the night phase detracts from the game IMO.

Edit:
Played this a bunch with experienced players and plenty of roles that did interesting things (like swapping cards and looking at them). Which made the game much more interesting meaning I am bumping my rating to a 7. Also played with 4 with I think is a nice number.

When I claimed I was the Troublemaker even though I was the Werewolf. And claimed that I had switched a very convincing Villager for a not all that convincing Villager (in a one villager game), I realized what kind of tricks you could pull off while playing.

However, the game, as with Werewolf, has an awkward start. No one wants to reveal anything because, well, what's the incentive? It's hard to lie when no one has said anything, yet. And there aren't all that many roles where telling the truth is useful.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't become fun until someone reveals something.

The finger pointing at the end is, well, abrupt. Everyone takes an action and then you've won or you've lost.

So, the middle of the game is great, the beginning awkward, and the ending is, well, it ends. Very suddenly.

I'm kind of shocked by how much I enjoy this game. Going in, I expected Yet Another Social Deduction game, and it sort of is, but honestly, this is probably the one I've had the most fun with. Way more laughs and variety than The Resistance for our group.

There's a fun thing that happens where you're all under the pressure of the time limit (I suggest about 5 minutes with experienced players, 7 for noobs), but nobody wants to be the first to give away information. You want to know for sure which side you're NOW on before you give anything away, and it makes for a lot of fun tension, suspicion, and bluffing.

This functionally works with as little as five, but it gets exponentially more interesting with each added player. Tensions and confusion run REALLY high when you're up to 8 or 9 - as it should be!

Take all the bad bits out of regular werewolf, distill it down to a ten minute game, and a better game comes out. It gives the same feel of trying to figure out who's who and what happened, but it also feels like there are actual ways to deduce what happened, rather than being random guessing until a seer hits. Much quicker too, and all players are involved until the end, a big plus. A bit on the random side, but not game breaking. A good entry to social deduction.

While I’m not a fan of One Night Werewolf, I actually like ONUW quite a lot. There are many more roles, and they are all very interesting. You can mix and match and play with a lot of special power roles, and I always like the customization in a game. Whereas ONW felt random and boring and without any real possibility of deducing, I’ve found that there is actually quite a lot to be deduced in ONUW despite the fact that it only lasts for one night. However, one night doesn’t equal 2-5 minutes, it’s more like 10 in my main group as we tend to try to talk and deduce… Which also means that the werewolves actually lose most of the times! With skilled players, roles like robber and especially troublemaker become very important and can cause great havoc. I haven’t tried each and every one of the roles (think I only need to try out the tanner), and while some work better than others, they are all quite useful. And even if you have a bad/boring role, you can always claim to be somebody else and see what happens…

Sure, sometimes you can get unlucky and have no chance to win (and not even by a fault of your own, but if somebody has switched your role), but that’s the name of the game. It’s so short that you can always just play again! One problem I have with the game is that, with lower player counts, there is a chance for the troublemaker to switch a werewolf and a good guy. When the troublemaker says that, it’s often very hard for the new unawaring werewolf to win… But besides that it’s a good social game.
Oh, and the “lone wolf” optional rule should be the standard rule. Use it!

I feel like this a really solid, well-designed game, and the guarantee of being able to knock out a round in fifteen minutes is much preferable to the potentially interminability of a round of Werewolf. My only problem with this game is that I dread having to be the werewolf... Well, that and the fact that I find it hard to shuffle cards around on a table without making noise.

RATING: 8
An 8 rating might seem a bit strong, but it's hard to imagine something packing in more entertainment in roughly five minutes. One Night Ultimate Werewolf is strikingly similar to The Resistance. But there are some differences.

One Night is faster, there's only one round of voting, and out of the box you have a dizzying array of different roles. The unique combination of roles is where the fun is found. I give the slight nod to The Resistance because I like the information gained with each round of voting, but this is still pretty slick.

Played it a handful of times with four and with five, and the five player count was noticeably better. I'm thinking this is a 5+ player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A 10 minute social deduction game that really requires you to talk your way through it after the timer is up. I need more plays with some of the different roles to see how good it might be, but being the Villager and having absolutely no knowledge about anything made it really hard for me to actually play the game. I just kind of sat there and listened to everyone talk, which doesn't make a social deduction game very fun. There has to be something to spawn conversation and not knowing your role makes that really hard and results in nothing but blind guessing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can't decide if I like this better than the standard Werewolf game, or not.  Pros: everyone plays until the end.  Cons: your role/victory condition may change without you even being aware of it, so it makes it kind of hard to strategize.

A bit underwhelming after all the hype I've heard.  I did like that it was quick, but after several rounds of nearly everyone being villagers and no werewolves we were not impressed.  I think it being short actually hurt it as nobody got too invested in it to care so much who the werewolf was.

Big fan.  Have played this with 4 completely different playgroups and all of them had a blast.  I usually play one game with max vanilla Villagers to explain the concept, then quickly replace them with other roles.   I like that the roles can be mixed and matched to create a different experience.   Regardless of how it plays out, this always seems to end in uproarious laughter.    The short nature of the game means if someone ends up with a role they don't like, start to finish takes about 10 minutes, so deal out another round.

One Night Werewolf was a revelation for how good a game could be with only 8 cards. (It blew Coup and Love Letter away, I think.) Ted takes that great game and expands it in every direction: triple the roles, +4 players, and an incredible iPhone/Android app that solves my only issue with the game, which is it can be difficult to mod and play at the same time. Tokens for helping remember and make deductions are also a nice addition.

The best way I can describe this game is that it is like the players themselves create a puzzle, collectively, but each player only has one little piece of the puzzle.  Collectively they work together to solve the puzzle.  The only complicating factor is that some players can only win the game by ensuring that puzzle isn't correctly solved.  That this can be done in a span of ten minutes is amazing.

Best with 5-7, but is fantastic from 4-8. 9-10 can be hard for logistical reasons (everyone reaching the cards), while 3 seems wonky at first but once you figure out how to play at that count, it too is also amazing.

For a ten minute game, this is easily a 10.

The resistance distilled for the crowd that wants something a little faster and breezy.

There is only one round, so there is little of the positioning found in similar hidden identity games.  In my few plays thus far, it feels more like you need to make decisions based more on your gut than on the evolving information of the resistance.

However, the fun factor is a little higher on this one.  The throw away feeling allows some really out there play.  People ill make some outlandish claims to watch for reaction, an there is some room for some amazing bluff and doublethink in the short playing time.

I'd still choose the resistance for a more hard-core audience, but the benefit of the throw away nature of this one is that it an be embraced by much younger player (and with those younger players come a whole new helping of deduction).  Whereas I think the resistance begins to shine with a group that has played together multiple times, this one is for the occasional family get-together.

How did I get to 35 plays before I even thought to give this mini-review? Oh yeah, it takes like 10 minutes to play. It's good and very enjoyable. But even with this many plays, I find it hard to win as the werewolves. Villager victories feel like an accomplishment. Werewolf victories feel like luck.

Everybody, wake up! I'm a werewolf... must. blend. in. Wait! I was a werewolf. Am I still? I don't know. Crud! I look suspicious, but he's talking to much. I want to stop this narrative in my head so I can think. Come on, concentrate. Aargh. Time's up. Vote! Phew, they didn't catch me. Boy, that was lucky. Anyone up for another round?

Great game that suffers from it's main advantage. It's short! But, by the same token, it's short. Always a lot of fun for a few times, but if I have more time, and am picking hidden traitor games, then I'll go back to The Resistance.

An instant classic that only get better with each update.  A fun game of deduction and guessing that helps break up the usual "judge chooses a card" style of party games that are floating around out there.  Having the ability to have an app run the timer and do the talking for you is a great addition, and the extra variants add more and more but always remains balanced.  A great game of guessing and bluffing for a crowd looking to get down on some gaming.

Awesome game. Definitely best with at least 5-10 players, but still a decent way to play Werewolf if you only have three or four. 

I would say that the game is actually a fairly different experience than a standard game of Werewolf. It's basically the same concept, but it all comes down to defending your position and deducing who is what in one single round, thus making it much more intense. 

I'd also suggest you time the Day phase of the game, thus making coming to a decision more imperative.

Nice party game.
Homemade copy using my [i]Coup[/i] cards and the free [i]Android[/i] app.
Roleset for 4 players would be: Wolf x2 = [i]Assassin[/i] x2; Seer = [i]Contessa[/i]; Robber = [i]Captain[/i]; Villager x3 = [i]Ambasador[/i] x3. For 5 player, Troublemaker = [i]Duke[/i].

It's fun seeing where things end up. It's mostly random guessing though. And it is too much about manipulating other players vs manipulating the game, which I tend to prefer. If you like social deduction you will almost certainly like this though.

I didn't enjoy having to lie without having any information with which to do so.

I also didn't enjoy the random pointlessness of some of the roles, like the insomniac who just looks at his card and that's it.

RATING: 6.5
This is a really good party game especially when your group is a few drinks in. I rated it at a 6.5 because it doesn't work as well in smaller groups. It ends up being too easy to figure out who the werewolf is or just way too complicated. I usually only end up playing with 4 players and it just isn't as enjoyable at that player count. When you have enough people and the right kind of group, it is a lot of fun. I definitely liked having the app to do the narrating and having the sounds in the background to help drown out some of the noise of moving the cards. The app allows everyone to actually be involved in the game. 
I liked the fact that everyone was involved in the whole game and each round was so quick that you could turn around and play another one really fast, or just use it as a game for the end of the night that isn't as heavy. I would recommend this to anyone trying to get into the board game hobby because that is how I got hooked, or just someone trying to convince their friends that there are more games than just Monopoly.

This game was fun from the get-go, but it really began to shine once I embraced lying as part of the village team.  You don't know what people have done to you in the night, and you need to look out for your own survival.  Everyone provides a piece of the overall puzzle, and you need to shape your piece so that the puzzle suits your interests.  I love this game.  I just wish I could convince more people to play with the Doppelganger.

I'm not sure how much I really like Werewolf which I can take or leave, but generally find myself avoiding.  This makes my enjoyment of One Night Ultimate Werewolf quite surprising.  The quick playing nature of the game gives it that elusive "one more time" quality. This is a well developed variation that is the perfect end to a game night.

Loses some of the subtle nature of the roles, but it plays in 10 minutes a game. Not one for people who have trouble being sneaky moving cards around the table though. 

If you can forgive that, then you can love this for it's speed, it's simplicity, and the fact you can say you're the seer without dying in the next night!

RATING: 10
This game just hit a homerun out of the ballpark and into the funhouse at the local Carnival. It distills all previous versions of Werewolf paranoia into
a micro game with a rollercoaster ride of thrills and kills in under 10 minutes. What Ted did right with this incarnation is something we also stumbled upon when making our own unpublished "The Thing" -game. There is a slight chance nobody is a werewolf. The tension of not knowing if there was a werewolf present was missing in previous iterations of the game. The App also removes
the moderator role so I can also get into the action.
Great stuff! THIS IS THE ULTIMATE WEREWOLF version to
buy. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????

Brutal!!! El mejor juego que tengo que dure tan poco. Posiblemente también sea el juego que tengo que dure menos, pero bueno. No me lo esperaba, que un juego que dura tan poco y se juega con tan pocas cartas (con 12 sobran) pudiera llegar a ser tan divertido. Vale que no es la cosa más compleja, elaborada y sesuda del mundo, pero divierte. Y que algo que tenga 12 cartas divierta hasta el punto de querer partida tras partida (al durar 2-3 minutos cada partida, siempre quieres más), sólo se puede decir que es un juegazo.
Para mi, ha destronado a Love Letter, Coup y demás como chorrijuego para pasar el rato. Pero muy de lejos.
Mucha gente opina que es muy caótico. Mal, porque no lo es, realmente tiene muchísima más información que cualquier juego de este estilo, solo que hay que razonar un poco para deducirla, y la gente que lo suele decir no son de razonar. Y los haters de juegos sociales también se deberian apartar de este juego. Pero todos los demás... probadlo! No os defraudará. A 4 jugadores puede que un poco, pero a 5-6 es una maravilla. Y una vez entra en juego el esbirro... Precioso!

Components: Simple, sturdy, legible tiles. Helpful app.

Experience: I'm impressed. I haven't had to be the werewolf yet and lie, but this makes the games so much shorter and less painful as the werewolf, and changes it from a social deduction game to a logical deduction game. I enjoy the nighttime, as I'm trying to imagine what chaos might be happening. Quick-thinking werewolves can be rewarded for assuming a false identity.

I can't think of a game I've played more than this one.  the crazy fun it offers is often too much to pass on.  My game group's go-to filler.  We often play it so much that it devours the rest of game night.  The chaos may be too much for some, but to me this is social deduction at its very best.

Short rounds means that there is no space for elaborate scheming, which really evens out the skill for people who aren't as good (me) and lowers the consequence of losing, allowing for a snappy, fun time.

Absolutely classic party game by now that serves as more of a social experience than an actual game.  Personally I prefer The Resistance because it provides more of an actual game experience and gives order to the conversation but I won't turn down a game of One Night Ultimate Werewolf.  This is the game that turned me onto hidden roles and social deduction (something I really love) and for that reason I'll probably always keep a copy around.
  Awesome social experience that I highly recommend if you haven't yet tried it.

Quick and fun filler which involves an awful lot of lying and baseless accusing, or you can try to be silent and hope that someone thinks that you're a werewolf only to be revealed that you were the minion. Easily re-playable. The app helps a lot with playing the game without a moderator.

People who won't play Werewolf will play One Night. When you don't have enough people to play Werewolf, you can still play One Night. When you don't have enough time to play Werewolf, you can still play One Night. When people are too tired to play Werewolf, they can still play One Night. When people are in too sour a mood to play Werewolf, they will still be in the mood for One Night. One Night is superior to Werewolf. One Night is one of the best fillers. One Night is one of the best bluffing and social deduction games. Try to prove me wrong, but don't hold me responsible for the wasted time you won't get back, since you can't do it.

Was incredibly excited about this the first couple of times i played it. Now, after 10+ sessions of probably 10+ games per session i'm losing interest. I still rate it an 8 as i think i got more than my money's worth out of it and i'd still play it any time somebody wants to play.

pro: 
fairly quick and simple
great intridcutory game to werewolf/hidden roles/deduction games
Very accessible, i have yet to see a new (casual) player seriously dislike it.

con:
Too random. Too many rounds either provide too much or too little information. Good bluffs become random guesses.
Some rounds become almost auto-wins for either side (2 werewolfs+ minion vs. 3 generic villagers, yeah, it's rare but it happens)

I'd rather play Resistance: Avalon, which takes a bit longer to explain and play but provided more consistent experiences.

And then a couple of months later, after some more plays (because people keep requesting it):

We finally added more roles: minion, tanner, drunk.

BRILLIANT!!!!  JUST SO F****G GOOD!!!!!

We've seriously had some insanely fun game nights with this one! Worth every penny!

If you find it gets boring, check out ALL the other characters!!!!  the Tanner, Drunk and Minion really take it to a new level!!!

A quick filler/opener that gives you a condensed version of Mafia/Werewolf.

Random to the point where you cant really take the game serious in any way. And this is - in my opinion - where it shines most, as a quick and silly game about making mischief and just having fun. Which is nice, but also very dependent on your group. For me, it is too random - but I get that this is the point. I just more often in a mood to play a lighthearted social deduction game like secret hitler than to jump into the chaotic randomness of ONUW

3-10

Er moeten altijd 3 kaarten meer worden gebruikt dan het aantal spelers. Schud de kaarten en geef iedereen gedekt 1 kaart. Iedereen bekijkt in het geheim zijn kaart. De overige 3 kaarten (gedekt) en de fiches van alle karakters in het spel komen in het midden van de tafel.

Gebruik altijd minstens twee weerwolven aangevuld met andere karakters.

Nacht: de verteller/app roept alle karakters 1 voor 1 op. 
Dag: na een paar minuten discussie wordt er gestemd door een andere speler aan te wijzen. 
Het spel is afgelopen na 1 nacht en 1 dag.

Het dorp wint als er minstens 1 weerwolf sterft of als er geen enkele weerwolf in het spel zit en er is niemand gestorven.
De weerwolven winnen als er minstens 1 speler weerwolf is en als er geen weerwolf is vermoord.

Karakters die ’s nachts wakker worden:

1/ Dubbelganger (weerwolfteam of dorpsteam)

De dubbelganger bekijkt ’s nachts de kaart van een andere speler en neemt die rol aan.

2/ Weerwolf (weerwolfteam)

De weerwolf opent ’s nachts zijn ogen en bekijkt welke andere spelers de weerwolven zijn. Als niemand zijn ogen opent, liggen de andere weerwolfkaarten gedekt  in het midden van de tafel. Als er maar 1 weerwolf is, mag hij naar 1 van de gedekte kaarten in het midden van de tafel kijken.

3/ Volgeling (weerwolfteam)

De weerwolven houden hun ogen dicht maar doen hun duim omhoog zodat de volgeling ziet wie de weerwolven zijn. De weerwolven weten echter niet wie de volgeling is. De volgeling behoort tot het team van de weerwolven. Wanneer de volgeling sterft, maar geen enkele weerwolf sterft, dan winnen de weerwolven en de volgeling. Als er geen weerwolven zijn, wint de volgeling als er iemand anders sterft. 

4/ Vrijmetselaar (dorpsteam)

Gebruik steeds de 2 vrijmetselaars. De vrijmetselaar wordt ’s nachts wakker en kijkt of er een andere vrijmetselaar is. Als er geen andere vrijmetselaar is, dan weet hij dat de andere vrijmetselaarkaart gedekt in het midden van de tafel ligt.

5/ Ziener (dorpsteam)

De ziener mag ofwel 1 kaart van een andere speler bekijken ofwel 2 van de 3 kaarten in het midden bekijken.

6/ Dief (dorpsteam)

De dief mag een kaart van een andere speler stelen en zijn diefkaart in de plaats liggen. De speler die de diefkaart krijgt, behoort tot het dorpsteam. De dief behoort tot het team waarvan hij een kaart heeft genomen (hij mag de actie van dat karakter ’s nachts echter niet meer uitvoeren).

7/ Onruststoker (dorpsteam)

De onruststoker mag de kaarten van twee andere spelers met elkaar verwisselen zonder er naar te kijken.

8/ Dronkaard (dorpsteam)

De dronkaard ruilt ’s nachts zijn kaart met een kaart uit het midden van de tafel zonder deze kaart te bekijken. Hij weet dus niet wat zijn nieuwe rol is.

9/ Slapeloze (dorpsteam)

De slapeloze wordt ’s nachts wakker en bekijkt haar eigen kaart (zodat ze weet of haar kaart al dan niet ’s nachts is veranderd).

Karakters die ’s nachts niet wakker worden:

1/ Dorpeling (dorpsteam)

Geen speciale vaardigheid.

2/ Looier (geen team)

De looier wint alleen als hij sterft. Als de looier sterft en er sterven geen weerwolven, dan winnen de weerwolven niet. Als de looier sterft en er sterven ook weerwolven, dan wint het dorpsteam ook (samen met de looier). 

3/ Jager (dorpsteam)

Als de jager sterft, dan sterft de speler die hij aanwijst ook (ongeacht het aantal stemmen).

RATING: 6
Above average gateway social deduction game that can be random and frustrating as you have to play from the gut. Short playing time (3-5mins) mitigates the randomness and acts as a great selling point to convince casual gamers (ie colleagues) to join in compared to the longer Resistance. A play every other week kind of game.

We are no great fans of regular Werewolf, but this one is really a hit with our Tuesday game group. They prefer lighter games with a good laugh. Theme is nice, also the extra characters in the promo packs, and plays are various enough to keep playing.

RATING: 8
One of our new favorite party games. Despite many roles, it's relatively easy to teach new players. Using the free app from the app store makes narration a piece of cake. Not eliminating players early makes this game much more enjoyable than traditional werewolf. The rounds go by very fast (we use a 5 minute timer), which keeps everyone interested.

(We haven't yet tried to play with the Doppelganger... that card seems to be the most complicated, so we've just skipped it to this point.)

RATING: 7
This is one of my favorite go-to party games. The game is incredibly simple to teach and learn and the companion app for your phone takes away all the overhead/memorization needed to play it. It takes almost no table space to play so it's great for play around holidays where drinks/food permeate the tabletop and can't be easily cleared.

Some minor caveats that keep the game from being rated higher: There's is very little concrete information to go off of, so many games devolve into baseless accusations (although to be fair, this is half of what makes it fun too). It also may take people some time to acclimate to what all the roles do, making newbie werewolves easy to spot. There's also a tendency for players to give away their roles at night by hearing the rustling of clothes and squeak of chairs. The app tries to mask this with some background music, but realistically it requires all players to commit to doing some light shaking during the night to mask who is moving.

I've never been a Werewolf junky, though in the past I've played my fair share and have had a good time doing so.  However much I used to like it, I'm over that now.  I pretty much actively avoid it in favor of anything else.  But some friends wanted to play the terribly named One Night Ultimate Werewolf (which initially indicated to me that it would take an entirely game night to play).  The game wasn't bad, and I do think the sped up proceedings completely stopped the game from being painful.  There was a feeling that you didn't really have any way to know things and it was pure randomness, but people tended to speak up and that wasn't a problem.  Ultimately, it's not a game I'm going to seek out, but I'd be fine playing again.

RATING: 8
Fluffy little Werewolf variant, played over one night and one day.  Players secretly examine their character then a night phase takes place.  Characters can be examined, swapped, replaced and so on, so when day breaks, things may have changed and players may not be who they initially thought themselves to be.  During the day phase, a free form discussion takes place, where players talk, lie, threaten, cajole, reveal and so on, to try and piece together the puzzle.  Finally, after seven minutes, a vote takes place and a player is lynched.  If it's a werewolf, the villagers win, otherwise the werewolves win.

Fun little 10 minute diversion.  Plenty of roles to blend in and out of the mix.  The victory conditions feel a bit clunky and needlessly complex, making this more a game for gamers.

Brilliant game! I've easily played this well over 50 times in the last few weeks. Especially terrific with the free iPad app.

I think there are enough bluffing/deduction game fans for this to easily make the Top 100 next year.

There is enough different about this game to have a spot next to Werewolf and The Resistance in peoples collections, and the 10 minute play time will ensure it gets played often.

If you don't like the genre there's nothing here for you but if you do...then do up a PnP copy today so you can play it over (and over) during the holidays. And save that Christmas giftcard for next year, you'll need it.

Suffers from the same problems as normal Werewolf (namely, anybody given villager basically gets to do nothing for the whole game, but playing with few villagers backs werewolves into a corner of having to pretend to be a seemingly random role). Fortunately it runs extremely fast, so the boredom is pretty small. Not the best social deduction game on the block, but it's usually got for a few plays, and can be a solid opener or closer to a night.

Oh, I've gotten many plays out of this game. This is classic werewolf except... it only last one night! This means there is no player elimination and rounds take about 5-10 minutes. We always end up playing this game over and over whenever we start. Trying new roles and adding in the expansion roles is fun and spices up the game. Since the game is so short and intriguing, I would almost never turn down a game.

Played this a lot this one night and I enjoyed it but out of the three versions of Ultimate Werewolf I've played, this is by far the hardest to be werewolf. The fact that you only have one chance to win, you have to lie and lie hard. This makes playing the spies in The Resistance look easy.

Still though, this or Ultimate Werewolf Inquisition or The Resistance? I still don't know yet. Inquisition is still very interesting whereas The Resistance is becoming stale to me.

It was fun, but I was stuck with the same role in both my games. The joker or something...which really didn't do anything, and in that case the game was pretty meh. I'm waiting on rating until I can get a few more plays in.

Update: 8 playes in and I like the game. In some crowds I've seen it turn into too much of a puzzle, but for many crowds its just a really good time. It stays at a 7 because my rule is any higher than a 7.0 and I seriously start to consider buying...and I'm just not 100% there yet with it for some reason.

Kickstarter, super precise on schedule.
The game itself is very light and very much fun. It's for when you're in mood for the Resistance but not in a mood for yelling and fighting. It's so much light hearted and variable depending of the setup. I recommend playing with a phone app, and not being afraid of making noises during the night phase. It's in a spirit of the game.

I have had the opportunity to play this game several times and it's always a good time.  Scratch away all the presentation and everything and what you have is a reason to yell at your friends.  It has the distinct advantage over Werewolf in that One Night is ref-less.  However, I think the meatier experience is always going to be the full-on game, but this one always works in a pinch.

With the right group, this game is great. Key word - right group; werewolves need to bring their A-game or they will be sniffed out right from the get go.

"Randomly pick someone. 50/50 chance you've won the game"

Took the lustre off what was otherwise a very enjoyable experience.

I like hidden role games and this one has it's moments.  But there are many games where it doesn't have it's moments and is remarkably dull, depending on who got what roles.  Depending on the info provided and when, sometimes you can simply 'solve' for who the werewolf is, which is not really fun.  The saving grace here being that if you have a dull game, it will be over in a matter of minutes.

RATING: 7
This was my go-to quick social deduction game for 5 - 7 people. Unlike the Resistance I like that it has an app that takes care of the opening spiel as well as the fact that it has completely divergent play to BSG.  The great thing is that there is no player elimination (I'm looking at you Coup), the game only takes about 10 minutes, and comes with a variety of roles to keep things interesting.  

If I had to knock anything about the game, I would say that rustling sounds during the night phase can ruin things. The trading of roles is also annoying for a few reasons: Tiles are included to make picking up the roles easier, but being that they are tiles, if they get marked the game is ruined. You can sleeve the tiles, but then you have to be more wary of changing the orientation of roles when roles are swapped. Finally, trading is annoying because if people pay attention to where their role card is and it's in a different location when they wake up, they know their role has been swapped and have an advantage.

Don't let these minor issues scare you away from at least trying the game to see if it's right for you.

I appreciate this game in almost every facet of it's existence, even down to the Eric Summerer voiced app. I am a voice over artist and radio personality, so when I hear a quality voice, I know the game is going to be a quality game. Why doesn't this game get played? Once The Resistance hits the table, that is all the group wants to play. Once we get tired of Resistance and Avalon, we will probably start giving this one a run. For now it sits on my shelf.

Fun party game.  When the in-laws are in town, who are NOT gamers, we break this one out and they absolutely love it.  Maybe not the best bluffing / social deduction game out there but it's simple to teach and is always good for a few hours of hilarity.

The companion app is great and is a must have.  It's best with 8+ people with ~6 being the bare minimum.

My favorite hidden role game. Its greatest achievement is probably how distilled it is; super quick to play and no player elimination, works well with a handful of players (when most hidden role social games need 6 or more before they get fun.

The biggest downside is probably all the time spent in set up (the night phase) where you're basically just waiting for most of that time, but it's a relatively minor complaint.

I want to like this more, I love The Resistance and Mascarade. But I'm worried about the swapping mechanism. The game could be ruined by players being too loud or displacing the tiles in an obvious way. The real world physics of this game may make it very hard to play as intended without a meta-game creeping in. 

Daybreak expansion included.

*Update: Played again and had a much better experience. The App really helps by drowning out sounds with background noise. Also it helps to have the cards in a tight group in the center of the table, not directly in front of each player.

ONUW and The Resistance are both games of deduction and deceit, but they're quite different in both style and play. The Resistance could very well be played silently, with all information sharing being performed through in-game methods (primarily voting and team selection). ONUW is on the other end of the spectrum, being almost entirely reliant on freeform discussion. So far, I like it, although with only a few plays it seems that lone werewolves have a tough job (we were unaware of the lone wolf variant at the time).

Very quick and easy to play party game.  The moderator app is a must as it allows everyone to participate.  There is a lot of randomness too it the more crazy characters you add though the villagers seemed to win every time when we played.  Its a definitive step down from ultimate werewolf for me as I'm not sure I like the changing/random roles...takes away from some great discussion and accusations that took place in UW.

RATING: 9
One Night Ultimate Werewolf is geared towards less players (including 5-6 players), and consists of just a single round of play, with no player elimination or moderator.

It has two additional characters dealt to the middle of the table, to add some uncertainty to the mix. Of the special characters in the game, one role is a robber, who secretly switches another role with his own, and a trouble-maker, who secretly switches two other roles.

This makes deduction possible, but it will be thwarted by the deception of any werewolves that are present... 

It's not completely a guessing game: if everyone told the truth, you'd have enough information to deduce all the roles.  Problem is, at least one person is probably lying... and that's where the fun comes in!  (but do non-werewolves have any incentive to lie?)  

This mixture of bluffing & deduction sounds exactly like the kind of micro-game I enjoy immensely.

3-8 players, asymmetric teams. Quick, light, and extremely silly, this fast-paced version of Mafia/Werewolf throws out all of the strategy of the original in favor of pure chaos followed by "can we figure out what just happened?"

This is a great party game.  I play it mostly with non-gamers, and it always is a hit.  It's quick and really simple to explain.  There isn't much depth to it all but for a party game, it delivers.

2 plays - 7: so far so good. Will become more interesting as i wrap my head around the game more. Right now it's pretty confusing but promising.

214 plays (including expansion) - 8: this was a 10 for me for a long time, i just never thought to update my rating. We just played it over and over and over, back to back to back to back. Finally a bit burnt out on it atm though, tired of the effort required to constantly coming up with believable lies. :P

I still don't understand why this game works as well as it does, but it somehow manages to. You go to bed at night after looking at your power and then wake up in the morning after everybody has exercised their power during the night phase. The thing is, somebody might have used their power to switch your card and you wouldn't know it. That shouldn't work, but somehow it does because it creates situations for people to either give the village information or lie and obfuscate things.

It's definitely a hard road to hoe as the bad guys though. If you're a wolf or minion, you better be ready to have a bogus story to sell upon wakeup. My group is seeing a lot of overly bad play by the minion to die and take one for the team which provides some nice double-think.

Update: Nowhere near as good as the real thing, but it has its niche -- a large group but not a lot of time. We have a lot of fun with this one and have found the less time the better b/c things get crazier with time running out. With more than, say, 5 minutes, the village usually is able to figure things out. So less is more here.

Looking for a fast and fun social deduction game?  Try this one.  There's just enough information available to the table that you can make a very educated guess, but just enough hidden information that one can also make educated bluffs to throw people off.  This game is boring and broken if people always tell the truth, so it really shines after the fourth or fifth play and people are used to it.

Only takes about 2 minutes to explain and 7 minutes to play! The game only gets better with more players and as you introduce more roles, and stays fun enough that I typically want to play at least 3 rounds (and usually a lot more if the group is good)!

This is probably my favorite bluffing game. The lack of player elimination and the hard cap of a very short play time keeps the game moving along without getting stale (or stressful) for me.

RATING: 7.8
This game has the potential to breed some of the most hectic-fun, mind-boggling, and satisfying experiences! I've had many many incredibly exciting moments and memories playing this game! At its best no one trusts anyone besides themselves(even that isn't ensured) and there is no way to be sure of what really happened, alongside an exhilarating adrenaline rush increasing until the final moments. After the reveal holds either incredible triumph or a still-confusing defeat; in either case, my favorite part is the potential, prolonged chatter and discussion about the game, sometimes lasting longer than the game itself!
Although, at its worst, there is little excitement. All too often there is no question over which character is which. No unsureness. No satisfaction. Everyone votes for the same player and the reveal is quiet. This can be due things going to smoothly, randomly, or the culprit is the group you are playing with. If there are a few or multiple people who aren't invested at all, it somehow often ruins the whole game. No one has a reason to disagree or lie because no one cares! This can be a huge issue for me, although I don't think that its entirely the game's fault! Almost every game suffers when the players don't care. Overall, I have loved my time with this game, despite the mundane rounds! Great quick game for a big group! (Most of my plays have been with the Daybreak expansion too, which I recommend you pick up along with the base game.)

This game is very simple to learn and the rounds go by quick, so after just 20 minutes of playing you should have a few rounds under your belt, and a great understanding of the mechanics.  The phone app you use will walk you through each step to avoid any confusion.

Perfect game to start a night of board games, or to bring new players into new styles of games to play.  It's a very party friendly game and as there is almost no explanation necessary you can get new players up to speed in minutes.  

My only suggestion to people looking into this game would be to play with at least 5, and not use the specialty cards right out of the gate!

One Night Ultimate Werewolf has proven to be one of the most popular games within my various gaming circles. It isn't the best game in my collection, but it's certainly one of the most accessible. 

+ There is minimal setup time.
+ The app removes any need for a moderator.
+ Short game length leads to many quick games, variety to the roles each player gets to experience, and a rapidly changing meta-game. 
+ The rules are easy to explain, but...

- ...teaching basic strategy to new players can prove difficult, particularly in the context of changing roles after the night phase. Several individuals that I've played with have struggled to figure what exactly they need to be doing in order to win.
- Teaching many new people at once leads to relatively boring games, at least until they figure out how beneficial it can be to lie, misinform, etc.
- It can take some time to figure out good character setups. Be careful to keep the balance between werewolves and villages stable.

It's an amazing feat that a game that lasts at most 5 minutes can retain most of the feel of the "real" Werewolf. Which, if you don't much like the original, isn't overly helpful, obviously. Still, I consider this variant a considerable improvement if only because it is over much sooner.

I'm not sure that I will ever play standard Werewolf again. While I enjoy the game very much, the fact is that it takes a long time at the preferred player counts and the elimination factor is too much to bear for many. 1NUWW on the other hand manages to distill the WW experience nicely and has the virtue of not requiring a moderator and playing in 5-10 minutes. Stellar.

Fun, fast, and light. This is the social deduction game without any of the hard feelings that social deduction games often create, possibly taking from it some bite.
Because of how quick the game is and how limited information ultimately is, it comes down to guess work very quickly, but due to that incredibly short playing time, it is easy to play multiple times in succession.

Werewolf is one of my favorite games, so I had to try One Night Werewolf. The first time I played I actually disliked this game a lot, it felt super random and just too easy to figure things out. But since then, I've grown to love this game. When played right, it definitely can be a great challenge to figure out what happened, and with the amount of roles the game provides now, every game can be different. You always play more than one game when you play.

Also own:
-Daybreak: More roles for the game with special wolf roles make the game even more fun. Still have to try the artifacts.
-One Night Ultimate Vampire: Just came in recently and really want to try this. Also very curious about a game with both werewolves and vampires.

Not a big fan of Werewolf, but willing to give this incarnation a try. It has the flavour of WW, but super quick. Different roles facilitate the one-round-only game. I was the Seer both times, which didn't help me particularly because it was my role to look at the first card, but then there is so much trading that goes on afterward, it really just becomes a shit-storm of confusion and lame accusations. Yeah, there's some deduction going on but it only goes so far as how much you trust someone - and that trust always has very few legs to stand on. Oh well, it was worth two rounds, but I can't imagine wanting to play this again. Would much rather play Coup.

I HATE the normal Werewolf game. It takes to long, the gamemaster is either bored to death or trys to entertain the whole group with "roleplay" stuff I hate in such games, the player elimination sucks (esp. in the first few rounds where it's totally random) etc.
All this issues are fixed with ONUW. This is probably the best hidden-roles-kinda game (altough I don't longer own this and instead have kept the resistance - its "more" of a game"; ONUW is super easy to teach and easy to play; great game for large groups

I enjoy playing this game with a group of 6-8 players. Art is beautiful, the game is fun, fast paced, messy, easy to teach and great for family. 
However, I have observed that newbies struggle to feel when to bluff and when to tell the truth. In the other hand, with confirmed players, it gets impossible to tell if someone is bluffing or telling the truth. In fact, so much bluff gets into it that it gets very hard to have a strategy, preventing the game from being deep.
It has some early replayability as you choose different characters each game. But as people get to know how to play, replayability runs out as people bluff well, the game gets too messy to make anything out of the new characters in play.
Finally, the game can either suffer from Quarterbacks taking control of the discussion or the discussion can get also super messy - either way is not cool.

An interesting take on the Werewolf/Mafia style of game. Everything takes place over one night, so really this comes down to one big argument over who's telling the truth about who they were at the start, and what they got up to when everybody's eyes were closed. Roles can be swapped, replaced, or spied on, and some have additional win conditions.

I'd say the app for this is almost essential as it handles all the stuff about who has to open their eyes in what order, so nobody has to referee things.

Having to make a bit of noise to obscure people moving tokens around is a bit odd, but you get used to it.

It's a great concept, but I just didn't have fun with it. Maybe it was the people I played with, there was a lot of meta-gaming. I still don't like that you can be change teams without knowing or that sometimes because of this it's obvious who a werewolf is negating the whole point of the game. There's also the general hidden role problem that it's just no fun being a simple villager.

Excellent party game.  


Players start with some information and allegiances.  Things are then potentially changed through the chaos of the secret night actions.  Players then use lies, half-lies and the odd bit of truth to figure out not only what happened but also which team they are on.  This is followed by a flurry of finger pointing and players checking to see if they have won.  It is quick, fun and offers a rich thematic induction/bluffing experience.

I love how there is this layer of pressure, created by the chaos, that forces the players to engage each other.  Not only is the engagement necessary but It adds to the tension/theme.

I can see how this game might fall flat if a group fails to engage and adopts an overly rigid understanding of how to play.  This game really rewards creativity, deduction and flexibility.  It is pretty much exactly what I want in a party game.

Not sure what to think about this one. We played it 4 time trying to see if we could make ourselves like it, but in the end it really is just a guessing game because of all of the shenanigans with swapping cards. But if you take the card swapping roles out it is pretty dull.

RATING: 10
Much simpler and easier to pull out and teach than ultimate werewolf. Instant hit and I never looked back. Very social based game. The game goes no where unless someone points the finger first and crys "wolf!" Meaning, if people don't try to accuse others, this game is not for you

RATING: 8
My favorite party game - No time commitment, can handle when drunk, don't have to worry about playing wrong because the round will end soon. At the same time, allows you more opportunities to be clever, more ways to be clever, and no need to stick with bad lies (again, short rounds, varied lies). Leaves room for deduction and bluffing both. 

Edit: I only played secret Hitler one night, but I could see that fitting here. It's less random/you have more to go on than one night, but it's not as in-depth/long as other hidden roles

I love playing this with the family (4 generations, different education levels, and different social statuses). Lot's of fun can be had and now it's expected that I bring it to family gatherings. We actually incorporate our younger kids into the game too. Normally they will "team" up with one of the players so that they see what's going on and know if they are a werewolf or not. Extremely helpful to have the app.

Might be that we were just too tired when we tried it in a 7 player group. It is no where near The Resistance imo.
Tried it again several times with my kids. It is easier for them, and we really enjoy it. That makes it a game I will get.
Still more into Resistance :-)

RATING: 7
A bad game for a novelty-focused crowd; with people who don't yet have the roles internalized, it seems like the metagame is "shrug and give up", which did not lead to playing it enough to outgrow the problem.

Update: Using different roles than are suggested for small groups solved most of the problem, and playing several times in a row with the same group solved the rest of it. I recommend adding the Tanner if the villagers are always trivially winning by telling the truth.

This has given me a bit of a new lease on social deduction games. Super fast so people stay interested and you get a lot more feedback rather than taking twenty minutes to get to the conclusion of a game of The Resistance.

That being said most social deduction games aren't that long anyway, but given that I'm not the biggest fan anyways the shorter play works for me.

This game is MUCH better than it has any right to be.  I'm not a big fan of regular werewolf so I avoided this for a long time.  We played it at a family reunion, and kept playing it over and over again, with different players, different player counts, and different characters. Every time it was great.  I'm not sure if it replaces Resistance, but I will definitely play it again. I might even buy it.

Pretty fun game. Make sure you get the app that provides cover noise and calls out the current actor and their actions. This makes it harder to figure out who is who by simply hearing them move and also keeps a standard time for each actions so you know how long you have to get back in position,

Unless using expansions it can quickly become a bit repetitive. However, it is VERY easy to learn, and to use as an introduction for people who are not that used to boardgames.

The best party game with my group to date. Strategy, bluffing, deduction, back stabbing... All in under 10 minutes per game. I've introduced so many different people to this and they've all loved it! Streamlines original werewolf and since this came into my collection I haven't even considered pulling out regular werewolf...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game works remarkably better than its predecessor Werewolf. There is room for bluffing and deduction. The time limit (when using the app--which I highly recommend), creates a lot of tension.

There is a flaw in the game, however. And it is almost a fatal flaw. I'm docking the game 3 points because of it. The flaw: you have to swap cards on the table while everyone else has their eyes closed. Even when one's eyes are closed, you can still sense movement from your neighbors. This gives away your opponent's role. And this makes the game ultimately flawed. 

I do not see any way around this flaw either. The card swapping is integral to the game. Detecting movement from around the table is inevitable.

With the right group, this game is amazing. If people aren't into it; it just falls flat. Sadly it really does require people to be a bit outlandish and just accuse people for no reason to be fun

This game always gives a great laugh. The characters are hilarious, I mean the tanner just wants to get killed cos he hates his job! and the drunk is a funny character as well. The art style really suits the game and the free app for the mediator is really well done. It's a bit harder to lie than the normal werewolves game so I feel like there's more strat to it, each game is short so you can easily play multiple games in one seating and slowly build up your strat. The best thing about it is, unlike the normal werewolves where people get killed from the first round and sometimes games goes for 10 rounds, no one is sitting there bored for half hour+ waiting for the next game so they can play again.

This game does a remarkably good job of distilling the Werewolf experience into just a single round. The drawback is that it is quite a steep learning curve. New players will almost assuredly lose to experienced players. Understanding each and every one of the possible roles is nearly a requirement for proficient bluffing, and nearly all roles require some degree of said bluffing. I think The Resistance is still my hidden role game of choice, but I found this to be quite enjoyable, and I would nearly always choose it over standard Werewolf.

Awesome implementation of the well-known werewolf game. 

The two mechanics here are deduction & bluffing, nothing more nothing less.

It's much quicker, there's no player elimination, got cool artwork, funny characters, scales perfectly with different player numbers.. (although with greater numbers the night/downtime increases).. great party game, a keeper.

The downloadable App facilitates playing greatly!

Handles player numbers rather well, from 3 all up to 10.. with 10 you should use the app though..

The thing i just recently realized is that once you understand the game & roles, not is it only about reading other players but also to fabricate valid arguments.. like: if this is true than this must be true, then he must lie, then i actually became a werewolf, so i have to present that player a valid argument why he should vote for that person to be killed.. incredibly good!

It takes a couple rounds to learn, but the rounds are paced well. Quick enough that you don't get bored, but long enough that you can get truly invested in each round. It's a game of lies and collective puzzle solving. And with every round you play, you gain a new understanding of strategies and possible outcomes. A game that can tear your group apart, while also bringing you together.

My god this is terrible, they took werewolf (which works and is good) and added these extra bits to it.

The Resistance is a good game but this is a gem. The game is time-boxed which gives you a great bang for your buck (other social games can drag). In addition, there are lots of abilities to keep things fresh, and each has their own little social strategies. You can play off of the meta the table too. Unfortunately it's not for everyone - especially if you hate being the last person at the table to finally understand how to play correctly

Best with 6-8 and good with 4-10

I won't be counting individual plays, but rather [i]entire sessions[/i]—it's so quick we never play it fewer than a bunch of times in a sitting!

Also:  The free app is pretty sweet—it runs through the whole script (based on the roles in play), makes atmospheric background noises to cover the inevitable shuffle of cards, and has a configurable countdown timer which then calls for the vote.

RATING: 6
Neutral - on occasion.

Play few 5[ games so far. Overall interesting, but there are few bad things that can happen in a game:

(1) Characters that are able to switch, or with a possible change from one side to another, will constantly create an almost random game.

(2) It's pretty common, at the very beginning of the day(i.e. the final identity is already set), one side has actually no hope, and the whole game is all about discovering that, quite frustrating. This core problem comes from the luck of drawing characters, and I wish the rules could recommend some good-enough combination of characters, rather than let players test by themselves.

I know it's extremely short, but these things happen too frequently to be annoying. Also, some characters' abilities are over-complex for a 5-minute game. But it's minor, players can play few times and get familiar with them.

This is my go to party game.  Never a dull moment, especially when there are enthusiastic or animated friends at the table.  Brings the fun of the Ultimate Werewolf series, but eliminates the player elimination that the other games have.

Even my 4-year-old son loves this game.  For that it will get a nice and high rating.  Some of the base roles are absurd (I have not, and will likely never play with the "Doppelganger"), and the information to go on is sparse, but there is *just* enough misdirection with the role swappers to make this a jolly fun time.

The advantages of One Night Ultimate Werewolf is progressing with moderator and elimination. And, the game is very fast paced than any other Werewolf game ever before. Because of these pros, the game has also some cons. Before playing game, players must be skilled in role playing various characters of the game. If not, the game easily confronts absurd situations. ONYW is a nice alternative of classic Werewolf games.

So, I've only played about 5 rounds of this one, and my instinct is it really opens up after a lot of plays because you need to get a feel for how and when you can/need to lie. All of our games everyone just said who they were and what they did (unless they were wolves) and almost always with just this information at least one wolf was obvious. I think I remember a few good attempts at lies, but none of them ever worked out. Interesting though, I look forward to getting more of a feel for it.

The little brother of Werewolves! Half as much fun as the regular version -- one night is just not enough for this game.  Maybe "Weekend" Ultimate Werewolf would have been better.  Good for a quick fix or small groups or as an introduction to the real version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We have had some really enjoyable nights playing Werewolf. If we have 6 to 10 people looking to play a game, this game can easily accommodate the group. It is fairly easy to teach although the strategy usually takes a few rounds. It is also great to get those shy guests out of their shell as they are force to lie and are accused of lying.

Unfortunately, it is no good with a smaller crowd so it does get played as much as I'd like.

I'm not big on social inference games but for this genre this is pretty good.  It is an improvement on the classic werewolf game where everyone is the villager except for the hidden werewolf folks are getting eaten one at a time until they figure out who is doing it.  Instead of player elimination and resulting boredom there is only one chance to figure out who is the werewolf.  To make this work, most of the players have special abilities (like secretly switching two role cards) which gives them more info and more grounds to bluff.  There are lots of different roles with different abilities which provides good replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy One Night Ultimate Werewolf more than most social deduction games as it has a good amount of variety and a strict, short time limit, but it is still one of those games where one can have very little information to make an accurate call.

Make some role cheat sheets and use the available app to run the game and this can be a solid choice as a large party game where people can drop in-and-out as desired.

RATING: 5
I don't like the special roles of Ultimate, so I suppose it's not entirely surprising that I would have a negative reaction to this.  In the first game, we played with 3 as recommended by the rules (well, that and we only had 3), and that ended up rather unsatisfying.  Presumably it will be better with more, so I'd like to try it will a full table, but I'm not optimistic.  Update: It is better with 6 or 7, but it still hasn't endeared itself to me.

RATING: 7
This fell a bit flat when we first tried it with four players using the recommended starter mix.  In our first half dozen plays we had two with no werewolves at all, and the solutions tended to be quick and easy.  The game got much more interesting, and rose to a 7.0, when we added the Minion for more likelihood of teamwork on the werewolf side.  It's probably better with more players and thus more roles.

We've been playing this non-stop recently and it seems to get better every time. An absolute blast guanranteed. I'm not sure I've ever played a game that delivers so much fun so consistently. Takes a few games to really get into it but once you're there this just keeps getting better and better.

Played this in KBK with 6-10 players. A HUGE success; people were basically standing in line waiting for a place at the table. I left after half a dozen games, but the others continued after that.

As always with this type of game, there's a lot metagame and "perfect strategy" thinking involved, and I am not sure ONUW really has as much playability as other, more involved traitor games. But for now, it's a LOT of fun.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2014)

As I love werewolf, it is no surprise I like this game. It has great components and the free app is a stroke of genius. I expected a different game (more control) and for that I’m a bit disappointed, still very fun when you get to play the robber or the troublemaker, they add a Mascarade feel to the game.

You no longer need a moderator to play Werewolf which is GREAT! This was the only thing I really hated (to be) in the previous version of the game.

This is still the same core game (which has tons of luck) but now the player elimination is not a problem, also it plays lightning fast (5 minutes or less). For some reason I prefer the longer version of the Ultimate Werewolf game, here I feel (most of the time) I have no control or idea who is the werewolf. In the longer game there are more opportunities to catch them. Still very similar games and I enjoy both of them.

It is a great werewolf game to play with fewer players than the original, for this reason I will keep both in my game collection. I must be the only one that prefer the long version of the game.

After more plays, I continue to like the game. Still I’m considering selling it as I’m not sure I need both werewolf games in my collection. Besides with the Ultimate Werewolf components I can play this version of the game too. I’m still undecided about this, perhaps I will keep both. I usually don’t take part in the philosophy that a game replaces another game, but in this case both games are very similar.

The short playtime is definitely a turn off for me, but most friend love this aspect of the game. I spend more time explaining the game than playing it.

Hidden Role/deduction and bluff mechanisms very clean and effective.  Requires group willing and able to shamelessly lie to each others' faces in the name of fun.  Lots of social interaction, so perfect for outgoing sociopaths!  Completely winning with right crowd, and will be replayed until dawn.  Consider the app a must - guides players seamlessly through night stages (maybe a little slowly, but...) so that last 5 minutes of tense investigation and recriminations can play out.  Post-game review often as hilarious as game itself.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability. In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!

RATING: 8
This is a pretty good hidden role game. It's almost like a mashup of Werewolf and Mascarade. It has a very chaotic element where you may or may not actually know who you are. I wouldn't mind that at all, but we had two games in a row where the troublemaker started off by telling everyone who they switched, which allowed one of me to then say, "Well, I was a werewolf, so now they must be." It blindsided the other player, who obviously had no defense. Of course, that shouldn't happen that often, but it still felt a little broken. It seems like the Troublemaker should have some kind of incentive to keep their mouths shut, at least for a little while. Still, it's a fast game, so it doesn't ruin it at all. Still a good time.

Update: After more plays, this game has really started to shine. The trick is getting to the point where players are ready for anything to happen (previous Werewolf experience can help with this). Once you get there, this game is a lot of fun. It has bluffing and deduction and a lot of the feel of regular Werewolf, but in a nice, fast playing package.

Another update: Bumping this up to an 8. This game is really just fantastic.

Having not played Werewolf in a very long time, I was assuming this would not go over so well.  However, what a great game.  To play 5 games in a row in about 45 minutes and to enjoy ourselves throughout, that's a hard game to find but, this is a real gem.  The thing that makes this great is the fact that elimination lasts all of 10 seconds as you laugh and discuss and set up for the next round.  Great game!

Woah, this is very different to standard Werewolf.  This is a true deduction game, with the tricky bit that you have to deduce who YOU are as well as everyone else!  Quite the brain-burner.

This is a fun filler that offers some laughs. There is some switching of cards that can happen so you may not even know what character you are until the end. It is only one round so there tends to be a deep discussion of who is what for the round. Kill the werewolf for the villagers to win, or a villager for the werewolves to win, or kill the Tanner and that person wins.

While my experience with traditional Werewolf is limited, this version of it is superb. Plays tremendously fast and provides the paranoid fun of it's big brother in a fraction of the time - meaning you'll probably play it multiple times every time.

This game is tough to turn down. It plays so quick and gives a lot of the same feel as The Resistance. The different roles can make it interesting, but also can result in anti-climactic villager wins. When a seer immediately pin points a were-wolf right from the gate it's sometimes difficult to do anything about it.

Still, well produced and executed and one I could see playing a lot at a game day to avoid having to break into separate groups right away.

RATING: 8
Ultimate Werewolf on a much smaller scale.  Gone are the eliminations so many people bemoaned from UW, which is a huge plus for anyone who docked UW points for that reason.  

I definitely love the player count capability, so you don't have to make an event-night out of playing it. It's quick and manages to encapsulate the fun of UW, but it seems to lack the depth that UW brings with it.  It's always difficult to get a good read on the situation unless you ultimately catch someone in a blatant lie, because there's so little time to really delve into everyone's story from one night to the next (like you would do in UW).

This is a great way to open a night of spooky gaming.

Prefer One Night Werewolf to all of the quick-to-learn-and-play deduction party games. I agree it's not perfect and requires at least one or two "leaders" in order to get the party started so to speak, but the moments where someone accidentally gives up their identity are priceless and some of the best in gaming. You don't get that from the Resistance (which I believe is a vastly inferior game without Avalon). 

Own all of the One Night series (Daybreak included). Get this one if you are wondering which to get as it's definitely the best unless your playgroup plays One Night a lot (in which case you will own both this and Daybreak anyway).

This game is very enjoyable, and definitely an improvement on One Night Werewolf. However, the games are not consistently satisfying, which is the main reason I'm not giving it a 9. That may be my fault, with the character mix I'm using, but I will continue playing, since some characters I haven't fully explored.

There is still room for regular Ultimate Werewolf, as this is a completely different experience, though I really like the play time for this version.

Update 3/15: After fifty plays, it is clear that this is a classic game. I rate it a 10 for the system as a whole, including the expansion. For this type of game, there's nothing better.

While I do enjoy the actual playing round of this game, I cannot stand the setup phase.  There really is no good way to hide player actions when everyone has their head down.   simply brushing against another player while taking an action gives away too much information.  We try to create noise during the setup phase which does create a limited improvement, but it is incredibly annoying.  I might like it better if the setup phase was completely done with a pass and play app.  But the actual playing round is a lot of fun.

I've played almost a dozen games at a few SF Bay Werewolf events - it was excellent. The game is fast (10 mins was the average game for my group), simple, and entertaining with a broad audience of players. It really seemed to improve on the "Werewolf"/"Mafia" formula, and I think that's saying a lot.

I honestly am baffled by the low ratings. One person said nobody had an "incentive to win" because of something to do with the circumstances of their playing, so they couldn't give a good review. Then why give a bad one? Makes no sense.

Anyway, this game is excellent and one of the FEW games I would take out with ANY group of friends - young or old, drunk or sober, nerdy or otherwise. I'm looking forward to public release.

This game is a lot of fun and plays really fast.  The app is a must and well done.  Plays well with many different player counts but probably 6-8 is best, but we've done with all kinds.  Everyone picks it up fast and each game is talked about afterwards about as long as the game itself.

Obviously this is not regular Werewolf: instead of a gradual stream of information and escalating tension, here you have a quick reveal and recursive mapping of the game state. The problem is that once this narrative of game events is established you may find yourself with a brand new incentive to change it, yet without any credible argument for doing so. This won't happen to every player in every game, but it may happen to some player in every game. Playing online was fun in a "wacky speed chatting" way more than in an... "actual gameplay" way. Probably better suited for tabletop play than play-by-forum, and likely preferable to Werewolf that way for many.

So fast that if someone really wanted to play it I would. This "game" feels like a light and airy pastry to me. It looks like a game but there is nothing there. The only good thing is it's over before you know it. It's commendable that the designer has really made a mint off of this and it really shows fellow BGG'ers that you can design something not great - as long as you get the art, theme, and price point right and people are happy to hand you money, again, and again, and again.

I like deduction/bluffing games very much and this isn't an exception.

So what's different between other deduction games?
First: player count. 
You can play with as few as 3 people! Of course the game will be different with more players, but you can get a game started while you wait the others.
Second: play time.
A game is over in 10 minutes, even with a high player count.
Third: There's the variable powers in game like his big brother Werewolf without the player elimination

Very nice filler

I don't want to call this a resistance killer but this may be a resistance killer.  Every game feels like it drops you right into round 5 of resistance, you have some information but usually not all, it all comes down to who can you trust.  Plays quick, the quality of the pieces is excellent the art is excellent and the free app moderates the game for you.  Game of the year 2014 contender for me, I know it's early but I predict this is going to at least stay in the top 3.

Plays fast. Has many different roles to create a different gaming experience every time. The app is basically essential to play this game, but it is free, so that is a plus. The thick cardboard cards are nice, but they scratch easily if your table is anything less than polished smooth, basically making sleeves mandatory so you don't know which card is which.

RATING: 6.5
I like it and have yet to turn it down, but I still feel like maybe I'm missing something from the gameplay.  Sometimes the mix of roles leads to nobody knowing anything.  I realize it's not supposed to be perfectly deductive, but when it's just everyone grasping at straws, it feels like glorified wheel spinning.  But when you're able to make a few inferences on the bits of info here and there that are provided, the twists and double crossing can be very entertaining.

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  5

[PNP] I think this one was my first party game and I have nostalgia for it. After this we played many more and different ones but this still has a place in my heart. Most of the people know werewolf or mafia and when you tell them they might have different roles or even teams after the night and there is only one night their eyes pop out. After the first game they get it and want to play it at least 5 more times because that's how fun this is. I just love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably our most played, a bit of strategy and lots of lying. Plays really fast with any player count. It says 3 minimum but for me I only pull it out with 5+ players. We love Resistance but we play this much much more because the shorter play time means more rounds can be played and hopefully everyone gets a chance to be on the werewolf or villager teams once or twice.

RATING: 9
A fun, fast party game of bluffing and deduction.  I should mention that I have never played any of the regular Werewolf games with a moderator and all that; something tells me that I would prefer this bite-sized version, though.  Games are 10 minutes long (or shorter) and lots of fun.  No player elimination, as well.  The (free) iPhone/Android app is almost necessary, though, so be sure to get that.  This one is a favorite filler/deduction game in my regular group and we often start and end the night with a little game like this, since games go so quickly and people can easily join or leave while we play a few games.

Social deduction game that's good for parties with the right group. Definitely not my favorite of this type of game as the number of roles can be a bit confusing. The night time (eyes closed) period can also last a bit too long with all of the different roles that it has to go through. Discussion can be a bit awkward since there's no immediate objective and players are hesitant on how much information to reveal. This part definitely takes some nudging. Overall a decent game but not as good as some others in the genre.

I played this game with some folks who have mastered it, so I had a hard time keeping up.

1 partida en Jesta 2015.

Una decepción total! Después de haber jugado al "Hombres lobo de Castronegro", obviamente vas a compararlos... y sale perdiendo. Termina la noche y no tienes ninguna pista de quien es el hombre lobo, la gente se queda parada y nadie dice nada (quizá con quien jugué no se enteraba de la película). En cualquier caso, me esperaba que fuera mejor que el Castronegro, porque puedes jugar con menos jugadores y cuesta el doble... y no fue así.

This game is so fun and replayable for being $15. What a great way to get riled up at your friends. It is so interesting if you play with sneaky people that you never truly know are lying or not. We have played this game for 3-5 hours straight before. It's addicting and challenging. I would love to get an expansion, even though there are already enough characters to switch things up. The more people the better - the game increases in difficulty and surprise that way.

It takes a while to get into it, because in the beginning it feels as if you have hardly any information. Probably needs more than four players to really shine.
Sounds made by actions during the night were too much of a give-away, so we tapped the table all through the night.
"One Night Revolution" might fix that because actions are taken in order around the table instead of by role.

Given that the game plays in 10 minutes, this is by far my most played game. Solves the issue of player elimination in Werewolf/Mafia and also adds the element that you have to deduce your own role. Very fun and decent variety, but the meta can stagnate after too many plays.

RATING: 8.2
The best thing about this game: You can experiment and do crazy stuff without risk, because even if you fail the next game starts within 5 minutes and so it doesn't really matter. In real werewolf or other games if you make a mistake you lost like 20min, 30min or even more of playing time, so you can't risk a failure and you have to play safe. This one you can play really stupid and really risky turns and it doesn't matter.

Artwork and components and everything is excellent.

Some games are really lots of fun. A few games sometimes are not that much fun.

Well, I still love it a lot :-) :-) :-)

This game can be extremely fun in the right situation. Ive had nights where my group played this into the wee hours of the night, but I've also had times where the game fell very flat. If your group is more social and willing to get very involved in the game, then it is great. But if youre playing with a less social group, then it could be boring for everyone in the group.

This is so much fun, sometimes you can identify the liars and deduce what happens, but sometimes lie upon lie is built and maintained and the unveiling is especially hilarious. 5' is plenty for the discussion, so each game takes less than 10'.

No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability. In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!

Really wanted to like this game, but it lacked structure. Will have to try with more people (5+) and see if the game improves.

A game about deception and deduction. Each player plays a character in a village that inhabits some werewolves.

This is a fun game in the right group of people, but I don't find that right group very often. There are other party games I enjoy more, as this one is mostly just an excuse to socialise and chat, and doesn't really have the same narrative depth or gaming elements as the best ones.

I've taken to calling this a gamer's game, as I really think it only works well with those familiar with the genre.

This game is only fun with noobs with short attention spans. Because a game is so short, it is not rage inducing when a noob asks a question like "so what does the troublemaker card mean? Do I help the werewolf?" In games like BSG or dead of winter, that would be the worst.

It is cheap, cute, and probably worth it to help introduce players to games like Avalon, the resistance, and eventually BSG. I think that I am just tired of the werewolf theme.

Absolutely fantastic party game that is endlessly replayable. Cannot recommend more. Anyone can learn it. The iOS/Android apps are highly recommended, if not necessary, as it saves someone from having to be the announcer and therefore adds another player. Doesn't get dragged down with the max players, like most games. Can be played as a filler, can be played as a main game, can be played as a starter, can be played as a finisher, can be played once, can be played 20 times, can be played with 3 players (though I prefer an absolute minimum of 4), can be played with 10 players, can be played with newbies, can be played with experts. Just a splendid board game.

I'm curious if I can justify owning both this and Avalon.  They largely scratch the same itch, but this will be much easier to bring to the table, to teach, and then play through a few iterations.  I still like Avalon quite a bit, and it'd be a shame to see it languish, but this is a very very good game.  I love opening my eyes and not knowing for sure who even I am.  I'm not good at being a werewolf, I think the best strategy is to be aggressive, claim a role and accuse anyone who sees through your lie of being a werewolf.

Like the social deduction game Werewolf, a village must find and lynch the werewolves that haunt their town, but the game takes place all in one night! To add complexity, various roles can cause strange happenings meaning people's identities and allegiances may switch without them knowing it. Are you still a werewolf? Is the player across from you lying about being a troublemaker and switching your partner's role. You have 5 minutes to decide in this fast game of lies.

If I actually was a fan of social deduction games, this would rate a lot higher, as this is very excellently designed. Distills the best of the genre into 10 minutes without need of player elimination or loss of werewolf's characteristic plethora of special powers. How these powers interact depending on what roles are left out and who has what is also quite interesting, and that you can change up which roles you play with and different roles are added/left out with different number of players mean that even if you play with the same people over and over, each game won't feel the same, something that can't be said about Resistance (and to a lesser extent Coup).

RATING: 4
Probably the most surprising plummet in the ratings for me, I initially had it up much higher and then kept moving it down as other things overtook it. I think it's time to accept that I'm not as much of a fan as I used to be of one night. In fact, I even cancelled my Aliens Kickstarter pledge because I don't want another One Night expansion sitting on my shelves unplayed.

It's not that this isn't a solid game. It's that there is ALWAYS a game I would rather play. Shadow Hunters has effectively punted it out when I want a quick social deduction game because of everything it has going on, and I'll never want to play One Night over Werewolf.

This is a lot of fun and a great short party filler. The meta game is what makes this fun and people learning what everyone else does. Best played in multiple rounds and a 5 minute timer helps keep things moving also! A great mix of deduction, bluffing and generally trying to out think each other. Bought March 2015.

Because it's so short, this remains one of the best hidden role games of all, second only to Secret Hitler. 

The time frame, and open interaction (rather than turn based as in  Hitler) make it so different that it's always a welcome alternative. 

It's the only other game like this other than SH that we need.

My favorite party game for mid-sized (6ish) groups. Larger? Telestrations. Smaller? Um. Er. I don't know that "3-player party game" is a niche that [i]needs[/i] to be filled, but it's one that I haven't filled. Daybreak is OK (but more complicated), Vampire looks more complicated still. I think this one is the sweet spot.

The secret to this game (says the guy who's not at all sure he's really learned the secret to this game) is to be the first player to credibly claim a knowledge role that happens to be in the unused pool. Sometimes that's guesswork, and sometimes it's knowledge, but being able to lie without anyone being able to contradict you is how you out your opponents.

Notes:
high degree of open player interaction, bluffing, lying, deduction
not for the shy, or those that can't lie or strategize lying very well
for a party game, does require central table and room to move for eyes-closed portions and hiding movement/noises from neighbors

This game is a fun little diversion that doesn't really hit the right spot for me and my usual group of friends.  The quick play time is fun for a bit, but teaching so many roles to a group gets tiresome, there's a real difficulty in getting the werewolfs to win, the night phase is long and awkward, and some type of accomplishment is missing from the whole ordeal.

After more attempts, I just can't get the game firing on all cylinders. Could be the group. Could be the opaque initial strategy. Could be my pre-existing experience with Resistance.

Maybe 1 more try before I give up on this. Not sure I care that much though.

Decent game. Almost entirely worse than The Resistance, Avalon, or Secret Hitler. I will use this game in smaller groups but I still want a group deception game feeling. It's also a good way to get people introduced to deception games before they move up to the more complicated ones. This game is just a bit too random and silly to take too seriously.

Another Mafia variation. Good abilities and some interesing ideas, but your experience with greatly vary depending on the group.

Standard Werewolf is a game that I've never gotten into, but saw this one on sale and decided to give it a go.  Really great decision on my part.  The "one night" format lends itself to quick gameplay and as a result, you're starting fresh in just a matter of minutes.  Compared to other werewolf games I've seen, this also lends itself to an element of deduction that I haven't seen in other versions of Werewolf that I've seen.  I kid you not, we played this twenty times straight with a small break in the middle...that's how great this was.   One bit of advice, play with the Minion card.  It helps complicate things in a  good way when you have the Troublemaker in play.  Highly recommend using the app to guide you through the instructions!

I enjoy this game the most when it's played as a filler game in between other, more complicated or time-consuming games. I would highly recommend using the companion app to do the narration.

RATING: 6
One of the better short-form social deduction games if you are looking for games strictly on social information instead of deduction information (e.g. the pass/fail cards in the Resistance)

Personally, I dislike the original werewolf because of its long play length and player elimination.  ONUW fixes this problem by boiling the game down to 10 minutes with no player elimination.

Because of this, just having social information is acceptable.  If you get the Daybreak expansion, you have a game with an insane amount of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Honestly this game is really clever, but it just isn't at all for me. If there's two things I'm terrible at, it's keeping track of things in my head, and convincingly lying (or convincingly telling the truth for that matter!). This game has both in spades, and so it's just not made for me.

That being said, in a large group (7-12) there really isn't a better game that I can think of playing. Plus it plays really quick so I'll usually play a couple rounds if everyone else is into it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This feels like it needs another play or two to click -- I can see a better-than-a-7 game here -- but unfortunately at least a couple of folks in my group didn't enjoy it at all. It's as fast as advertised, and the app makes things so easy (and I love not having to have a narrator, or forgetting things). The one-night twist delivers as advertised.

It feels like the first night/day of regular Werewolf in some ways, though -- the day in which no one's quite sure how to kick things off. It's so quick that you can safely throw caution to the wind and just get it over with, and then play again, but there's something a bit unsatisfying about that at the same time. I liked it, and I'll happily play it again if the opportunity arises.

---

My group couldn't stand this and I don't know who else I'd play it with, and I like it less than vanilla Werewolf or other fast-playing games, but my wife wants to keep it. Re-rated from a 7 to a 6.

RATING: 9.5
Awesome game! One Night Ultimate Werewolf has so many things going for it: great art, great components (thick tiles rather than cards are really nice), play in less than 10 minutes, and most importantly, it's A LOT of fun. It's loud, fast and furious. Our group played 16 games in one sitting! Those 16 games took a little over 3 hours. I tried comparing this game to Resistance: Avalon, which is difficult, because despite their similarities in style, they play out very differently. All things considered, I like them equally. 

Update 2/16/14:

This game is the f*cking business! I have played 34 times in 2 sittings. If ratings were based on how addictive a game is, this would be tops! I literally can't say one bad thing about it. At this point, I'd have to give the nod to this over Avalon.

Update 4/21/14: 

Played this at Easter with family. I still had a lot of fun, and it was still a hit for the most part, but it wasn't near as much fun with a diverse group (broad range in age and gaming experience). Despite being an excellent "party game," it is still, at its heart, a strategy game. IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR GROUP WHO EITHER DON'T LIKE TO PLAY THE WEREWOLF OR DON'T PLAY IT WELL, THIS GAME BECOMES QUITE UNBALANCED. I'm not going to take that away from the game though. I will say that I'm lowering my rating ever so slightly because the tiles scar easily.

The App is a must have for this game, it allows the voice of Eric Summorer to be the moderator for you. This is a pretty fun party game about accusing others. you have to keep your eyes closed and your mouth shut for most of the round, which is what allows for the accusations and mystery of the game, but it does limit interaction and casual conversation between players. And in a party game, that's a big part, so it leaves a little something to be desired in my opinion.

Best game of 2014.
This game is GREAT. So. Much. Fun. It's way easier to teach than any other social deduction game. Good gateway to genre. Just pick very basic roles for first game (rulebook has a suggestion), do one round (maybe with shorter timer, 3min is good) and everyone will be all set. Games take 6 minutes but offer just as much fun as longer deduction games. It's also more light-hearted than something like Resistance. I'm by no means dissing Resistance, it's one of my favorite games too, but I'm fan of the slight chaos this one offers. No moderator (if you don't happen to own Android device or iPad or whatever you'll need one player to speak the commands, but he can still play - if you do own one, then I must mention that the app is very well-made and had way more customization than I expected), no player elimination, great components, good replayability. And did I mention it's always FUN. 

Update: Amazing achievement. Perfect game. This one has quickly become one of my favorite games of ALL TIME. It's the game I'll suggest every single time I have opportunity to play with 4 or more other players.

Same ultimate werewolf in less time but not as fun, replayable and way too chaotic for me to like.

Really excellent hidden role party game.  Plays very quickly (games over in 10 minutes or so), fun for 4 to 13 players (rules say up to 10, but there are enough tiles for 13 to play and it works great with 13), and just enough chaos from the special roles but not so much that it makes the game impossible.  Free mobile app to narrate the game is a huge plus.

As the newness has worn off and I've played more social deduction games, the chaos of ONUW is less appealing although still lots of fun with the right crowd.  Still enjoy the game but not one I actively push to play much anymore.

Resistance, coup, and cash and guns all mixed together and plays in 10 minutes. I really hope we start seeing more timed games because this is so much better than just letting a game drag on indefinitely!

I wish there were a few more ways to balance the game (it's broken if the seer, troublemaker, and robber are all in the middle) or force peoples hands... but overall its a great experience.

Update - after the expansion came out my group completely lost interest in the game? Lowering my rating because it never gets played anymore.

The free app is most definitely an essential add-on in order to have maximum fun, as you don't have to have one person sit out and narrate the night phase. From my experience, don't play with the basic villagers unless you have the maximum amount of people playing, it's just less interesting.

I placed second in the first annual world championship tournament at Gen Con.  It was a fun experience, but I'm not sure I'm really interested in the game anymore.  It is a fun party game, but I don't think it's better than any other social deduction game.

I dont really fancy werewolves/mafia due to people being killed off and then having to wait around. This game solves that issue and is a blast to play! I like that there are potentially a lot of different roles and you try to figure out what’s going on in the chaos. Must have!

Social deduction games are not really my thing, but I've come to appreciate them a bit more and this one can be quite enjoyable.  I like that each game is quick, which allows new players to learn the game and improve quickly, and also allows trying different roles easily.  The app for this is fantastic and overall it's just a fun experience.

Play is kinda flat, I've seen people play it better, but with my group (and a lot of people who haven't played it before), it was fairly obvious.

I think as we get more plays we'll get better, and the wolves will be better at disguising themselves.

I still much prefer Secret Hitler.

RATING: 6
I've played Mafia / Werewolf plenty while growing up, and while this game lacks the narrative, the fun storytelling and the gradual build-up of suspicion and drama that happens when you are playing a 10+ person game of regular Werewolf, it condenses it and strengthens the deduction element. When you play you weave these long trains of thoughts, explicit facts, uncontested and contested statements, bald faced lies and then you try to untangle what they imply. Or you are a stinky liar yourself, and try to ride the wave of building suspicion so you can gently steer it to anyone but you (or your team, or maybe you want it to land squarely on you you filthy Tanner!).

Sure, you all look a bunch of dummies when everyone is tapping their hand on the table to cover the noise, as the app drones on about which role does what, but do you care? No. The game is fun, can be played by anyone who doesn't mind lying (of which there are some, strange people), and the variety of roles and setups you can roll with mean you can try out strange things causing wildly different outcomes and discussions.

A great game!

Good, quick, stupid fun! Makes Werewolf playable by eliminating the  biggest issues: player elimination and uber long game time. It loses some of the fun by making it short and just one night, and really it becomes its own game.

Gets many things right that are problematic with normal werewolf, mafia, vampire etc.

The free app replace the moderator, there is only one round, so no-one is eliminated while the game runs, and discussion can easily be limited to say 5 minutes.

Downside for me is that the switching of roles is highly unthematic. How exactly did she turn the insomniac into a werewolf? Also, some people seem prone to lie about everything, claiming that this gives them insights, which makes the discussion a mess. 

Still, if I have to play werewolf etc. then it would be this or its one-night cousins.

Few games have earned so many plays in so little time as this one, mostly because it's very available and very short, and almost demands multiple plays each time it hits the table. It's chaotic and silly but it works for me. Most notedly, it works where Resistance fails, as I feel they are going after the same goal. It can be a little difficult to jumpstart, but once someone gets talking, you are able to garner more real data than in either Resistance or Werewolf, so it isn't quite so replete with blind accusations. Skill comes into play with clever lies, which must be different depending on your actual role, your perceived role, and your projected role. Those lies can direct, misdirect, or fish for information. This is the only traitor game I've liked so far, and I love how fast it plays!

ONUW hits the table with friends aged 25+ and at work with kids aged 9+. The kids love this game! The whole app integration really seems to draw their attention, the deduction and playing the roles feeds their imagination and it's simple and short enough to hold their attention, even during several consecutive plays. I think that the base game is really worth the money, and I'll probably invest in Daybreak as well.

(220515): ONUW has really proven itself. I've played it almost daily for two weeks now, and it still holds my interest. I really like the bluffs that my gaming regulars are pulling. Having a Tanner in play is extremely fun. ONUW is also really, really easy to teach to people, having just taught it to 8 strangers who also were non-gamers in less than 10 minutes.

This game hits my table more than just about anything.  The entire family loves it.  It plays fast, under 7 minutes but the fun factor is fantastic.

It is very much like regular werewolf but a bit more casual since it is over so soon.  If they vote you out it is no big deal since you can play it again right away.  No elimination.

Just had a game where we voted out my daughter who thought she was a villager and she angrily turned over her card to discover she was the tanner and had just won the game.  Absolutely hilarious.  Moments like that make this game priceless.

The app makes it so much more wonderful.  So good to have the app narrate for you so you don't forget anything and so that everyone gets the same amount of time to do their nightly activities.

A great party deduction game... I like this one almost better than The Resistance, as it brings in more variation with the different roles. Switching up the characters keeps it fresh, and using the app through a bluetooth speaker at the table makes narration easy and pleasant. I'm generally not a big fan of deduction games, especially if the "guessing" portion is so open, but somehow, ONUW works.

"One Night Ultimate Werewolf" greift das bekannte Spielprinzip der Werwölfe, die enttarnt werden müssen auf. Allerdings mit zwei gravierdenden Verbesserungen:
1. Das Spiel wird von einer App geleitet, daher muss Niemand mehr den Spielleiter verkörpern. Die App funktioneirt toll und ist sehr atmosphärisch.
2. Es gibt nur eine einzige Runde, also nur eine Nacht. Dadurch spielen sich die Runden extrem flott und es ist trotzdem spannend. 
Durch die App macht das Spiel so schon ab 4 Spielern richtig laune. Toll!

There is a lot of game in this small package.  We've played several sessions with only the basic cards and the true nature of the gameplay is really presenting itself.  

This is brilliant.  I wouldn't want to make an entire evening out of it, but we've played with various numbers of participants from 3 to 7 and the game has worked very well. 

I think the sweet spot for me so far is 5+, but it's even been decent with 3 and 4.

One other note...the IOS app is mandatory.  It takes all the overhead of being the moderator out of the picture.  Everyone gets to participate in the fun.  Beautiful implementation.

-Disruptable and sometimes long night phase
-Getting the goal of the game across to new players quickly might lay in the hands of luck

Excellent game! It checks all my boxes: funny, bluffing, outplaying... It's so easy to explain, very flexible playtime, and adjustable roles to fit any kind of player. It has one of the best moments in gaming ever: when you realise in the middle of a discussion you're actually working for the other team...

I find only two (very small) negatives:
1) the night phase can be a bit too long and susceptible to interruption. 
2) the first game with new people can be a bit underwhelming since you can't guarantee every role is in the current game (like the important werewolves or role-switchers). You just have to tell them to trust you that this was indeed a bad role-distribution but by that time they may not want to try again anymore (hasn't happened to me yet though since it's only 5 minutes, but I can see it happen).

Self-evidently, you also need to be pretty good at lying. If the Troublemaker tells you you've been switched with another person and that other person says he was a Werewolf, if you just give up then and there it will be unexciting. You can say for example you were the Seer and know the self-declared Troublemaker isn't really a Troublemaker, and if you already revealed yourself earlier as someone else, you can say you just said that to bust other people.

Eric Summerer's fantastic voice acting in the ap does not save a 'game' that boils down to a guess after ten minutes of discussion.  Not a single interesting decision to be had in this one.  Bad.  Definitely style over substance.

I like Avalon and One Night Ultimate Werewolf strikes similar chords. The idea is simple and brilliant: start with a role, do some secret shuffling and then try to deduce your new role - all in 10 minutes' gameplay. It may not have the depth of Avalon but the short playing time and the possibility to play with few players compensate more than well for this. The free app to support gameplay is also appreciated.

This is Werewolf played in one round. Some of the original roles from the game are there, but other roles are added. You negotiate for 10 minutes, then lynch another player, and depending on the role of the villager lynched, villagers or werewolves win. 

I like this better than the original Werewolf, since it is much cleaner, since the original game could be protracted with players eliminated having to sit and wait. I wasn't a huge fan of the original Werewolf; this game makes it quick and fun, over in one round.  Good to play at the end of a game session.

My favorite micro-game, bumping For Sale off. This has as few cards as games like Love Letter and Coup, yet it has the espionage and intrigue of Resistance, and it has different characters and unexpectedly high variability.

I love the bluffing that happens in this game and its tremendous fun even losing when you discover you're not actually the role you expected.
Hopefully the app stays good though.
The closest comparison would be a single, intense mission round of Resistance, but ONUWW's faster playtime is a huge plus. 

One small issue I have is that players have to crowd around a table a bit (helps if you stand), which gets difficult especially at higher player counts. Also, a small physical issue I have is that keeping my eyes closed so long sometimes annoys me (but this is just a minute physical tick).
Another thing is that the cards could've had the effects written on them alongside the roles and also higher quality tiles without wear.
I don't usually like chaotic games, but since this one's so short, I don't mind. Its the best werewolf game I've ever played too (so far).

Overall great party/light deduction game thats similar to a mini-Resistance of sorts. BTW, I recommend getting the announcer app too!

Plays: Many (estimated 10-20?)

It can be interesting as players attempt to influence one another, but sometimes you may not even know your own role card, dependant on what happened in game.  Not fun. Not satisfying.

I was puzzled when I first learned about this because I'd been playing this for free, for years, under the title Mafia. Why would you pay for a free game? I wouldn't pay someone to make up rock paper scissor cards.

Good bluffing/deduction party game.
Can be extremely chaotic and lots of shouting and accusing other players to be werewolves.

It's great to hear peoples reasoning who's the werewolf and who's not.

Not my cup of tea but I can enjoy playing it from time to time.

I hate Werewolf. It's just a terrible reskin of Mafia, and because the people I've played with get bored, they often kill randomly and quickly so the games will go fast and they won't be out too long if they're eliminated.

One Night Werewolf solves all of these problems. The game is fast, no one is excluded, the roles are interesting, and they lead to fun logical messes. I've only played this game at one gaming night so far, but we played about ten games in just an hour, and it was a good hour of fun.

This is a fantastic ice-breaker because it's easy to learn, and very quick; games last 10 minutes or less. We started off with basic characters, e.g., "villager", "Werewolf", "Seer" and "Troublemaker". As we picked up the basic mechanic, we began to add in more complex characters like "Doppelganger". If you can download the free app that goes with it, no one has to play "keeper". Cards are thick stock, and the game works great when played on a cloth to deaden sound.

Solo due partite all'attivo ma non mi ha convinto per nulla, l'idea sembra simpatica e la voglia di riprovarlo c'è.

Perfetto party game di confusione, da riprovare, magari aumentando il numero di giocatori, per un giudizio più definitivo.

Played a couple of 3 player games with wife and 6 year old today. While it felt kinda anti climactic with just 3 players, it was still fun trying to second guess each other. I really think the BGG community is right when saying it plays better from 4-10. Certain roles like the troublemaker can be really random but luckily the game comes with so many other roles to swap in.

This game has been a hit with every single group I've played it with. It's easy to understand, the app makes it simple to play, and the game itself is so goddamn fun that you don't even really care about who wins. For me, the "point" of winning (or at least the reason you play the game) is usually a big factor. It's why I don't like games like Apples to Apples, for example. ONUW is so much fun that it doesn't even matter. A terrific game that works with any kind of player.

RATING: 3
6 plays - A well designed game, but just not my cup of tea. This is really not a game for beginners, as opposed to many other secret identity games. All the different 'roles' almost always confuse people. This is particularly noticeable when you try to lie about your role. Usually a beginner's lies will not make sense, as they confuse the roles, and say things that aren't actually possible, sending immediately obvious signals to others. Further, the amount of chaos that is caused by the different roles is (in my opinion) ridiculous. My idea of fun, is trying to figure out people's identities while hiding my own. If people aren't even aware of their own roles though (because they've been switched by another player for e.g.), then figuring out roles is just annoying, and a chaotic mess. I'm sure with some groups who understand the game well, they can work together to figure out who is who, but with all the groups I've played with, at least half the people are just lost and have no idea. I much prefer games like the resistance, where lying isn't so complicated, and people can have fun without all the role confusions. I'd rather not try to piece together a jigsaw puzzle, and simply try to bluff and call other people's bluffs. I just want to play a game about lying, manipulation and deceit, I don't want to enroll in a logic course.

A nice fifteen minute version of the original. It is one round and the android app really helps as you do not need anyone guiding the game. You spend one night where characters can move cards around and then 10 minutes trying to kill off a werewolf if you are human or trying to kill off a human if you are a werewolf. There is not that many options so the discussions are limited, but if you want a quick versatile game, it is worth a look.

I'm not a Werewolf fan and don't like social deduction games in general, so obviously this one wasn't a big hit with me.  Trying to silently re-arrange cards while everyone else has their eyes closed is a little difficult, especially at higher player counts where cards are potentially further away.  It was a little tough to keep all the roles straight too, despite a good player aid.  The app seemed to work okay, but it was a little boring waiting for everyone else to make your move while you had to keep your eyes closed.

RATING: 6
The game was more interesting with expanded roles and powers.  Pretty good to spice up regular Werewolf if you've played a lot.  One night is good that it doesn't get dragged out and eliminated people sit out.

I felt that it seemed a little ambitious with the roles and powers, so if playing in a party setting like Werewolf, it won't do as well.  While I liked the shortness of one night and not dragging out, however the game felt like it went by too quickly and didn't build on the paranoia or backstabbing of the original game.

Better than normal Werewolf. It needs a player aid for new people so that they're not relying on the app to tell then what to do, which sucks if you're new and the doppledanger. It also sucks if you're new and a werewolf, as.you don't know what else to say other than villager.

A game that might get better with more experienced players rather than a bunch of newbies.

RATING: 6
I like Werewolf, and I like microgames, but I’m not sure I see the need for this. When Werewolf works well it is often because of the incremental knowledge gain and elimination of suspects over several nights. This game lacks all of that. It does play with fewer players, but I think I’d rather just play the Resistance, or perhaps Coup.

RATING: 10
Absolutely phenomenal social deduction game, the best of the best. Most social deduction games fall flat for our group, because people feel bad about betraying their friends, because there's nothing to deduce at the start, and because you have to play them a few times to get good them. One Night Ultimate Werewolf solves all of these problems because it's short enough to play consecutively, there's no player elimination, you get ALL the information right away, and everybody's equally invested until the last 5 seconds!!

(50+ plays) I had a great first experience playing this game with a group of strangers.  It's an extremely fast, highly interactive social deduction game - and a total blast to play.  If you know Mafia or Werewolf, this game will be easy to learn.  It has the advantage of a fixed game length of around 10 minutes, no moderator, and no player elimination.  I believe they may have designed the perfect formula for this style of game.  Now, after playing a bunch of games with a wide variety of different people - family, friends, colleagues, strangers... this is my favorite new game.

A greatly condensed game of Werewolf in which the whole game plays in one night.  Quick and clever, there are some devious twists that make this a different experience than Werewolf (for instance, you can begin the game a villager and become a werewolf.  And not even know it!).  This will appeal to families and groups that don't like all the arguing/intrigue of Werewolf, but for my money nothing beats a knock-down-drag-out full game of Werewolf.

I'd call this better than the basic werewolf, since all players get to play, and there's no player elimination. Having a meaningful/varied game of werewolf with only 4-5 players also pushes this over the top, as you can scratch that WW itch without needing 10 people to play. Very, very good game. Would heavily recommend that you download the app as well, since it runs all the night actions for you.

Fast and fun game that benefits from a jovial environment.
Downloading the app is a must to gain the full experience.

A very clever deductive game that always results in lots of laughs, particularly when someone is caught lying their ass off.

Takes a second to learn and is highly replayable.

I already knew I didn't like social deduction games and One Night Ultimate Werewolf was no exception. Partly it's just because I'm terrible at constructing a plausible lie on the fly, but this just seemed to come down to a five-minute argument. Not my thing. The app is very well done though.

This is a great social deduction game. It has just enough meat to the mechanics to give people some starting points to figure out who the werewolves are and who the villagers are, but it leaves enough room for doubt that you can still be sneaky. It feels like the perfect middle ground between logical deduction and just looking people in the face and trying to figure out if they're lying to you. This is easily my favorite game in this genre to date.

Great to bring to office bbqs (or other forced events) to make time fly and have fun for a change. Of course it's for parties (given) too! Highly/must have the free app to be the narrator for tasks of each character. Kids 7+ to adults will have a blast.

Take Werewolf, remove everything that's bad about it, and you get this.  People that don't like Werewolf or had a bad experience with it in the past should not be discouraged by the "Werewolf" in this game's title.  Think about what you may not like about Werewolf. Player elimination? Too much blind arguing? Moderator required? Takes too long? None of that is here.

I really enjoy this game. When we play Ultimate Werewolf, I'm typically the moderator. Which I really enjoy, but it's nice to be able to play as well. This game allows me to do that. 

I've heard comments from my gaming group about this game...some really enjoy it, others miss the "character building" that I encourage when playing Ultimate. In my opinion the big "pro" for this one is that there isn't player elimination. If you die in the first night of Ultimate, you're sitting around for a while. 

This changes all of that.

ONUW is a wonderful game of lying and deduction that quite literally takes only 15 minutes to play.

However those 15 minutes will be some of the most interesting, confusing, and hilarious few minutes you'll have for a long time.
Imagine all of the deduction, teamwork, lying, and frenzy of Werewolf/Mafia, without any of the tension, hostility, or player elimination that usually drives people away.

ONUW is amazing.  Absolutely perfect for parties, and introducing non-gamers into our world.

The game seems fun for a few minutes but after a while, it is a bit stale. There are usually a few players in the game who must absolutely lie about who they are (their character) and the rest of the players simply tell the truth and try to make sure that anyone else telling the truth believes them. Yes, it's fun when someone gets away with their lie and everyone went for it. But when you end up as a villager for three or four games in a row, there's just nothing to do but wait and see if someone thinks you are lying - then you must argue that you are being truthful with little to nothing to back up your claim. It's sort of like arguing with people about politics and religion sometimes.

But for the first few plays at a party with new people, it's worth playing.

The best of the social deduction games.  So much fun packed in 10 minutes.  Sometimes a setup will result in a dud game (too easy to deduce a werewolf too quickly), but the games go so quick it doesn't matter, just play again.  

The last game we played, my buddy and I were werewolves and together we pulled off such a convincing deception, we couldn't resist a high-five after the reveal.  We had no collusion before the game or anything, but we were so in synch with the deception it felt as if we planned it ahead of time even though it was completely off the cuff and improvised. Our lies supported each other and had almost everyone else convinced the werewolf was the guy sitting to my buddy's right.  The guy we accused wasn't even sure himself because I claimed to be the troublemaker and swapped their cards. It felt borderline telepathic.  Great stuff!

One of the most satisfying gaming experiences in such a small box.

Quick, Zany, Fun.

I prefer Avalon since it's a little more rewarding to fight for your team.  This one is so chaotic that it's difficult to be very invested in the outcome.

Although, I've only played 8 games (all in one session).  So I think once I understand the game/roles better, the engagement will be increased as well.

Update:  almost too short to be engaging.  It's more a puzzle than a social interaction game.

It took a few plays, but I eventually turned around on this game. I am more of a Werewolf purist for longer games. I don't like a ton of special roles. But for this, the chaos helps the game immensely. The short play time is a huge boost too.

I like this game, but every time I try to introduce it to a new group, it seems to fall flat. Seems to be a game that gets better the more you play and "get" it, but it's frustrating trying to get people past that hump...

However, finally got to play this game with a group of people who "got it" (mostly, seasoned Werewolf players), and it turned out to be one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had. It really requires players engaging with the premise and consciously playing it how it "should be played" - which is a complicated barrier. Once it "clicks" that villagers get a *huge* benefit from bluffing and double-bluffing, the game really shines. I wish it didn't have such a huge hump for new players to cross.

It's the best "werewolf" game that I've ever played. The concept to reduce all the action in a unique night makes it quick and fluid. And the use of the phone app to follow the tempos it's a great idea. A good game to play after a dinner with non usual players, they'll enjoy it!

RATING: 10
One Night is without a doubt one of my favorite games. The group I play with is a big fan of games like The Resistance, which I personally think has grown a bit repetitive after so many plays. I picked this up looking for a fresh take on the hidden roles game, and I've always been a fan of mafia games like Werewolves.

Our first play was hilariously one-sided, as we were all so used to hidden roles games no one wanted to share anything, but we quickly fell into the game's groove, playing dozens of 5-10 minutes rounds until well past 4 in the morning.

The plays we've seen have been amazing. Playing werewolves feels like skipping ahead to that tense final round of The Resistance when everything is revealed. We've seen the troublemaker claim to switch player's roles, at which point a werewolf immediately tries to finger the new wolf, thinking they're now on the town team, only for the troublemaker to reveal they lied about who they switched seconds later. We've caught players in carefully calculated lies and lynched them only to hang the tanner. I've had games where I thought I was a werewolf, trying my hardest to throw a townsperson under the bus, and succeed, only to discover I was no longer the wolf afterwards and had just handed the game to my buddy, who I thought I had managed to convince I was right. The list of crazy plays goes on. One of the best things is watching one player jump up declaring victory, only to flip their card and see they actually lost.

This game has far more staying power than Resistance in my book. The variety of roles and the ability to switch them out keeps things fresh. My group has easily played over a hundred rounds by now (which is rather easy, seeing as a session takes only a few minutes, especially if narrated by the convenient iOS/android app), and have started mixing things up. In our most recent game, we were playing with 4 players. We had no seer, just to see how it would work, instead using all the town roles that gave information; the masons, robber, troublemaker, insomniac, etc.

We've played 4 players games with only one werewolf and a minion, which work out great. It's always hilarious when there's a minion in play and the werewolves are in the middle, as the only way the minion can win is if someone, anyone in town dies, even themselves. We've even had a game where the minion and wolves outnumbered the village 3-2, and the wolves (and minion) won by all voting the minion.

Bottom line, this is one of the best games you can pull out for 3-12 (really, the sweet spot is around 5-8, but 3-12 is still a great game). It's a fantastic, fast game to play while waiting for another member of your group, but you may end up continuing to play well after they arrive. It's a surprisingly easy game to spend an entire evening on. I really cannot recommend this game enough to just about any kind of group, especially as it's price.

Protip: once you're used to it, try playing without the tokens. Things get really crazy when players can't look at the token bank to see what's left to claim.

I know that I'm very late to the "werewolf" party. I finally got to play. It was with 2 other first time players. It didn't take many rounds for us to start getting the hang of it.

It's a fun enough game, but definitely requires a group of people who are willing to talk and debate with each other. 
Has a bit of a problem that no-one wants to be the first person to talk, as it gives away so much information. It's easy to fall into a pattern when you have a "table-captain" type of player at the table.
Overall, it's not bad and a decent choice when there's a larger group of players - especially when they are casuals.

A great party game, the players are all members of a village, the sides are villagers vs werewolfs, and at the end of the night a debate sparks to which player should be hung, If a villager is hung the werewolfs win, and vice versa.

I utterly despise this game and its clonal progeny. Not that I would want to play it ever, but I have seen it played more than enough to make my opinion.

It is a game that phagocyte an entire group of players and a room, overpowering like the smell of a toilet cleaner.

It destroys all possibilities to play any other game in the same room so disruptive it is and can even hijack players engaged in other games

Don't ever ask me to play that, unless your want to see a werewolf in action...

In truth I am a little disappointed that this lost its luster so quick for me. The app was a nice novelty.

I can't figure out for sure whether I like this game, but so far I've enjoyed playing it.  There are definitely less bad feelings from lying or being lied to in this compared to a game like The Resistance.

If all of the town-aligned players (before nightfall) tell the truth, then the game is easily solved and the wolves will lose.  Once townies figure out that they have to lie too (and they will the moment they begin the game town and switch overnight), the game really opens up.  It feels like it comes down to a coin flip or gut call most games.  There are two (or more) consistent narratives and you just have to choose one and vote!  So deduction takes a back seat to reading players.

The more advanced roles make the deductions harder but do so at the cost of a much longer setup time.

portable, accessible, beer/wine friendly, can be played at a picnic table, expandable for variety and longevity. definitely a fun game for a while, but eventually you realize it's just a bunch of nonsense. from the get go, no one knows if they're even still the same role any longer. there's usually no good basis for starting accusations either, which can strand a group of strangers (especially if everyone is trying to tell the truth for some reason). if you're looking for an ice breakers maybe try Love Letter, Coup, etc. personally, i don't care for those other games so i keep this one around just for drinky evenings when nothing serious works.

Usually too easy to find the werewolf if the number playing is larger than 3. Too much cooperation and you can usually back into who was the wolf, and who is now based on movement of cards.

Finally, a way to play Werewolf without a moderator. Once you have the app on your phone, you're ready to play. The voice from the app tells each player when to wake up and exactly what to do. Players decide before each game which roles will be included. If the Villagers are winning too much, then add another Werewolf or perhaps the Tanner. Each game takes us about 5 minutes to play and there is always a lot of laughing and giggling. Not for the over serious crowd, though. Easy for casual gamers to pick up and enjoy.

RATING: 6
-kurze Spieldauer 
-würde es ab 6 Personen empfehlen
-Kartenspiel
-Partyspiel
-jeder schlüpft in eine Rolle

Vorab: ich kenne das Original Werwölfe nicht.

Jeder zieht eine verdeckte Karte und nimmt in der Nachtphase die entsprechende Rolle ein.
Dort müssen alle Spieler ihre Augen geschlossen halten und wenn sie an der Reihe sind, dürfen sie je nach Rolle eine Aktion ausführen.
In der darauffolgenden Tagphase wird diskutiert.
Die Dorfbewohner (unterschiedliche Charaktere) müssen dafür sorgen, dass ein Werwolf bei der abschließenden Abstimmung die meisten Stimmen erhält( somit angeklagt wird). Die Werwölfe gewinnen, wenn keiner von Ihnen verdächtigt wird.
Einige Rollen modifizieren die Regeln etwas. 
Ein Günstling z. B. gewinnt, wenn die Werwölfe gewinnen.
Ein Gerber ist suizidgefährdet und gewinnt, wenn er verdächtigt wird. 

Es ist also Sinn des Spiels, dass man je nach Rolle andere verdächtigt und entsprechend argumentiert.
Es wird geflunkert um ggf. von sich abzulenken oder um den Verdacht absichtlich auf sich zu ziehen -  nach dem Prinzip "wenn Du denkst, denkst,dass ich denke...".

In der richtigen Runde kann es sehr unterhaltsam sein.

Dies ist für Personen mit folgenden Charakterzügen nicht zu empfehlen:
-nachtragend
-mit großer Hemmschwelle davor, darauf loszuflunkern.

Ein weiters Problem gibt es meiner Meinung nach, wenn gewisse Spieler zu dominant und andere zu zurückhaltend sich an der Diskussion beteiligen.

In der richtigen Gruppe ab 6 würde ich dem Spiel eine höhere Wertung geben.
Wir haben allerdings gehofft, daas es sich auch zu viert oder fünft besser spielen lässt.

RATING: 5
I love social deduction: the classic Werewolf game was my gateway into the world of board gaming, and it’s still a favourite among my friends; yet, One Night Ultimate Werewolf bores me to no end. Essentially, One Night strips down Werewolf to its bare components while adding an almost absurd amount of randomness into the equation. Unlike most Werewolf/Mafia variants, there’s only one Night phase in which all the characters play their abilities, half of them being some variant of exchange other players’ cards—stranger yet, the titular wolves don’t get to kill anyone. After the overly long night phase, what follows is a timed 5-minute Day phase at the end of which the players must decide who’s the wolf among them. In theory, this setup should drop you right at the heart of the social deduction experience, but the actual game is everything but that. Without any solid leads, the accusations boil down to flawed, dispassionate deduction at best or blind guessing at worst—no role-playing, no hard evidence, no misdirection, no intrigue, no manipulation, just 5 minutes of noise. Add to that the subpar art style and the less than stellar companion app and you have the one social deduction game I’d rather avoid.

I suppose I can see the appeal, but for us it fell completely flat.  It felt like an utter crap-shoot, very little information is out there so the voting was completely random.  Werewolf's big draw is the multiple rounds to gather information, plus the challenge of dodging the bullet as long as possible.  This just distills a fun deduction/bluffing game to a random shout fest.

Best to be played with creative people who will thrive under minimal guidance. Very easy to teach, but I do find that some people do require a lot more guidance/explanation as to what their supposed to be doing. It can take quite a few games before people click with it, but once they do it is addictive. Played several hours of this with a group of 10 people (most of who are not typical gamers).

Played a couple games with 5 people that didn't seem to result much, but can probably be done with more experienced group.

The "app" really elevates this one, making this game a more fun experience than the game itself would have been otherwise. I prefer it classic "Werewolf" (though I prefer almost anything to that overlong party game) but it's just a little too shallow for me to choose this of "The Resistance" or "Deception" or even "Spyfall".

But boy, that app makes this one easy to pick up and play... makes me wish all those other games were guided by apps.

Seemed more like keeping powers straight and thinking of every edge-case lie than anything. Don't even know who you are sometimes. Too much ambiguity for me. The myriad roles provide quite a bit of replayability though, even if some roles are more boring. This kinda neglects keeping the game fun for vanilla Villagers.

It's the group of people and the power of the brain that make this a good game. It's quick, very fun with a group of people, but depending on the group, the game will either be really fun, or really stupid/silly. I'm more of a strategy gamer, but will definitely play if I'm asked.

Exceptionally fun time, assuming your group gets into the the spirit of the game. We really enjoyed the narration and varied theme music that the app brings to the game. Nice too that you can change up the experience a bit by adding in different villagers. Bit of a bummer if you repeatedly get the same card, but rounds are quick (done in just ten minutes)so you can play again and as many as you'd like or move on to another game if you are using ONUW as your filler game.

I'm willing to play, but not crazy about it - I suspect it's the grouthink which was infected by the owner of the copy, namely it was pure deduction with each person declaring who they were and what they did during the game. Blargh! So everything went pretty routinely and it was hard to lie. Sowing confusion kinda worked, but because you yourself never knew who you were. I would need to play this with a different group to truly get a grasp of it, but I'm not impressed so far. The strength of Werewolf is in its moderator who can pain an evocative landscape (I run it as light roleplaying). This is kinda one round of Resistance meets Mascarade in Werewolf clothing. But Mascarade does the crazy chaos better, Resistance does tension and deduction better and Werewolf does werewolf better. And I don't like digital applications as a necessary part of the game, just get a damn good moderator and play Werewolf!

Really smart social deduction game. It takes the bluffing and deduction aspects of Werewolf and distills it into a pure, enriching, 10 minute or less experience. When this game happens, we usually play at least 5 times because it's so fast and interesting. Each game unfolds differently, though I usually claim Troublemaker at least once. When it's over, you're ready to redeal and get a taste for something else!

I had never played Werewolf before and didn't have a lot of interest in it due to the theme, play time, and player elimination.  However, I was really interested in the "One Night Ultimate Werewolf" and "Inquisition" versions after having seen videos for them.  The restricted play time and lack of player elimination are what appealed to me for both games.  I finally got to play "One Night Ultimate Werewolf" a couple times and had fun.  The game plays quickly, yet seems to capture the spirit of the original game.  The app really helps with the game setup and a variable discussion time can be configured.  In addition, some of the characters used can be switched for others for a particular game.  Based on the comments and participation from others playing, it seems that that the game experience does depend on the people playing it.  Even so, it was still fun  and look forward to playing it again.

A super fast deduction game but you need the right crowd to play. You need a group of high energy, loud, deceptive people.

This game works out pretty well and the companion app really makes it top notch and easy to understand. There ends up being a lot of laughing and screaming when I play with my group of friends. 

Some roles are a bit too complicated so we tend to leave those cards out. 
There are certain combinations of cards that make it almost impossible to win as a werewolf. I think having multiple villagers gives werewolves a fighting chance. If you stick with one of each role you really limit the lies you can tell.

I play it with a group of 5 around a small table. It's the perfect size for moving cards around without anyone noticing. Having more than 5-6 seems like it would become difficult to do any stealthy exchanges and having someone sit out to do the exchanges may not eliminate the issue.

Quicker than Avalon but with a similar feel.  I like how there's no player elimination, since it's only one round, though this does result in a loss of continuity and so there are lower stakes with gutsy plays.  It also requires players to be familiar with the roles because it seems like werewolves should be actively trying to be other characters in order to throw people off.

A fun game, short and puzzle like. The werewolves can get caught out really early with a seer and robber. Although you can always try and lie if you are the only werewolf it will make for a short game.

After playing this on numerous occasions now, the only bad thing I can say is that it can be somewhat inconsistent game to game. That said I've had some really great games with some really interesting situations and even the so so games aren't bad considering the game lasts less than 10 mins. The more I play and get to try different role combinations the more I like it. The new expansions roles can be great too, but you need to be a bit more thoughtful about which ones to include as the game can get really lopsided.

my first "social game", it's pretty good.  i think it is a great game to play at work.  Interesting interactions.  

On the fence about buying it: I don't think i would be able to get my family to play - they would find closing one's eyes too weird, and the kids wouldn't like the bluffing aspect yet.

eventually i got tired of the conversations that it always seemed to come down to: 2 or 3 people trying to convince people of the same thing, and no real way to say which one, so it's just about how convincing can you be.  Being convincing got to be stale for me.

I could be missing something from the game, but it left me feeling flat and uninspired, as with the rest of my game group.

My favorite party game, good use of deduction and bluffing. Eliminates the two main problems with werewolf(player elimination and narrator) and also has a good bit of organized fun chaos.

Managed to play a few games so far, and as I can tell, the first time you play with people, there's a lot of hesitation, but round 2, 3, 4 and onward can get really intense. Once players begin to devise strategies and become more comfortable with lying to their friends, the game hastens incredibly and only get more fun with more people.

RATING: 9
This is not the type of game I usually like, but nearly every game I've played has been an enjoyable experience.  I like the variation in character abilities and the investigative component of figuring out what really happened during the night phase.  There are two clear strategies to win this game - successfully navigate the convoluted stories to discover the inconsistencies in the werewolves' stories, or come up with a compelling story to throw the villagers off.  Both strategies have heavy variation in achieving this, which is appealing to me.  We play this often enough that I suspect this game may plateau for me, but that end is not in sight yet.

Very quick hidden role/social deduction game.  Players get a role, their roles (maybe) get switched, and they debate who they should kill the following night.  Very simple, plays in 10-15 minutes per game.  I don't think I quite have a grasp on the deeper strategic elements of this game, but I really like it.  One minor complaint is that I think this game needs some house rules so information cannot be gleaned from noting the position of your cards when you wake up.

It captures the feel of Werewolf in 15 minutes.  There is more evidence to base the decisions and voting on, and no one is ever eliminated.  It does require more logic than regular Werewolf to play well.  I like it and look forward to expansions.  Definitely not a one night stand.

I was a huge fan of the game back in the days. However, for the only 2 games we played, people lacked interaction and didn't play properly, ended up being a dispointing game :(   on the bad side, my wife says she doesn't want to play again :( :(

RATING: 6
Much more fun than ordinary Werewolf as it plays much more quickly, needs no moderator, and there is even some logical deduction to it. I still think I prefer Avalon to this, and there are some logistical issues with this (you have to touch the cards on the table for some roles), but it's still not a bad game.

fast playing Werewolf with NO PLAYER ELIMINATION - YAY!  i like it.

for this game to work, it is essential that the players lie, otherwise the game is boring.  be sure to use some traitor roles to encourage this.  

also, the less time there is for discussion, the better - it increases the chaos... and that is the fun of it!

Expansions: Daybreak

Probably my favourite social deduction game - You get enough information to make reasonable deductions and it has a locked timer so people can't talk for so long that they bore people into admitting they're a traitor (Which is how I often feel in other similar games, like the Resistance).

The biggest flaw in the game is the lack of method to create predetermined setups - It's very easy to break the balance of information (Either making it so you can pretty irrefutably point out the traitor, or such that no solid information exists and its' pretty much a guess). It's a big shame that they (afaik) have never made a generator in the app that creates well(ish) balanced game compositions.

The other issue is that I've realized how uncomfortable real time/social deduction games make me feel in general, which is why this gets a low rating despite the fact that I actually have a high opinion of the game.

RATING: 8
Possibly the perfect filler, One Night Ultimate Werewolf is everything I like about hidden traitor games distilled to a few minutes of lying, dissembling, and persuading. The Resistance is good in this niche, but ONUW is at least as good, quicker, and works with a wider variety of player counts. ONUW is also more of a puzzle. Some may find it too insubstantial, but I like to play again and again until I've had my fill, yet my appetite inevitably outlasts the occasion, and if that isn't the sign of a good game, what is?

Not just a condensed version of Ultimate Werewolf, this game is its own breed and scales better than Ultimate Werewolf does with fewer player. While we are still grasping the nuances of the game, everybody saw the potential for deception in this little gem and wants to play it more. It is quite possible that this game will become our go-to social game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While the theme is interesting, this game falls short of the high standards set by The Resistance: Avalon in my opinion. The solitary round means that everything is over quickly and often enough it seems quite simple to find and kill a werewolf. Having said that, this is based on 5-players; I suspect that to get the full experience this will need more than 5.

*Traded away as it did not live up to my high expectations.

RATING: 6
RATING IN BRIEF:
- For me: 3
- For it's target audience (people who actually like Werewolf mechanics): 8+
- Average: 6ish

I am not a fan of Werewolf: the few games I've played were long and painful, with me sitting there most of the time (having been lynched early on), BORED. But this version has been getting a lot of buzz, and promised to be very very quick so I had to give it a fair shake.

2 plays (7er) and my suspicions are confirmed. This game is quick, but it's still Werewolf :yuk:. And the biggest reason I don't like the game is not for the length (I prefer longer games) or player elimination (although true, I don't like that aspect either); it's because it involves at least 2 skills I lack, and have little interest (or ability?) in acquiring:
- negotiation: convincing people to do stuff. While a great life skill, I just don't want to do it. For example, I've grown very weary of having to convince people that I'm actually not winning something, and they ought to be attacking someone else!
- people-reading: figuring out when someone is lying. That's another life skill that would be nice to have, but I just can't do it! Say what you mean, and mean what you say -- I don't want to have to figure out what you [i]actually[/i] mean!

However, for people who enjoy Werewolf, this game would probably be a real winner! It still has the core elements of the game, albeit with some chaos from the characters in the Ultimate version of the game, but each game is compressed to just 10-15 minutes!

But it's not for me!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
A bunch of character cards are distributed randomly, one per player. Then, everyone puts their card in a circle in the center, with some extra cards in the center. Everyone closes their eyes, then someone calls out every character in the game, in order (there's an app for that). When you're called, you act based on your character. There are a variety of powers, for example:
- look at a card
- trade any 2 cards
- copy another power

After every card has been called, everyone opens their eyes and the discussion begins. When everyone is ready, simultaneously point to a person; the player with the most votes is lynched. If the Werewolf is lynched, the Villagers win; otherwise, the Werewolf does. Of course, some characters modify this (e.g., if they're pointed to, they can kill someone else; or if they're killed, they win instead). And since there are some extra cards in the center, it's possible that NO ONE is a Werewolf; Villagers only win if they figure that out and decide not to kill anybody! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is great. A blast with everyone I have played with and easy to understand enough but deep enough that anyone can pick it up and everyone can have a good time. If you have 6 people or so and don't know what to do and this game is around I would highly suggest it. The Tanner in particular is a genius addition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Werewolf games are just plain bad and this one removes the one somewhat intriguing part of Ultimate Werewolf, the social party structure.  This game is a single round of Werewolf using some of the roles from the Ultimate package's selection, that's it.

I was introduced to this game as a Werewolf game I would probably like because there was actual deduction involved...buuuuut not really.  Sure, some of the roles allow you to look at other players roles and get some information but others just randomize the whole thing up again.  And if you don't have any special role or you have a stupid role like the drunk who switches his role for a random one without looking at it you are still left with no information and just guessing who is or isn't lying when deciding who to kill.

Not to mention that the two games of this I played, neither had any Werewolves in it...we win...I guess.  Super fun (insert sarcasm here)!  Not only is this not the one Werewolf game I actually enjoy, it is one of the worst I've ever played next to Inquisition.

My favorite game that can be played in under 10 minutes. It's a filler game, but we often have so much fun playing it that we just play it over and over. I like The Resistance slightly better if we have more time. This game occasionally flops, since some people just can't get into it, and sometimes the role selection or the card deal results in an unsatisfying game.

I hate Ultimate Werewolf.  No, let me rephrase that:  I HATE Ultimate Werewolf to the point that I would burn a copy of the game if it was given to me, as I could not bear to inflict it upon somebody else.

But, after being coerced into playing this game, I found myself to have a good time.  It is really fast, and the deduction element is a 1000x more prevalent that in it's predecessor.  I would even go so far as to say that I like this game!

RATING: 9
Really good fun with the right group - although new players sometimes take a while to get into it (and, unfortunately, sometimes just don't).  The app is a must - I play it over a bluetooth portable speaker and at a loud volume it just about covers up any rustling my the players moving in the night, though we still like to make random noises to throw people off.  It's fast (less than 10 minutes a game) so you can play it over and over again, and it never seems to get stale.  Definitely a go-to party game.

Like all versions of Werewolf, this one takes the right group of people. Get a good set and there's a good bit of fun to be had.

Update: I've been playing this a lot with my students in down time between exams. Everyone really enjoys it. This play has, however, led to my biggest complaint. I love the cardboard cards, but the artwork has gotten seriously scuffed just from sliding the cards across the table through the course of 10-15 plays.

I like it much better than the original Werewolf game. The elimination in the original game made things very boring for a player that was killed the first night. The app is wonderful as well. It keeps things moving and nobody has to stay out of the game to narrate.

Also in the same box:
One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak
The expansion adds some interesting characters to the base game. My group especially likes the curator. I wouldn't try to play this without the app. The app keeps everything sorted out and no one has to sit out as narrator.

This is just about the perfect social game.
It's very quick (so if people hate it you can play something else). It's much deeper than it looks, though, so it rewards multiple plays; once everyone realises that offering true information is potentially dangerous, the game really shines. Lying and bluffing has never been so much fun.

A fantastic party style game for small and large groups.  Players try to convince others they are not the Werewolf, in some cases there actually isn't a Werewolf.   All of this is done in a single round.  Plays very fast and works best with the use of the app.

RATING: 9
This is a direct Werewolf/The Resistance/2R1B* competitor as it has the same team-based play and free form structure but this only takes 10 minutes and it is fantastic. Not 10 minute filler fantastic, BGG Top 100 fantastic.

It is an eclectic mix of puzzle, deduction, bluffing and timing that come together in an awesome  way that provides better opportunities for logical deduction. Go and print out the rules and scribble on some cards so you can play it today. And set aside that Christmas gift card because you don't want to be caught short when it is released.

--

I'll nitpick two issues. 
Being the Werewolves is hard especially with the hunter in play. You can't just be coy or talk BS, you need to be on your A game to win. Even more so if the tanner and/or minion aren't playing well.
The other is that the setup process that is annoying with 8+ players crowding around a table but also requires noise to be made to hide the nightime activities effectively.

*You could also make comparisons to Coup, Citadels or Love Letter for their shorter play times but the individual victors, turn structure, resources and a reduced focus on talking/bluffing give those games a completely different flavour to this.

It's a small and simple social deduction/bluffing/push your luck kind of game. Very dependent on the playgroup for the game to really work. There isn't much game to it, just the crazy shit that happens when lying and bluffing is on the table during the negotiation stage.

I wonder if ever someone would design a social deduction game with quite a bit more meat. I have a few on my wishlist i would like to try or purchase. But they don't play up to as many as a big group of 8-10

I love Mafia, and being able to play more quickly with less people is a wonderful plus.

Great party game with immense replayability.

You can't think about it too much, just play and have a good time. With the right group -- the kind that enjoys Coup or The Resistance -- you can have an exciting/tense night.

I'm glad that the designer of ONW is credited and indeed receives a payment for each copy of ONUW sold, but it does still feel as though Bezier are constantly reselling the same product each year.

A fantastic take on the Werewolf franchise! Werewolf, where everything is decided in one night and then the bluffs and accusations ruthlessly come out. Quick and easy to teach and it really gets the group screaming and laughing at each other. All my friends that I taught and played with enjoyed it. We never play with the Villagers as everyone enjoys having roles!

I don't like games that are mostly about lying and just trying to guess who is lying without many data points to inform your decision.  ONUW pretty much falls into that camp.  Most of our games tended to be either totally solved because someone was caught in a lie or a total crapshoot because nobody was caught in a lie.  So the strategy seemed to be to reveal as little info as possible, because that info can only be used against you.

So I didn't find the strategy to be particularly enjoyable, but at least the game played quickly and it was always fun flipping over the cards to see who was whom and which cards got switched.  I'll also give it credit for playing decently at a small player count.

This game can be really fun, but also really frustrating, perhaps broken. I've played tight games where you don't know who is who, but some combinations and the way players play can completely ruin it. If someone is found out as the werewolf, but got traded away, it is then obvious who the new werewolf is and the game fizzles immediately. Good news is, new round starts in 5 minutes! I like this game sometimes, but would often rather play something else

Very highly rated, quick party/social deduction game--Shannon liked Sheriff of Nottingham and Coup, so loved this and we decided to get all the expansions.  It's not a weighty game, so won't give 10, but everyone who plays it loves it and it well deserves a 9.

RATING: 5
I feel this game is a bit too random. The games I played ended with what, I feel, were pretty uninteresting results. Sometimes you can be pretty certain of some players identities, because their stories corroborate each other. But then it seems to be only guess work as to which of the others are werewolves, as long as the wolfs keep a low profile. Other times you pretty much know for certain that someone is a wolf. With people you know really well it might be a lot better as a chance to chat and make jokes. Also the game is very short which is a plus.

Fun party game. Requires only 3, but you really don't want to play that way :(. Not quite as dramatic as secret hitler, but with the narrator available as a phone app, this game is fun. You can make things as simple or difficult as you'd like while you discuss (argue?) with friends. Multiple roles that can be switched in and out add variety to the game.

RATING: 7
Quick rounds and no moderator are what really sells me on this game. Because the rounds are so short, you get to experience many different roles. Be careful when mixing the roles from other games; it can become very confusing and overwhelming very quickly but even the most beginner of game players can have fun with this one.

Download and use the app! Much easier to use the app as the announcer and making sure people do their game turns in the right order! Fun game with the right crowd.

One person commented they prefer Ultimate Vampire having now played both.

Great light filler. Perfect for starting or ending a night of games. It's rather random though, so it has to fit the right crowd. I'd call it a social game more than a 'social deduction' game. For a better deduction "social deduction" game, try Resistance: Avalon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Much better than Werewolf, but not nearly as good as The Resistance: Avalon.

One major issue we've had is figuring out who should talk first. Werewolves don't want to claim a role to begin with because they might be found out easily by the person who really has that role. Villagers don't want to talk first because that just gives information for the werewolves to work with. It's not a great social game if the best move is for everybody to remain silent.

Still, if you just embrace that flaw then the game can create some fun, unexpected moments.

Sold.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a great 10/15 minute game where you'll probably end up having lots of rounds and laughing alot. The surprise when you turn over a card and it is not the card you started with makes a great moment to why I play board games.

Why we culled it: A great little social deduction game stuffed into a frantic five-minute session, this is a party favorite.

Sending it on to a new group made sense, and I still end up playing it fairly often.

Much prefer this to original werewolf due to the app being the moderator, this is great for groups of 5 to 10 players. I have to say though that this game should be much cheaper to buy than it is as there are little to no components, I suppose the app is added value but still it seems a little cheeky, still well worth it though. 

*Update* This has been getting plays week in week out with my playgroup and I now pretty much always bring it to meet ups as its a perfect end of the night quick game and I haven't played with a single person who hasn't enjoyed this yet. The front of the tiles are now getting a little worn however which is disappointing considering the price of the game, but this does not affect play.

December 2015: Great party game, my siblings took to it really quickly even though none of them are what one would call gamers in any sense of the word.

This game plays in no more than 8 minutes and requires a game or 2 for everyone to grasp the basic concepts. I'd recommend having an experienced player at the table, and to use the free app that comes with the game.

Plays better at higher counts, and a dining table is definitely better than a coffee table for reaching across.

Recommended.

This game is so much fun. The best configuration I've found so far is 4 players because its easier to decipher who's bluffing. The other day we played with 7 people and it was a blast, although it was super hard to tell who was who. What makes it even better is keeping a tally of who won which round in order to increase the competitiveness of it.

This game is quite a trip, worth going on at least once! It's really confusing at first. Actually it's kind of confusing even with experience. It's not uncommon to experience six minutes of a flurry of arbitrary lies. Regular Mafia/Werewolf is slow, plodding, deductive, argumentative, and boring, especially for those poor suckers who get arbitrarily eliminated first. In contrast, One Night Ultimate Werewolf is confusing and madcap and hilarious, and involves all players throughout.

Absolutely love this game, will pull it out whenever I have a chance to play it. It's fun to mess with people through the various cards in the game. I own the expansion as well, but we mostly used the base game with just one or two expansion roles. The best way to play this game is by swapping out a role with an unused role after each round.

RATING: 7
I'd never played any other version of werewolf before... but I've played The Resistance so I understood the basic mechanic fairly well.  From what I understand this differs from the regular werewolf in that it's only a single round, and everybody picks someone to die, instead of voting on a single person.

This was really fun.  It's more of a party game with a lot of craziness involved.  It's a lot of deduction and bluffing where some of the players aren't sure who they are and others are convinced they're someone they're not.

We played with the free iOS app, which kept track of which roles were in play, gave all the instructions on who should do what when, and timed the game.  The app was pretty sharp and took all the bookkeeping out of the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[thing=147949][/thing] works, mostly, like the regular [thing=925][/thing], with one clear difference: everything happens in a single night.

Some of the roles present in the games are still the same: the Werewolves (they don't kill anyone, however, but the village still wants to find them), the Hunter (if killed, can kill someone else), the Seer (can look at someone else role, or look two of the ones out the game), the Tanner (wants to die, and, if killed, wins alone the game), and so on. But, more important, are the new roles: like the Robber, that trades his role for the one of other player; the Troublemaker, that trades the roles between two other players; the Drunk, that trades his role for one of the center of the table, without looking at his new role; the Insomniac, who sees his role at the end of the night; etc. These roles are designed to insert a high level of uncertainty into the whole situation, and, if that wasn't enough, there are always three roles that stay "out" of the game, in the center of the table, so players don't know exactly what is in the game and what isn't, even if they know all the roles that are beign used in the play.

Therefore, you might have started the game as a Werewolf, but, after the Troublemaker changing roles, you became the Drunk, so, during the day, you will act as a Werewolf, trying to not beign caught and maybe defending your fellow Werewolf, only to discover, in the reveal of the roles, that if you succeeded, you actually lost with the rest of the village!

Basically, the few sure thing the game allows are the roles you see during the night (but you can't be sure if the roles you saw remain with the same persons) and the Insomniac is the port in the storm, as if she is in the game, the player will definitely knows what he is at the end of the night, and this could be key, both for the village and for the werewolves. This is true because, even if players have their roles changed, they will do the actions, at the proper times, related to the ones they saw at the start of the night. So, for istance, say you saw that, at the star of the night, you were the Drunk. During the night, the Robber exchanged his role for yours. Still, when the Drunk is called, you will do the Drunk action, changing your role (now, the Robber) for one at the center of the table, even if you aren't really the Drunk anymore.

The goal of the village is to find one of the Werewolves, and of the Werewolves is to make the village pick anyone else. The Tanner can win alone if he is the one chosen to be killed.

If I had any doubt that this shortened version of [thing=925][/thing] would work, it was completely left behind. [thing=147949][/thing] is fun, chaotic, fast and loud. The only bothersome part is the phase in wich everyone "sleeps" with their eyes closed, as players are called, in the order of the roles, to execute the actions of them. Certainly isn't a fun part, and the more roles you have (i.e: the more players), the longer this phase will take to end. However, the next phase, even if limited in 5 minutes (or maybe [i]because[/i] of this), generates such a fun time, with wild discussions and accusations, that it more than compensates for the waiting time.

The game has an app that allows for it to be played without a GM. It is in English only, so not everyone might deal with it easily.

Now, my only "fear" is that [thing=147949][/thing] will replace most of the other party games in my collection.

I am a huge fan of The Resistance so I decided to give this one a try as well since its another small and simple social deduction game.  Unfortunately, it is nowhere near as good.  The app that goes with the game is great, it is much more convenient, fun, and accurate to use it instead of saying the script in the instructions (I don't think I could stand the game if it wasn't for the app).  The main problem I have with the game is that, after everyone has looked at their roles and everyone does their actions, nobody knows what their role even is (a lot of the time).  If you were a werewolf before the action phase, you might be a villager now, and vice-versa.  This makes it impossible for anyone to know for sure if what they are saying is helping or hurting their team.  I really don't enjoy not knowing my own role, and that really breaks the game for me.  Some people I've played with really love this game though, and always rave about it.  It can be fun at a party every once in a while but otherwise I'm not a big fan.  At least it is quick.

A good social deduction game.

Components: Game components are functional, sturdy and minimal. I like the art style and the fact that character tokens were provided as helpful reminders. 

Ease of learning/teaching: The game rules and victory conditions are extremely straightforward. The companion app conducts most of the game and simplifies play.

Theme: The theme is commensurate to the light weight of the game. I enjoyed the many quirky characters and their descriptions. 

Gameplay: Plays quickly and raises enough ruckus around the table to make for a good time. Personally, I haven't taken the game seriously enough to employ adequate group manipulation and deductive reasoning, but I will look forward to getting better at reading people and their actions. 

In conclusion, One Night Ultimate Werewolf makes for a great, fun and breezy filler.

My very favorite of the bluffing/deductive reasoning games where some of the players are on the 'evil' side and nobody knows who they are. The original werewolf game is fun, but is long (sometimes over an hour) and has a musical-chairs elimination strategy. This game is only 10 minutes long, and all the players participate to the end. I'd much rather play a half dozen rounds of this than one of the original game.

Decent deduction party game. Best part is it plays so quickly. This is the only game I've played that was right about rated time to play printed on the box. It will take about 10 minutes or less for one game, which will leave you wanting to play several more times in a row.

Definitely love the brief time length, it's 4 minutes of pointing fingers and trying to puzzle out what happened.  Not a game I'd ever really push for though, spending 5 minutes with eyes closed is a bit silly, and having to be so convincing at straight lying is a bit exhausting for me.  A fun experience though, for sure.

I love the idea of a one-shot werewolf game, removing the absurd player elimination from the base game. Unfortunately the game fell a little flat for me. It gave me the exact same feeling as Mascarade. Both games have a lot of potential for chaos, bluffing, lying, accusing around the table, but both games kinda require all players to be familiar with all the roles available. However being pure party games I would mostly play occasionally with non-gamers/new players, it would take more time to explain the game/roles than to play the game.

[+] like the concept, wish it was easier to teach for the intended audience
[-] maybe with more knowledge of the roles you have more ways to go about it, but for the most part I thought the good guys had no reason to lying in the end (villager, seer, thief, troublemaker, etc.) while the werewolves had to gamble a lot in their interventions.

First things first: If you're not planning to play this with the accompanying app, then you shouldn't bother getting it.  The app is pretty essential to playing the game, or else you'll probably need to still have a moderator for the game.  Beyond that, though, this is a fun variation of Werewolf that takes less time to play and still gives you some of the feel of the original.  I think it's essential to mix in a lot of special characters, or at least be willing to bluff, because if everyone's honest about their roles, the round gets a little solvable (especially if only one werewolf is chosen that round).

RATING: 5
This is a decent time waster, billed as a game of werewolf that resolves in just one night (round). That's sort of true, but there is neither time nor enough information to be remotely sure of any accusation you might make. Every game comes down to a wild guess between the 2-3 people that have fallen under suspicion.

That gets old pretty quick. There is nowhere near the drama or the comedy that usually springs up when playing the original Werewolf. Then again, the first two or three people that get hung rarely get to enjoy that anyway. If that tendency bothers you, this version of Werewolf might be good for you. I prefer the old way though, as even watching from the sidelines after an early death has usually been incredibly entertaining.

I find Mafia to be superior in almost every way, and this is basically a commercial rip-off of Mafia.  I don't hate the game, but I'd much rather just play Mafia.  I find the additional elements in Werewolf only serve to make the game more fiddly, and take longer.

The ability of the Robber and Troublemaker to swap cards around makes the deduction of the day phase pretty crazy. In most games that would be a huge drawback, but here, the accusations and blaming are already chaotic, so why not throw another wrench in the gears?

A decent game, but the randomness combined with the short play time and idea that you're somehow actually supposed to be able to deduce who has what role will probably give this relatively limited replay for a filler.

A fast game in which everyone gets a role. One of the Werewolves or one of the dozen different villigers, each with a special ability.  The game consists of two phases, 
a night and a day phase. During the night everyone closes their eyes and a players take turn "waking up" to perform their special ability. During the day the villigers try to figure out what happened during the night, and who the werewolf is. In the end, players vote on who to lynch. The game uses an app that keeps track of time and tells everyone what to do during the night.

It's been a little while since I've played The Resistance, probably because I've played it quite a bit and burned out a tiny bit on it. However, I love social deduction games and want to try all of them out, hence my purchase of this game.

I really liked how quickly the game played out and the fact that there's a timer to make sure things are kept tense and fast. I like that the timer app also does the narration because sometimes it's tough to narrate and play the game at the same time. I enjoyed how the roles switched around almost randomly due to roles like the Troublemaker and the Drunk, it keeps things interesting and makes it hard to determine who's doing what.

If there's anything that I don't like it's that you can easily overplay this game to the point where you're burned out on it and more variety would always be better. I see this sticking around for a while and coming to most game nights as a closer.

Quick and easy-to-set-up Hidden Traitor game with a mobile app that handles all the moderation.   If you’re introducing new players you can just use the simpler characters and then add in more interesting ones later, but even the latter aren’t very difficult to understand (especially as the app will tell you exactly what to do during the night phase).   Would be good as a filler game but we often just end up playing it over-and-over with different character cards involved.

First off, you need to know, I don't even like Werewolf.  In fact, I loathe Werewolf.  2-hour+ games and player elimination makes for a horribly boring situation.  I was vehemently opposed to all variations of Werewolf.

Then I played One Night.  This game changes everything.  ONUW is the only deduction game you will ever need.  10-minute games, zero player elimination, and best of all, [u]everyone[/u] has a reason to lie.  One Night is not only Ultimate Werewolf, but also the ultimate filler game, the ultimate party game, and the ultimate deduction game.

If you are even remotely a fan of Werewolf or any party games, this game is a MUST HAVE for you!

Compresses everything fun about Werewolf into 600 seconds, without a gritty aftertaste or side effects.

Its only drawback is that it frequently gets played at conventions after midnight, and at that point my lips, brain, and tongue don't function properly.  After a grueling day of trying to learn Guns of Gettysburg, for example, I can barely remember my own role, let alone the possible identities of everyone else.

I played some Mafia and Werewolf type games as a kid and I like the mind games of flat-out lying that can occur in them. These types of games usually require a really large group, however, and I don't tend to like the mass player elimination that's really essential in these games.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf, however, gives me the same mind games and lies in under 10 minutes without the player elimination. The roles interact deviously with each other and no one really knows if they've won or not until all the tiles are flipped back up. Werewolves that fought so hard during the discussion phase to ensure that the villagers lynched the wrong person find out that they turned out to be a villager! The laughs, wild accusations, and bold-face lying that have come out of my sessions with this game has been simply the best. We've found that it works best for us with 5+ players, but I'm glad that there's still the option to play it with less.

When I watched the earlier reviews of this game I was rather underwhelmed: it seemed pretty random and chaotic. But after buying it on impulse and playing a couple a rounds I can say with confidence that this game has produced some of the best laughters I've had in a game. The chaos, the talking, the stress, the accusing looks, the silence, the brilliant background tracks... It all adds up so surprisingly neatly. And yes, there are some rounds in which one of the sides didn't stand a chance from the beginning, especially with a low amount of people (I refuse to play this with less than 5. 3 or 4 people is terrible). This is definitely one of those 'the more, the merrier' games. It leads to more chaos, but also more fun! :D

Great fun! I'm a bit concerned that they will release this with tiles instead of cards, because cards can easily be protected by sleeves, while if a tile gets marked up, then the game breaks.

I love the idea of a quick playing werewolf game, that instead of playing until the bitter end, you simply play one night after another, resolving one game at a time. Lots of fun! Ted Alspach's teenage daughter taught us the game and did a stellar game of it, and we will definitely be playing this again.

This game is all deduction with very little other than people's claims to work with... but with the right group it is just wonderful.  In fact I was surprised how much you could deduce just by trusting the right people... though some convincing liars or poor truth tellers can make this quite a muddle to sort through.  This has replaced Resistance in our local group since its so fast, fun and easy to explain in comparison.  Just a wonderful large group game that also scales down surprisingly well.

I played this game so much that it made my rating drop a lot. Outstanding game though : I wish I could forget all the plays I've had to enjoy it again as  much as I used to .

Was fun but I think it would be better with a larger group and more alcohol.

Better than regular Werewolf in my opinion. Faster and easier, and everyone stays involved.

The first game to try and take the best of Werewolf and condense it to a five minute game. Still like it.

Everything I love about the Resistance simplified into a 5-minute game anyone can understand. My go-to party game that almost everyone loves, with a high skill ceiling to boot.

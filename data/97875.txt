This game tries to combine euro with american gameplay and fails. If you try this, try to remove the influence of the die, not move the influence to your decision making. It may work in an abstract game, but it removes all atmosphere from the game in this case.

RATING: 4
A luck dependent game with limited control and where screwing over other players is essential. This leads to a lot of combat and picking on players who then spend the rest of the game trying to catch the leaders. There is also a lot of deliberation needed after each dice roll that creates unnecessary and dull down time between turns.

RATING: 7.5
An interestingly themed game that is deceptively quick to play and surprisingly tactical.  There are 3-ways to win the game, but the approaches are quite different in style.  The game is by design highly interactive and if the players are conservative or play engine-building game style, it can fall flat.  If the players are more risky and engaged, it can play more excitingly.  It is critical for the players to keep an eye on the leader and keep him in check, lest the game be given to him while the remainder squabble over the scraps of second place.  This is not quite a king-making scenario, but does require the players to position themselves in such a way that they obtain the goal regardless of the others efforts.  And there within lies the challenge - both to play the game and with the game.  The game has good potential, but is subject to abuse by the player mix; which in the end ultimately will drive how the game is received.

A resource-management, area-control Euro with dice rolling and direct PvP conflict. Yikes.

The hybrid nature of this game is bound to turn lots of people off, but I really like it: you always can do something with your dice, and you do have to attack each other if you want to do well (in fact, it's virtually impossible to win without combat). On the other hand, you have to manage your resources and protect your tiles, so it definitely has Euro elements.

I know people hate the "broken" tech cards, but I for one like them: they force you to make drastic decisions to try and stop seemingly unstoppable players, and often, you can do it. There can be balance problems in a 2-p. game, though, so I'd recommend playing this with 3+.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent in your face area control with some minor resource management and set collecting. The 3 different win conditions and very tight gameplay offsets the somewhat chaotic nature of the game due to dice rolls.

Plays extremely well with 2 players. The claustrophobic board and randomness of dice might get way too chaotic for 3 maybe even 4 players. Perfect for 2. A sleeper hit.

Wiraqocha made it to my radar because of the dice mechanism. For reasons I cannot adequately explain I like it when designers try to come up with something new with this ancient source of randomness. A good dice game to me allows the player to [i]chose[/i] based on the result, or to [i]modify[/i] it before actually using it. Or both. Ideally this means there are no bad rolls: just different rolls, which require then a bit of skill to be strung together to a game. Yspahan does this right, Troyes too, and in a simple form, Roll Through The Ages and Kingsburg too. Wiraqocha has the honour of making that very short list of Dice Done Right™-games. The players enter an intense race with various goals to secure energetic crystals, boring resources, and lost treasure. In this game there is a fair bit of direct conflict which allows one player to knock off the board playing pieces of other players; stealing is also allowed. In order to move, plunder and destroy, the players throw a number of dice, modify the result at the cost of resources, then add them together as they see fit to come up with the exact result demanded by a tile. That tile can then be occupied (or someone on it ousted). It takes a while to learn to rapidly combine the result of a dice throw, but there is certainly some clever trickery possible.

This is without doubt good stuff, inviting further plays. There are, however, a few darker sides to the game as well. For now it is obvious that for defensive purposes high dice results are more worthwhile than low dice results. I’m not sure yet whether this is balanced in some way: if no such balance exists, then the game is unfair by definition. The second issue is that because of its agressive nature, it invites all the standard problems of selected player targetting by groups of players and the like. It helps that one unit cannot be knocked out of the game, but it takes time to hurt the bullies this way. They are then in a similar position as the bullied player, so there is some ‘justice’ in this game at least. Finaly, because Wiraqocha is a race with multiple players being close to winning, the end [i]can[/i] come due to a lucky dicethrow. I wish that matters were different here—perhaps with the aid of a ‘coasting’ end condition as found in Vinci—but that wasn’t up to me of course.

[b]Update[/b]   I think... that the darker sides are much darker than I feared. The main reason for this is that for a [i]dice[/i] game, it introduces the slow, plodding mess that hinders Troyes too: dice selection is not quick. It requires calculation, thought, planning; and this saps the fun out of the game quicker than a hungry vampire can empty a victim's veins. It makes ageing Yspahan’s star shine that much brighter again: that game [i]flows[/i]. This issue is compounded by the fact that it is so direct and confrontational: with everyone hitting on each other, defenses are quickly built up, bases are moved to hard-to-get-at terrain, making it ever harder to invade territory or steal stuff, thus prolonging the agony simply because it can prove very difficult to get at another player's base camp once he gains a foothold on a three-dice space.

As the advert stated: smart dicing, yes, quite. Smart gaming, however, is a definite no. A short way of putting this is: if the game is about bashing each other's brains out, then you don't need a complex dice selection mechanism (look at Nexus Ops); and if the game is about a complex dice selection mechanism, then there should be more to it than blatant bashing each other's brains out. Wiraqocha wants to do both, and fails as a consequence. Which is a darned shame as a Wiraqocha of the second kind would have been something to treasure and behold.

[b]Update 2[/b]   I am happy to report that the expansion seems to alleviate many of the above gripes. It doesn't help much in the slow dice selection department, but since it appears to be much easier now to obtain resources you are at least never out of the running all that long. And with the alternate victory conditions matters are not that much of a see-saw anymore because it's the only thing left to you. I must admit I hadn't expected this, and so shall put out Wiraqocha more often again.

A true hidden gem of a game. Similar to Nexus Ops in the way that everyone is right on top of each other all game.

Another game I got based on a Faidutti review.  Not blown away, but impressed enough that I'd like to try again.  A pretty mean-spirited game, but luckily it seems to be quick enough that all the stealing is not really a problem.  I don't care about the theme, which may be a draw for many, but I do like the artwork.

Wiraqocha is easy to play. Around the level of Catan (a comparison I often hear people making due to the hex based board) but with the unfortunate need to frontload a lot more information if you want an even playing field. This means a higher barreir to entry. In return though you do get more strategic and tactical options.
Though a "throwaway dice" action really would've been useful. Even something as weak as "Trade in any dice for 1 resource" would've been welcome.
Theme wise it's pretty thin. Lost valley, hidden treasure and competing agencies. Bla bla bla. Nothing really evokes the weirdness that you' expect from the cover.

I want to play it again. I want to do a better job teaching this game.

And I want the art + gameplay to be as awesome and weird as the cover xD

Would benefit a lot from streamlining, has way too many rules for a fairly simple beat the leader / take that -game. Things are not by helped by the fact that like many other "roll dice to see what you can do" -games, Wiraqocha moves way too slow as you can't do any of the heavy thinking outside your own turn. Art looks fine, but is frustratingly poor usability-wise at times.

This is something of an oddball game, with a great looking design to it. (We played at Unity and many people stopped to ask what it was.) It's hard to describe. You place units on the board based on die rolls to claim resources and items, and you can also knock other people off the board or steal things from them. We all enjoyed it, I think, but one player either just happened to stumble into an utterly devastating combo or the technologies you can buy are seriously underbalanced.

Good looking area control game where the decisions and ability to conquer are based on dice combinations.  Controlled territories gain you dice adjustments.  Overall it's fast and fun.

More than 10 two-players plays. I like this game for its originality: particularly the 3 different ways of winning. Also the fact that it can be very aggressive.
I would like to play it now with more than 2 players. A good first game for this new editor.
What I like less: when the first player obtains a very good first dice roll, and the second player a very bad one. Then, the first player has a good way to victory (or I have not found yet how to deal with this !).

One play so far, didn't had a good impression of this game. They try to do something 'strategic' with dice, but the luck you need with the dice rolls is suinificant.

Extremely underrated game !!

This game should be ranked way higher then it is right now ! Lots of cool elements in this game. Area control, resource management, worker placement, set collection, players interaction, etc. Everything fits so well together and the game plays so smoothly !! 

This game is a gem !! I would say however that in order to play this game with his full potential, it requires the Expansion: Ways of the feathered serpent. That expansion gives the game way more options, introduces more character choices and fixes the game in certain ways. It also implements a great comeback mechanic, something that was missing from the base game. It definitely helps coming back from behind, something that was difficult to do in the base game. So get the game while you can.

Once again, this game is a real gem !!

Fun dice rolling and also cut throat which translates to an exciting game (could be less cut throat if played that way.) I really enjoy manipulating the dice to gain the best advantage each move. It's kind of a Yahtzee, area control, war game.
 
Two negatives: (1)Once you fall behind it's hard to catch up and (2)Lots of small rules to remember.

Over all a good game and way under rated. It should easily be 500 or above. Components are very nice and plays great with 2 players. If you like dice games and like cut throat you must buy this!

This is the pachinko of conflict games.  When you only have a few dice to work with and a board with numerous constraints in more cases than not you only have one optimal move available to you.  Meanwhile you have to search the board to see what that move is.  Sometimes you don't even have a move available to you at all.  Likewise, the cards that come out are obvious buys, so you just buy the best card that you can afford (or an even more obvious combo), and you hope that other people don't buy what you want before it gets to you.

When it is not your turn there is nothing to do or plan for so you just twiddle your thumbs and hope that other people's random rolls don't push them in your direction.

There is nothing more awkward than winning a game where you spend so little mental effort and where your action weren't particularly worthwhile to put you into that position. Historically the problem with multiplayer wargames is that you are at the mercy of the caprice of other players, here other players don't get enough decisions to use against you, rather they are given a move and sometimes you are the recipient.  The strategy to winning is to not be the one whose spaces match die rolls.

Also, it is very easy for one player to be effectively eliminated, and they just get to play along with no chance of winning and no rewarding turns.

With all the downtime and false decisions I should probably give this a three or a four, but the art and theme is really great, and the cards are fun.

A first game went very well - the rules are generally nice and clear, apparent ambiguities were quickly cleared up with a closer look and we were soon at it hammer and tongs. It is a very interactive game as, with three ways of winning, everyone is soon in with a chance and everyone has to be busy pinning everyone else back. In a three or four player game it isn't long before someone is going to make the break and seize victory, and it gives a very tense two player game.
One slight criticism - some points costs have to be looked up in the rules when they could easily have been put on the player reference cards. But regular players will very quickly memorise them, and I'll bet an expanded crib sheet will be up on the Geek in no time anyway.

Bash the leader dice game.
A fresh innovative design, but one I wouldn't play too often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I like dice allocation games and this takes a different tack than most -- it's not a genre where I'm used to seeing head-to-head conflict and area control.

The board is made of hex tiles which can only be conquered by using dice summing to the number on the tile, or in some cases by specific dice (doubles, straights). It is easier to capture contiguous territories, but you can take any territory on the board with only a small penalty. Unless specifically defended, it is normally no harder to capture a territory from another player than it is to take an unoccupied one, so conflict is implicitly encouraged.

Once occupied, hexes provide bonuses like extra dice, re-rolls, and two different kinds of resource points. Acquiring a certain amount of the rarer resource is a win condition. Spending both types of resource to acquire a sufficient quantity of technology cards (extra units, force fields to defend hexes, death rays to destroy hexes, etc.) is another.

It faces the obvious dice-game problem, that poor rolls at the wrong time are crippling, but if you don't like that then pick a different genre. The luck of the technology card draw is, perhaps, worse -- late in the game, players will usually be able to buy any of them that are available, so it hurts when your opponent gets first shot at something spectacular. 

The biggest problem is that the only catch-up mechanism is "pick on the leader". This obviously has potential to make the two-player game a frustrating exercise in an early advantage snowballing into an avalanche, so it is not recommended with that player count. With more players, the board is so small that conflict is guaranteed early and often, but that is no improvement. Resources are scarce, so recovering wrecked tokens is difficult; and the requirement of certain dice to attack makes it more likely that a player will be stuck attacking wherever they are able, rather than the leader.

The variant rule that allows explorers to move from the 7 tile to a mountain is a minor improvement.

It does make a nice contrast to, say, the placid multiplayer solitaire of The Castles of Burgundy, but unsatisfying experiences at every player count make me reluctant to try it ever again. Three players is probably the sweet spot, no AP allowed.

Attractive French artwork (if a little dark & broody). Steampunk backstory. The game is a race to acheive one of three victory conditions. A landscape where hexes bring benefits. Each turn you harvest one type of resource, roll dice to dictate your possibilities this turn, move pieces to claim/conquer spaces, claim artifacts or buy building/techology cards, then harvest the other resource type.

The degree of conflict reminds me a bit of Evo - and as the game progresses, you have to balance progressing your own path to victory against acting to prevent other players from getting ahead.

Initial (3-player) game was great fun. Second (4-player) game less so. So why the difference?

Partly it's the downtime, and the fact you can't really plan until the start of your turn: only then do you know how many dice/cubes you'll have for the turn, let alone what you might do with them.

Perhaps a bigger factor is that there are only so many cube-producing tiles in play. The cube economy is tighter with 4 (so its harder to acquire those cubes). At the same time, there's more competition with 4 players - more chance of your pieces being sent to the graveyard and there's then an even more pressing need for cubes to buy them back.

I don't think I'll ever play this with 4 again.

This is very overwhelming at first with tons of rules and a steep learning curve. It plays really well after you get into it, though.

Uncomfortably backstabby for such a game. Such viciousness has its place, but a Kingsburg-style dice game where you collect resources and turn them into points is not it.

Unnecessarily fiddly rules and anticlimactic victory conditions let this down.

This is a beautiful game, which makes it all the more disappointing. It felt limiting, even pointless. 

For example, I put a piece in a hex, wait a turn to receive the benefits, only to have it replaced easily by an opponent, sending my piece to a "graveyard"... so now, not only do I not have the benefit of that space, but I have to pay to get it back into my supply. How do I get enough resources to pay to recover my piece from the graveyard? Put a different piece in a hex and wait another round for the resources to pay out...oh, wait that piece just got killed too. Damn.

I'm going to share with you my patented strategy to lose this game. It also works with every direct conflict/race to do X game out there.

Step 1: Find a plan that could potentially satisfy the endgame victory conditions... but eliminate any plans that include subtlety or subterfuge as those are too clever by far for you.

Step 2: Implement your plan and make sure to make a big splash! Having picked the most obvious plan there is, you need to make sure to telegraph your intentions to all the other players. If you aren't drawing a big target on your back then you're not playing step 2 correctly. Bonus points in this step for placing next to, and attacking, the only known warmonger in your group.

Step 3: After having everyone else pile on you and completely destroy any chances of your original plan working, dither around for a bit, then go back to the original plan for lack of a better idea. We all know it won't work at this point, but you didn't really want to do well in this game anyway, did you?

Step 4: Watch as the player who wins the majority of games in your group, and who will win the current game, somehow mesmerizes all the other players into believing that he is doing horribly... phrases like "I don't even have a single resource" and "No! I have absolutely nothing to do on my turn!" and "All my dice rolls are horrible!" may be trotted out at this point.

The funny thing is that I like games like this. I just don't like playing them. And it's not the game's fault. It's that I'm absolutely horrible at games like this. I'm not good at coming up with new plans on the fly and this is a game where your plans can be completely disrupted by opponents moves.

I (almost always) hate playing games where I build something up and then my opponents get to destroy it. Additionally, when there is a game like this where things can change so much on a turn and there are a lot of options, I have problems figuring out what to do. It's not that I'm considering every option mind you, I'm just overwhelmed and suddenly I can't make heads or tails of anything. You really don't want to be playing a game with me where I have to keep changing plans during the game.

So despite the great artwork and clever ideas in the game, I'm just going to do badly in this game and not really enjoy playing it.

Very interesting dice management game with different victory ways and different strategy. A must try for those how like or love Stone Age, Kingsburg, King of Tokyo, Alien Frontier and other dice management games.

Provisional rating, one play (4p).  Not my kind of game, too negatively 'interactive', but I did quite enjoy it - possibly because I turtled, suffered very little, and won.

Love this game, very unique and you could say it is not a Euro game. Ameritrash I guess, because of the winning conditions. The game is unlike any other, okay you can see similarities from one aspect or twos from other games, but this game is in another level of different. If you like direct conflict, this might be in your alley.

Very well balanced. The luck of the dice can be bended if the right choices are made. Trying to go too fast will wipe the ground from under your feet. The easy to get victory is also difficult to hold. I can go on like this, it's just very well balanced, nice and fast. My kind of game!

It's a dice depended game, rolling badly the first rounds will make it VERY hard to catch up. The last rounds feel like you know who will win, but there's not always much you can do. 

I might play this again, but I will not request it myself

So much "take that" here. The game does not work unless you are aggressive in stealing. What makes it tolerable? First the pool of crystals controlled by the players is going to be increasing most turns which will cause an end to the game and prevent the never ending game issue. There are several different paths to follow, although I think the expansion improves on this substantially. Finally there is a tolerable to think about between turns at least with 3 players.

Great artwork.

Boring.  With three players, it only takes a few rounds to get 9 crystals if that is all you are doing.  Stealing one only slows it down a round.  Game is over before barely any of the technologies get into play.

RATING: 8
After first play it gets a 7, with hope it will prove better in the next few plays.

We played with 3 and neither of us have tried it before, and we tried a normal game. I had briefly read the rules beforehand, and we went through the rulebook together one more time.

But it did not help us avoid making stupid mistakes, mistakes that hindered gameplay and made the game seem less fun that it should be.

We fucked up in the mining fase, some failing to understand how the movement works (and failed to ask, but thats another topic :P) and we all failed to remember to change the first player until late into the game.

We also made mistakes in the quests, only removing the quest tracker in the next turn, so we ended up gimping us selves quite a bit.

But the game shows lots of promise regardless of the mistakes we made. I am looking forward to try it again, and eventually try the epic variant.

2nd play was much better. Upgraded to 8.

If you merge three excelent games in one that makes sense in a theme and work together, that would be awesome. These games are Yedo, Yinsh and Tzolk'in. You could replace Yedo with a worse game like Lords of Waterdep, the point of convergence are the quests. The influence of Yinsh is clear enough, the other influences are more subtle.

Forge War is a game where you collect resources at the mines moving the overseers in a puzzle like Yinsh. These resources combining with the market action serve for you to forge wepons for the adventures to complete some quests. The majority of quests don't end immediatly and keep growing on difficulty on the run, what makes you plan ahead and try to synchronize your actions, so you don't fail the quest.

The game is awesome, with a lot of things going on, I played the epic game in 2. In 3 or 4, this game may be more chaotic on the yinsh part. The art is good, could be better, a little lighter, mainly on the cards. The quality of the components are ok and there are some fiddly management with the adventures and wepons. But my biggest consern about component quality is that the adventure tokens seem fragile and could break with a feel uses.

Other than that, the game is very cool, a little bit too long, but this price is well paid for a great game design.

I love it.  The wife loves it (win!). Everyone I've played it with has thoroughly enjoyed it.  Takes more than one play to really get the tightness of resources so I recommend a few regular games before you tackle an epic.  The epic game is very satisfying.

Just awesome! The combination of euro style worker placement/gathering of resources and adventuring is matchless! Isaac is genius.

RATING: 10
Pretty heavy (both in game weight and physical weight) resource management and planning game. Instead of playing as the adventurers, you get to play the smith that outfits a group of adventurers. Resources and money can be extremely tight for the entire course of the game. Combining that with only being able to perform a single action each turn makes planning critical and every decision you make very important. Extremely cool game.

RATING: 3.5
This is the poster child for the cold soulless Euro. Yes there is good art. But nothing really lends to the theme. For starters to gather the resources you need to move forward you basically play a game of YINSH to get them. And you do this every round to gather the resources. Then you do worker placement to build what you need to accomplish quests. And by the way those worker placement choices are always obvious. And should you get shut out of what you really need you'll fall behind. Then to score points you must advance on quest cards that you buy. I'm sorry .. buying a quest? I get that you are playing the "manager" of the people going on the quest ( a concept that still sounds a bit off let's be honest) but buying a quest? But back to advancing on the quests. Do you fight the menacing creatures depicted on the quest cards? Nope. You just have to have the resources to advance when that step of the game comes around. Then you do it all over again. And again. And again. AND AGAIN!
This game is so boring. It took forever and that was on the short game. The art is good and the concept is ok ( I won't say unique because the concept of being the mastermind behind the shadows is already out there in Lords of Waterdeep) but the designer just made this game so complex and overwrought for no good reason. Maybe if the quests were done is a less boring way and you didn't start every round playing YINSH Forge War could have been something special. But as it stands it's nothing but rather, rinse, repeat only far more repetitive.

RATING: 5
TL/TD: Play a full game of Yinsh, and play a full game of Lords of Waterdeep in the time to play Forge War instead of getting bits and pieces of each. 

I want to like this much more than the rating I gave it.  It is a very ambitious design for a first time designer, but lacks polish/refinement and ultimately suffers from the "too many things mixed together" syndrome.

Major Issues: 

Why is there a mini-game of Yinsh built into the game?Don't get me wrong, I love Yinsh, but think it is completely out of place in this game. Yinsh is a 2 player abstract game, and there is a reason it isn't designed for 3 or 4 players.  Too many times during the game, would the 1st/2nd/3rd players take actions which completely messed up the 4th player or player 1 would take a greedy move which would allow player 2 to also reap a lot of benefits, but then player 3 and player 4 weren't in positions to get more than 1-2 resources.  IMHO, this doesn't belong here, because it has one of two (both undesirable outcomes): People play the mining phase too loosely, and it is then just chaos, or people play the mining phase with lots of AP which causes the game to bog down in the most non-interesting portion of the game.  

The game would have been better served two have two sets of worker placement: One to get resources, and one to take the market action.

Fiddle me this, fiddle me that.  Man, this game is super fiddly.  You assign adventurers and pay resources, but no where on the quest card, does it indicate how much weapon there is, so you have to reference the public area along with your own weapons to calculate and re-calculate the amount of strength you have.  Then you have extra tokens to indicate whether you have a spear/axe/bludgeoning weapon against a particular threat and then if you have a special weapon like the shield that gets more powerful as you progress, you need extra bits to track the extra strength.  

One additional fiddly point is the mining phase.  If you convert your own worker, you then need to check to see who has the least workers and gets the resources, but if there is a tie, then it goes to the person highest in the turn order.  Calculating who would benefit from the worker conversion every time honestly became a big pain.  

Positives:
The quest management with weapons is certainly the most interesting aspect of the game because it has a puzzly aspect and you have to figure out: Who do I send where/when/with what weapon and which quests can I handle? But as one other astute commenter noted "It's like playing Quest Manager" instead of actually going on the quests yourself.

Rating based on solo play only. Didn't KS this to play multi-player. No complaints when playing solo other than that to be handled without tweezers or fumbling the level and champion tokens in the adventurers are only 2/3 the size they need to be and the quest progress cubes need to be at least twice as big.

If you want to discover the gameplay, just check the rhado's video which is well done as every time.

What I love on this game is the theme which is very well done, even if the mining phase is a bit abstract.
Here you gather your ressources, buy new weapon scheme and hero, send the hero on quest...
The resolution of the quest can take some turn unlike on lords of waterdeep and you have to make a good use of your heros because you will not have more than 6-7 of them. When they finish a quest, they lvl up and you can send back them to a new quest.

Because of the theme, I will compare this game to Lords of waterdeep. For me the 2 are really 2 great games. Lords of waterdeep is lighter, easier to learn and faster to play where Forge war is more complex and necessarily take more time to learn and to play. If you think that the only problem of lords of waterdeep is a lack of depth, you will enjoy a lot this game.

I think it's the best eurogame that I have played since a while, I prefere that game rather than bruxelles 1893, concordia or t'zolkin...

RATING: 6.5
First Play: After much hype and a long wait, I was keen to get this on the table quickly with like minded players. Rahdo raved about the game play but my read through of the long rule book left me puzzled. An epic game wasn't immediately apparent. Perhaps it needed a play to reveal it's colours? 

The time needed to punch and bag the components was considerable and the multiple little bags for the wide range of tokens and chits suggested a fiddly game. Play confirmed this. It looks like play testing uncovered a number of instances where there was confusion over how to identify when (say) an adventurer entered a quest or what weapon they were carrying and the solution decided on was a mountain of chits. The gears to this engine are not streamlined. It is to be blunt overly fiddly.

Yes its a game that works, yes it seems balanced but if you want theme then you will probably be disappointed.  The mining element is tactical but makes no real sense thematically, its just an abstract game mechanic. Clearing the board and reforming the grid is necessary but lost continuity. The market phase and quests have all been seen before in different games but the three mechanics don't flow naturally together and for those prone to AP this game will bring the worst out in you. Yes is smells heavily of Waterdeep and I didn't really like that game.

After 1 hour of explanation and 3 hours of play we had completed two phases and we were happy to end at that. Personally I found it monotonous and a bit of a chore. 

Production is generally very good but why are the cards so paper thin? When the market cards are flipped the bend allows them to spin in the breeze. These need sleeves, and I hate card sleeves. 

The weight of the components does not translate to a clever nor cohesive game. I have no inclination to play again and its up for sale. Sold.

This is a fun game. Littlebit on the lighter side but would appeal to those that like dungeon petz and magewars. i like how there is a abstract part in the mine and how you forge weapons and comple quests. The normal game is a tutorial. The fast forward epic is my recommendation. The artwork is ugly but works. The theme is awsome. I would like to have an expansipn for this game to add more complex quests and weapons. And maybe another dimension to the game. In mageknight the monsters/quests have much more variation. The quests in forge wars have just 2 attributes (str and damagetype slash/piercing/blunt resistance). I would have loved if quests had elemental resistances like cold/fire/acid/lightning. Monsters could have abilities like damage reduction, healing, initiative much more. The battles in mageknight is much deeper in that regard.

Played normal game.  Mine portion was more complicated than it needed to be.  Would have been nice to have a number of workers tracker on the board.  Rest of the game was fine.

Kickstarted this one, so might be biased.

Early days, but now played Age I 3 times (2,3 and 4 player) and Age II twice (2 and 4 player) and full game once (2 player). Pretty good. Fast-forward option is a big bonus as you can start at Age II and either just play that or play II and III.

Money is really tight and/or resources are really tight - which makes the whole game rather thinky as you can't afford to screw up. That's a good side for me but I can see some people put off by the learning curve and need to plan so much.

For a heads down plan your stuff game there's quite a bit of interaction.

Overall like it. Only negatives are the hero and level markers, having to push them in and out my set is already a bit worn :( Would have preferred a mageknight type dial, but that would have been rather more expensive to produce!

Excellent, thematic worker placement game with an innovative resource-gathering mechanic. The importance of timing your "engine" reminded me a little of Tzolk'in, in that you have to plan several turns in advance in several different areas to time them just right. I'm not crazy about having only one action each turn, but the game works that way, and you can still accomplish a lot with such a limiting restriction.

Very unique euro-style game which mixes worker placement with RPG elements(leveling up adventurers and completing quests).
Tons of ways to play: Normal game, Epic game, Fast-forward variant, Solo play. 
Forge War has a mini-game inside the game which is the abstract style mine where we can get resources and the number of our workers there decide the turn order as well.
The full epic game is just pure awesomeness with 20 possible titles we can give to our adventurers when they reach the 4th level :)

I'm kinda in love with how the solo game alternates between an abstract puzzle and worker placement/resource management game. If you are good at the abstract puzzle, you get rewarded with more resources. It's actually similar to a gameplay element in Mansions of Madness that I was surprised I enjoy so much.
Still, this game is flawed and the gameplay eventually turns into project management more than anything else.

Very heavy euro style game ahead!

Our first play (Epic one of course) took us about 4h30...
But everyone enjoyed every last minute of it. No one even thought of quitting.

The mine phase is cool, the market (worker placement) is limited but feels satisfying and the quest management (yes, management only) is a wonderful resources management puzzle.

Resources are very scarce, particularly money, and it's very challenging to be able to fulfill quests with what you have at your disposal.

To be honest, I will probably never play another full Epic game, but looking forward to many short epic or advanced normal games (with fast forward variants)!!!

After 3 plays, this game is starting to feel like the whole is less than the sum of its parts. There are a few things I dislike:

* It's fiddly. There's a lot of setup and there are a whole bunch of frequently-moving little pieces and cards.
* It's very prone to analysis paralysis. To do well you need to plan a few turns ahead so you can successfully complete the quests you acquire. This is made extra difficult by the fact that you can't tell at a glance how much weapon strength you've applied to a quest - the weapon assigned to each adventurer is represented by the resources it costs, which you then have to map back to a weapon blueprint to look up the strength. Do that for 4 adventurers, tally it all up, then figure out what additional strength you need, which weapons to buy, what resources they'll take, whether you have an adventurer that can wield the weapon...then try to determine which moves you'll have to make in the mine to collect those resources next turn...then see a market card which could affect your decision...then try to remember why you were calculating all this in the first place...
* Component quality is poor. The chits are fine and the gems are great, but none of the cards, player mats, or board has linen finish and they are easy to accidentally mark/crease in the course of play.

Our first game in "epic" mode (third game overall) took us (two players) 3.5-4 hours to complete. I'd compare the setup/fiddliness/length/brain-burn with Mage Knight. Unfortunately, in that arena, I'd choose Mage Knight over Forge War literally ten times out of ten.

All that said, there are clever things - the mine overseer/worker movement seems like it could almost be a mini-game in itself; I like the _concept_ of weapon blueprints, equipping adventurers, and questing; there's a decent amount of player interaction; despite all the complaints the games we've played have been fairly tight with no big runaway leader.

The game would be improved by having a better way to track adventurer weapons and finding a way to reduce the amount of future-thinking analysis paralysis required.

Economic engine game that takes quite a long time to play. Some innovative mechanisms give this worthiness; the mine phase with overseers and workers is one such, and is really important for gathering the materials you'll need to forge weapons. Get outplayed in that mini-game and your final score will be hurting. But as this game takes quite a LONG time, I don't find the payoff to be as worthwhile at the end as shorter (and somewhat simpler) games like Lords of Waterdeep or Kingsburg. Also, the worker placement in this game is not as interesting as it's very limited -- one placement each round. Still, a good game, but not a great one.

Forge War is a great game.
The theme is well integrated into the game play.  There are thematic reasons for everything you do in the game.  All of the actions build toward the victory point scoring.
There are good decisions to make & you have to be careful that some tempting choices are not going to be made obsolete in the very near future.
Very tight design.  Played very well with two.  Looking forward to trying solo.
Looking forward to the next title by this designer.

Ugh. Played the full game once. 
So many things that detract from the gaming experience going on here. First, the mining is a mini-game of multiplayer Yinsh that feels so disjointed from the rest of the game, which seems to present a stronger theme.

It seemed to me that there's a lot of fiddliness and complexity that shouldn't be there. It needed more developing. Too many resources (six) to collect for creating different types of weapons to use on adventurers of different levels to send on adventures of different difficulty (with different rewards) all requiring some specific type (or none) of weapon. 

In order to do well, the game requires players to 1) be good at spatial Yinsh-like abstracts (to collect resources) 2) be good at planning ahead and predicting what your opponents will do. With 2), it's like the regular customers in At the Gates of Loyang, but without the guaranteed income from your farms and with having to contribute an increasing number of vegetables to the customer each turn. While I enjoy games that require heavy analysis, this one was too easy to make a mistake in one's calculations. It would frustrate a player, but on the other hand, frustrate other players if you're taking slow turns to plan everything out in order to prevent such a mistake.  

It has excessive fiddliness with the six types of ore/gems to collect, a tableau for each player consisting of cards as well as a row of public weapons. In addition, you're constantly managing which adventurers are going on which adventure for that turn, checking to see if they have the right level to wield that weapon, making sure you have the required weapon type(s) for that adventure, and making sure you have enough strength to advance on that adventure while also planning perhaps other simultaneous adventures and considering how you will increase the strength on each one in the future. Whew! (breathe) On top of that, there are 20 abilities from which to choose when an adventurer reaches Level 4, each with a corresponding tiny counter. Sounds exciting, huh? And there's 18(?) rounds of this!

I was so bewildered that I couldn't even appreciate what thematic elements were there. I rarely read the title of the adventures, and even what I saw had rewards that had little to do with any thematic reasoning.

Forge War? The title makes it sound like a combat-oriented game, and while that probably sells more copies, it is highly misleading. Another commenter said it best in describing it as Human Resource management. Deciding who goes on what mission and what they will bring. 

You may likely get a better gaming experience by playing a couple games of Yinsh and a couple games of Lords of Waterdeep in the time it took to complete this game.

Great game where you are gathering resources and sending adventurers on quests. Love the progression in this one. We end up playing the mine portion of the game a bit more cooperatively because if you block each other, you both get less resources and get to send out fewer adventurers and that is no fun.

Rating based on intro game.  It was fun, but nothing too special about it.   It was a little fiddly when it came to assigning weapons to adventurers and assigning the adventurers to quests.  Very confusing on which adventurer used which weapon.  Seems to missing some development here. I imagine some of the actions (such as taking cards) is a lot better in the longer game.  I don't think I'd seek this game out to play, but would be willing to play it again if suggested.  Need to try out the full game in the hope it will be better.

I backed this on KS.

Forge War is an okay game.  I have yet to play the epic game, but outside of the few differences and extended game length, I can't imagine it being that much more enjoyable than the basic game.  Sure, more resources, different stack of quests, but essentially the same thing over and over again with little variety other than the card draw.

Either way, our first play was completely wrong and admittedly, it left a sour taste in my mouth.  After corrected plays, the game is an enjoyable, tightly-wound resource-management game.  While I would have liked the theme to pop more with what players are doing, in the end, it is little more than another VP race.  In the right mood, this game will scratch that itch, and while the components wonderfully complement the mechanics, it's a bit overwrought.

The crux of the game is the limit of what you can accomplish on each turn and every player will be straining to just survive the next leg of the quest.  It's great at times and shines when you're really trying to optimize your turn.  At the same time, optimization exercises rarely do it for me and without a true competitive edge to it, optimization loses its grasp.

Worth playing, but perhaps not worth putting on your shelf.

A pretty good Euro. In fact, it's probably my top Euro, especially when playing full-mode.

However, it is heavy, and rarely sees the table due to its length, so I am parting with it.

The standard game ends to soon, rating is for the epic game, which shines.  The game makes you think several turns ahead.  It has the feel of an economic game and there is enough player interaction to keep it interesting, without being totally vicious.  Components are generally pretty nice, but the player boards tend to warp and the cards are fair quality only, so it's not perfect.

After playing this again, with more rules corrections, I have to say it seems a lot worse. I like some aspects of it, but I don't think I'll be able to bring myself to play it again. This game is much longer than advertised. Variable turn order, the nit-picky-ness of the mining and the mathy nature of the missions make it hard to plan your actions. 

More about quest management than war. But that makes it better for me. The player interaction was fairly haphazard. The components were pretty good. I did have an issue of the double sided level tokens on double sided adventurers, after picking one up I was unable to figure out what level it was supposed to be. But they still are pretty nice.

The mining seemed fairly random, very hard to predict and in that way a bit luck based that other people happened to move in such a way as to make your moves better. It worked, but I was not a big fan of it. The worst part was how start player was determined. Everyone cited that 1st and 4th pretty much just kept changing hands, and if you were 2nd or 3rd, you kinda just got stuck there. Since 1st was a big advantage, this seems like a horrible balance. Clearing the board between waves super sucked to, because having miners on the board is necessary to keep gaining more than one resource, and clearing them sets everyone back to the stone age. I'm not sure there is a work around because you have to change up the board, so it does need to be cleared.

The market phase was the big let down. Money was super tight, and I would have preferred more actions each turn in the market, as all of the market actions had appeal. A 2nd action for each player might make it a bit more competitive, as it was, no one seemed really locked out of what they wanted to do.

The quest phase was interesting, and I would have liked to like it, but again, no interaction. It pretty much boiled down to making sure I had enough adventurers so I could get a new quest each turn. I'm sure it's a bit better then that.

RATING: 9
Truly an awesome and epic fantasy-themed euro-game, which as such hits a huge "double sweet-spot" for me.  And the theme shines through most brightly, which is truly the "icing on the cake."  Plus, on top of all that, it is readily played solitaire, although it sure looks like it'll be difficult to get a win playing its "epic" version -- but then that's not really a bad thing.  So I'll approach each game looking to see how far I can get in terms of rounds successfully completed and Prestige Points attained, and thus be able to gauge my progress and improve my skills in this manner.

This is definitely one of the best fantasy-themed euros I've ever played -- right up there with Simurgh, and maybe even a bit better.  Time will tell.

Tentative rating after 5 plays & 2 wins. As a non euro gamer, feels really different from my usual gaming experience. Tight resources management, streamlined mechanics, looks good. Then of course theme is not so existent, feels more like a puzzle experience right now so let's see after few more plays (& at least 1 or 2 epic games) whether this will give me enough fun & pleasure to carry on but it might just do that...

Kifejezetten jól sikerült "kis" játék. Az absztrakt erőforrásszerző résszel szerintem nincs semmi baj, sőt kifejezetten különlegesség teszi a játékot. Engem sose zavart, ha van egy-egy jól működő absztrakt mechanika egy játékba, ha közben más frontokon tudja hozni a témát. Itt is így van, a téma többi részen nagyon jól átjön. Kalandozókat küldünk küldetésekre, akiket fel kell szerelnünk fegyverekkel, amit azonban el is kell készíteni, amihez tervrajzra és alapanyagokra is szükség lesz. Érdekes, hogy itt maguk a kalandozók nem kapnak sok szerepet, helyettük a fegyverek dominálnak. Nagyon jól sikerült azt is elérni, hogy ne legyen unalmas erőforrásmenedzselés a játék, hasonlóan a yedohoz vagy a waterdeephez. Ebben egyrészt a fen említett absztakt erőforrásszerzés segít, másrészt az, hogy a küldetésekben itt van egy.két csavar ahhoz képest, mint hogy szerezz két kéket, három sárgát ahhoz, hogy kapj 10 pénzt és 8 pontot. Egyedül a játékidőt tartom kérdésesnek. A normal talán túl rövid, nem bontakozik ki eléggé, az epic meg vállalhatatlanul hosszúnak tűnik. Persze van még valami gyorsított normál is, lehet hogy azt kéne legközelebb kipróbálni. :)

Played first time with normal two player game. This is only good to get used to the mechanics. Normal starting cards are too powerless, leading to boring first rounds. And they are luck based. If you don't have starting cards with more gold, you are in a big disadvantage.

Playing next time the epic game with fast forward starting cards. Doing house rules. We take two starting cards per player and every player chooses one of them. This starting cards will be given to all players. So everyone have the same to prevent this lucky element. Looking haw that works.

Played a second time, 2-player, fast-forward short epic game. Game works still fine, i like it a lot. BUT: It is way too long. We played about 3 hours excluding teaching time. (Yes, we do quest progression simultatneous). Material is very fiddly, the mini quest trackers are flying around, the heroes levels and the weapon tracking is extrem fiddly as well. Cards are bad material and setup time is very long. So i do have to rate down the game to 6 points from initial 7.6. Unsure if i want to play it again.

RATING: 9
A wonderful mish-mash of euro-inspired mechanics with a well-developed fantasy theme. I love this game despite being put off by most cube pushers, and it is owed to the excellent graphic design, well-thought-out ruleset, and deep, brain-burning game play. By the end of an epic game I am thoroughly and satisfactorily spent. Only complaints stem from some fairly minor component issues regarding the thin card stock and the silly way in which you force tokens into little holes in your adventurer tiles. Solo play is awesome!

Fiddly.

Cheap Chinese components and relatively poor design/usability don't help.

Theme is relatively pasted on; would have worked way better for me with a more appropriate theme.

Some nuggets of good ideas and gameplay obfuscated through first-time-designer- and Kickstarter-lack-of-development-itis.

Does not give me a warm fuzzy about Gloomhaven.

Forge War has a neat theme but somewhat fell flat for me. With the interesting theme aside (mining for minerals to build better weapons to arm your adventures to fight THE MONSTERS!) everything just felt mechanical and derivative. I'm okay with designers rehashing the "get resources and trade for better resources to buy nicer things for victory points" Euro standard, but unless there's one excellent quirk to shake up the standard, it's hard to get a passing grade these days. I like how the abstract-like mining phase feels like a separate game to the "resources for VPs" engine of buying and battling. Beyond that, it really feels like time-honoured mechanics have been taken and dressed up with a new theme. Nothing feels truly or even partly innovative here.  But, if you are not looking for anything innovative but rather a good theme and a re-hash of well-loved mechanics, then Forge War is worth checking out. The game is quite playable and straightforward. It just might not knock you out of your seat.  Oh, and a minus point for terrible quality control on the components and rulebook.  Especially the rulebook that is written to make the game sound SO much more complicated than it actually is, but ESPECIALLY the components: the cards in particular suffer from bleeding and smudging issues.  Shouldn't have made it out the factory door that way!

We played the 'normal' game (as opposed to Epic).  I can't even imagine playing Epic. This should NOT be a 3-4 hour game!

2014 - 2015 : 2 to 4 player (stretch goal of solo play on kickstarter)

In Forge War, players will take on the role of blacksmiths in a kingdom rife with marauding harpies, cursed dungeons and fire-breathing dragons. They are charged with gathering ore from the mines, purchasing weapon designs from the market and then using these resources to forge weapons for adventurers who will go on quests to fight back the ever-deepening darkness. If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.

RATING: 7.8
Has a resource gathering mini-game and a quest taking phase.  Needs 3+ players (or some sort of house rule for 2 players) as, to get enough resources, you need more pieces on the board.  Reminds me of Feast for Odin in that there's a random puzzle component in your quest gathering.  There's a short mode and a long mode.  The short mode is too short, you can't get enough done and you miss a lot of the content.  The long mode takes 3-4 hours and is where the game shines.  This is very thematic Euro which feels like you're training warriors and sending them on quests.  It's a great theme, mechanism, art, text on the cards is amusing and it just feels adventurous and fun.

EPIC Edition (early bird) backed on Kickstarter

--
Received March 18th, 2015. Slight scratch on the Epic game side of the Yellow player board, but not a huge problem. Also a bit of a printing issue on the back of one Level III Quest card, just a tiny strip of white showing which will make the card easy to identify, but still not something I'm going to complain to Isaac about.

I am very pleased with the quality of the components and I am very much looking forward to bringing this to board game night and playing several games. Already planning on bringing this to International Tabletop day too!

--
After playing a full 4 player Normal game last night, I can easily rate this game a 10. It took a little longer than an hour (probably closer to 2 all-told) as there were a few distractions and one player was having a bit of AP when it came to the Mine.

Overall, however, this game is incredibly fun and one that I would play on a weekly, if not daily basis given the opportunity. The game doesn't ever seem slow, nor does it overstay its welcome due to the 3 phases of each round, and although there are 3 considerably different phases with their own rules to follow, the rules were surprisingly easy to explain. Scores at the end of the game were all relatively close and each player in the game approached it from a different angle (one went heavy into Market action cards to build an engine, another went heavily toward acquiring weapon designs, I focused more on quests and levelling up my heroes, etc...), giving *tons* of replayability. I can not wait to play again.

After one solo play and one two-player game (both of the short variety), I enjoy the mechanics, although the mining phase does feel very out of place, as some other reviewers have stated.  It doesn't really make much thematic sense.  I do enjoy having to build up your engine to complete the quests as they get harder.

Production quality is quite low -- art is pretty weird and some design mistakes. But the game play is awesome and that's what will bring it back to the table.

Game is a bit too long though and each stage plays identically to the previous play. Would have loved only a 1 stage game with a large variety of quests/blacksmith plans.

If I had to guess, I would say it's a kickstarter and you know what? It was kickstarted!

Seriously, it just feels like the typical kickstarter game. Parts of the game feel awkward and it doesn't feel polished. Now, the game works and it has some nice concepts and ideas, but as most of the time with kickstarter games, that's all it does and that's not enough.

And yeah, putting a game of Yinsh into it as the mining part is not only crude, but a complete disconnect from the rest, which just doesn't fit at all.

Opinió després de videoresenya:
Temàticament representem una especie de "lords" que tenen herois i els envien a fer certes missions, a la vegada que forjem armes per equiparlos. Eurogame típic amb tres fases ben diferenciades: una primera de recol·lecció de recursos on hi ha implementada una mecánica similar a les dames, un altre de col·locació de treballador (un sol treballador) on s'obtenen cartes i altres beneficis, i una tercera de resolució de missions que és el que dona punts (a aquestes missions s'han d'assignar recursos). Similar al Lords of Waterdeep, tot i que la part de col·locació de treballadors és molt més simple (només col·loques un, no apareixen més llocs on poder col·locar, etc...) i s'ha substituit per el minijoc de les dames. El mecanisme de resolució de missions és molt millor, normalment les missions necesiten més d'un torn per completarse, has d'assignar herois (en tens 3 al principi del joc) i equiparlos, etc...

La temática està molt enganxada, i el minijoc de les dames no té cap sentit en la temàtica i no m'atrau en absolut. Després de veure els primers torns jugats a la videoressenya em sembla que es pot fer repetitiu i no aporta res nou...

I liked the quest system and the mini-abstract game related to the resource gathering.  The resources and money are always tight.  The gameplay feels repetitive as you make the same kind of decision/actions in the first turn as in the last (gather resources, forge weapon).  This is fine for 1-hour game but I need more variety if the game is going to take 2 or more hours to play.

I've enjoyed this so far.  It's a little bit fiddly (in terms of moving cubes around) but each turn is quite straightforward, though not simple.  I work backwards from my quest objective - what do I want to achieve in the quest phase?  So what will I use my single market action on?  And to help me do that what do I want from the mine?  Trying to optimise each of these stages while hurting the other players strikes the right balance of interaction/solitaire.

Errata for Commanding: "When this champion is applied to a quest, 1 additional weapon power is added to his weapon for each other adventurer currently applied to the quest.""

Fairly typical of Kickstarter-provided material: lots of cool bits, not enough gameplay. OK, we did get a rule wrong initially, but this game is simply overwrought, there are too many commodities and general fiddle factor for what's really a simple game of building weapons to go on quests. It's far too long (reckon 3 hours first time you play if you're going to play all 3 ages) and too repetitive to sustain interest for that much time. Lords of Waterdeep is better, being shorter and better focussed.

The latter two-thirds of a game round are interesting, but the first third is this weird abstract, quasi-resource-gathering game that's completely out of character with the rest of it.

Solo game is difficult to wrap my head around but it is the only way I have played. Several timing aspects are unclear, making it harder to judge whether I can actually complete the quests that I accept before the final rounds end.

It seems like you can't actually do much here. Money is very tight and one action a turn is very little.

I'd be open to but there are so many other games out there to play that I'm not going looking to try this one again.

Part of this is an abstract game on a hex playing area used to generate resources. The abstract game is not that difficult, but adds a fun component. Then go to market to buy various abilities, actions, or weapons blue prints. After that buy adventures. Then make the weapons for your adventurers to complete the quests. This is well themed and a very fun game.

Play this 2 player with my wife and we both enjoy it alot. It can be daunting at first with all the components and the rulebook, but the game is really a snap once you get it down. 

The mining part of the game actually works well, though I can see how some think it takes something away from the game. For us, it works fine and we both liked it's addition. The worker placement is interesting as you only get one worker to place which is pretty different than many other games and does take a little getting used too. The quests themselves are well done (which there was some other way to keep track of adventurers powers though than plopping the resources down on them).

I suggest going right into the epic game as the standard game was far to short. Overall it's a game that's a keeper and one my wife was really surprised she liked as much as she did (she was actually against getting it as she was afraid it was to heavy for her). Really need the time to devote to playing otherwise would rate higher.

Okay, so maybe this is the heaviest game on my list. Watched Rahdo do a runthrough with a prototype expansion and it may be too heavy for me at my stage in the hobby. Will look at it in the far distant future (after Panamax and Shipyard).

First Impression:

I wasn't buying in after the rules explanation but found myself interested as the game continued.  The base game provides a good base from which to learn, but I think I might prefer the longer game.  The resource acquisition mechanic is quite interesting and a bit different.

Positive points for this game because it was easy to explain. The negatives outweigh the positive though. It was much too long for what it was in that the questing felt extremely repetitive (and we only played the short game). We were bored, and felt the weapons lacked theme.

UNIQUE: the Yinsh-like resource collection.

NEGATIVES: the normal game feels a bit truncated despite taking a while. I can only imagine that the Epic game will be far too long.

Fun game with lots of flavor.  It is cool to be in the story, but not actually be the heroes -- you play as the blacksmith who is supplying the heroes with gear!

Great deep strategy game well balanced and very playable. So far we've felt like the 'best' way to win hasn't been found since there are so many variables in play. Rules are a bit muddled in places but the only 'flaw' we feel in the game is that once you're last it's really difficult to move up in the turn order.

A unique game with an interesting mix of mechanics. I really enjoyed this game, and the more I play it the more I like it. I think it is overly complex in certain ways, but everything is clear once you've played two or three times. The epic game mode is long, but is definitely superior to the short game. There is much more time to develop a strategy, and there's a lot more sense of accomplishment when you execute your plans.

Game ổn, gần giống như merge Champion of Midgard với Lord of Waterdeep lại, thêm 1 tý xíu của Vilticulture, nâng cao độ khó lên. Điểm độc đáo khác biệt duy nhất của game nằm ở phần đào mỏ. Nó làm thành một bàn cờ thu nhỏ, tách biệt hoàn toàn với phần còn lại của Game.

Game chơi khá phiền, vì có quá nhiều rắc rối với việc design kém phần component kết hợp với nhau như thế nào. Có lẽ chơi vài lần sẽ hết nhưng với lần đầu tiên chơi thì việc kiểm soát quest step hay là weapon và lv của adventure khá củ chuối và phiền phức.

Game chơi tốt ở vài vòng đầu, nhưng càng chơi về sau thì khả năng nhàm chán sẽ càng tăng cao. Vì game chơi lâu (3-4h) mà những việc phải làm mỗi lượt thì lại lặp đi lặp lại, khả năng cao là càng về sau càng giống như chơi game đếm số + - 

Với một game mà điểm cần nhấn để thu hút người chơi là thematic như game này thì việc thiết kế kém comp và gameplay đơn điệu nó vô hình làm giảm tính thematic của game đi. Đồ họa lại củ chuối và cũng đơn điệu ko khác gì gameplay cũng là một điểm trừ lớn.

Tạm thời đó là những đánh giá qua 2 lần chơi normal game.

A good, solid Euro game, but suffers from a lot of the same problems that other Kickstarter Euros have. The turn structure is very rigid, and even though you're given a lot of choices, it's almost more of an illusion in the grand scheme of things. There is also an overabundance of resources to be had here, which is probably less of an issue with the epic game, but I don't know that I'd ever want to attempt that. This game's complexity is that of a game that shouldn't go on for more than an hour or so, and I feel like the basic game clocks in right around that time frame once you know what you're doing. Any longer than that, and I feel like it would become very repetitive. The quest fulfillment is fun, and the mining mini-game is pretty interesting. I just wish that there was a little more room for creative play.

Richard Ham has done it again, he has convinced me that this is a game that I want and would highly enjoy. The premise sounds a lot like Lords of Waterdeep, but is has a much more involved resource management element and multi-level quests with heroes that level up and stay with you throughout the game. These factors combine to give a very different playing experience, and perhaps a better one?

Looks great. Takes up a lot of table space.

Still deciding on which variant I like the best (normal, epic, advanced or short epic)

One thing though, the epic game with 4 players is going to take 4 hours. That's a bit much for this type of game.

Likely, I will stick to the short epic and the advanced game.

The fast-forward rules do make for a LONG setup time however.

Zwar nur die Onlineversion gespielt, aber das macht definitiv Lust auf mehr. Der Mechanismus, sich zu überlegen, ob man seinen Aufseher zweimal bewegt oder stattdessen Startspieler sein möchte, ist raffiniert. Auch die anderen Spielmechanismen (Quests erfüllen mit passenden Wafengattungen und Rohstoffe abbauen, um die eigenen Helden mit neuen Waffen ausstatten zu können sowie Erfahrungslevels für die Helden) überzeugen absolut.
Alles in allem eine sehr gelungene Mischung aus Rollenspiel und Brettspiel. Hat das Zeug zum Dauerbrenner! Leider hat die Onlineversion einen kleinen Bug beim Aufseher-Zug und die Karten sind am Bildschirm sehr schlecht erkennbar. Aber das ist nicht wirklich dramatisch, da die Onlineversion ja nicht zum ernsthaften Betrieb gedacht ist, sondern nur zum Spiel kennenlernen.

5 plays so far ... 

Played the Epic game right out of the box - learning curve didn't seem much steeper than the short version so figured what the heck - quite a long game, even for just 2 players - this game can really induce the AP!  Don't pull this out with new players and expect to play the Epic game in one sitting, unless everyone is committed to a really long, several hour long game.  And honestly, I don't feel its worth that time investment.   It takes too long to play the full game and the payback for that investment just isn't there.  Best to stick with the fast-forward variant and make for a shorter game. 

The obviously likeable things are the weapon designs, upgrades to your characters and the Quest Management.  So the theme sucks you in ...  but then you get to the strange Mine Phase (an abstract puzzler) and the Market Phase (with seemingly few options and no engine to create).

 So, at first, the Mine Phase felt jarringly out of place and I didn't understand at all how the market cards could help you create an engine or why they were worth buying - plus, resources and money are incredibly tight in this game - at first - now I have a better grip on  how important the market cards are to actually doing well and yes, they even create a bit of an engine.  Now I feel like I have tough decisions in the Market Phase, instead of what appeared to be obvious decisions at first!

The Mine Phase is and always will be an abstract puzzler - along the lines of Othello, Yinsh and Hey, That's My Fish!  I really hate those games because I am terrible at them and my brain just doesn't want to work that hard.  But I'm getting better at it.  I just hate losing because I suck so badly in the Mine and end up getting too few resources to create weapons.  The Mine Phase is critical to winning.  I guess this is a personal challenge of mine that I plan on facing up to.

Solitaire - on one hand, this is a great solitaire game because there is lots of pressure and one false step will cause you to lose.  Unlike a lot of other solo games, this one doesn't rely on luck/random chance very much.  It is very much an exercise in math, resource management and there is a strange abstract puzzle (the mining phase) on top of it.  Wasn't my cup of tea at first but really enjoy it now.

On the other hand, I prefer multiplayer, because the Mine Phase is just a mathy puzzle that can be solved without that chaos of player interaction.

"Heavier euro that combines an abstract mini-game with fantasy-themed recipe completion. I've only played the basic game, which took an hour and a half, but felt like it ended just as things were getting rolling. I suspect the "advanced normal" game would be best for me (fast-forward but still only 7 rounds)."

What I like:
- The fantasy theme works fine
- Having basic (short) and more advanced modes
- The randomized starting positions are cool
- No pvp attacks (although there are occasional denial moves)
- The whole economy is quite tight
- Box is not huge

What I don't like:
- The abstract mini-game to get resources is really un-fun for me
- The rules for heroes, weapons, and quests all seem needlessly complicated
- The end-game bonus spots in the basic game seem oddly tacked on
- The coin chits are too small, and don't match the colors on the board

This game requires you to go through several steps to actually accomplish anything, which could be frustrating for some. I would like to be able to play with the advanced weapons, but that seems like the game would be too long (the basic game is already long enough), so it would be cool to be able to start off with more heroes and weapons.

What's up with the market?  The cards seem to be way too expensive for the amount of money you'll acquire.

What's up with the length?  It's long.  It didn't feel rewarding to play the long game.. The engine (which would include the few cards from the market (see complaint 1) that you acquire and the abilities from your high leveled adventurers) doesn't really exist and doesn't seem to justify the length of the game.

I did like the "mining".  The hey that's my fish mechanism was kinda cool... but thematically a little weak.

"'Ere, Bill, I 'eard that the Grey Lemons let yer keep a couple o' pieces o' mithril an' might even make yer a sword for an 'alf day's work. Fish King come round 'ere we're gonna need one. Le'ss gerrouta here. Purple Doorknob crew ain't ever given us nuffin' but whippin's an' copper shards."

So, in this game the land is under threat by many many bizarre creatures - The Fish King, Crystal Beings, Giant Grumplesomethings, etc. Essentially each player controls a guild that gets workers to mine them minerals in order for them to make weapons and kit out adventurers to complete quests. The game is often compared to Lords of Waterdeep, but is substantially more mentally taxing and has very different gameplay.

The similarities lie in the guildmasters sending adventurers on quests and that both games have worker placement. HOWEVER, Forge War has very minimal worker placement and adds an interesting time mechanic to the completion of quests, as well as adding its own sort of mini-game for resource production and making generating weapons just as important, if not more so, as adventurers.

The basic flow is players harvest minerals in the mine using a strange sort of "I move my piece and flip over other pieces and get stuff for everything that becomes mine, but other players get stuff for anything that was already mine in the first place" (that is probably possible to do incredibly clever things with if your brain wasn't already exploding from the main game stuff). Then players will get to take cards giving them new weapons, or resources, or enhancing their trading abilities, or hire new adventurers/upgrade existing ones. Finally players pick up new quests and assign adventurers to them, BUT adventurers alone are useless, they need weapons to do anything. The twist is that the quest isn't completed instantly, instead it has stages that get harder and require more adventurers to continue as the game progresses. If you satisfy the increasingly painfully demanding requirements of the quest then you get shiny new rewards to then send your adventurers on new horrendously arduous quests that are as equally easy to completely screw up your management of and fail :D

This game is amazing, but is essentially a fairly heavy euro with fantastic theming and a slightly bizarrely disconnected abstract puzzle running alongside that is important to pay some attention to during the game. The disconnect between these two things makes it a challenge to use the resource generation to its full potential but also means that your abilities will likely grow the more you replay it and the resource generation may become less of a "Where the f$*% do I move these guys and what am I doing?" to more anticipation of player's moves and maximising of resources to play more efficiently in the construction of weapons and other shizz.

TL;DR it's awesome and makes your brain hurt and you will get used to repeatedly saying "Well I ballsed that up" or similar, but will hopefully enjoy and even be entertained by your own incompetence nonetheless.

This is a nice idea for a game with a few interesting things going on, but ultimately it seems like it wasn't completely thought out. The general idea is that you play sort of James Bond's "Q" to a roster of unnamed misc hero types. You have to buy quests for them to go on, build their weapons for them, and then build more weapons for them as they manage to lose the weapons they had after each adventure. You do this by playing 'hey that's my fish' in a cleverly designed mining area of the board. To begin with, the graphic design in this game is really award. The quest cards are hard to read, the adventurer tokens and the way you track their equipment and development seem poorly thought out, the quest tracking cubes are the smallest board game component I've ever seen in a game, and I own a number of splotter games. The progress of the round takes you from the top right corner of the board to the lower right to the lower left to the top left. The game is also, clearly too long for the level of interesting things you do on your turn. I don't have a problem with long games, one of my favorite games is the original civilization. For a game to be long, it needs to feel satisfying, like you are really building something, and this game I didn't have enough to think about, especially between turns. Clearly the designer got some feedback about this, but rather than fix the problem he band-aided it with alternate modes. You can play the full game of 18 rounds that's way too long, or you can just play the first 6 rounds which is way too short, or you can play the fast forward mode, which shortcuts out the first 6 rounds, so you just play the last 12. It feels like a chaotic mess. I really think if this game had another year in development it would have been something special, as I love the method of resource gathering, and I like the idea of the game.

Eagerly Kickstarted this one.

Got in one play with Kristen, she... well, she hated it. She didn't get the "point" of the game and no amount of explanation on my part helped. But hey, some games aren't meant to be loved by everyone :)

If I ever do get to play this one again I look forward to exploring this game space. It intrigues me greatly.

Re-learning the game due to interest in the group to table it. Plays very nicely solo, want to try an 'epic' game, but the thought of starting one is extremely intimidating.

Played it again with Kristen too, she still hates it.

Played a four player with the group. Everyone liked it, high interest in trying an epic game. Have to clear a whole night for that.

The epic version of this game is really, really interesting and really, really difficult. I felt like I was using every ounce of my mental ability just to hang on during the final stage and I lost three rounds in. Excellent, excellent mental exercise.

This may seem like a typical thematic game, masquerading as a euro under some shallow cube-pusher mechanics, but there's a lot more to Forge War than meets the eye. Surprisingly deep (and heavy). If you play the full game, you'll spend three long unforgiving eras mining for resources, forging weapons, and completing quests. The neat thing about the theme here is you're actually playing the part of the weapon smith rather than the adventurers, so this is much more about resource management than typical monster bashing.

For your first game, I recommmend playing only the first era, then immediately starting the game over and playing the advanced fast forward version. You don't really need to play all three eras to get the full experience, but you should really play a tutorial era before diving into the full 3-4 hour game.

Pros:
- Lots of different gameplay mechanics
- Lots of different things to do
- Strategy everywhere
- Quality components
- Multiple variants to play keeps it interesting and time flexible
- Not a lot of down time.  The game is broken up into phases which shortens wait times.

Cons:
- The short game ends kind of abruptly in my opinion. I felt like 'wait, we're done?!'  And sometimes the short game doesn't really fit well with some of the quests available for purchase.  Also, I didn't feel like I got very far into the depth of the leveling and stuff wit the short game. Though, that is a good thing too because it encourages me to play the longer version occasionally.
- LONG setup and tear down.  There are a lot of components to this game.  I like having lots of components, but it is important to factor in set up and tear down time when etching out a time to play this.

Preliminary rating (something I have never done before, even for a kickstarted) based on playing the online version of the basic game. I had not the chance to play the extended game.

The theme is a lot like Lords of Waterdeep, but the execution is waaaay better. The questing is the crown of the game. Quests have multiple steps you have to accomplish and take several rounds to complete. To get all the resources that are needed for the quests, you have to go to the mines. In between the mines and the quests, you can go to the market to trade for resources, knowledge to forge more powerful weapons, trade skills, etc.

The beauty of this game is, that the three steps are distinctively different from each other, but work together beautifully.

I really like the fact, that the game has a short and a regular version. The short version takes 60 minutes (I can confirm that), the regular version is said to take 180 minutes to play. The short version is good and I hope that the regular version will be interesting as well and not overstay it's welcome.

RATING: 4
Only played once: the two player "short" variant that took forever. 

The mining phase felt disjointed from the rest of the game and, as noted by others, completely divorced from any theme. Why do my overseers need to jump over my opponent's workers? Why do I get an advantage when my workers go on strike? Felt arbitrary and puzzling to me. To top it off resources are as scarce as hen's teeth (at least in the two player game where it is easy to deny your opponent opportunities for multiple resources).

Given the scarcity of resources I felt extremely limited in my choices during the market phase. If I was lucky I had a choice between two things, but usually I was lucky if I could buy even a single item. Given how small my decision tree usually was, it really felt like the game was playing me rather than the other way around.

The quest phase dictates what one does in the mining and market phase, but other than that felt repetitive and unexciting.

Played the intro game with 4P. Forge War is a Euro with an RPG setting, and resembles a more ambitious version of [thing=110327][/thing] in terms of thematic scope. Players are blacksmiths, and will oversee the mining of resources, crafting of weapons and delegation of heroes to quests. 

The main point of interest for me is the questing mechanism, which has the same forward planning element as that of satisfying regular customers in [thing=39683][/thing]. Players have to plan ahead as to how their adventurers will be buffed and equipped with better weapons as they progress through the quest, or risk losing the quest altogether. 

The abstract mining mechanism, which has tinges of [thing=7854][/thing], is a mixed bag. A number of elements factor into the decisions here, such as obtaining desired resources, manipulating turn order and setting oneself up for future rounds. I had to learn the hard way that it is easy to drive oneself into a corner and have only crappy moves left. My reservation is that this phase forms a bottleneck in the gameflow because players tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time optimising their moves here.

Another caveat is that the basic game feels truncated, despite the fact that it took us almost 2 hours to get through a basic game. On the other hand, the epic game would likely be too long for my tastes, even if it fell within the optimistic printed 3-hour playing time. A credible effort for an original Kickstarter game for sure, but unfortunately not quite all there.

In this game players take on the roles of companies tasked with sending adventurers on quests as well as collecting the materials and forging the weapons the adventurers need on these quests.

The gameplay itself is made up of a few smaller parts that I think blend together very smoothly.  Everything is very abstracted but also very thematic at the same time which lessens the blow I feel from many abstract games.  First players collect resources by moving overseers around a map of mine tiles.  The overseers "create" workers that mine that particular mine tile for that particular resource as well as "convert" any opponents workers they pass over.  The workers also strike if too many of them are in close proximity and turn order for the rest of the round favors whoever has the fewest workers on this map.

Then there is a worker placement phase where players take turns acquiring different weapon plans, market bonus cards, or hiring and training new adventurers.  Finally players begin and manage their existing quests which are passed or failed based on the strength (and often weapon type) of the adventurers and weapons sent on that quest.

I know that's a lot and a lot of different gameplay elements but I really enjoy games like that when they are blended smoothly.  Too often when a game tries to do too much it can feel clunky or like one piece was just tacked on as an afterthought but this game has a very nice flow.  The non-epic version of the game goes by pretty quickly since a lot of the phases can be played overlapped or simultaneously (such as quest management).  The epic game is much longer but downtime isn't too terrible since the turns are divided into pieces and there is still a lot of overlapped and simultaneous play.

The artwork and components are very nice with a lot of fun thematic nods such as needing an axe to complete a quest where you have to kill a possessed tree or needing a spear to reach the bats in a tower.  The player and main game boards convey a lot of information without looking busy.  The only major qualm I have with the components is the itty bitty cubes used to track quests.  I would have preferred larger quest tracking spaces or even a different tracking method altogether than these miniscule cubes just asking to be lost on the floor for a pet or child to gobble up.

An epic game in both length and scope, at least when played by the Epic Game rules. Start out by killing rats in the cellar, end up diverting a meteor from hitting the planet. Unlike Lords of Waterdeep that shares this theme, the quests are central to the tension in the game. I love how the quests are long affairs that ramp up. You desperately need an adventurer for one quest, but they're all busy doing another, and you could go get another adventurer, but he'd only be a level 1. The mine mini-game is heavily inspired by Yinsh, but it works great. Really looking forward to playing again.

A really nice game. Lords of Waterdeep on steroids. The mining minigame seems off at first, but it effects quest acquisition and completion. you have to plan wisely when moving foremen.

Kickstarted after seeing Rahdos run-through and playing the online version. Wow, did this leave a fantastic impression. So looking forward to get it to the table. It achieves what Caverna and Lords of Waterdeep failed at. Instead of a good or great Eurogame with a make-believe fantasy scheme you now have a good or great fantasy-themed Euro. I don't want to rate the game just about now, but I think it's weird when people state that this is your typical kickstarter being not fully developed. One part of why this game made such a fantastic impression, is because of the games' development. I don't see where this game would not be excellently tested and thought through. And your typical kickstarter would rather try to lure you into kickstarting with tons of plastic. Which this one doesn't need to do at all. It's all about the game.  
--------------------------------------------------------
Turns out that the first impressions the game left during the online "beta" were confirmed with the cardboard version. The mining phase is a clever resources gathering system, the actions you can take during a game are crucial and scarce and the Quest phase makes the game succeed not only on a mechanical but also on a thematic level. There is a chance this game might not be for everyone. It didn't bother us but the game is prone to AP, since each round you only get to take one action. Also, the movement in the mine phase is mindburning not only because of the resources you get but you also have to think about what your opponents get and what will be your initial position for the next round. What I quite like about the game is that it has three equally important "main" phases during a single round instead of games where you have 3-5 phases during a round but only one main phase where all the action and thinking happens.  Second epic game in, which I lost 241-238. So much brainburning of the wonderful kind, raised to a 9

I played the print and play prototype of this Kickstarter game.  As such, some of the artwork and design wasn't complete, and only a seven round teaching game was playable instead of the full 18 round game.  So obviously my opinion may change after playing the final version.

The game has three basic phases in a round.  The first is a mining phase where you gather materials from your mines.  This is the funkiest part of the game, as it's basically an abstract mini-game where you move a single pawn (of the three you have on the board).  You put a marker in the spot you leave.  And then you pull whatever resource is under the markers you've placed this turn.  But if you jump other people's markers, then you convert them to yours, and you get those resources too.  If you jump your own markers, they flip to whoever had the fewest markers on the board, and they get that resource.  Finally turn order is determined by fewest markers on the board.  As I said this is a little weird as it's completely different and out of theme for the rest if the game.

The second phase is a market round where you can choose to buy 1 thing from the village, or pass and take a coin.  Money is very tight in this game.  And everything flushes from the village, so much of the time you just watch things you wanted disappear.  (You also have the option to buy and sell 1 resource per round.) This is a worker placement round and many of the actions are limited to a single player.  There are some common weapons blueprints in the village and everybody can go to the blacksmith to learn how to make them.

The third phase is the heart of the game.  You buy a quest and then assign adventurer's to the quest.  This is also when you forge your weapons by committing your resources.  Every round your adventurers will advance another step on the quest if they can meet the attack value of that step.  Some quests require a certain weapon type, and there's an attack penalty if you don't have the right type.  Most quests will have more than one "leg"... Which means that after x number of steps, you advance to the next row.  Usually that gives you some reward for completing the previous leg of the quest.  Also, if you manage to complete the full quest you'll get lots of victory points.  If you fail the quest you'll still get some victory points depending on how many legs you completed.

Rinse and repeat for another six rounds (or seventeen in the full game).

I enjoyed the game a lot.  There were a couple of things that were rough in the rules, but I imagine they'll be clarified in a FAQ shortly.  And some of the things you can buy in the village don't make much sense in a short game.  I'm a little worried that making the game longer will just drag it out and not add anything new, but it really depends what the level two and three cards do.

This game is tempting me to try Kickstarter for the first time.

Update:  Having played the game several more times now... I still like it a lot, but the length is a real concern for me.  The game takes a long time and I'm not sure that I'm willing to invest that much time for this experience.

Excellent game. Componets very nice indeed and plenty of them. Played a couple of times two player on the weekend. First play was a bit slow as we got the hang of play, the second time things went very quickly. I much prefer it to Lords of Water Deep (although I do like that) and so did my playing partner. Looking forward to trying with 3. The mine phases can really change the game depending on how cagey you are - preventing resources for your opponent usually means you get less too. Will take a while to get a good strategy for the mine phase. I think this will be a regular play for quite a while. Well done Isaac!

3 mini games smashed into one.  The game requires an intensely large amount of forward planning.  Yet injects chaos into the 2 preceding rounds to the important quest selection and management.  The things you need may not be there and it is very hard to plan for turn order.  You can attempt to set things up in your favour but they may not match with other player's plans.

To play this game well would take an insane amount of analysis about what all of the other players are up to.  As it is was very difficult to just plan to be able to continue your own quests.  I love deep games that reward heavy analysis.  However, I did not feel the level of analysis was rewarded by quality of game play or selected moves in this game.  Too much thinking for not enough pay off.

Would much rather play a game of Caylus and then a game of Yinsh instead.

Granted the theme is quite strong (even if the mining portion is super abstract).  I will maybe play the full epic version once more for the "experience" and then call it quits with this game.

There is a lot to love about Forge War. The mining mini-game is an amazing abstract enterprise that could absolutely stand on it's own as a game itself. The whole idea of building a party, then arming them with weapons custom forged out of your mines (the minigame) is cool beyond belief. The adventures you send them on are both funny and compelling, as they refer back to all sorts of genre tropes, comedic and otherwise. Getting your quests completed is stressful in the best way possible.

But there's a problem. The game is just too long..or it's too short. It depends on how you play. The quick game is over so fast you have virtually no chance of building up your tableau to do anything clever. The long game takes HOURS. It's nice to really build an engine and see your long term plans come to fruition, but four hours of this wash, rinse and repeat gameplay is just too much.

I think what this game really needed was some more development time (as is often the case with independently published Kickstarter games). There is no doubt that there is an interesting game here, but there is also a lot of annoying chaff. The worker placement  aspects are comically under-developed. Seriously. it would have been easier to have initiated a card draft, to do the same thing. The different game modes are also feast or famine. The short game is over almost before you can finish more than a weapon or two, and at most your adventurers will have gotten through three or four low level quests, yet the epic game goes so long that you lose interest, just when the most exciting things are happening and your grand plans for a resource engine are coming to fruition.

This isn't a core gameplay problem, it's a development issue. Someone should have found the happy medium, before this went into release. It's fun and absolutely crammed full of neat ideas. There is no doubt the designer put his heart and soul into this...but the sheer length of it mskes it so that instead of leaving you wanting more, it just leaves you wanting it to end. maybe someone will work out a better rhythm for the 2nd edition.

First off, there is nothing new here.  Well, that's not quite fair, as there is a weird resource collection abstract strategy game that is plunked down into the middle of a very chrome laden engine building game.   That's sort of new.  

But, overall, it's just an ok game and the full game is way, way too long for what it is.  Also, it's fiddly and requires a bunch of micro management of turning resources into weapons, which then turn into points.

Frankly, it just confirms (again) my overall view of Kickstarter.  There may be a good game here somewhere, but no one took the time to develop it.  So, it's sometimes slow and ponderous, and there are a fair number of pieces that seem not to matter very much.

I played the online version of this in order to determine if I was going to back it or not and ultimately I decided not to. Let's get the good stuff out of the way: I really like the way the mining phase worked and how jumping other workers gets you additional resources and how the mining board clears itself. I also liked how the adventurers quest and level up.

However, there's a lot that's been done before in games that are further polished. Also, the epic game is supposed to take nearly three hours and I have other games in that time range that I'd rather play than this. I think my biggest beef is that there are lots of little rules loopholes which says to me the game isn't quite ready yet.

The blacksmiths of the kingdom are forging and equipping the adventurers to save the land from certain evil. First action is digging for ore with our disloyal workers. I don't understand thematically why they switch allegiance so easily other than to provide a sub-game puzzle challenge (reminds me of the game Othello). Second action, is worker placement in town and market which includes getting weapon and armor blueprints. The final quest phase is unique from other fantasy quest games of its kind. Adventures are matched with gear to meet the starting requirements of selected quests that take multiple turns to complete with additional resource needs and increasing difficulty. The abstract method of tracking hero level and item power is clever and effective.  The way quests play out adds a unique strategic challenge which in itself is worth a play. Epic game runs too long for us but I predict this will be a good one.

我相信第一時期的卡的模損程度絕對比第二第三時期要來的嚴重。絕大部分你找不到能跟你一起抏史詩模式的朋友，儘管他有這麼多時間，寧可選擇其他遊戲。

Need to play the epic game, which is very long -- but completely worth it.

Great, long, solo adventure. Resource gathering does feel a bit out of place, but I just look at it as a mini-game in the larger experience. A lot of decisions to be made and they need to be made 2-3 turns in advance, if not more, as the game goes on. A lot of fun!

Sent to [username=sam319] through the PiFF Geeklist. This was a highly anticipated game for Wendy, so I wanted to send this quality game to somewhere it would be played more and loved as much as it deserves to be loved!

A very good game, but just wasn't getting to the table. I love the theme and artwork of this game and the mechanics are solid. Epic play is definitely the way to go in my opinion (very satisfying), with the small downside of being quite lengthy.

mini-game to gather resources, worker placement of one worker, then try to fulfill quests with your stuff... a bit wonky and linear, but I did find it to be entertaining...

Good except for the weird that's my fish mini game.

Pretty great game. Bought it through kickstarter on a whim and found that it exceeded my expectations both in terms of component quality and enjoyment. Plenty of meaningful choices and easy to get lost in the game. The much-recommended epic game is longer than a lot of things so I don't see it hitting the table too much, but I'll certainly look forward to our quarterly play of Forge War.

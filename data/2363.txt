Quality of the gaming-experience really depends very much on the case you put on the board. Some are quite clever - and some just stupid. 
It has an interesting design, though. Some of my sweetest memories of gaming with my family when I still was a around 13-15 years old are linked to this game.

The clues and cases are clever, as is the built in time limit (the train journey). But I find with murder mystery games in general that everyone has to be in the mood for deductive reasoning, or else the feeling of 'let's get it over with' can become contagious and spoil the end game.

Played again recently to celebrate the truly awesome movie. The game has roll and move, but it's not that big of a deal since you can almost always reach some sort of new information. The way you can block evidence is really neat as is the timing mechanism of the game. The actual deduction aspect remind me of those logic puzzles with the graphs (If Bob and Sue are guilty, then the motive is Revenge and John is innocent, that kind of thing). If you enjoy that kind of logic, hunt this down, it's worth it.

Picked it up at a garage sale for $2.50 and hoping someone can help us with the missing clues so we can play those cases (only 2 clues missing really).

Played case 1 so far and it was fine, not a bad game, but you can only play it 10 times (10 cases included) and it is a bit strenuous on the old grey matter ;-).

Move around the Orient Express train. Suspects and crew all move around too. At certain locations, send a telegram for more clues. Lock clues away with bribes. Try to deduce the murderer before the train reaches Varna. Lots of logic puzzles to deduce.

[b]Opinion[/b]:
This is one of the best mystery deduction games I've played. The train and passenger movement is a really great touch. If you like deduction games, this is for you. Issues: Deduction Sheet is confusing to use, and my wife didn't like it. Some editions are much nicer than others.  Overall: Great.

RATING: 8
Clever concept and very attractive board (Jumbo edition). The roll & move mechanic is not as bad as it sounds as it rarely stops you from doing something useful so doesn't feel frustrating in the same way that Cluedo or 221B Baker Street do. The only luck is in whether you roll red numbers and therefore see clues that others don't. The gradual revealing of the clues make you feel like you are part of an Agatha Christie novel with all the usual colourful characters and red herrings.

Only ten cases supplied so limited longevity (though there are many good games that get a deal less play than this one will). I've played many of these twice now as I forgot all about them after a couple of years. Extra cases were published and can be found in the files section though unfortunately not in the original format. The European version has story-related clues whereas the American version uses unthematic logic clues.

Mysteries:
1. The Folding Table (Huzzah! - one of my favourite cases)
2. Family Reunion (D'oh!)
3. The Babel of Tongues (Huzzah!)
4. French Pastries (D'oh! but a good mystery)
5. Klevsmurnsk (D'oh! - I should have got it)
6. The Seance (Huzzah! but disappointingly straightforward)
7. Do You Smoke? (Huzzah! - another favourite)
8. Lost Property (D'oh! - the reconstruction baffled all six of us and took me a while afterwards to work out. It's quite clever but I think you are required to make some rather unintuitive assumptions)
9. The Bitter Pill (D'oh! - A good mystery but I was the only person not to see the vital evidence due to the number of 1s and 6s rolled)
10. The Greatest Show on Earth (Still to play)

Andrew's - "The Black Sheep" (Huzzah! though it does require a leap of faith and only the penitent man may pass? Oh, no, that's something else entirely....)

Mark's - "Steak Knives" (D'oh! - a good, solvable case but beware the red herrings)

I really like this game. I want to play this more, my rating may go up (it may also go down). Each scenario can only be played once, but I did like the first one.

Played the 2nd scenario. This is definitely my type of game, I won't be dropping it's rating, I might actually put it up if I'm allowed to have a few solo plays (my Mrs likes this so probably won't be allowed). It's a logic puzzle wrapped in a boardgame. Can't wait to play the 3rd scenario!

Someone's been murdered on the Orient Express!

First impressions: A good game, only marred by the limited replayability (10 scenarios). First case is well thought out, being neither too simple nor impossibly complex.

Note: I have the Jumbo edition, which appears to be substantially different from the Just Games one...

[Played the Jumbo edition] 
For a game with individually prepared cases (which are not replayable), this game was surprisingly devoid of theme or flavor. Each mystery seems to be more dedicated to the logic aspect of the puzzle rather than creating a sense of atmosphere and mystery.

There is also a luck element involved which can really favor certain players by giving them more clues than other players. Overall, the game was a bit of a disappointment. Its a dry, luck-filled deduction game.

I was a little doubtful at first (1980's game) that looked like Cluedo to me.

Based on a train - 8 suspects , 6 motives (You have to guess both right) - You get to talk to the Suspects, train staff, search the rooms and even send telegrams on each suspect - each clue only gives you a piece of the puzzle eg. My first clue was "The xxxxxxxx (one of the suspects) knows three suspects who know nothing about Jewels" when I read this I figured this ain't going to be a straight forward investigation - It turned out to be a good game - with enough player interaction (Having got a clue, if you feel it's an important one you can make it more difficult for other players to get it) to make it feel like it wasn't just a race.

Nice deduction game.  I love the milieu -- every time I play I want to go watch the movie.  The game is a logical deduction puzzle couched within a nicely themed murder mystery.  Extreme logic, and a smattering of luck, are required for successful play.

Nice Filler, the mysteries are well thought out, and though the mechanisms are dated and not so good, it's still quite fun to try and figure out the clues. I like to play with a time limit, so that people cannot think everything through too much, otherwise everyone would guess right at the same time.

My wife really loves to watch the films of Hercule Poirot, so therefore I bought this game. 
It is a great murder solving game with clever story based mysteries and my wife and I really love to play it. During the game the story really slowly unveil itself when you question the right persons and search at the right spots. The graphics are beautiful and bring the right atmosphere and during the game you feel like a genuine Hercule Poirot. The movement of the train is a clever mechanism and creates a nice tension: the murder has to be solved before you reach Istanbul. 
There is only one disadvantage: the basic game comes with only 10 mysteries which you can only play once. There is an expansion for this game with 5 new mysteries from the same writer, but it is hard to find an original version of this expansion (but there is a French copy available here on BGG and an English translation of the cards as well). 
I really recommend this game to everybody who loves clever detective films and/or games. Don't let yourself scare of due to the fact that it has a limited amount of mysteries, because you will have at least a great time during the solving of these 10 (or 15) murder cases!

An intriguing and involving game of deduction where you travel around the train trying to solve a murder case in the least time.  The cases themselves are tough, and clues can remain hidden, tipping the balance in favour of one player.  It is sad that only ten cases are included in the game (there's another on the Geek, I believe), but, on the other hand, ten plays of any game represents decent value for money.  If you enjoy deduction games, this is worth seeking out.

Great, great game published by jumbo in late '87!
i have the italian version, but i think it's the same of the other ones. The game puts you inside of (maybe) the best novel written by christie: you are a detective who must solve a crime before the orient express arrives to instanbul. It's not a light game, it requires skill and deduction, it forces you to make your own opinion of how the crime has occured. A play normally takes 2 hours but, believe me, it's not boring. Visit every location, ask any question and put the pieces of the story together before the other detectives do the same.
the only negative comes from the number of cases: they're only 10 (plus other new ones you can find here!)
If you can find it on ebay buy it!!

Fun mystery game. Nice that it can be played solo or cooperatively. Many of the clues are thematic, but many are just logic puzzles that don't fit the case.

First game played cooperatively but with 1 detective was way too easy, so we are going to try a house rule where the train moves EVERY turn instead of 50% with 1 detective.

We tried that a couple times, with each player having their own pawn but sharing all information. Having the train's movement be predictable loses something, since you can predict wire stops exactly.

This is based on one solo play.
But I thought the game was good,not difficult to learn and was pretty fun flipping through the book reading clues and taking notes. I would call this a more of a adult version of Clue,more in depth with reading and note taking,and some clues not being so strait forward.
I also liked it because it added a couple of features to differ from clue like you can add a Silence chip to slow down the other players,and much like clue its a race who can solve the crime first but it adds a moving train and if no one has the crime solved by the time the train hits a certain station,Game Over!
overall if you like Clue but want a bit more without getting massive rules and can also be played solo,This game is for you.

I do much prefer 'case' based games in deduction games than games where you pretty much have to hunt down a random bit of information that is missing from the game by finding all the others (Clue, Mystery of the Abbey, Mystery Express etc.). One of my favourites is 221b Baker Street and Orient Express definitely looks like a step up from that. I have played two cases and I found the cases to be a bit tedious and dull and more about numbers than creative thinking. I prefer cases in which the mystery lies behind a seemingly inexplicable crime scene instead of who sat for dinner with whom for who long. I have always been more fond of Conan Doyle than Christie so that is probably why. Anyhow, the game is okay, but I cannot say I enjoyed it a lot when I played it due to the nature of the cases.

Rating based on one play of case #3 with 5 people, all of whom were new to the game.

A quick and easy game to pick up and learn with only a few pages of rules to digest. Set up time was a matter of minutes and the game initially had the feel of a variation on the popular game 'Clue'. However, the clues felt abstract even though it was fun chasing around the board for them in competition with the other players but like a good detective novel the mystery slowly started to unravel and the villain, along with their motive became clearer as the pieces of the puzzle were put together.

Re-playability of the game is sadly limited to the number of cases available but this game makes for a fun diversion where you do feel that a mystery is actually being solved rather than the simply identifying the solution.

Much better than "Cluedo" I think. A bit more comparable to "Sherlock Holmes: Criminal Cabinet". Very nice and tricky cases! It can be very tight in the end ... who was the murderer? And who solved the case at first if more players were right? Tension guaranteed!
A lot of fun with the right game group.

My aunt gave me this game years ago as a gift.  I played it a few times, but do not remember it too well.  I ought to break it out again, if for no other reason than philological interest, but I don't know if I see that happening soon.

Some fun, but not very. After you played all of the cases, you can pretty much sell it. Better "solve-the-murder" games out there.

After 1 play, I have good feelings toward this game.  It was a five player game though, if you plan on playing with more than 2 players, have 2 or 3 copies of the clue section of the book available or the game will drag as players wait for the book to make it to them.

I liked that logic puzzle race feeling, solitaire seems good, a nice quiet game for two.

A very good deduction/murder mystery game! Better than the trivial Cluedo, but not as geeky as Sherlock Holmes Criminal Carbinet. This may very well be the best deduction game ever! Only to be enjoyed occassionally though because there are only ten cases. (+expansions + fan made cases).

I figure it might be fun to create a case myself one day...

A very thematic game, you really feel like you are on the Orient Express! Great artwork as well.

So the deduction mechanic works perfectly and the cases are excellently written. If you only take the deduction part itsself, it's clearly the best deduction game I know.


However, the semi cooperative point mechanism doesn't work that well. So the fun really is to find out "whodunnit" rather than beat your opponents.
The red (read hint secretly) 6 is overpowered!
(We play with this house rule: Consider the 1 and the 2 to be red and the 3, 4, 5, 6 green.)

Just another deduction game. Not enough information is hidden to make the game fun (unless you want to just keep moving back and forth until you get a 1 or 6 that allows you to keep new information to yourself but that would add a lot of time to the game) and the whole design feels creaky and not massively play tested. I'll pass on this one.

This deep mystery game offers a total of ten mysteries, concerning different cases with quite good replaying ability. The mysteries are not easy to solve: therefore is challenging to play. 
The board is beatiful and attractive. One has a possibility to take journey through Europe from Paris to Istanbul with old-classic Express-

This is a whodunit, except that randomness of the dice mean some people may get secret clues that the other players don't. It is close to being an ok game, but there isn't much re playability here.

RATING: 5
A murder mystery-solving game with a nice (train) theme. Unlike Cluedo and it's clones, it's not simple elimination of wrong answers though - you'll need to do some actual thinking for yourself, too. Basically you're competing against the other players in who solves the murder quickest (=gets the least negative points)

The case (no. 3) we played wasn't very convincing tho - need more plays, final rating could be anything between 4-6.

Played once, thought it was OK, but desperately lacking in flavor, not to mention context, e.g., where was the body found?  Wouldn't that be a good place to search?  I don't understand the comments about never getting an exact solution or making logical leaps - I got the solution with no room for doubt, maybe halfway to Varna.

RATING: 6
Interesting murder mystery/sleuthing game. Gives a gamer's feel to the Clue generation. I've only played a 2-player game so far which proved fun but more of a race type situation. It does play a bit solitaire-ish in that you can get caught up in following your own clue set and not even have discussions with other players. Still, it is a great take on a sleuth game and gives enough variety with the border crossing, detective interactions and expandable case sets to enjoy for some time.

For real detectives! Even with all the clues revealed the murder may be a tough nut to crack and the simple acts of exclusion as known from Clue do not work here.

Some cases seem good and some don't, might also be a translation thing in some cases. Feels like a good amount of murder mystery for 90 minutes.

Rated after the first (and fast) play. The idea is good, but I played poorly. I'd like to play this in the future with not so much stress and going properly through the game mechanics and rules - I forgot too many of the basic principles.

The game can be played ten times, so the replayability is not perfect, but how many games you actually play more than ten times? Especially when they are not great, but just good or promising (like this).

We played the second time last weekend, but we were not able to solve the first case even after reading all the clues and solution. The feeling was of course not very good after the game, but may be I need to read everything again and try some other scenario. Solving mysteries is always nice, but this one was either too hard or had some error. May be we all overlooked something?

The first case was solvable, but we just all missed one thing. Played solo the second case, but I was too tired, so didn't see the solution once lost on the wrong track. Nice puzzle game.

Really love it, altough all players have almost the same information at a time so winning the game is more an individual challenge then a competition. Would play it anytime again! On the other hand i have to say that my group wasn't so pleased with this one.

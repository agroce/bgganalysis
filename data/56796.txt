Still a great little game, exactly what its supposed to be a light abstract.

Clean little perfect info abstract.  A nice shogi variant that showed me that I don't think I will ever get around to learning the real thing...but this one will keep me entertained for quite some time.

RATING: 8.5
I bought this as a gift for my friend's 12 year old son, and we (the boy and me) played 10 games right afterwards. It's a very simple abstract with just 4 pieces on each side: the lion, an elephant, a giraff, and a chicken(which can be promoted to a rook if moved to the bottom line of the opposite side, just like the pawn in chess), but it adopts a feature from the Japanese Shogi that each piece taken from the opposite side can be used immediately as yours. Each game can be played in about 5 minutes, looks simple but have quite a number of tricky moves. Highly recommend to young teen gamers.
The raiting of 8.5 is as adult gamer, it can be rated higher for young teens.

An excellent little game. Karol enjoys it a lot.

For a disadvantage it was solved. But the solution is far too long for me to remember it so it is not big deal for me.

Japanese Chess (Shogi) boiled down to the bare minimum. This is the perfect gateway into Shogi for children as well as being a great game on its own. The game play is fun, full of action and deep enough for children (adults too from my limited experience). The components are fantastic - solid, durable, colourful and well designed. The publishers have nearly hit perfection with this one. Next step is Goro-Goro Dōbutsu Shōgi.

Belongs to my children.

Designed to teach the very basics of Shogi, I fear that there isn't much here. I'd like to play against someone other than my son to see if there is more depth to be found. Yet, if I am going to do that, I'd rather just play Shogi.

Probably would be pretty easy to solve if analyzed, or even just from a lot of repeated play, but that's sort of missing the point.  This is a fast, simple introduction to Shogi, and it's a super fun game in it's own right.

Very simple game, very simple moves and I still lost! Very attractive graphic design, aimed at small children but adults would be very happy to play this edition. How it compares to Shogi, I have no idea and as I am not a fan of abstract games or Chess-style games, I don't think it would draw me in. But for beginners, it looks like a nice introduction to some of the ideas.

The initial set-up is very tight, so I guess there are standard openings. The English rules PDF on BGG is not as comprehensive as the Japanese rules included in the game, and I'm left with the odd question.

Great way to introduce shogi. Even with 4 pieces per side and a 3x4 play space, the 'bughouse chess' style of add-and-drop plays means that there is still a a remarkable amount of play space for this little intro game. This reminds me of pawn+bishop+rook learning matches I used to play when learning chess.

Plus, the aesthetics are super cute AND super functional (i.e. the moves are indicated on the pieces).

Note: Birthday present for my eldest daughter

It's a good game for teaching shogi and the more advanced set (on its way as we speak). I'll play with my kids for that. It's also good for teaching losing graciously as it's fast. Pointless to play with adults as there are a limited number of good moves. 

I play this with some regularity and not all plays are registered.

Very fun simplifified version of Chinese chess.This version has less space and less robots to move making this game simpler in strategy but also makes it tense from the start. Very good game and a great introduction to logical games. Eventhough the game is very basic I rate it highly as a person who is not very good at logical games. If you aren't either try this out and feel the fun of logical games!

Shogi is, in my opinion, the best abstract strategy game.  It is like chess, but with real personality, which is really all chess is lacking.  LCTL is a Shogi instructional game, where your pieces are cute bunnies and lions and hedgehogs.  I can teach this game with LCTL to five year olds and watch them (re)develop strategies that have existed for hundreds of years, and it is remarkable. And the same goes for adults.    
Can't recommend this game enough.

RATING: 7
This childish looking game for two managed to enchant me. This game is an entry-level variant of Shogi, Japanese chess. Your pieces are a lion, elephant, giraffe and a chick. Each has its own unique direction of movement indicated by dots on the beautiful wooden game pieces.

The main difference is that the chess pieces do not have colors, if you see the piece straight up, it is with you.
At your turn you move a piece or you place a piece you conquered before. The small board is sized 3x4 only. You win if your lion reaches the other side or when the lion of your opponent is set mate.

Fun game which gives you the chance to say 'my chick just ate your elephant'. Tip!

mini shogi for teaching, but still an interesting game in its own right.

Apparently, the game has been solved and the second player can always win, but the first player can make the game drag on a long time and the optimal plays are not obvious.  So, it's a very solid game, especially given how tiny it is.

VERY minimalist clever Shogi variant! Surprisingly interesting and diverse ways it can play out, given the tiny board (3x4) and tiny number of pieces (4 per player). Ultimately a sort of "shogi filler", but fun.

If you like it, I also recommend checking out [gameid=28389] (5x5) and [gameid=141467] (5x6) which are also small but more open and strategic and varied than this 3x4 variant.

This is a very enjoyable gateway game to learn Shogi (Japanese chess).
Even if you're familiar with Shogi, it's still a lot of fun.
It's very easy to learn and yet unsparing, as if you're playing the final stage of Shogi right from the start.

Cute artwork. Retains many of the features that make Shogi so interesting, like piece drops. For such a small game with a limited piece set (at least compared to Shogi), there is a surprisingly fun game here. For adults, I'm sure the game would exhaust itself quickly, but that's no reason not to try it -- especially if you are unfamiliar with Shogi.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Well... what a surprisingly brilliant game.   A cutesy aesthetic, quick playtime and simple ruleset belie the brain burner this game truly is.  It was apparently designed to be an intro to Shogi, but this one truly stands on its own as a fantastic abstract game.  Plus, the production of the travel package and helpful iconography on the pieces are perfect. 
 Loved it!

Simply excellent introduction to 2P abstract wargames likes Shogi and Chess.  Kidnomad liked it and dominated.  Totnomad was very quickly ascertaining consequences of moves.  Putting directional icons on the pieces is a masterstroke.  Made better with copious "om-nom-noms" and the inevitable giggles whenever a baby chick swallows an elephant whole.

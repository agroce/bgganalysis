An OK filler.  A bit of potential for clever card play in seeding the supply of scoring cards.  On the down side, as others have commented, luck of the draw is too important.

Ugh. There's a hint of a good idea here -- feeding the score pile -- but there's not enough of a game wrapped around it to make it at all fun. What really kills it dead is the utter lack of planning and tactics due to the unpredictable scoring rounds.

If you like to destroy other player's creations, that's your game.  Very interesting game with a high level of destroying interaction.  But the good thing is that destroying is not just that, it is a way to get points... probably.  Quite simple concept, very well designed, fast, and really good fun.  There is some luck involved, but it is obvious from the very beggining, and it is a 20 minutes game.  The art is just functional and nice in it's way.  Very happy to have it.

This is a great filler and was fun to play with the kids and with adults. It moves quickly and everyone catches on fast.

Everyone we have played it with has enjoyed it as well.

An okay game of set collection and hand management.  Lots of luck.  Has a bit of a "take-that" element... as well as a memory element.  Many tough decisions and tense moments... IIRC, you only earn points in a given color wall (that you built) if that color also appears in the discards!

As much as I wanted to like this game for its theme and reputed play simplicity it simply was not possible. Despite playing it 3 times, twice with 3 players and once with 4, I found the artwork on the cards distracting, especially in determining the proper colors. Whites, yellows, and greens all seemed too similar. The texture of the cards themselves also felt mediocre. Gameplay was much too random with not enough meaningful open information to decide what the best play might be. Other than playing the Get That aspect it was totally no fun at all. Now a casualty for my Must Sell bin.

Jericho is a fast and entertaining card game, with a lot of opportunities for ruining your opponent's plans. It turns into a fast game of card draw, wall building and wall destroying. Four scoring moments in the game occur at which point you score for the highest wall in each colour. Hence the importance of destroying your opponents walls during the game.

Imagine Alhambra without the wall sections, without the currency, and with the ability to remove tiles from your opponents palace. That, in a nutshell, is Jericho. Good fun.

RATING: 6
A rare item - a Euro game which consists only of playing "take that" cards (to destroy the walls of your opponents). All in all a bit too random and chaotic to be of major interest, but one has to admit that the basic concept of "trumpets" as "trumps" and the building of walls is original and well handled. But the fact that the scoring rounds come completely randomly and that no player really has control over his scoring apart of feebly attempting to build the longest wall and hope that the others don't interfere will turn many off.

(As of [b]3[/b] plays) A simple card game that involves a lot more intriguing decision-making than first meets the eye. A mixture of set collection, push-your-luck, second-guessing and forward thinking. Quite satisfyingly (and unexpectedly) cut-throat.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Still a fun game. Not the first filler, or even the first set collection game I would reach for, but not played out yet.

Had a few rules wrong, so this is very provisional.  Way too short to be of much import - like some other Lehman games an interesting mechanism not given a very pleasing shell.  I like to think this, when compared to Great Wall of China and Palazzo, articulates the design style differences of Lehman and Knizia.

There is a little bit too much luck for my taste here. You must draw trumpet cards and hope to build a large wall section just before the scoring, which occurs randomly. Two things I can't manage to do... I would have wished for a bit more strategy.

A very good choice if you are looking for an easy to explain, fast to play, and quite nasty little card game. 

You play cards to get the majority in different coulours, but the highest card is always vulnerable to attacks -by the infamous trumpets, that are also joker cards.

Can be random and aggravating, but is fun, and offers interesting choices all along.

RATING: 7
Jericho is a light-weight card game in terms of play time, themed after the Biblical fall of Jericho, but the focus of the game is actually the reverse- building up your walls, in spite of shofar-wielding opponents who knock them down.

Players are trying to capture cards with point value.  these are either cards seeded by the players, or walls collapsed by "trump"-et cards.

Players have a variable sized hand depending on the round, they play a card, either to their own area or to the central bank of point cards.

If the card is played to one's own area, it either starts or adds to a single-color wall, or it is a Trump-et card, which is wild for suit, and can be added to any existing wall (it cannot stand alone). In addition, when a Trump-et goes down, the highest value card(s) of that color are all discarded to the central bank of point cards.

After playing a card, the player draws from the draw deck, which is a separate pile from the bank of point cards.

Three end of round cards are shuffled into the draw deck, and after these are drawn, the largest wall in each color wins all matching color wall cards from the central bank, with ties splitting the pot. Trump-ets in the central pile are not awarded, but discarded from the game.

Timing when (and how) to build up walls and when to lay low (if possible) is the central part of game play in this one.

Reserving an initial ranking until I get a play or two more in, and can better assess luck vs. strategy.  It is interesting that knowledgable geeks fall in both sides of these two camps: too luck-based/deeper strategy.

I like Tom Lehmann and the theme used here anyway; I think Jericho deserves a little more play time and thought.

First played Oct 23rd, 2007. This is a quick learn (<5min) and quick play (~20min for 3).  The game is weighted more towards luck than strategy. This game was dissapointing as it has the look of a better game than what it is. After it was over, I felt like, "that's it?" You didn't seem to have much control over playing your walls either. You deal everyone a set of 5 cards and offer one up for the kitty.  Then you build your walls (numbered 1-7). If you play a wild 2 card, all high cards of that color you picked are placed into the kitty. I.e. if 7 is highest of that color all 7's go in. If you are only left with wild cards after discard, the wild card goes in as well. There are three scoring cards placed in the deck, when one is drawn, you score. The person with the most cards points in one color wins that colors cards out of the kitty (those are victory points). If you know someone who has it, I'd recommend giving this a try as it is a pretty cool mechanic. However I wouldn't bother purchasing it.

Apr09: Solidly okay filler.  I've had this game for a long time.  Traded it off and then got it back.  That says something about how enthusiastic I was about it.

The best I can say is that each play was generally an interesting decision.  It didn't really seem like there were many obvious choices.  Except when a player throws down a 7 and you can immediately blow that sucker down.

The trumpets were annoyingly chaotic.  The only saving grace was they controlled what went in the score pile.

I'll maybe play it again, but it's no Coloretto.

This game is better the more you play it (or, I suppose, up to a certain point, a point I haven't reached yet).

I like that there's some great choices in feeding (dropping cards into) the supply. It's a nice risk/reward feeling.

--
I'm now seven plays in, and I'm really enjoying the game. The battles over one specific long wall are lots of fun, especially when it's the 'meat wall' (red wall). It's quick, easy to teach (once someone knows how to play), and there are real decisions with real tension.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2011)

Ok game with an awful theme (for me). Fortunately, the theme doesn’t intrude much into the game mechanics. It’s been a while since I last played this so my comments could be a little off.

I remember that the game has regular art (although highly functional), the quality of the cards is also regular BUT it did have some clever mechanics that I liked (scoring system, majority game).  I Remember I thought the luck of the draw to be very prominent on this game and it also has a lot of “take that” moments but as it plays so quickly I don’t mind very much. 

I need to play again to review my opinion. I will try to bring it to our next gaming session to decide if I keep it or I sell it.

RATING: 7
A decent card/building game with some unusual mechanics.  On your turn, you may either add to the length of one of your walls or feed the "supply" with a card that will increase the number of victory points.  The supply is hidden and if no one feeds it cards, no points are scored.

'Wild' cards help to destroy larger walls (the only comment that I can make here is that there appears to be too many of them) and also increase one of your own.

Not a bad game for its price.

RATING: 5
It's not like it's a bad game - but it's such old news.  It feels like a majorities card game any Spielfriek might have made up in an hour.  Each turn play a card in any of 5 colors and values 1-7.  Three times you'll score for majorities.  The principle twist - not a bad one really - is that there are many cards valued at two with a shofar (ram's horn trumpet) pictured.  When played, they will take out the highest valued card in one color.  So there is some risk in using high value cards.  But the game mostly plays itself, especially as players hands dwindle each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The card stock is a little too thick on this one, making the cards hard to shuffle.  The theme of the game is unique and makes sense and I like how quickly the game plays.  The luck of the draw seems to play a huge role here, but it's so quick that it won't matter much.  Jericho has a good amount of take that, though there are so many trumpet cards that you have to expect that you'll get hit fairly often.  There's nothing that lifts this to the level of greatness, but it is adequate and enjoyable.  I'd definitely play this one again.

Pretty simple card game in which you are seeking to develop majorities in 5 different wall types which allow you to take cards from the supply of that wall color to gain points.  There is some interesting strategy in using trumpet cards to remove highest valued walls from everyone and potentially increasing your wall value and different twists within that as well.  Only the player with the best wall of a type will gain similar cards from the supply so that color wall needs to be fed into the supply by a player or through trumpet cards to gain points.  Plays very quickly.

Super luck-dependent but quick-playing card game. The cards are of very weird quality -- glossy yet cheap. Probably not a top filler but might find its way to the table once or twice a year.

Some interesting balance issues to deal with: Cards with high numbers make your wall bigger, but are very likely to be blown away by a trumpet. Feeding the supply gives you victory points for a color you win, but that makes it less likely you'll win that color. Quick and fun.

Got it for $5 on clearance.  Worth it.  Fun little game.  Lots of take-that with the trumpet cards--may be a little too much for my wife.  But it plays fast with some easy strategy and some luck.

RATING: 6.5
You place cards to build walls of different colors (material) and can also destroy the current longest section of a wall. When you do so, that wall piece is added to the scoring deck, thus making the person with the longest wall of that color at scoring gain more points. A simple game that is fun to play and has the right amount of strategy for a light filler.

This card game is a little like Alhambra, both in the timing of the scoring and what's actually scored.  The difference is that instead of each color scoring a fixed amount, it's scored according to how many cards are in the middle, which is usually a function of what's been blown up recently.  Playing cards in the middle never seemed worth it, as you could never guarantee you'd be the one scoring it.  Getting attack cards and low-value cards seemed great, but that's all luck of the draw.

Ugh, this was a luck fest. Hand management but really just play fast and keep your head down and maybe people won't target you. It was terrible, I really hated this. Maybe I just don't understand it, but, it is not a game I want to play again. I am always target and this is just too mean.

First play with 3 of what could effectively be Alhambra: the Card Game. 

Majority holdings in five colours are played in front of each player as walls, but it is the total in card values not the number of cards which determines who will claim cards (of that colour) which have been discarded during play, and each discard is worth a victory point. A bonus vp is awarded for each "1" in your wall.

As in Alhambra this scoring is triggered by 3 scoring cards planted in the drawpile, a seemingly commonplace mechanism that still excites.

Has the pet peeve of the deck distribution not being memorable, which makes choosing either placing the card to your wall to stay in front or to the discarded vp pile abit muddy.

But what really brings this experience down is that Trumpet cards forces discarding of high valued cards. In my first game I had to target the weaker player in order to get ahead, which I don't think made for a fun experience. At least 1 less card after scoring means your choices are less so accelerating the end.

Very nice little filler.
Build your own walls (in different colors), while destroying other players'.
To destroy wall cards you use trumpet cards, that you can add to your walls.
There are three scoring during the game. You score if you have the longest wall in a color. Points are made from the cards in the discard pile.

Chaotic and messy, but it plays quickly and is easy enough. Not a lot in the way of choices or even risk calculation. Did I mention it's over fairly quickly? The mechanism is interesting enough, but seems to fall down in the power of the number one cards and the abundance of wild trumpet cards.

Not a bad take-that filler with some fun twists.  There are some nice ideas, and it plays simple and quick enough that even if things don't go your way the game ends before you are miserable.  This is really all about timing and intuition.  There is some fun hand management.  The game is so destructive that you really have to save some cards to bail yourself out, but can you do it in time?  Great risk/reward decisions.

I like that it encourages conflict otherwise there are little points to be had.

One part stupid, two parts neat!  Enjoyable none the less.

[Uberplay 2006 edition] {Building, filler; hand management; optimal 3p} Jericho is a tactical card game. It's fun and nasty (you can directly hurt another player!). However, its theme is tenuous.  Nothing special - take it or leave it.

Player interaction comes from 2 aspects: competition to build the longest wall of a color and using trumpet cards to destroy walls of other players. It is a hand management game - a player has to decide whether he  should use his card to lengthen a wall or keep it in the supply for scoring. The decision is meatier with fewer players - a player can judge what other players are doing more easily.  And, it's not difficult to understand what other players are working on. Players can plan ahead because the walls remain in the layout after each scoring.  The trumpet card is interesting - it is a double-blade.  If you want to use the trumpet card to hurt other players so that you color wall can become the longest, you may hurt yourself too because you may leave your wall with highest card on the table.  So, using a trumpet card wisely is not really trivial.

A minus is that the trumpet cards are too many. This makes the game quite random and may create a king-making problem since a trumpet card can be used quite arbitrarily.  The random scoring timing can also be a problem because players cannot plan well. Luck of draw is moderately strong in this game. In addition, the game is too short (not enough cards) for players to plan and act well. But I do enjoy the fun of this card game.

The illustration of the cards is not my taste; nonetheless, they are effective.  The choice of color is clever.

A majority-influence game that moves along nicely. Each turn you can place a wall tile to increase your influence in one of 5 colors, or put a card into a face-down pool, or play a trumpet card that knocks down the highest value cards in the color you choose (& you can then add that trumpet to your wall). Then pick up a new card. Three cards in the draw deck trigger scoring, where whoever has most strength in each color gets those color cards from the pool.
Played only once, with 3 players (& we missed how the 3rd scoring was different to the first 2).
Language-independent cards, rules in English, German, French, Italian.

This is a card game that looks ultra-light at first, but actually has surprising scope for tactics and planning ahead. Reasonably fast too, so makes for a good filler - but beware, the game is pretty much based on sabotaging other players, so keep this out of reach of touchy people.

Not a ton of strategy here, and luck of the draw is king. Also being lucky enough to draw one of the three scoring cards - right after you've finished your turn - can be a bit unbalancing. Still, this is an inoffensive diversion with enough "take that" elements to make it worth playing now and again.

An average filler with a few interesting elements. I enjoy that the supply cards act as the score cards, but playing it to the supply means you have fewer cards of that color to play in your wall. 

Reality though is that trumpet cards are so powerful and plentiful that using a trumpet to destroy walls can help you can get you more points than playing to the supply. Still, the game does have some short term tactics amidst the chaos. However, luck of the draw is quite strong in this game.

Very bland game, but at least it plays fast.  All plays are essentially void of strategy, except when you get a wild card -- you have the chance to pick which player to hurt.  

Choosing who to pick on is essentially the only control you have over how it plays.

Played once and did not like-- trumpet cards are too powerful to be something that's randomly drawn by players (perhaps a variant where trumpet cards were evenly divided among players and were available to play at any time would work better). Without a rule change like this, the game just feels like all the effort is meaningless, and the only real factor is when the Jericho card will come up, which can't be predicted. I know that I have no interest in actually trying this again or tweaking it to where I think it could be interesting. Why bother.

Thomas Lehmann (Race for the Galaxy); Card Game; Each player tries to build the longest walls in different colors by playing out wall cards. Using trumpet cards, the players can remove pieces of the walls. During scoring, the players with the longest wall in a color are rewarded with cards from the supply. The cards that end up in the supply are decided by the players themselves. At the end of the game, the player with the most cards is the winner.

GAME: Hive Mind
RANK: 4078

RATING: 8
In Hive Mind, the players must be harmonious in answering intriguing questions based on their experience and opinions. The more answers they have in common with other players, the more points they get! Represented by bee pawns called Beeples, players move through the hive; those who score the fewest points each round must move closer to the hive exit. As soon as one or more bees exit the hive, the game ends. All the remaining bees win!

Light filler where players try to match answers of other players - whomever can do that best wins.

Very scalable. I particularly like the concept of more winners than losers, and essentially infinite questions.

Great fun, great ice-breaker.  No teaching, quick setup, drop-ins and drop-outs are fine.  It's simultaneous play for the main part, so it'll go to 12 players just fine (We enjoyed it 
with 10).

The box has some really good prompts, in a variety of formats.

However, it contains a game board, scoreboard, several pages of rulebook, meeples, die, etc, all of which are unnecessary.  It has a scoring system which adds little and actually made the game run too long, for us when we followed it.  Use The Force.  I'm guessing this over-production is all to try to justify a higher price.

This game would be attractive as a small portable box with just the prompt cards, and a price tag of £12-£15, not £30.  The excellent "Sixes" got the form-factor right.  But it used Comic Sans font! :)  And Hive Mind's prompts are more numerous, more varied, and generally better.  We can only hope for their lovechild.

Ok icebreaker/activity for the most part - really shines with "creative minded" folks that can ask unique/fun questions or at least pick out the "fun" ones from the deck.

This was an interesting experience, apparently I am quite unique in my thought processes and in a game where you score points for getting the same answers with other players i.e a hive mind, then I don't really score very well. I am  also not very good when placed on the spot and for a few rounds really struggled to actually think of the required number of answers

I'll play anything by Mr. Garfield.  I do find that he like some of his contemporaries, like Martin Wallace, have transitioned to designing less depth into their games; the reason I see them doing this is because that's where the new players are and that's how to sell 10,000 plus copies.

Great party game by Richard Garfield.  The design details paid to the game is amazing; warm-up rounds, random penalty, safety fence to give players extra chance... this game is so well polished!  My only complaint is that I wish those beeples could stand up straight and not tip over so easy. The meta effects on people is interesting too, I'm curious to see if playing multiple games would brain-wash your friends into hive-mind like zombies.

Nice implementation of old parlour game - select from a category, the more people select the same choice the more it is worth.  Works well.

Some funny moments but ultimately not that interesting. The game seemed a little long and I can see it getting more boring with increased plays.

Decent game, I wouldn't want to play it too often though.  Fun for big groups, 5-8 or so. Perhaps lasts 5 minutes too long.

Played as 3p, and laughed the whole time.
Very enjoyable.
I don't feel the need to own this game, although if I found it cheap I'd pick it up. 
Great party/family game, lovely mechanic, kind of like Scattergories in reverse.
If you like Scattergories you'll probably like this one too.

A good solid party game in the Family Feud genre - but with the fun twist that you're not trying to guess the most common answers for a general population, but rather the specific group you're playing with.

Fun, friendly family game about thinking alike. This is WAY better than scattegories because there are no arguments about who's 'RIGHT'.

One thing you need to know going in is this is a PARTY GAME. Yes it was designed by Richard Garfield the creator of Magic the Gathering but it is a PARTY GAME. A great party game at that. One of those instantly re-playable games.

I enjoy playing this one with my high school English class. It requires a slight rule modification, but works well.

Simple concept that works well.

Maybe a more appealing 'getting to know you' style of game especially for a younger audience due to the graphics and theme minus a judge.

Excellent party game. Suits a super high player count (which doesn't really impact on time to play very much); some simple mechanism(s) beyond just the core question asking add to the fun, it's apparent that lots of thought has been given to the questions, but it'd also be easy to add your own personalised ones. Highly recommended for all ages.

More fun than expected, opposite of Scattergories but avoids some of that game's problems.  Handles large group but takes longer with more people - looking for ideas to keep the game shorter when > 7 players.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. It's really a party game where you're trying to guess the same answers as everyone else to questions such as "What are three kitchen appliances?" It seems from being described the game that it won't be fun, but it was perhaps the most played game at my local convention I run. Very fun game!

Very nice party game for non-gamers or gamers that are winding down a night of more serious games.  Plays a group of up to 12 so that is a great plus for parties.

Decent production and high player count, but the game wrapped around the silly answers is middling at best. Goes longer than it should with random dice rolls.

Great game. You really only need the cards, paper and pencils.  (actually, that's all I've kept).  The scoreboard and point track just trash.

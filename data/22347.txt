RANK: 2539

RATING: 9
I really like this simple, but deep game... I originaly thought it had quite a bit of Lost Cities in it, but I'd say it has more Stratego in it than Lost Cities. Players play cards battling it out for perches with higher numbers trumping lowers numbers. Both players have a 1-12 and a Jaguar which basically is one free kill (might kill the 1 or the 12 depending on how you play). I like the replayability of the game... it's got some psychology going for it, too. I'd classfy it as light strategy and it's a good game to play with the nongamer wife (who also liked it).

Surprising how good this is.  Even reading the rules, you go "That's it? Wait, attacking cards stay face down and you just have to tell the truth about whether you won or not??"  But it makes for a fast, strategic, and highly enjoyable game.

I rarely rate games (just do not have the time) but feel compelled to rate Pecking Order.  Not sure I agree with the four round setup for a complete game since this defeats the purpose of a quick contest but obviously, it tends to even out the luck of the draw.  The game is VERY simple and VERY clever.  Using the Tiebreaker and Vision perches to full advantage is important, but it can waste cards that might be used for higher VP perches.  Decisions are fairly intense and bluffing is a great element.

This is a pretty fun game. You're placing cards of varying strength face down to try and control places on the board to claim points. I enjoyed it more the first ten or so times I played. It reminded me of Stratego in that you were trying to fake out your opponent by making them think that your unit/card is better than their's when it isn't.

First play with Ruth - she killed me all 4 rounds. Cute game, nice art, nice production quality. Very quick and simple to play, it's really a version of war. You can definitely sacrifice a lot of cards trying to gain hold of the higher perch positions and end up running out of cards with very little points on the board.

Plays as a combination of war and a guessing/bluffing game.  Quick to play, easy to learn, good for non-gamers, with enough depth to keep a gamer interested.  And getting 9 easy points by throwing your 1 strength bird on the 9 spot, where your opponent wont challenge because he thinks it's a lot bigger never gets old =).  To me at least.

RATING: 7.2
Clever, head to head game where you're laying small numbered cards on various 'perches' to duel over them, and at the end of the game you score for the perches you are in control of. Solid, fun Garfield design, I like that a few perches have special abilities, and the art on the board and box is pretty good. Not as genius as MtG or King of Tokyo or Android Netrunner, obviously, but a fairly timeless filler nonetheless.

Great 2 player bluffing game! You are trying to get more of your birds on the numbered perches. Birds are laid on perches face down. When a bird attacks another bird on the same perch, the defender must show the bird and the attacker tells the defender if he lost or won, without showing his card. Brilliant!

Nice bluffing.  Quick.  Certainly worth the price at Tuesday Morning.

The "cards" are heavy cardboard and impossible to shuffle.  They're much heavier than the heavy cards of Mystery Rummy.  And they're tiny, much smaller than I'd realized from the pictures.  I'm not really a fan of the artwork.

RATING: 8
Played with Beth, enjoyed it quite a bit. Has a sort of Stratego element to it in determining how to place your birds in order to psyche out your opponent and win with the higher number. Probably a game best played against the same person over and over.

As has been stated elsewhere, the box is grossly oversized for what you get, so much so that I thought I was surely missing some components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fast 2-er game that fits into the Lost Cities style of games.  There's a lot of bluffing.  Since you only have one card to play on a turn, gameplay moves at a very good pace.  I like the fact that the perches are not guaranteed points (usually), with ownership possibly passing back and forth between players.

This is the best quick to teach/ quick to play 2-player game I've played.  You can teach it to a non-gamer in under 5 minutes and depending on how fast you play, be done in under 15 minutes.  But, there is a lot of player interaction and learning to anticipate someone else's strategy -- exactly what a 2-player game should be.

Adult Play = 8;  Kid Play = 8

Edit: the game can get old when played with the same person for a while but as a quick filler for new people it still rates high.

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Marzo de 2017 por 3.10€ (En realidad se pidió en Noviembre de 2016 y llegó a principios de Marzo).
Juego rápido y sencillo en el que los jugadores disponen de 13 cartas iguales para enfrentase al adversario. Se juega en cuatro rondas y en cada ronda el jugador suma la puntuación de las posiciones que controle. 
La dinámica del juego es muy sencilla y las reglas se explican en dos minutos. Está entretenido y es muy indicado para no jugones.
Sólo para dos jugadores. Es bástante rápido. Una partida no debería ir más allá de la media hora.

I haven't actually played this by the rules.  I played using Alan Reeve's variant.  With this caveat, I would say that this is one of the better two player games, especially after repeated plays as the players adjust to the play of the previous game.  Different strategies are more and less effective depending on the other players approach.

Update: Game plays just fine using the actual rules.

I wasn't expecting much from this game, as the theme didn't do much for me, the components looked thin, and the designer (Richard Garfield) is someone I could give less than two hoots about.  But I can actually see this making it to the table often.  As an exercise in player psychology, this is right up there with the best of them, and the two-player only nature of it makes it a perfect fit for us.  Great game, the art is actually very nice, and it's much fun to make stupid bird sounds as you attack.  A definite sleeper.

RATING: 3
Disappointing game. Once I read the rules, I discovered that one could play this game with only a standard deck of playing cards. So, really all you pay for is the rules, half a deck of cool looking bird-themed playing cards, and a board that is not really necessary to playing the game.

What's the point?  A soulless, vapid attempt by Mr. Garfield to mimic a Reiner Knizia game but without any actual ingenuity or elegance.  The game is amazingly simple, and although there is more subtlety to it than you'd expect it still merits about three plays (which will take you about 15 minutes) and then it's pretty much done.  The "great art", including the crude paintings of the garish birds, does little to add any theme, which might as well be anything.  The point is, there's too many games like this already and another mediocre one to add to the pile isn't worth your time.  And it's not worth your money either- woe be the person who pays full retail for this one, basically just a mounted board and 26 cards.  That is some pretty nice cardstock though...

After opening this game up I was disappointed. It seemed to small and simple for my tastes but when we played the game it was fairly fun. For a game involving guessing what card your opponent played there was more thought and strategy than I suspected after first reading the rules.

Very Good card game with player conflict, "area control" type scoring, bluffing and special actions built into some of the spaces.  The random element of the game lies in your shuffled deck of cards, which also provides variety each game.  Even with a random card draw each turn, you must still make smart, tactical placements to win. Fun!

Components: Nice artwork for the birds, and a beautiful board.  I'd prefer to have the cards be regular size, but understand that the board would then become unmanageably long.  The cards should definitely have different backs for the two players.

Experience: More interesting than I thought it would be.  There are elements of bluffing, memory, deduction, and budgeting.  It's fun to try to efficiently place one's birds.  Controlling the 1 and 3 spaces can be key.  And it plays very quickly.

It's ultra-short & tactical though luck plays a part, but not overwhelming. A perfect game to play with your spouse. Kind of in the same line as Dragonheart. More of these, please !

I was quite surprised to find out the difference between Pecking Order & Auf die Palme. In PO you have two spots on location 8 which is worth 19 points when claiming both and you can only attack the opposing spot, not diagonal. In ADP there's only one spot which is worth 16 points when having two birds there and both of them can be attacked at once. It really makes for a slightly different strategy. PO has the better graphics, but ADP has bigger cards and is more compact, so makes for a better game to take with you on holiday. That's why I'll be keeping both.

[EDIT: After repeated plays I need to pump this up to a 9.5]
I've heard "Lost Cities" mentioned in the context of this game, and I'm not sure why.  It IS a 2-player game, and you have a thin board in the middle where you each play on either side, but that's about it.  It's a smidge more like a super stripped-down Heara and Zeus... at least in the mechanic of stratego-esque battle of two mystery cards.  There is a lot of bluffing, and psycho-strategy.  Example: The last game I played I got beat because my opponent had a "3" on the 10 space two turns from the end.  I next picked up a "4" and a "5", but didn't challenge him because I figured it was a much better card.  Lots of nice surprises like that in here.  Lots of moaning at the end when the face down birds are revealed.  It can be tense and sometimes vicious (ooh, that jaguar!).  OH, and if you are describing the rules to someone and his/her first question is, "Well, if I don't have to show you my card, can't I just tell you I win, even if I don't?!" PUT THE GAME AWAY and go home.  They are about to cheat.

An enjoyable 2 player game of column control. players play cards face down to each side of a long board to try to take control of it for end game points. Cards are placed face down and challenged only when opponent plays one on the same column. You then look to see if it is stronger than yours.  The theme is fairly pasted on as birds fighting for different perches in the tree.

got in math trade at GC 11', played Sept. 9th at store for first time against K, after her plain did not take off and we waited for another arrive ( fuel leak ) - 4 rounds, the first and last I destroyed her, she was not happy and would not play again, lol.  She was like the 1 & 3 are the most important spots, I tried to explain they are great in the beginning, but it is about the top spots, IMO., and twice I controlled both 8 spots, fun game, want to play it some more!

Got in 5 game with Matt, a very smart game, will play this one more

At first, I liked the graphics. The rules were simples yet there's place for a bit of strategy and bluffing.
I could not imagined like the gameplay based on the rules and the simplicity of the game itself but I had a good time. Played two games in a row (I had to have my revenge!)
I had a good time enough to sing a just made up song while beating my girlfriend. It's the first game of its kind I was playing, so maybe it helped me like it. Otherwise I could have been bored. It's a keeper!

The first two plays were in the era before I was commenting all my ratings. So here's a new comment on an old game. I think I didn't like this originally because it seemed to be pretending to be strategic when it was just random luck.  When I was coerced into playing it again, I didn't sweat the strategy and just accepted it as chaotic randomness with a touch of tactics. And hey, there's the game.

Hey, it's advanced War!  After reading the rules I thought this game looked just stupid, but after playing it I have to say it's not bad.  It's decent quick filler between games.

Interestingly enough, you need an opponent you can trust (not to lie) to play this game.  It's rare to see that built into the game mechanics these days.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

I bought Pecking Order on 2011, so it took me 4 years to play it. The reason was that I had such a low desire to play it, but I was pleasantly surprised. The game is better than I thought.

The game components and art are ok. The rules pretty easy and it plays very fast, so it is a good family game. You do have few interesting decisions (namely where to put your card) but it works. I think one of its best features is the short playtime per round. It had luck of the draw, but the idea of the game is to mitigate this luck by playing the card in the best spot. You can bluff a lot with this one.

Bottom line, I’m rating pecking order a borderline 6.0. I would play it again. It was much better than expected but I still sold it. The reason is that I’m trying to cull my collection so I can play the games I really like.

Tiny little cards.  They are like little tiles though.  My only complaint is they should have had different color backs per player but I banded them separately so it's no big deal.  This is a cute "filler" for two people if you only play a couple of rounds.  They are very quick but you have some neat decisions and the bluffing is good.

A perfectly cromulent game, I like the simplicity and quickness of the game, though it really seems like all kinds of other games (Cordoba, Double Agent) and it is not necessarily compelling enough for me to think to play it.

For some reason, I want to like this game... but I just don't. It has promise to be a bluffing strategy game, but usually just ends up being an exercise in blind guessing.

A brilliant two player game by Richard Garfield which has the distinct advantage of being very simple to explain and very fast to play. The theme and the artwork are immersive and it doesn't take much to imagine the birds flying off a branch or being eaten in one bite by the jaguar. 
It has plenty of tactical room to maneuver, a fair amount of bluff and just the right dose of luck to keep it exciting. There seems to be a distinct advantage in playing second.

This can also be created VERY EASILY using a standard card deck (A=1 K=13): Clubs to one player, Spades to another player. Then use Hearts for standard perches and 3 diamonds for the special perches.

HOWEVER, the deck is beautiful and may be worth buying.

very simple "battleline" card game of bluff / attack
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: A war type game for 11 different positions on a perch. You choose where your cards numbered 1-12 go and are only revealed if there's a conflict. Highest number controls the perch and the points at round end.

Played as: 2 player only

Pros: It's only a few rules more complicated then playing War as a child (that's to say it's easy to learn) but it makes a world of difference. Secret placement opens up opportunity for taking chances and bluffing and a small 13 card deck keeps it fast and interesting. Just the right amount of small add-ons (like the tie-breaker perch and jaguar) don't over-complicate matters but fit it nicely and add to a very nice package. 

Cons: There's a certain memory element to the game that isn't my favorite. My biggest concern is durability. Due to being fast and simple, it's the shallowest of secret deployment games I've played and likely has less depth because of it. One little scuff to just one card will render the game essentially useless. While the cards are about as sturdy as they come it's not on the level of what you see in other secret deployment games like Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation (plastic stands) or Hammer of the Scots (wooden cubes).

Other: I think the game fits in nicely between Lost Cities and Battleline since it has more confrontation than the former but remains light-hearted as compared to the latter. Plus, the bluffing aspect makes it stand apart from eather one. 

Best Use: An easy, fast, secret-deployment bluffing game for two when you feel like matching wits as much as competing with cards.

Nice game with this particular mechanic I like - a single deck of cards which is cycled through only once, and once the card is played, it's played.  This game reminds me a little bit of Battle Line.  You draw the next card from your deck and put it on a scoring space, which range from high to low.  If the opponent also has a card on the space, you compare them to see who wins.  The winner is the person who has scoring spaces with the highest total value at the end of the game.  The theme is a bunch of birds occupying more or less desirable perches, so you get some nice artwork of exotic birds.  I'm not sure how they decided that a cockatiel is more powerful than a parrot (or whatever).

Very light filler game that feels a bit like a mashup of Lost Cities and Hol's der Geier. It plays quite quickly and offers some sneaky fun (you never play just one round), but it stays in between the two games above without ultimately revealing the intricacies of any of both. 

There's otherwise a bit of a flaw - even though normally the players are supposed to be honest games shouldn't allow too many occasions for cheating. Here the only thing players still need to do so is an explicit invitation.

The mechanics of any bluffing game are going to be clunky, and if you reveal something by mistake, it has a huge impact on the game. Meanwhile, the artwork is nice, and the components are high quality. People either hate this game, or claim that it's better than Lost Cities.

I don't think it's better than Lost Cities, but then again, it's an ok game. Should it be outside of the top 1000? Probably not. Does it belong in the top 250? No.

There are better games, but it's good, quick filler for two.

This is a fantastic game. Quick once learned. Re-playable. Fun for everyone.

Many people I know consistently ask to play this game when they come over.

I keep Pecking Order on hand anytime we are doing an event, or playing a game that involves kicking players out or losing early, so they have something fun to do while waiting.

It makes a good in-between game between bigger games, and a good I-dont-have-a-lot-of-time game if your are running the show. 

Often while running game nights and movie nights I find myself teaching Pecking Order to people, and then they run off with it for an hour, lol.

The only thing keeping it at 9.9 instead of a 10 is this:

There should have been a 3 or 4 player board with adapted rules :)

***
Our House Rules
***
1) 1st turn choice. After shuffling, but before your First Turn: Draw the Top 2 cards, look at them, and put them back on the top of your deck face-down in whichever order you choose.

This is to give players some option on how to Start the game. It also prevents a scenario where a player must waste an important card on the first turn due to bad timing (such as a 12 or a Jaguar).

2) Point Change. We have found that the Vision Quest power, associated with the 3 point branch, is quite powerful. So powerful in fact, that is should only be worth 1 point instead of 3.

We have also found that the Tie Breaker power associated with the 1 spot is pretty much wasted. No one bothers with it because it is only worth 1 point. In conjunction with above, if it is assigned 3 points, it suddenly becomes quite an interesting branch indeed.

So: switch the powers of the 1 point branch and the 3 point branch, that is, the 3 becomes the Tie Breaker (where a defenders tie wins) and the 1 becomes the vision quest (where the 1st player on it can look at any card once per game). Or switch their respective point values. same diff.


These changes have made Pecking Order into a much more strategic and balanced game. Rock.

Extremely quick playing two player game. Very simplistic, though. At first glance it reminds me of some of Knizia's two player card games- Battle Line and Lost Cities. Playing it, though, it lacks the agonizing decisions of Knizia's creations and replaces it with simple, limited bluffing and blind guessing. Strategic points on the branches create some interesting points of contention, but choices mostly seem fairly obvious and tough choices come maybe once or twice a game.

Pecking Order is a simple bluffing game where players use the exact same hands to compete for perches with different point values. Players draw cards one at a time though, and must then either occupy an empty perch or challenge one of the opponent's birds for an occupied perch. Different perches are worth different amounts of points, and there are a few special perches. Occupying the "Tie Breaker" perch allows you to win all ties, even if you are the defender (who normally loses ties), and the "Vision" perch (I can't remember the whole name right now) allows you one peak at an opponent's bird (birds are played face down). You might think of Pecking Order as occupying the same "space" as many of the two-player Kosmos line, such as Caesar and Cleopatra, Hera and Zeus, etc., and I suppose it fits in with that group of games. But it is a little bit quicker/simpler than most of the Kosmos two-player line, and I confess to really liking it as a light, two-player bluffing game. Also, I think the art is beautiful, and the match of theme to game play is excellent.

Quick, fun game, that is easy to learn.  Requires a little bit of strategy and a bit of bluffing.  Should be in your 2-player library with Battleline, Lost Cities, and a Mystery Rummy game or two.

A nice game, sort of like Battle Line with bluffing (and less tension).

The board is placed with its 11 perches (1-10, 2 8s) between the players. Each player has 13 tiles (1-12, jaguar) which are shuffled into a face down draw pile. On your turn, you draw a tile and play it face down on your side of a perch, max 1 tile/perch/player. If the other player already has a tile there, it is flipped face up and you announce who won. The higher numbered tile wins, with ties going to the attacker (current player) unless defender controls perch #1. The jaguar kills/scares any bird it's against, but is then itself discarded. If you win perch #3 (with a bird, not jaguar), you may look at one of the opponent's face down tiles. Alternate turns till both players have played all their tiles. Get points = perch #, with bonus 3 points if you control both perches #8. After 4 rounds, the player with the most points wins!

Like Battle Line, there's some tension about where you should play the card (tile) you draw. But since you play tiles face down you can bluff at will! You also have a few special locations -- the 1, 3, and 8 perches -- that make the game more interesting. Should you use your high values to secure #1 (winning ties could be very nice), despite it only being worth 1 point? Should you spread out hoping to outguess/bluff your opponent, or fight for the high-value perches?

I've only played 1 partial game -- we forgot our scores after round 2! -- but this seems to be a pretty good light game; looking forward to playing it some more!

Made a blind purchase when I saw it at a Goodwill. Saw Richard Garfield's name on it and thought it was a steal for $6. Was disappointed to open the box to find two sets of cards that are basically numbered 1-13 with a two-sided board with boxes on each side also numbered 1-13. You can easily play this by mapping the cards to a standard French deck, which coincidentally also has 13 cards in each suit. Also just not that interesting of a game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a good one to keep handy to play.  It's fun and you can easily knock out 3 or 4 rounds in 30 minutes.  It has some surprisingly difficult choices early in the game, but card counting lessens the tension as the game progresses.

If you don't play often enough, you'll find that you will give away "equal" contests as your eye flick over to see who has the tie-breaker spot.  If you want to mitigate this, just make sure both of you take a 1-count pause before the attacker declares a winner.

The art work on the cards is worth the price of admission, although I dislike having the cards so thick as I like to shuffle, not mix on the table.

Quick filler game. Can be fun if you put a little thought into it (but not too much) but always feels like you're just getting started when it's over. Great to play with the kids. Teaches higher/lower numbers, memory skills, bluffing (somewhat) and a little bit of strategy along with a little bit of luck.

RATING: 6
This is a quick little bluffing/deduction game, which I suck at. Nice quality cards for what is really a simple quick game. Players each play the same cards to the tableau trying to play the higher card. Only the defender reveals his card, so there is some element of trying to deduce what the other player played.

Clever game, but one more about reading your opponent and trying to deduce where he is playing his cards. There is some luck involved, but not enough control for my tastes. On the plus side, it is very quick, and so I would play it as a filler.

RATING: 9
Simple mechanics and game play.  Deep strategy. Like.  1 value perch is silly.  Perhaps move the 'tie breaker' perch somewhere else.  Seems like a bit more play testing could have been done... but we will see after a bunch more plays.

RATING: 5
On the downside this isn't the deepest or most challenging game ever designed, and it wears thin pretty quickly. The plus factors: it's streamlined, elegant and quick - really quick at under five minutes per hand and perhaps only 10 minutes or so for an entire (four-round) game. That's a great filler length that not many two-player games fall into. It is going to become a top-tier favorite for me? No, but it fills a niche and I'd be happy to play this now and again.

RATING: 6.5
A game of pure bluffing.  Not really comparable to Lost Cities or other 2p games.  Perhaps closest related to Raj.  If you like bluffing this is a great game.  My problem with it is that it's only bluffing.  I love Clans and Lord of the Rings Confrontation, both of which have bluffing as well as other elements.  Both are superior to this and both are also fillers.  Pecking Order is more like a super filler.  So if you're short on time and want a bluff game, this is it.  Raj is also another option.

This is a game that rewards changing tactics.  If either player plays the same way from hand to hand the game will fall flat. 

It's not a game I'd want to play all the time, but it's a real good short filler.

Have to reduce my rating simply because, even though it does bluffing well, there just isn't enough there to warrant as much interest as Clans or LOTRC.

There's a game here but not enough of one to capture my attention.  It's a bluffing game and there are better bluffing games out there.  Each player has a hand of 13 cards numbered 1-12 and a Jaguar.  There are 11 perches valued 1-10 with two 8s.  If you control 3 of the perches they give you special powers, the 1 lets you win ties, the 3 lets you view a single opponents perch and the 2 8s if controlled by one person are worth 19.  You take turns drawing a card and placing it face down on a perch.  If there is already a bird on the perch, the defender turns their card over and the attacker announces who wins.  Ties go to the attacker if noone controls perch 1.  If the attacker wins he leaves his card face down otherwise the defender leaves his card face up.  If either is a Jaguar both cards are discarded.  You play 4 rounds.  We only made it through 2.

(7/09)  Had been looking at getting this after seeing so many comparisons to Lost Cities.  I can see the similarities, but it is different enough and adds more bluffing into the game.   You might want to try before you buy since YMMV.  I can always use a easy to teach, quick, 2p game and this fits the bill.

It's Lost Cities meets Raj, with a blackjack element to it, though without the betting.  Though, I suppose you're betting on your opponent not playing the card that's going to kill your own.  It's a 10-minute game, if you ignore the multi-round rule of the game, but it's not a 2-player game I will think to take with me to play.  So far, I have enough 2-payer games that don't get enough love as it is, and I will choose to play these over this one every time.

I love this game, but it's a bit shallow. The first key to the game is realizing that you should always place your first card on the highest number, no matter what it is. After all, it represents the biggest boost in points and tells your opponent nothing about what the card is. After this, the game's mystique dwindles a bit and play becomes much more mechanical.

There is also a pretty clear disadvantage to going first. Since the game is best 2 out of 3, the person who goes first in the first game is at a big disadvantage if both players are reasonably good. Still, this can be fixed by playing 4 games instead, and just counting the spread in points each time. Played this way, I almost never lose, so the game is not without some depth.

[b][i]Pecking Order [/i][/b]is a simple to learn and simple to play game, and the bluffing and second guessing required fit nicely in the short timespan, typically 10-15 minutes for four rounds with a speedy opponent. The low numbers make great scouts in the mid-round in order to set up later strikes, and sometimes they manage to hold onto top spots simply because the opponent is convinced that attacking there is fruitless. Caw!

Immortal Eyes Games brings us a quick, intense mind game.  The cards are of a thickness halfway between cards and tiles, and the cards, board, instructions, and box all sport gorgeous artwork.  As the box claims, this game is an excellent "warm-up" game, and is perfect for those relatively short stints in which you want to play something quick, but suspenseful and satisfying.

For the length of the game (really short), and setup time (the time it takes to unfold the board, provided you keep the players' cards separate), this is a great game to grab to fill a few minutes.

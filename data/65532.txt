I don't like co-ops but they can make good solo games and this one has a bit more meat on it than many; however, it is way too hard for me. I lost within the first couiple of turns the first time I played it!

Pandemic with monsters. Not particularly original, but not bad either. Only the fact that you're not moving cubes but monsters adds some fun :)

RATING: 6
I'm a bit iffy on this one after my first play.  I've heard this game called "Pandemic with dice", but let me tell you, I know Pandemic, and you, sir, are no Pandemic.  In Pandemic, if you play even halfway competently, you'll almost never lose very early in the game.  It is always a slow death in Pandemic, which I like.  In my one play of this game, we dispatched two enemy bosses with relative ease, but then lost when we drew two movement cards for another boss within the span of about 4-5 cards.  I looked through that deck afterward, and there wasn't another movement card for that boss for another 18 cards, which would have been 3 full rounds for the three of us.  It felt very anti-climactic, and I'm not sure if there's anything we could have done better to avoid the defeat.  The loss left a bitter taste in my mouth, unlike Pandemic, which usually leaves me wanting to play again to get my revenge.

Some people complain that the shuffle of the deck in Pandemic can make a game over before it starts.  I don't know how likely that is, but I always FEEL like I have a chance to win in Pandemic.  After my first play here, I don't feel like we could have won this game.  It feels to me like the way the enemy deck is designed, you are highly susceptible to the luck of the draw, much more than in Pandemic.  And in Pandemic, you there are ways you can stem the tide.

I'm definitely willing to give this game more plays, but right now, it feels like it pales in comparison to the game it is often compared to (and which is also my favorite game), Pandemic.

UPDATE: Played it a second time. This time we got to 3 dead bosses before one card draw from the Darkness Spreads deck added a dozen goblins to the board, exhausting the supply.  Again, the ending felt anticlimactic.  Sure, we could have spent more time cleaning out the enemies, but this particular card added a goblin to each location with exactly one goblin. Must we clear every single goblin out of most locations to avoid this kind of loss?

Maybe our strategy needed work, but I can't help but feel like the outcome of this game is too random for my liking.

Not quite what I was looking for, but a step in the right direction. Very much a fantasy themed pandemic.

I was hoping for pandemic with Runebound characters and advancment. What I got was Fantasy pandemic. There are differences, but they aren't striking enough justify owning both games. DotR adds a bit of complexity and a bit of theme, but also adds a long set up/teardown time, and well complexity. I still think Pandemic is the better game. DotR could have been, if it had gone full blast towards a more thematic experience.

RATING: 9.5
This game is underrated and under-appreciated for some inexplicable reason.  I understand people quibble about the design choices -- the artwork, the minions, etc., -- but the gaming value is top-notch and the production is solid.   Rich co-operative gameplay that doesn't take forever....provides interesting teamwork while minimizing downtime.   Some learning curve with the rules, but I think it's the presentation in the rulebook more than anything else;  the organization is okay but the wording is often verbose while lacking clarity -- two cardinal sins of rules-writing....

Fantasy version of pandemic that relies on dice to save you.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a good co-op that will remind people of Pandemic a bit. You're constantly trying to balance quests and keeping the horde at bay. A little bit more luck-dependent because of the dice, but still a great game. It's just a tad long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An Ameri-Trash version of [thing=30549][/thing], so much so that I was using Pandemic terminology throughout the game (outbreak/infect).  But the random element of combat and requiring cards to fight the generals is far superior to Pandemic's automatic cube removal and disease cure.  It is probably too long -- to the point that the length starts making the enjoyment decrease, but that may be due to the additional dice rolling, which makes it superior to Pandemic (along with the plastic).

RATING: 6
+ Hands down, better than Pandemic on all accounts; Very tense gameplay with victory usually hanging in the balance through the last few turns.
- Takes about 30-45 minutes longer than I want to spend on a game where I usually get screwed by a dice-roll in the last few turns.


Why it's previously-owned:
I was so excited about a bigger, more dangerous Pandemic, but the big problem with this one was that it just took too long to play.  Most of my friends like co-ops, but no one wanted to spend all night playing one game of this.
I gave this game away to a friend who was the one who was always suggesting that we play it before he usually was shot down.  Ghost Stories has definitely remained our co-op game of choice.

RATING: 9
Pandemic without the reshuffle of the discard pile and with an awesome theme and some awesome theme-based powers (which works out very nicely).  It's fun to play and the dice are a nice addition - you'll win or lose on your rolls.  Quests are good to provide some push-pull on the larger target of wiping everything clean.  Expansions are nice, too, for the added characters and stuff and whatnot.  A really good coop!

RATING: 7
Really fun, but feels a little long for what it is.  Less elegant than Pandemic which it borrows heavily from.  I like the high fantasy theme and the different characters.  They don't really feel that BALANCED, but keeping that in mind, taking different characters can be used as a light hand to modify difficulty levels.

One thing I DON'T like is how the quests work in that some are very easy and can give you can AMAZING bonus and others end up being incredibly difficult and give you something you didn't want and will never use.  This would ruin a competitive game, but it is tolerable in a coop.

A great high fantasy game. Trying to fend off the four armies approaching the kingdom while destroying enemy units scattered throughout the map and collecting resources to destroy the enemy leaders is tense, challenging and fun. This is a great cooperative game for a small group.

Thank you, 2013 Santa!  Loved it! Such a beautiful game, and we had a great time playing it.  We lost unexpectedly, but I can't wait to rally again.

RATING: 7
Pros: 
Fun to play, if a little repetitive.
The Heroes have varied and interesting abilities.
Quests are fun.
The designer obviously had fun doing this.
Theme is well-integrated.

Cons:
I know fans don't like discussing this, but this is too much of a Pandemic clone. I get that most games are "inspired" by others, but there are limits. Here, you can clearly *see* Pandemic under all the chrome. The designer should have worked a bit more to change the basic mechanisms (like the overrun + tainted mechanics) to make the game less derivative.

Also, all the chrome really adds to the playing time. To balance this, the designer should have reduced the number of Generals by 1, to keep things under control. The way the game plays, it's just not worth the time investment.

I will add that while Elmore's art is nice, the graphic work isn't (back of cards, etc). The game has a really "cheap" look to it. Also, the figurine quality is so-so (I like the minions, however, as they are easy to handle in quantity).

Am I happy with the game? Yes, I'm glad I've played it, but frankly, had I known it was a Pandemic knock-off, I probably wouldn't have bothered. I'm also glad I didn't have to pay for it, otherwise I would have been disappointed by the gameplay. I'm not that great a Pandemic fan that I need to play many iterations of it...

A fantasy-meets-Pandemic co-op. Very difficult indeed for two characters to win, the game seems to be designed for 4 characters. (So in 2p, take two characters each).

I do generally prefer games where the rules are cleaner and tighter, but in the right mood, with the right group, this is good fun.

RATING: 7
I'll confess.  I am a huge co-op devotee.  

So combining a game with many similarities to Pandemic and a fantasy theme as a co-op, really ticks all my boxes.

A fun game that makes great use of the Pandemic mechanism of armies of darkness spreading like diseases across the map.  Working as a team of heroes you must work separately and together to defeat the evil lords and their numerous minions.

Lots of lovely components to play with packed into a big box, gives the game a weight feel.

As much as I love the game and theme, the board itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Messy, over bright and it is very difficult to find many similar locations.  The rules booklet is possibly one of the worst I've seen and in desperate need to a decent re-write.  Illogically structured with crucial information virtually hidden.  You spend half the time flipping back and forth trying to find answers to the most basic questions.

The game says 90 mins.  Unlikely.  More like 2 hours minimum.

Those minor points aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game that plays well and carries the theme along nicely.  Highly recommended for fantasy and co-op fans.

RATING: 6
A luck-based pandemic. While it's not a bad thing in itself, it has some problems, as a really too-luck related boss fights. 
It has qualities, too: you really feel like a hero with guts and skills, and each one really feels different.

The main default of the game is the downtime: it's really difficult to find the places where you add the minions on the map, and you spend a lot more time doing this than actually playing with your character. 
The other one is a really bad compatibility with the expansion: four decks almost identical by pairs, not that much compatible new generals and minions, unless you make a lot of setup...

That's the reason why it doesn't hit the table often.(that and because it's in english only). 
It's a better solo game than multiplayer. In multiplayer, it only feels like a heavier in a bad manner) and random Pandemic. 

In solo player, this game can be enjoyable, because the heroes are really different from each others, and the fantasy theme shines.

Fantasy flavor of pandemic with a few extra game mechanics
I prefer this to pandemic due to the theme and added mechanics which add an additional depth pandemic does not possess.

Play times are longer than pandemic.  Those not into a fantasy theme will most likely not enjoy this title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's Pandemic with orcs and dragons. Oh and dice rolling. All these things combine to make it a fun game but it just cannot live up to the game it so obviously owes itself to. Plus despite it saying it is a 1-4 player game we dare you to try it 1 or 2 player. It destroyed us mercilessly every time. We now play with 2 characters each making it basically a 4 player only game. Not tried it with 3, might work. That said we are still holding onto our copy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This really just feels like a longer and more luck reliant version of Pandemic. It introduces dice to the game and relies on the dice rolls to damage and ultimately kill the mosters on the board. 

For me I'd prefer to play 2-3 games of Pandemic or switch prior to playing this game; however, I do like the theme.

Box is also a large/awkward fit I reserve for games such as Kemet.

Nach allem was ich auf BGG zu diesem Spiel finden konnte (und das ist eine ganze Menge an Informationen) scheint Dieses Koopspiel Spiel habe ich mir vor allem fürs Solospielen zugelegt. Ich mag Pandemie und ich mag Fantasy. Daher habe ich auch direkt die Erweiterung [thing=93899]Hero Expansion #3[/thing] mit 4 zusätzlichen Figuren gekauft. Den Shamanen habe ich schon immer sehr gerne auf dem PC bei Diablo II gespielt.  
Die kleine Erweiterung [thing=71674]The Barbarian[/thing] fügt eine starke Figur hinzu (Conan lässt grüssen).

This is what you get when a rogue dragon eats your pandemic game.

Brutally hard out of the box yet the game never fails to be enjoyable.  Games can be short, but mostly they go down to the line and you will feel that there was always a slight chance to pull out a win.  (They even say that its possible to win!)  The game differs from Pandemic in that each player's turn the player will feel that they can take direct action without the tight coordination that Pandemic requires.  Player cooperation is key when taking out a general, but the build up to that gives the players more individual control.  Enjoyable play, but be prepared for the game to play long.

Fantasy Pandemic, and it works quite well, giving you the feel of an old 80s D&D campaign through the Elmore artwork, and offering tight, tough strategy as your heroes race around to stop the spread of these four evil overlords and their minions. I think the newer version, Last Stand, offers a lot more to do, but it can often feel a bit too fiddly for some folks, so this is the natural alternative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Sort of like Pandemic meets Lord of the Rings with optional individual victory conditions. More interesting and more fun than Pandemic but is knocked down a point for dragging on too long. Unlike Pandemic which can easily be played within an hour, DotR can drag on for 2 or 3 hours.

First introduced to me by a classmate whom was also very interested in board games, Defenders of the Realm is a heavily cooperative game that involves communication, strategy, and teamwork when attempting to defeat the generals. The unique character sheets and abilities allowed for varied gameplay. Although I find that some characters hit the table more often than others, this game is still fun in the fact that you aren't quite sure if you should defeat minions to protect the land from being tainted or gather cards to eventually face the boss. Minions can and tend to inhabit the spaces on the board pretty quickly if a spot is overrun. I highly recommend this game. It's intriguing, and I see tons of expansions available to this game. Definitely one of the games higher up on my list to hit the table.

If it had not Pandemic all over it I would probably give this a bit better rating. But as it is I can never see me choosing to play the more random, chaotic, longer with bigger downtime version of Pandemic rather than Pandemic itself.

A co-op game should crush the players the first (first few) time they play it. This one doesn't and because of that leaves no desire to return to it, learn the strategies, get some revenge etc.

Excellent, well-rounded game. Love the vintage fantasy feel; the gameplay is smooth, and there are multiple areas of focus for your attention, which keeps you thoroughly engaged.

This is a great game. As you can read below, I'm a big Pandemic fan, and this game has a lot in common with it. It is very different, though. There is a significantly larger amount of luck involved in Defenders. This, to me, is not a good selling point. However, it also has a wonderful fantasy theme. If you can enjoy games based on the feel and mood, rather than strictly on game play, this game can easily overwhelm Pandemic.

This is so far one of my Favourite co-op games.  Introduced my brother and soon to be brother-in-law how to play and they became hooked.  They wanted to keep playing as we kept losing.  There is quite a bit of luck on the dice rolls, but managing your cards help to alleviate the bad ones that will occur.

My brother has figured out how to basically win almost every time now.  It is unfortunate that an expensive game like this became this easy after a month of play.

RATING: 9
Richard Launius has designed a very good cooperative game here. Big teamwork elements (group fights!), a great flow of play and an elegant design makes it a challenging game with less downtime and a lot of tension. I really like the status of war idea, so that the game will become harder after making progress.

The replay value is huge because of the random setup, the card mechanics and the dice rolling.

The graphic design is not the best though but the great mechanics make them negligible. Nonetheless the price is too expensive for the material you get.

But I really love the gameplay itself.

The gameplay itself is a pure 10.

After 3 years of initial 2 plays, I took the game out of the closet again and ... it rocks. It is indeed inspired by some mechanics used in Pandemic, but the theme suits me better and a LOT changed of course, like the boss fights and great Fantasy setting.

Initially I bought it because of Larry Elmore's art, but I am so glad I didn't trade it away and gave it a second look.

No sursprise I just managed to kill one boss though. The game is a beast to conquer.

Pros: Great co-op game.  Enough random elements to make it not a puzzle and plenty of monster killing.  Lots of cool-looking plastic minis.  Great looking board.  Just enough difficulty to encourage replay as opposed to shelving it in frustration.

Cons: All the minions are the same, just different colors.  Would have been nice for the different minions to have different figures.

Better than Pandemic. More variety, more for players to do. Some very questionable art choices (terrible fonts in particular) - the old school D&D style artwork is really let down by the general graphic design.

Defenders of the realm is a solid cooperative game with a fantasy theme.  Each player takes turn fighting monsters and completing simple goals for rewards ("quests") eventually building enough cards to take down the evil leaders which are marching toward the city.  Each player plays a unique character with a few special abilities (although no rpg-type leveling).  There is a larger element of luck involved than the often compared game pandemic although I have played both and they fill different cooperative-type gaming niches.  Well received by my gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I love pandemic and I also enjoy the fantasy theme but this game didn't work for me. There is a good kind of luck (Battle Cry, Catan, Stone age) and a bad kind of luck. When you save up cards for 40 minutes and attack a general with plenty of dice and then have one bad roll (effectively ending your game), that's the bad kind of luck. Minion battles are fun but the battles with the generals don't work for me. If the game took less time I probably wouldn't mind battling the generals as much. It is just too much effort for everything to come down to a single dice roll. I have mainly played 2 player games.

Favorite Co-op game.  Takes what I love about Pandemic and for me takes it to a whole new level.  Love the increased length without knowing exactly when it will end, the variety, and the controlled randomness.
Also love the theme and need for team work.
What makes this a 10 for me is the endless variety of gameplay.  Many of the rules are interpretive and hence open to lots of house rules.  Finially, I applaud Richard Launius for not only creating such a wonderful game but showing a tremendous degree of support including spending time to answer many questions about the rules, clearing up areas of interpretation.

Rio enjoys this and it is easy for him to deal due to the coop. It is hard for me to say whether I like this more than pandemic or not. Pandemic being the innovator, I have to give it a nod and a whole lot of respect, but the theme of Defenders is somewhat more interesting, and there is more variety certainly.

I do have plenty of aesthetic complaints. The minis are completely sub-par...not really worth a spec of paint. The map is nicely painted but ruined by generic path dots that look completely out of place and difficult to read location names. This bothers me enough that I'm tempted to paint paths and names on my board...

RATING: 10
What really struck me at first about Defenders of the Realm was Elmore’s art on the box: I have been a fervid fan of his AD&D covers for all my roleplaying years and still love his paintings, so simply looking at this game’s box cover was like diving into my fondest memories. Yet I knew very little about the game itself: I read it was a good fantasy-themed cooperative but didn’t know much more, let alone how it actually played. Nonetheless I was quite easily convinced into blindly buying it and all of its expansions.

As soon as I started playing it though I realized how deeply thematic Defenders of the Realm is and fell in love with it at once: actually I long for thematic games and with Defenders of the Realm I’ve found one that perfectly suits my taste. It’s both enthralling and challenging while being neither too complex nor rule-heavy: moreover, its mechanics have been clearly designed to fit the setting and developed so carefully with it in mind that the game drips with theme off every rule.

And this is right what Defenders of the Realm better succeeds in: it tells a story, kindles the atmosphere quickly and sets up that sense of imminent danger that makes you really feel under siege.
It’s superfluous to say Defenders of the Realm has immediately become one of my all-time favourites.

Fantasy Pandemic?  Sure maybe at first blush.  The game has been expanded and pimped out quite well over the years.  I think it stands toe to toe with Pandemic and in some ways surpasses it.

I found it to pretty Pandemic-y, but with fantasy additions and twists. Dice combat, some more varied powers for the characters, and a big bad in each color make it a different game, though. But, the underlying system is pretty close. As I'm not the biggest Pandemic fan in the world, I'm probably not the target audience for this. LotR, Ghost Stories, and Space Alert really spoil me for new co-ops.

RATING: 8.5
A combination of Pandemic and Arkham Horror (with a rich fantasy theme), but I think it's better than both of those games, and very much it's own game in and of itself. In terms of gameplay time, it falls somewhere between the two, usually clocking in at 2 - 3 hours.
The game thrives on the willingness of players to talk to and coordinate with each other. If you've got a group that plays Pandemic as a bunch of vigilante warriors, don't bother with this one: You'll lose in 30 minutes, every time.
If not for the long playtime, this would make the core Pandemic game obsolete (and I am a huge, if somewhat burnt out, Pandemic advocate).

An okay co-operative game that has many similarities to Pandemic, but it's more complex because each person has multiple special powers, the monsters (unlike disease cubes) are not automatically removed (you must roll dice), movement seems to be easier, and there are penalties for ending your turn in the same space with monsters (disease cubes).  I'm not fond of the need to save massive amounts of cards to make attacks on the generals.  Also, it lacks some of the sense of urgency that I feel in Pandemic because the supplies of monsters and taint crystals are large and do not run out as quickly as disease cubes in Pandemic.

RATING: 7
What a fun game. It has received many fair comparisons to Pandemic, but while I don't care for Pandemic, I love DotR. Whereas Pandemic's elegance and cleanness feel cold to me, what DotR adds is a sense of theme and camaraderie that warms the cooperative experience. The characters really do feel different as they move, decide tactics, and fight. The villains do make the contest seem personal. Teaming up to know a big baddie out is very satisfying. I also love Arkham though in AH characters mostly are on their own, coordinating usually only for item trades. DotR brings them together for several "all for one" final battles sprinkled throughout the game. Finally, as has been acknowledged gratefully by many, the designer, Richard Launius, has been extraordinarily generous in his support of the game with vigilant question answering and several free uploaded scenarios. Recommended.

Update: I've bought it down to an eight where it will rest for now. For a narrative, I think Robinson Crusoe is unmatched. For exploring geeky themes, Eldritch Horror trumps the generic fantasy tropes here. Still, it's probably my favorite "teamwork" game, capable of eliciting more genuine high-five moments than any other game in my collection.

Update: Down to a seven as there is so much tough competition out there for co-op games. I wish the backstory were more compelling rather than being so generic fantasy. Still a good, solid co-op game.

RATING: 6
Summary: As a game, it's really quite fun, although it seems a little too difficult (so far). Quests and immersive theme are pluses. Graphics are not so nice but ultimately they don't affect the gameplay for me. They just leave me wishing the game was a bit prettier. Recommended!

-----

As many have said before, the design and components leave a good deal to be desired. The Comic Sans is just unforgivable, and the lack of detail in the minis is a little disappointing for a game in this price range.

It could be argued that the design and components might be detrimental to the overall experience, but those things don't really matter much once I start playing. I will say, however, that better-designed components would bring up this game to an 8.5 or 9 for me.

The game itself is just a blast! To date, I've played two games solo and two with other players; it seems to work best with 1 or 4 (splitting four heroes between 3 people is lame), but 2 works well, also. 

Very difficult - haven't won yet! - it almost seems that the game designer is a little bit masochistic! The designer has made it clear in many threads that he enjoys house rules, but I don't like them very much. I may change a rule or two if I play a few more games and still don't win. But it seems possible... (See EDIT: feelings have changed) It's still fun to play, regardless of whether or not you win, simply because of the narrative that plays out as the characters fight tooth-and-nail to defend the realm!

In some ways similar to Pandemic, but the immersive theme and addition of Quests just makes this game that much more exciting to me. Thumbs up if you can get it for ~$60 or less! 

PS - Listening to epic fantasy film music is a must when playing this game! 

EDIT: Score brought down from 8 to 7. Time away from the game, and more experience with other various boardgames, has impressed upon me the long playtime and frustratingly difficult nature of this game. If I'm going to play a game that takes 2+ hours, at least make me feel like it's possible to win... Seems I used to feel that way, not sure I do now.

EDIT: Score dropped even lower.

RATING: 8
Not many coop games out there and this one rocks, even though the sculpts of the bosses and heroes are mediocre (the cultists rule!).
It is slightly easy though, with about 70% change to win the game when you play with experienced coop-game gamers (LotR tbg, Pandemic). There rules in the basic book too make the game harder, so this is okay.
P.S. For comparison: Pandamic has a 90% win ratio, or is with 6 pandamic cards completely random and no fun, LotR also has a 70% win ratio with Friends and Foes at normal difficulty, but still a tough nut (10-20% win ratio) when Sauron starts at space #10.

A great implementation of the ideas set forth in Pandemic.  I'm not one of those who will totally put Pandemic on the shelf now that I have DOTR, but it will certainly see much less play now that I have it.  The addition of dice and the fantasy theme take this one a few notches higher for me.  It just seems like you have so much more you can do than in Pandemic, and the different classes really change the game...more so than the specialists in Pandemic IMO.  Great fun and highly replayable.  The Hero expansions add even more variability.

If only the rules were more clear.  Even after several games I still find myself visiting the Geek from time to time to search for answers on the FAQ and on the game's message board.  It's mainly a simple game but there are confusing situations that arise from time to time.  This might be the only aspect keeping it from a 10 for me.

Also FWIW, it's a hit with the wife.  Always a plus.

Borrows heavily from pandemic, but in a good way. It is a solid game mechanically, but I do wish they had taken the time to better represent the theme in the game. In particular the quest deck would have benefited from more cards, proper descriptions and more interesting rewards. The art style may also not appeal to everyone, they made some rather strange art choices such as liberal use of comic sans font and using colour schemes that either can't be seen properly or stand out for no good reason.

Somewhat similar to Pandemic, but has enough differences to make it still interesting as its own game. Strategy-wise it feels less "straightforward" compared to Pandemic.

The visual design of the game materials in regards to usability (or "player experience") could be improved a bit; Pandemic is much better in that regard. Still quite a nice game, though.

Played twice with two players. We have yet to defeat a single general. Don't know if this will get better over time but it's frustrating to take five turns collecting 7 cards to fight a general, only to have to discard them and do one point of damage because of bad die rolls. Annoying. I might as well play Risk.

UPDATE: We were playing a crucial rule wrong! Now, this is a decent little Pandemic knock-off. Doesn't hold a candle to Pandemic, though...

Fun co-op game.  Runs a little longer than I prefer, but is engaging throughout and has some very enjoyable moments when something random causes all hell to break loose and the heroes have to scramble to keep from losing.

A co-operative game with a fantasy setting and dice rolling for results. The randomness and the story background is very appealing to the kids.

This game completely blows. It's amazing how you can take a great game like Pandemic, rip off the unimportant bits, ignore the crucial bits, and end up with an atrocious game. This is a design which is completely tone-deaf to important concepts of pacing, tension management, and narrative. Instead of the interesting organic threat growth of Pandemic, we just have a game of random stuff happening for two and a half hours.

I mean come on, what the hell was he thinking to take a cooperative game, rip off so much, and then *not* allow players to trade resources? What would Pandemic be like if you could never transfer cards in search of a cure? It would be dumb. Yes, I know, characters can combine their cards when facing down the bosses, but it still just comes down to drawing the right cards in the right hands, there is nothing you can do to accelerate the process, you're either going to get the cards or you aren't.

Back when Shadows over Camelot came out, the fact that it was a merely mediocre game was so frustrating when it followed on the heels of Lord of the Rings, borrowing so much that was not really that important while failing to observe what it was that made the original game great. Once again with Defenders we have a designer basically ripping off a great game while utterly failing to comprehend what it was that made Pandemic so good in the first place, and turning out an overwrought, brutally overlong monstrosity that aspires to be mediocre.

And just to be clear, this is not theme vs. mechanics, American vs. European. Defenders is a crappy game with crappy theme, no tension, no arc, and no narrative.

Plus, $85 list? Seriously? The production is the usual Eagle over-produced but under-thought. The game is straightforward but the rules are unclear, sometimes confusing, and often make no sense. Quest, character, and card balance is wildly uneven. Colors are mismatched (they're still having trouble with purple apparently; the cards the rules refer to as purple really aren't purple). The typesetting on the rules is amateurish. Usability is not at a premium, and it honestly isn't even all that attractive.

Wow. First impression are, they really did rip the hell off of Pandemic. It seems like an intriguing game, but it's hard to get past the amount of direct mechanical copying that was done here. Maybe after playing it I'll feel different - as I did for Thunderstone - but it really does seem a little nuts. What do you expect from Eagle Games, I guess. Novel ideas do not feature heavily amongst their output.

My suggestion to designers and publishers on this is that you can seem like a lot less of a dick if you give some credit where credit is due, in a "special thanks" or whatever. Obviously, the line between imitation and variation is not well defined, but both Thunderstone and Defenders of the Realm could have used something like this.

$67.95 from Germangames.com

I played 2 solo games and one with 3 others.  For the solo games I used 3 characters and it was tough.  The first game I played several rules wrong but was still fun.  I lost the first due to needing to add Orcs to the board and was missing one.  

The second game was also a loss because the Orc commander made it to Monarch City.  This was fun, but anti-climatic.  I would suspect this ending condition always will be.

The third game was also a loss but 3 generals were killed!  We lost due to insufficient taint markers.  The tension was high in this game and when we lost it was "Aaawww, man!" and super fun.

Great game and I'm looking forward to playing more and picking up some hero expansions.

This game is hard! Still have yet to win after 5 plays!  We must be doing something wrong :P  Still tremendous fun though.  Note to self: remember to get 3 cards each for killing a general for those involved!!! 

Plays 4 and 5 were at Hal-con 2011 where I demoed the game for new people!

Play #6 was played properly by drawing 3 cards for killing a general and we won!  Wizard, Paladin, Eagle Rider, and Rogue were used.

Play #7 was awful!  We lost to Gorgutt with bad die rolls and there were WAY too many minions on the board to deal with effectively.  We did end up killing two of the generals eventually, but lost to tainting.  Damn crystals.  Wizard, Rogue, Ranger, and Eagle Rider were used.

Play #8 was a solo adventure using the Errant Paladin (doubles are awesome!), the Barbarian, Ranger, and Eagle Rider.  There were definitely some times where I thought that I was going to lose, but I managed to pull off a victory finishing off Varkolack, then Balazarg, Sapphire, and finally Gorgutt.

Game #9 I tried with the 6 player variant and it was tough!  Definitely some ups and downs.  We managed to kill three generals but due to some bad timing, the 3rd took an extra turn (at the loss of a bunch of hero cards and one of our players!) which set us back.  Unfortunately, we died by taint!  We played with the Wizard, Cleric, Eagle Rider, Ranger, Errant Paladin, and Barbarian.  Barbarian was definitely the MVP.  Still have yet to play with the Sorceress.

June 5th 2012: knocked this down from 10 since it's REALLY hard!

I don't know why, but I don't really enjoy this game. It has that "meh" feeling, but I honestly cannot point exactly to why it makes me feel this way. It has the same mechanics as Pandemic, a game I like, but it just feels like something is missing. It's also a bit too long for what it is. Traded my copy away as I would rather play Pandemic, and they scratch the same itch.

It reminded me of Pandemic with a fantasy theme. I'm not really a fan of co-ops but the theme at least made it more interesting. I don't think we came close to winning though too hard is better than too easy. There are some ambiguities in the rules and the plastic figures are rather so-so.

As a co-op, it's a fun game.  But not really my kind of game, as I am not big on co-ops.  The one time I played was with a great group, but it was at a convention.  I don't think I will play it again, but that isn't because I don't like it.  It just didn't say "hey, play me again now".

Played its course. Ugly board with ugly pieces. Really fun to play but a rather embarrassing game to get out in public settings with non-gamers. After playing it enough times to feel burnt out on it I got rid of it. If I want a cooperative like this I will probably pick up Pandemic. The theme and pieces are just better for non-gamers.

I like Pandemic and was eager to see how this compares.

Generally, I prefer the theme. It's engaging and there is something exciting about seeing the monster bosses edge closer to your home base. We had the dragon boss one circle away from our city for a few turns. This introduced a lot of tension, and was great thematically. 

Mechanically, however, I think there are a few problems:

First off is the game length and predictability. We got really lucky with a lot of our cards in that the monster bosses rarely moved. While this is good for us - I could see how the luck of the draw can very much influence how long this game would take. If the bosses stay far away, we could afford to explore the other avenues of the game like questing or curing the land. If they are close, the game will end quicker as we either have to take them out or they reach the city. One thing I like about Pandemic is if you run out of cards to draw the game ends - that certainly puts a nice time limit on things and makes sure you keep the tempo up.

Second is the variability of the cards drawn - they are completely random. I like the mechanic in Pandemic where after an epidemic occurs the cities already drawn are more likely to get hit again. While I don't think DoTR is bad in this regard, I like how Pandemic introduces generally more stress.

Two other quibbles: I didn't like the fact the dying seemed to easy - just get a new character and start again. Seemed a little anticlimactic. Second, I really don't like the "one player can win the defender of the realm title" even though it's primarily a co-op. I didn't feel this really added much except that it would distract from the core game. We play without this.

Finally, thematically, I found it hard to believe that the bosses wouldn't attack of their own accord. This made them a little less intimidating then what I would like.

However, there are some improvements here as well:

I like how the minions represent a real threat to the heroes and can diminish their amount of actions. That really works with the theme and generally gives you more things to think about as you travel the realm.

I also like the mechanic of how the bosses move, although as I stated before I wish this was more predictable without ending the game to quickly. 

I also think the tainted land mechanic works well and reduces the sheer number of minions you would have to add on to the board (Pandemic style) otherwise.

Excellent game.  Not as streamlined as Pandemic but much more color.  I like it better for playing with my kids, since there are so many more options I don't find myself tempted to micromanage their moves.  The rulebook and cards, though, leave much to be desired in terms of clarity and numerous exceptions come up that are not addressed in the rules.  As of this writing there is a 19 page (!) official FAQ.  And people complain about wargame rulebooks...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The early going seemed pretty tough.  Played with a few of the "easier" suggestions, which made it more competitive and enjoyable.  As some successful strategies become apparent, this may not be necessary.  Obviously, this is a game where luck plays a pretty decent factor.  But, it is enjoyable.  I'm not really sure if this has legs or not.  I would say that Pandemic is probably the better game, and much cheaper to boot.  Would have rather seen this in a smaller, more cost effective package, but that isn't really the Eagle Games way.

Update:  One reason the early plays were tough - played some rules wrong due to too many Pandemic plays.  Particularly the setup, did three rounds of draws and placed far too many baddies initially.  As well, didn't read the fine print on the war status.  Playing with these rules made it a little easier, but it's still a tough game.  However, it's better balanced after more plays and we're starting to see how to win.  This is a fun, engaging game, and my rating could increase.

By the way, this game is not like Wizard's Quest, but the regular proliferation of Orcs and other baddies definitely reminded me of it.  This is sort of like Wizard's Quest filtered through two generations of game redesign.

The basics are the same, but minor rule changes do add a lot to the experience. I got the painted heroes, and they make the game a fun experience to behold. The tension that builds in this game can be quite exhilarating.

A solid-enough cooperative game doomed by terrible layout and design. A game like this, to me, relies on the theme and setting. I love Larry Elmore's art work but here it is ruined by garish overlay colors, hard-to-read font choices and unhelpful layout. I feel like there's not enough adventuring that can be done and the world and setting gets lost immediately. I don't know if I'll be playing again; downgrading to a 5.

Great game!  Played four solos with one or two heroes and a two-player now.  So smooth and intuitive.  Board and pieces are easy and fun to look at.  Standard challenge level is perfect.  Game gets tougher as you go (unlike Arkham's base game rules without variants).  Runs a bit long at three hours, but what the hell.  Solid.  Have Dragon expansion, but yet to play it.

Edit (a few days later) - Dragon Expansion is great too.  Makes game even better.  Two plays so far.  Going to get the other expansions.

Many games with Dragon expansion.  A must have.

Straight up Fantasy themed Pandemic. Played a two player game with standard rules, didn't end too well for us. Quests are vital with their bonuses in order to succeed (in our experience). Very nice flavor with each class and while it was difficult, we enjoyed it. Only real complaint is the font on the cards and rule book. Why the hell would you pick Comic Sans? You couldn't find a better fantasy themed font, let alone a better one in general? Docked 1 rating due to it. A slight blemish on an otherwise fun game.

Man, read all of the reviews and really thought this game was going to be cool. Checked it out at Geekway 2017 and a friend and I quit halfway through a game. Rules are terrible, there's no leveling up your hero, gameplay is super shallow and there's nothing to discover. I guess going into this thinking it was a "fantasy Pandemic" and maybe I would of enjoyed it more, but I went into it thinking it was going to a be an RPG-lite experience and it failed to deliver on all counts. Mostly this is just the rules. Good lord are they awful. When the FAQ is longer than the rulebook, you know something is up.

I do like the support the developer is giving it, by creating special scenarios to play through each month of the summer. Those are fun. But it really is a piss hard game. The sense of comradeship and togetherness that develops between the players playing against the board is great. It plays very similarly to Pandemic.

Components: Fun art; awesome miniatures (especially the generals). The board is way too big, and the locations on the board difficult to distinguish.

Experience: With 4 players:
Lots of fun. Much more enjoyable than Pandemic and Forbidden Island. It does a good job of evoking the fantasy theme. It doesn't quite have the “doom approaching” feeling of Lord of the Rings (the Knizia boardgame), but it is tense nonetheless.

We won our first game; there were some close calls, but mostly cool heads and steady rolls prevailed, leaving us to wonder if it isn't a bit too easy. Time will tell.

We played without the King's Champion winning condition, which completely contradicts the idea of a cooperative game. Either the game is cooperative, or it isn't. I dislike games that seem to think everyone losing isn't a tie. If I were playing this game competitively, I would view a mutual loss as a tie for the win, and would therefore only play to complete as many quests as possible.

Playing it cooperatively, I'm impressed with how it transcends the pseudo-cooperation of Pandemic, in which we can counsel each other, but don't need to work together too closely. In Defenders, we had to coordinate our turns to be in the right place together at the right time.

With 2 players:
Doesn't seem to work at all. There just aren't enough heroes on the board, or hero cards in circulation to stand a chance against the generals. We are able to keep the board from being overrun, but we played for over two hours before aborting, and with the board ending pretty much as we started, except for a few generals being within striking distance of Monarch City.

Only real complaints are that the pacing isn't as solid as Pandemic due to no real built-in timer, it's hard to locate areas on the map (although that improves with familiarity) and the graphic design leaves something to be desired.

I like it, but...

I'm starting to get to the point where all co-ops are feeling a bit samey. Obviously a lot of the mechanisms in Defenders of the Realm hail from Pandemic, so owning both games might mean each could cut into the other's ability to see the table. To be fair, there's more to do and see and play in DotR than Pandemic and the games all have a chance to feel a little different because of the multiple character choices and quest cards.

(If this had come out before Pandemic, I suspect I'd be rating DotR with an 8 and Pandemic with the 7.)

Update: Kicking it up to 8 anyway. Sure, co-ops are samey, but when you're in the mood, it's a lot of fun to play. Not a fan of the "King's Champion" aspect, though. It's hard enough as it is, so the last thing needed is a poor decision being made to get more victory points instead of making the necessary sacrifices.

And the creator of the game himself also keeps in touch with fans. I highly recommend getting this game!

Draw a couple of bad cards or make a couple of bad rolls and you have lost the game before it has started. Draw a couple of good cards and make a couple of good rolls and you could win the game without any drama or tension. Would probably rate the game 8.5 but the high price and randomness brings it down a bit for me.

Defenders of the Realm (DotR) takes Pandemic's base system, adds some luck with dice combat and transfers it into a fantasy setting. In the end, the whole package doesn't work for me as good as Pandemic does. DotR is less puzzle-like, it takes way longer but has less tension than Pandemic and just didn't grab me like Pandemic does.

Normally, I don't care for co-op games like Pandemic, Red November, etc.  However, I find myself really enjoying this one.  We played this for the first time last night, and lost badly.  Normally, that would have been it - put aside for another game.  But we played it again - and lost.  Amazingly, we tried it again - and lost.  You would think that we would have thrown up our hands in disgust, and thrown the game on the trash heap of unwanted games.  But you would be wrong.  We are eager to give it another go next Saturday.  I'm not exactly sure as to why, but something about this game just "clicked".  Now, I'm not going to run out and buy it, but I'm not going to turn down a chance to play, either.  

After another game session, I've decided that I really don't like this much.  I'm not into co-ops, especially when there doesn't seem to be a chance to win.

RATING: 6.55
A twist of classic fantasy game which is completely co-op. The board has a Runebound look, the characters are very classic fantasy type characters. The initial learning of the game is a bit confusing. It is not hard to play, but understanding how the board places enemies can be difficult to understand. This is an excellent game to play where everyone works together to fight the board. Currently its my youngest son's favorite game. I, however, don't find it very fun. I put in about 5 plays and have a hard time wanting to play it again.

I keep trying to come up with alternate rules to like this game, because I love the concept behind it; however, I just can't make this game work for me.  From my perspective, Legends of Andor is a Pandemic-style adventure game that blows this out of the water. (with expansions)

I still enjoy Pandemic and Forbidden Island, but for some reason I never cared much for Defenders of the Realm.  It is a solid game, but I just do not like it and you would be hard pressed to convince me to play it.  I am not averse to fantasy games, so I am not sure why I dislike this game.

RATING: 5
A good and interesting "variant" on Pandemic, it suffers mostly from being very long.  I find it takes more than two hours to play and it gets a little tiresome about two-thirds of the way into the game.  Though it has more interest than Pandemic, I think the original does a better job of hitting the mark with its much shorter game length.

RATING: 6
Players are fantasy heroes, fighting to defend Monarch City from the encroaching hordes of evil.  Players take turns around the table, taking actions for their hero.  Hero actions include moving, fighting minions and perhaps the "boss" minions, healing, drawing cards, etc.  Then, in good old cooperative faction, the deck of evil is flipped to add some bad stuff to the board, possibly creating a chain reaction and spillover of evil minions.  Added to that, the boss figures slowing advance on Monarch City, adding time pressure to the game.  Players win when the four bosses are slain, and lose in about six different ways.  Excellent fantasy cooperative, which borrows heavily from its cooperative ancestors - Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot, Pandemic, etc.  The States of Siege "octopus" is here too, with four tentacles along which the bosses advance, possibly ending the game if they reach Monarch City.  I enjoyed this - seemed to solitaire well, the rules seemed clear to me, and was engrossing to play.  Good game.

RATING: 6
I really like what they've done with the Pandemic foundation gameplay-wise.  This would be a must-buy for me if the graphic design was not so awful.  Maybe if it gets blown out on Tanga some day.... Better yet, I'd love to see a redesign - then I might pay the $85.

UPDATE: After playing, I found this to be a little less like Pandemic and a little more like Arkham Horror than I expected.  My favorite thing about that game is the way you need to balance fighting minions with removing corruption and gathering enough cards to fight the bosses.

I also really like the chunky minion minis.  I wish more minis were like this - more abstract and easily distinguishable on the board.  Alas, the heroes are of the unpainted, intricate, hard-to-distinguish variety.

UPDATE 2: I have decided that I prefer my Pandemic and Arkham Horror as separate games.  I loves me some dice, but I found the dice in DotR frustrating.  You can spend several turns getting together all the boss cards you can (plus a reroll card) and know it is likely you will win, but then get some bad rolls and lose.  The penalties are harsh, and the guy heals up to boot.  The second time this happened last game I was ready to throw the game out the window.  I get the epic feeling this game is going for, and I am sure it feels awesome when you win, but it seems like for the game length and production, it should be more strategic than it is (particularly the boss battles).  Not being able to trade cards between heroes is especially frustrating, as is the slowness of accumulating cards at the inns.

I am glad I tried this, and would be fine playing again, but I don't need to own it.

[i]Note: My feelings may be biased because I was a Defenders of the Realm playtester and a friend of Richard's, but what I say is true!  :D  Besides, Richard's support of his game has been nothing short of legendary and that has increased my rating accordingly. [/i]

Richard is on these boards seemingly non-stop answering rules questions.  As if that wasn't enough, Richard still finds some time to upload free publish-quality print-and-play variant expansions and scenarios to keep us happy.  If that isn't the very definition of awesome, then I don't know what is!  Richard Launius, you rock.  :cool:

Wow!  This game is filled with dripping themey goodness and is just fun as hell to play!  It's a fantastic solo game and the tension always builds right up until the last game ending die roll.  Richard Launius has captured something special with this one.  I will always respect a designer that has thematic reasons behind absolutely every single design decision; Richard has done this - and it shows!  :thumbsup:  

Each game feels different from the last and there are always new strategies to try and adventures to be had.  The combinations of Heroes, Generals, Quests, Minions, Global Effects, and Scenarios offered in the Expansion and free official PnP variants allow for an almost endless variety of gameplay and experience.

Oh yeah.  An imagination is required to truly enjoy this game for what it is.  I know some of you out there do not have one of these - so be warned!

Amongst my top 10 co-op games. Really great with 3-4 players. 
Hero expansions 1-3 is a must if you enjoy the base game. New cards and monster expansions are ok editions aswell to make variaty, but not a must.
Mechanics are easy to learn. Game is semi-hard but beat able. Drawing cards combined with dice combat makes it interesting everytime you play (Good replay ablility).

Tried 6 player game with expansions, but simply to much downtime to make it enjoyable then. Cant recommend unless everybody are experienced players which can keep up the phase I guess.

RATING: 6.5
After a second and third play (back-to-back), this title has dropped somewhat compared to my first play (and first impression).  This is a blatant rip-off of [thing=30549][/thing], but with an overused fantasy theme.  Having heroes with unique abilities, quests, Orcs, Undead, Demons & Dragons, the campaign feel of the game as a whole used to scratch a particular itch.  Like I say, used to.
One thing I've always enjoyed about (other) cooperative games, is the more poorly you do, the quicker the game ends, and that is where I think this one lacks.  Each play has taken at least 90 minutes - win or lose.  This is enough time to get lost in the campaign feel, only to realize your sudden demise (or win).
There are other co-op games I will choose over this title such as [thing=37111][/thing], [thing=30549][/thing], [thing=38453][/thing], [thing=37046][/thing], [thing=15062][/thing] - now that's some pretty stiff competition.  As such, it has dropped from a 7.5 to a 6.5 in my ratings.

After one play (four players). The overall game doesn't play like Pandemic, but the minion-spawning rules certainly feel like Pandemic.

I guess I was expecting something a little more RPG-like. We had minions that were hard to kill, so can I upgrade my Dwarf with a better attack? Nope. Can I choose a decent quest because this one sucks? Nope. Should I just run around and whack minions? Yep. It's a lot of dice rolling. I like the artwork, but the cards can be hard to read.

Suffice to say we died horribly.

Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative game set in a fantasy theme where players are heroes defending the kingdom against 4 marauding armies led by 4 dark lords all heading straight for the capital city.  DotR is often compared to Pandemic as many of the mechanisms are similar.  I understand not everyone enjoys the fantasy theme, so for those people, Pandemic may be the better choice.

I prefer DotR as it feels much more thematic.  Each hero has 3 very unique powers that make them play very differently from each other.  In addition, each general and their minions have different characteristics and abilities.  Heroes can also undertake quests to gain individual glory and gain a reward that can have lasting effects on the game.  However, questing will take precious time and resources away from suppressing minions, preventing overruns, and killing the generals, which is the win condition.

DotR gives players more choices than Pandemic.  Although some can see that as making the game less streamlined and adding to playtime, but others (like myself) find it more thematic and immersive.  DotR is also a bit more luck dependent as combat is resolved through dice rolls.

If you enjoy a fantasy setting and like cooperative games, DotR is a must try.  Definitely recommended!

I really really wanted to love Defenders of the Realm.  I like it and would consider playing it but overall I don't feel the need to own it.  Invariably people will compare this to Pandemic and I know that I couldn't play it without comparing the two.  The things that I like about this game, is that there's more things to do in this game than Pandemic as well as the added excitement of the dice rolling.  Unfortunately, here are the reasons [b]I'm[/b] trading it:

1) The graphic design.  I like the Elmore's portraits and scenery for the locations, but everything else could have been so much better.  I won't go into further details as this has been discussed to death.

2) The rules issues.  When your FAQ is longer than the rulebook, you know something went wrong somewhere.  This is also true of Ghost Stories and I can look past this issue but it's not as if there aren't other issues I have with the game.

3) Size and cost.  This is a big game that will take up a lot of space on the shelf and it's also very expensive.  I think a lot of co-op fans would already own Pandemic and thus would be better of spending their money on something more that's more unique, cheaper and takes up less space (ie Ghost Stories, Space Alert, etc).

4) I really felt the game was inflexible with the number of players.  With 2 the game feels way too hard unless you control 2 characters each.  I find controlling two each to be annoying as you have two hands of cards.  It's not so difficult in Ghost Stories as there are only tokens out in the open next to each player board.  With 4, it almost seems two easy as you just gather all four and gang up on a general and then get three cards each.  These cards should be enough for you to beat up the next general, and so on and so forth.  Three seems to be the best number to play with.  

5) I loved that each General and the Minions for each General were unique but the actual method of defeating the Generals annoyed me.  I felt like if you lose one battle against General then it's almost just as well to quit the game and take a defeat to save time as you're likely going to lose.  Maybe your millage will vary but in my experience if you lose a battle against one General then the Heroes don't win.

There are going to be people that go gaga over this game.  As for me, I prefer Ghost Stories for a co-op that takes about an 60 - 90 mins with dice rolling.  If I want something quicker, I have Pandemic, which has similar mechanisms but is less complicated for newbies as it's more elegant and streamlined.

This rating could change, but I don't think it will. This game has appealed to a large variety of "gamer types", as well as folks of different ages. I love to play it solo as well. I would almost mark it a 10, but the luck element gives it an ever so slight ding. You couldn't do without the card flipping and dice rolling though. Great game.

There is a definite "epic" feel to the game that most co-ops lack.

RATING: 7.5
Cooperative fantasy adventure game, designed by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror) and artwork by legendary fantasy artist Larry Elmore?  Count me in!  This brings a Pandemic-like cooperative engine to the fantasy genre, and features plastic miniatures, generals and characters with unique abilities (players choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, or Wizard), and individual quests.  The game revolves around the protection of Monarch City, which is being assaulted by four accursed races: orcs, dragons, demons, and undead, and players must cooperate to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat these four races before one of them enters his city.  There's been some criticism about the retro style artwork and graphic design, but in my view the cumulative effect of all components on the table and the thematic and tense game-play makes up for that.  It's a good length (~ 2 hours), tough to beat, fun to play, and has a real fantasy adventure feel. See my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/537878]pictorial review[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/538607]session report[/url].

Usually when a design [-]rips off [/-] is inspired by something, it improves upon the design in some way. I was surprised to find this game less interesting than its predecessor, Pandemic. They added a bunch of stuff but forgot to bring along the tension, man! 

I miss the deck re-seeding element of Pandemic which produces so much tension and a sense of vulnerability. Here, the game is not so lethal in terms of minions spreading but rather in the dice rolls. The reseeded deck is so much more interesting. 

Our failures were all related to the dice which I guess was their way of making this one less puzzle-y than Pandemic. I don't think the tradeoff was successful, however, as part of the fun of Pandemic is knowing that the hopper is filling up with bricks ready to fall on your head and planning around them.

" Defenders of the realm is like pandemic. It fun." 

Defenders of the realm is like pandemic in real-time. Its tedious.

This game is so slow! I was expecting the game to build to a point where every move counts and you are running out of time. Instead you can amble around the board not doing anything because, - lets face it-  the monsters on the way to the capitol city have had to stop and ask for directions!

This is to me a nice Tower defence game with a fantasy setting & plenty of options to choose from.
Set-up & tear down is a bit long as are the plays so it calls for leaving the game ready for few sessions in a row. Can be tough but still manageable. Not a game I feel a huge urge to get from the shelf but once set-up I can play with pleasure.
Probably slightly too long for what it brings as an experience though.

Fantastic game, use of dice and individual quests give agency back to the individual players rather than giving a 'right' move that other players can dictate.  Characters are different to play but each have enough variety in their individual abilities that you're not just stuck performing the same function over and over in the game - again, you've got options.  Artwork has come in for some stick, but I LIKE the classic 80s style, and also think the garish hot pink border to the hero cards continue the work of the well balanced characters to keep this more appealingly gender neutral.  Great fun, dramatic, always enjoy playing.

Love it! Epic fantasy war with lots of little plastic monsters and other bits. The variety of heroes, each with unique powers, makes every game different, especially if you select heroes randomly. It's very fun solo as well, and while it takes a lot of table space, the game isn't so complicated that I get overwhelmed running multiple heroes. Can take a couple hours to unfold, so I need to set aside plenty of time to complete a game. The common comparison to Pandemic is apt, but the altogether different theme and theme-related additions make an altogether different experience. I like both games a lot. It also feels different than my other co-op/solo fantasy games (Mage Knight, D&D series, Darkest Night), which is a bonus. And I'm a sucker for Larry Elmore art. The drawback to Defenders of the Realm is a steep cost and outrageously priced expansions.

I really like this. Some of the design elements feel a little bit rough but the whole idea runs excellent. A step up from Pandemic is the fact that heroes have multiple abilities and personal quests. It feels more cooperative because you do have personal choices to make within the group.

After three plays - two wins and one defeat, I do find the gameplay immersing. However, the play time outlasted the fun of playing. Trying to locate city locations for the spread of minions/darkness spread cards is where the game drags the most (as well as setup and upkeep). I had thought the expansion could liven it up some, but it only complicates the setup as you piecemeal whatever part of the expansion kit you desire to increase the theme/complexity of the game. If I am going to play a game that last this long, I want the end result to be "Wow! Where did the time go?", and not, "At last; we're done."

Traded away in my first math trade.

Not a bad game, actually.  I was going into expecting a complete Pandemic rip-off after reading the rules, but the dice mechanism adds a nice bit of delicious tension.  That said, MY EYES!!  Whatever "graphic designer" is responsible for this visual disaster ought to consider changing careers.  It is easily the worst art design I have ever seen in a board game.  For that reason it is played, but unowned.

AWESOME game.  Fired Pandemic.  Overpriced with some questionable graphic design choices, but other than that, a superb adventure co-op game where the armies of the enemy amass, their generals march on your cities, all the while adventures go on quests and slay the monsters to help stem the tide of evil.

Forbidden Island is great for a light fix; this is the meaty fix.  I have no idea where someone who has both of these games would need to fit Pandemic in.

It would be higher except it takes a long time to play and a massive game table : 10 minute setup, 3+ hours gametime. Pretty fun though and the theme is great. Dice make the gameplay more random [negative] but also help mask the optimal play line, which makes it quite interesting as a coop. It seems to get easier the more people you have - the two player game is really rough.

RATING: 7
Really fun cooperative game. You can play this solo, or play it with 3 other people. Seems pretty tough to beat from a 1st time play though. You are defending Monarch City from minions and generals. You must keep the land from becoming overrun by these minions (who will taint the land if there's too many in any one location). Too many tainted locations, too many minions in Monarch City, too many of any one kind of minion, or 1 of the 4 Generals moving into Monarch City is a loss for you and your heroes. 

After a couple of games though, you realize it's more of a card buildup to win the game. You simply build up a stack of cards and everyone goes in and takes out the big mean monsters. The fun is how you use the heroes.

Addictive co-operative game. IMO calling it "Fantasy Pandemic" doesn't do it justice, because there are many more options in this game than in Pandemic, and the theme holds very well. Besides, hero miniatures and the blue dragon are awesome :-) Very very difficult though.

A great group game.  

Lots to do, suffers less from Pandemic's "one person telling everyone what to do", lots of variety with just the base heroes.  Components are hit & miss, but overall it's a solid game.

RATING: 10
Defenders of the Realm bottles great gameplay with some wonderfully syrupy goodness that sates the inner child's desire to slay fantastical foes. It does a wonderful job of taking the core engine behind Pandemic and adding an RPG element. 

Defenders of the Realm is one of the very few games I have experienced that has a true thematic immersion. Each character and General feels unique and has an individual personality (despite the generic names). Each game provides it's own narrative and generates wonderful stories which are either heroic, tragic, or comedic (usually the latter two).

Defenders of the Realm is quite simply a game that strikes that delicate and rare balance between pure joy, tension, and solid mechanics.

I have played 14 times in my first fortnight, and can't wait to play again (and I am not a big dungeon crawl/hack n'slash gamer).


Ongoing record: 37 plays: 16-21 (started 0-9) current streak: L2 last 10: 4-6

Playtime averages about 75 minutes (including setup). First game took 2-2.5 hours. Since absorbing the rules, set up takes 7-10 minutes and play time is 60 -70 minutes, with longer games going rarely over 90. I have had a few games under the hour mark.


Chris Farrell made the following comment:

[q]"I mean come on, what the hell was he thinking to take a cooperative game, rip off so much, and then *not* allow players to trade resources? What would Pandemic be like if you could never transfer cards in search of a cure? It would be dumb. Yes, I know, characters can combine their cards when facing down the bosses, but it still just comes down to drawing the right cards in the right hands, there is nothing you can do to accelerate the process, you're either going to get the cards or you aren't."[/q]


I have an issue with this statement, as Pandemic also comes down to essentially card draws, and it's rules are much more restrictive. However, the mechanic in Defenders of the Realm that allows the group to fight generals together actually works much better in my opinion. 

In Pandemic you can only trade a card if in the exact city location (thematic?), this means you have to waste many actions (sometimes hijacking a player's entire turn) in order to transfer one card. 

That's better than being able to join up and combine ALL cards?

I love Pandemic, but this mechanic always annoyed me, and more times than not seemed futile and too time consuming.



UPDATE: After 30+ plays this truly is a great gaming experience.  The expansions add a ton.  The Dragons are true killers, and the heroes add a lot of replayability.  I prefer the unpredictability of Defenders over the puzzle like Pandemic ( although Pandemic is still a strong 9).  A true "10".  

Can't wait to see the troll expansion come to fruition.

So far this is pretty fun.  Compared to Pandemic and Forbidden Island, DotR has more strategy and theme than Pandemic, and takes slightly longer to play.  It's a lot more involved than Forbidden Island, of course, but does share Forbidden Island's stressful ending, while Pandemic is usually either an obvious win or an obvious loss.
We'll have to play more, but for now this is a winner when we want something more strategic than Forbidden Island.  I might be trading Pandemic.

So Awesome. Like Pandemic, but different and totally fun it's a completely unique way. Great Components. Great tension.  Winnable, but not every time. Terrific game.  Probably my favorite purchase in 2013.

Update: Falling out of favor because it takes so long to set up and play. The dice rolling wouldn't be bad, except that it adds so much to the time. This is like a less efficient Pandemic. Also, the board is hard to look at.

Still, I really do like this game, and when I'm willing to take the time, I will play it and enjoy doing so,l

Interesting cooperative game that has similarities to Pandemic but has a very different feel.

There's something special about this game, even if it borrows some of Pandemic's co-op mechanics. I may just like the classical fantasy art...but it really gives me a sensation of stopping a conglomerate horde of enemies from invading a city! I would liken it to a broad, and much quicker view of what Descent:Road to Legend does.

In other words, A fantasy "campaign" board game in under 3 hours!

Yeah, okay, it's been called "an example of Ameritrash," and it copies some basic mechanics from Pandemic.
Honestly, this IS Pandemic with a fantasy theme. Ok, you can go now-that's all the review you need. But wait, cause I kinda like this game better than Pandemic because it scratches a different itch.

Mainly because it's even harder to win than Pandemic. That's due to more random mechanics, but even then it just...WORKS! Don't get me wrong, there are better dungeon crawls out there. There are better fantasy strategy games out there. There are better games out there PERIOD, but if you want to introduce people to a new experience, whose only previous board game experience is Monopoly, Payday, Life, or Clue, then this will blow them away and open their eyes to our current "Golden Age" of board games. Consider this game a recruiting tool for those folks who liked "The Lord of the Rings," and "Narnia" but who don't know a D20 from an acorn.
The best part of this game is that, unlike other cooperative games, you have STUFF TO DO. You can go on a quest. You can take on a boss monster single-handed. You can eradicate the "Taint" or try to open new portals to make navigating the world easier for your companions. It eliminates the "ONLY DO THE NEXT RIGHT THING" syndrome that plague other co-op games. That randomness I mentioned earlier also keeps Game Bosses from dominating what everyone does. Unfortunately, that randomness is one of the bad things, because the game can end up kicking you. Hard. If you win, it will come down to the last second, and if you lose, which you will, you loose HARD. In fact, you may be tempted to throw in the towel halfway through because you know you're going to get beat. But I would say, soldier on. This is one of those games that is just interesting to play even if you lose. 
It's hard to fully recommend this game, but I certainly wouldn't write it off. I guess it comes down to the good and bad things:

BAD THINGS:  It takes a while to set up. It has a large luck component. The individual locations on the board are hard to find. It behaves a lot like Pandemic. 
And, it looks like an 80's issue of EPIC magazine.

GOOD THINGS: Lots of expansions for other hero types. Cool components and lots of them (though you'll want to replace the included dragon with something you can buy at a local hobby store.) A really good co-op, dungeon-crawl type experience that makes you feel like a total bad ass when you kill one of the boss monsters.
And, it looks like an 80's issue of EPIC magazine.

So what?

I used to read EPIC.
I guess it's a Try before you Buy kind of game.

Calling it a LOTR Pandemic clone would be wrong. I read somewhere that the creator did consult with Matt Leacock (Pandemic designer) and you can see some similarities in the game mechanics. 

This game really is tons of fun and the free expansions that the designer puts out shows how much he cares about his creation.

Better game with more players but plays fine with two. 

The only downside is the setup time. Probably a little harder to teach than Pandemic..not sure why/

This is a nice tense coop.  The group I played with had not won yet after 2 games, and I helped them lose their third.  It was very close, however.  We had killed all but the undead general.  We had organized for our final strike, when he moved to a new territory, and ultimately into the center city (game end condition).  

Heroes have nicely differentiated powers.  Figures are nice, but minions are generic.  For the price, I'd have liked distinct units.  I also was not a fan of the board aesthetic, however it is very simple to understand with color coded territories, evil generals' progression is clearly marked, and paths of movement are clear.  

I would definitely play this again, if given the opportunity.  However, it's not quite on my buy list at the moment, as I have too many games, and can't get the ones I own played.  :)

RATING: 5
Pandemic with a fantasy setting. Minimal character development. In my gaming group, Quest Cards are generally ignored, especially in the late game, unless along the path of another goal. Thus, game mechanics and feel are much more like Pandemic than games like Runebound. After a dozen plays, it seems that the overall strategy for the end game becomes somewhat rote. Fun for a while. Once you figure out the pattern to winning, the game loses its luster.

Better than Pandemic; I can't really imagine why I'd play Pandemic if I had this game available too.  But, I'm not really a big fan of Pandemic.

Some have compared this to a fantasy version of Pandemic.  While it certainly has a similar feel to Pandemic (as do most cooperative games) it also feels very different.  Maybe it is just the difference that a theme makes, but in Defenders, you have to deal with enemies which requires the role of die which is not present in Pandemic and adds a level of uncertainty to what you will be able to accomplish.  It's like Pandemic in that it is cooperative.  It is unlike Pandemic in that it feels very different.

Extremely derivative, this game is best described as an Ameritrash version of "Pandemic". But although I generally prefer Euros, "Pandemic" loses in the comparison: between fighting Fantasy creatures or nameless diseases, having fine miniatures or wooden cubes, and Larry Elmore or some dull artwork is a really easy choice.

So, theme, components and artwork certainly add a lot to my enjoyment, but those wouldn't be enough without a solid gameplay. Interestingly, despite the extensive use of dice, the game feels less luck dependent than others in the cooperative genre, where luck of the draw is too often decisive.

Just two complaints: the rulebook leaves a lot to be desired, and the minion figures should be different for each race, especially considering the price tag.

I'm really enjoying this game. I've had a couple solo plays and a couple plays with my daughters. 

Just when you think things are going your way, they can change real quick and force you to make some tough decisions. There are many ways things can go down hill, with either a general closing in on Monarch City, minions closing in on Monarch City or Locations getting overrun and the taint crystals just multiply like crazy. Do you heal the land, kill the minions, try to complete a quest or go after one of the generals? Lots of choices and consequences.

Less predictable and solvable than pandemic, which is good.  Also less balanced, but I think that was due to some rules misinterpretations we had regarding character special abilities.  I wish they had worked to kill more of the downtime but overall this is a great cooperative fantasy game.  Overall it solves my biggest gripe with pandemic which was the predictability.  At the same time, defenders also manages to be a fully functional cooperative adventure game, with enough chrome to give it a strong fantasy flavor.  As if Arkham Horror would not be enough, this definitely solidifies Launius as perhaps the greatest co-op game designer of all time.

Great cooperative game with great art. The rules are good and can be played in about one hour and a half. Lots of varety with only the base game, but there are a lot of variants made by the game designer made available free on the BGG. The theme is good.

Certainly similar to Pandemic.  This game is a little bit finicky in comparison, with certain enemies having special abilities to track, different numbers of demons causing outbreaks more rapidly, undead fear doing damage, etc.  There's just more detail to track, which is fun to have detail and all, but Pandemic feels more elegant.

The fantasy theme is nice, but I was hoping for some more impact from the quests.  Each hero feels distinct.  The movement is a little funky and also feels a little fiddly compared to Pandemic.

Difficulty is pretty brutal, though I'm still not convinced I'm playing every rule correctly.  It's amazing that such a similar game to Pandemic requires a rulebook over twice as large.  The map is still a little odd, as it can take a few moments to locate a place to drop enemies on.  The die rolling can truly punish you if you don't get plenty of extra to help mitigate the dice.  Losing to a general due to the dice rolls can be a game-ender.

I look forward to more plays, because despite the negative comparison to Pandemic, it is a challenging co-op with a thick theme that is different enough to warrant playing.  If this were similarly-themed to Pandemic, I would never play it, but the few additions and changes keep it fresh.

RATING: 7
Pulled it out and played it same day as it arrived- it looks a LOT warmer there than here (12" snow and counting today).

Defenders feels a little like Pandemic at first, but with 'Boss Battles' that seem more critically important.

Unlike the Pandemic mechanism, where you intensify the effects by immediately putting weak areas at risk again, Defenders strings you along, almost mercifully, while you try to assemble the cards to win the next key struggle.

But where Pandemic requires a particular set of resources to succeed- no more, no less- and teases you before it crushes you, because Defenders uses cubical randomizers you can actually try a foolhardy minimal resource attack, and have at least a statistical possibility of winning. Just roll well!

I'm going to start this cooperative behemoth off at a 7 on a 1st solo play- but I know it's coming out again soon.

It's a fun game that does a decent job at differentiating itself from its obvious inspiration. Unfortunately, it's marred by terrible theming and graphic design. The locations, characters, and baddies are stunningly corny. After several plays, I'm more and more able to get over it, but it still jumps out at me several times per game. I mean, really--Unicorn Glade?

I put the blame squarely on Eagle Games, who I think do a pretty shoddy job on everything that I've seen. A better publisher would have spent some time bolting a better theme on and hiring competent designers. I really wish that FFG or Days of Wonder or Asmodee could have done this--it coulda been a stone classic.

My wife and I enjoy playing co-op games and this is a very good one.  We played it quite a bit when we first got it, but we don't play it very much any more.  When I have family in town, they like playing it with us, so we bring it out with them.  It can suffer from some alpha player/quarterbacking, but there generally are some good open discussions about which General to go after next.  This game is brutal to play with only 2 characters; whenever my wife and I DO play it with just the two of us, we always play 2 characters each.  Otherwise, it feels too hard to cover territory quickly (depending on the characters you choose).

Fantasy pandemic. Quests give you something to do while building up cards to fight the generals.

Ok game. A little slow for my liking, long play time with little periods of tension. The downtime can be excessive so I lost focus making this a boring experience (no matter if you win or lose).

The game components are very good, the art is merely ok. The game looks gorgeous with all those minis on it :thumbsup: I will post some pictures soon. I love the theme, but that is not enough to make me want to play it again.

I do like CO OP games but I don’t want to play again Defenders of the Realm, it feels repetitive and without interesting decisions. Still I prefer to play this over Pandemic (But I will review that comment in the future). Some friends like it so try it before you buy it.

Love this fantasy version of Pandemic.  It's Pandemic with a better theme (for me) and much more to do and consider on your turn.  I love co-op adventure and I think this may see more plays than Arkham Horror as the play time is much shorter.  It gets knocked for the artwork, but I don't mind it a bit. Yes, it would have been nice if the minion sculpts were different, but that's minor.  Absolutely one of the best games of the year.

We got to play this game with the designer, Richard Launius, at ORIGINS 2010. I didn't know but this is the guy who designed ARKHAM HORROR which I am not a fan of. This game is soooo difficult to win as a group as the deeper you go in the game the more the intensity picks up until with a couple lucky cards the game wins. 4 of us had eliminated 3 Generals (I was the  "Undead Slayer" and "Orc Slayer" while Kristan was the "Dragon Killer". Only the red BALAZARG remained and we set out sites on getting to his location and destroying him. Unfortunately, the concentration on eliminating the other 3 left the minions to multiply and taint 12 sites giving the game a close victory. I scolded Richard as being an inhuman tormentor of gamers and a sick human being to which he took it as great praise. This game, like ARKHAM, feels like the walls are slowly, consistently closing in on you without relent.

Every now and then, a game comes along that's fresh enough to inspire a lot of refinements and re-imaginings. Pandemic is just such a game. Now, a year and a half after Pandemic's release, Defenders of the Realm has arrived with lofty ambitions and good intentions, but can it escape the shadow of its megahit predecessor?

"Yes, but." It seems that for every great idea that distinguishes DotR, there's an ambiguous rule, a contradiction between the rulebook and the designer, a glitch in the graphic design, or some other unfulfilled potential. Even so, I rate it an 8. It sinks and it soars.

In Defenders of the Realm, players are generic fantasy characters tasked with saving "monarch city" from a four-pronged invasion of fantasy cliches. At least the Dragon-kin are a bit fresh, but the Demons, Undead, and Orcs leave something to be desired. Still, each invading horde is distinct from the others, giving them some much needed character. Orcs are easy to kill but crop up repeatedly all over the board; Demons are most dangerous in groups, Undead can terrify player characters for extra damage, and Dragon-kin are just BAMFs who don't go down easily. Each army is led by an overlord that must be defeated before it reaches Monarch City (game over), and these big baddies are also appreciably distinct from one another.

The real success of DotR, however, is in the character abilities. The Rogue plays much differently from the Sorceress, for example, and all the characters feel pretty powerful. The game comes with 8 characters (9 if you pre-ordered), so there are a lot of potential combinations. It's too bad the character types aren't more specific (one of them is simply "Dwarf"... seriously, that's not even a class), but thankfully each one feels good to play.

There are problems, though, and not just one or two. First, the game makes no attempt to scale based on the player count, and this is remarkably strange given that so much attention was paid to scaling in Pandemic. The designer is on the record saying that you should not play with only one or two characters (yet the box says 1-4). I'm fairly convinced that with four players, the game is going to follow a simple pattern, and that this will markedly reduce the game's narrative range and variety. It's also quite easy with four players. Unfortunately, that leaves a single count as the clear best option.

The game's presentation is also inexcusably subpar. The map is a complete jumble of colors and generic locations ("Unicorn Glade"). It fails functionally, as players will have to memorize locations through sheer repetition, and it fails aesthetically - it's just a disorienting mess. It also provides no sense of place, which presumably is a priority for a fantasy epic. Compounding this point is the fact that the four hordes have the same sculpt in different colors, which sabotages player-immersion. An orc looks the same as a dragon-kin, just a different color. At least the overlords look pretty good; in my group, we already have a running joke about Sapphire (a large plastic blue dragon) constituting 90% of the game's production values. The rulebook, cards, and character sheets are rife with ambiguity and poor wording - just glance at the game's rules forums if you want to see the sheer number of resulting questions. The designer continues to answer all rules questions promptly, but don't expect to play this game smoothly without the internet close at hand. In some cases, the designer flat-out contradicts what a card or the rulebook says, and I'm sure he's right, but that doesn't reduce the frustration.

In a word, I'd say it's amateurish. Some great ideas, with just enough execution to make it fun, but enough blundering to add some disappointment and head-scratching to the experience. This easily could have been a much stronger game. Too late now.

The difficulty level seems to widely vary for this game.  So far our games have swung extremely between too easy and too hard with playing the normal rules - which suggests to me that sometimes you just get a really unlucky card draw and there's nothing you can do about it. Going to try some of the variants listed in the rulebook next.  Love the cheesy fantasy theme and the cooperative game play - especially the group combat against the generals. More entertaining and immersive than Pandemic but I'm not sure it is better designed as a game.

Its pretty much "Pandemic with dragons", and still a fun game.

It seemed easier to win than Pandemic, although we did lose my 1st game on a bad card draw.

Well, since I gave Pandemic an 8, I guess since I like this better it deserves a 9. Sure it borrows HEAVILY from Pandemic but it changes things up enough to be it's own game. I like both themes but I am a sucker for the fantasy theme. Unlike some, I really like the uncertainty of battles through the dice (even though the dice don't seem to like me).

The quest cards are a nice addition and can be really helpful or just a nuisance (visit 3 inns). Every hero has decent special ability and every combination seems to be a good one.

The tainting of the land and the marching generals along with your overruns keep the pressure on and makes for a tense game.

Like it's big brother it plays great solo too. Can't go wrong with this one.

Not my style of game... but then, I wonder what "style" this is considered, exactly. The game feels like a tedious version of whack-a-mole with constant turn/piece maintenance, and a zombie-style spawning mechanic that seems sort of out of place for the fantasy theme. 

The art is probably the main reason you will get into this game. I know its what drew me to it. I'm a huge fan of that old school D&D heroic art, not that anime-style massive sword spike hair thing that has invaded fantasy art over the last decade (odd, considering I'm also a long-term fan of anime). And while the art DOES give it a great old school feel, the game mechanics and zombie bash, frantic spawning seem to be at complete odds with each other, each detracting fromt he other and bringing this down to a disjointed thematic mess. At no point during either play session did I feel remotely immersed in this world, despite the great pains to make it LOOK immersive. Perhaps becuase there's nothing setting ti apart, other than the old-school feel. It's unfortunately old school and generic. The map also, while attractive, is so functionally average in look and description that you'll have a hard time locating any of the many locations you may want to move to, especially when all those generic zombies -err.... minion... pieces are blanketing the board.

I'm told this game is like pandemic.. I haven't played that. But I'm also told that pandemic is less tedious and detailed, emphasizing the fun factor and pacing over the wanna-be tactical factor. MAybe so. I'll need to give pandemic a try. I think there's things in Defenders to like, but the game feels too much like an artery clog of disjoined theme, mechanics, and randomness.

Very good. Best with 4 players. Have played 4 characters solitaire to learn game (there us alot to consider) and a 3 player game where we all controlled the 4th character through mutual discussion and decision making. I think the game will be great with each of 4 players controlling one character, but any number 1-4 players is doable and fun.

RATING: 5
Dice chucking version of Pandemic, I guess? And just like that game, it's really easy to lose control and have everything suddenly spiral into defeat. Especially tainted lands are nasty since they require you to sacrifice specific cards, thus emptying your hands without even the guarantee of success. And of course if you don't have the needed colours... welp, no taint clearing for you.
I like just how different and powerful the characters feel.
The art is... ok. Kinda old fashioned for my taste. The graphic design is pretty much a prime example of "mediocre".

Good game. Quite fun. I'm not too fond of it solo since there definitely is a lot of luck involved. But with other people there as well to cheer for those good rolls and stuff like that? Yeah, sure.

RATING: 6
Not bad! It's like Pandemic, only interesting. I don't understand why Tom Vasel was so struck by the bits, though - the garish colors and (gack) Comic Sans are just so determinedly ugly that I am actively deterred from buying the game. 

It's interesting, in a stunted, dominant-personality-appealing, Pandemic kind of way, but I'm not sure how well it scales with different numbers of players - seems like 1 or 2p would be forbiddingly difficult. 

Anyway, not really my thing, though it was good enough for an afternoon.

RATING: 8
Nice coop game where the game really puts up a fight. The lack of theme and fluff is so shameless ("We don't know why evil is attacking. You must stop them!" and that's the whole fluff...) that it makes you laugh. "AI" creates tense situations but is bit too random to create any narrative.

2014-05-27 - I'm after one play and I'm not thrilled about it however I would like to, because the game seems to have potential! Maybe, as usual, we misinterpreted some rules, but the game lacked something. But I'm eager to play once again and maybe I'll change my rating.

RATING: 9
The Good: This looks to be a better multi-player coop than Pandemic. Eager to play - but after my solo experience, I suspect multi-player will play at least an hour longer. 
The pressure of defending your capitol, in addition to the other pressures in Pandemic makes the game more fun. You also have Quests to add to the fun. Furthermore, the dice-driven epic Final battles with the generals are great fun.

The Bad: Setup/Takedown is pretty long. Problems with Solo mode. Solo runs too long, and was too much work for the fun I got. First game was a solo gane with 3 adventurers. It took me 3.5 hours. I read that the designer said the game was designed to play with 3-4 adventures - but playing solo with 3 characters and 4 generals was too much work to keep track of. That said, I do believe the time and work would go down if I played the same adventurers again. 
Hard to find a co-op group that wants to play the fantasy theme.

The artwork is horrendously garish and retro 80s (not in a good way).  But this is soon forgotten once the action starts in Pandemic-cum-Castle-Panic.  The theme is more realised than in Pandemic, and the player powers are more interesting.  As with Arkham Horror, the game has tension even in a solo session.

Nearly two years later and I finally know someone who owns this game, complete with prepainted heroes and bosses. The game is fugly fun.

I was impressed by how large the board was and by how hard it was to find locations on the map. Otherwise, I had a good time playing the barbarian with an 80's perm. Another guy played madame cleavage and a third played a stunted Cleric riding a Shetland pony. I haven't laughed so hard in ages.

I find many of Eagle-Gryphon Games to really lack in the graphical design department and Defenders of the Realm is no exception.  At first I thought I would like the better theming of a Pandemic style game but ultimately the randomness here did not make it better.  There are some elements I liked but in the end I went back to Pandemic (which has several good expansions as well).  For a more thematic version of Pandemic there is now Defenders of the Last Stand which seems like the more 'Evolved and Fixed' version of this game.

REPLACED BY:  Defenders of the Last Stand, Pandemic.

It copies a lot from Pandemic, but then leaves out most of the best parts and replaces them with lots of randomness that pretty much invalidates most of the players' decisions.  Plus, it's like 3 times longer than Pandemic.

But at least I was able to trade it away pretty easily...

It took a long time to play through. There were two of us playing, each with two characters. 

The game feels very derivative of pandemic. The entire collect colored cards to stop one of 4 colored bad things coming to kill you. The whole 'turn over cards to see how more items pop up onto a map, until they cascade out to neighboring locations', etc.

We had fun playing it, but I don't know that I want to play again.

The game feels so driven by the luck elements, that I am losing interest rapidly. I vastly prefer Pandemic to this, mainly because of how epidemics work - the repeated infection of the same areas do more for me than the completely random influx of enemies in DotR. Initial rating 7. Lowered to 5.

Great use of theme and immersion, what I expect from a Launius game.  I enjoyed it a lot and I can't even put my finger on why.  I feel that better and more varied minis sculpts would increase the game's appeal a lot, but that is a small complaint.  I would rate this game higher, but some rules are missing and those that exist have too many ambiguities.  I feel that you need the FAQ to play, it's really a missing part of the rulebook.  A game's rules need to be better than that.

Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King's Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defenders of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Tremendously fun co-op that lets each player do their own thing and still manage to cooperate. Tense, intense, suspense, sometimes terribly brutal ... but when you win the realm rejoices for a really long time. Masterful game. I did cannibalize another game's figures to replace the orcs, demonkin, and undead but use the provided minions for the dragons. I washed the prepainted minis and they look even better. Includes Expansions #1, #2, #3, and the Dragon Expansion.

¡Es imposible ganar a esto! Un juego realmente divertido que bebe de la mecánica de Pandemic, pero con tema fantástico para atraerse a ese público.

Cuidado que es muy adictivo.

After a video review, not really sure how it plays solo as the game requires teamwork to win. It's apparently an expansive game, but now that it's old , it could be easier to get used.

Many people compare it to Pandemic, but with more randomness. Solitaire play is done by normally playing with 2 characters.
------------------------------------------------

The escalation of difficulty seems badly designed, the difficulty drops as the game progress unless you fail in the first 20 minutes. Apparently, lot of inspiration from pandemic but done worst. Overprices or produced for what the game is.

This is such a great, fun game!  The only game I've ever played that I'm willing to play any time, it's so much fun and has plenty of strategy, but doesn't feel heavy.  It takes longer than games I am usually willing to play this often but it's so addicting and I never get bored.  The best adventure game I have seen by a lot. This game gets extra points for the great support by the designer on this website: new variants and ways of playing, quick answers to questions, the summer league has been really fun!  The dragon expansion is great too and I can't wait for the new heroes and other expansions coming out.

This is definitely not Pandemic. This is actually an interesting game. I would have rated Defenders hire if it wasn't a Co-Op, or semi Co-Op, but for what it is it is quite good. Richard Launias has definitely made a fun game here. There is always so much you want to do on a turn, and the choices are interesting. Near the end game it gets tense, and in my one play there were a few moments were we were cheering when the final attacker killed a boss rolling hits on every die rolled to barely pull it out. 

I still think the graphic design of the published game just shows laziness on the part of Eagle Games.

Fun coop with a fantasy theme. It's a bit like pandemic with dice and without the recent problems back on top of the deck thing. The dice add a nice pushing you luck feel in that you do not know whether your action will actually succeed. In my case the gambles paid off.  

Have only played a few turns solo so far but will be revisiting.

Played a few times.

Added significant depth and player choice to the Pandemic gameplay model, while simultaneously limiting the frequent Pandemic problem of quarterbacking.  Sadly, that depth and player choice came at the cost of significant time.  Losing Pandemic is never a big deal, as the game resolves relatively quickly.  Defenders can go on for hours before you lose thanks to an unlucky card draw.

Would be willing to play again, but would rather play Pandemic.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

It feels like Pandemic with a lot of (needless) randomness thrown in.

A more thematic, more approachable Pandemic.  I do not enjoy Pandemic, which is odd since I love low-randomness games.  But honestly, Pandemic losses feel like you stood no chance since the deck is set.

Defenders of the Realm?  I feel like we are a true band of heroes running through the kingdom fighting against impossible odds.  Sure, the dice can go against us, but there is a story there.
 
The base game might be too easy, but add in some of the expansions and get ready to feel the hurt.

3.1 - I enjoy the game, and the epic feel, but ultimately, Pandemic is more streamlined. Got it painted, but ultimately traded it.

Dice rolling, hand management, action point allowance, variable player powers.

Thematic Co-op. 90 mins. Also see Forbidden Island.

Only one play, and it is ok. I was never a big pandemic fan and this is much of the same. At least it tries to make things more interesting by adding in some combat. 

All the hype over the production is a bit much. Sure its not that pretty and could be better but nothing takes away from the game play. 

I would play again, but I probably would not buy it.

A strong fantasy themed game with a simple underlying mechanic. The downside is that there aren't many options to choose from during the player's turn, resulting in players making similar decisions repeatedly. This is a 1-hour game wrapped in a 2-hour timeframe.

This was recommended to our group, and we were wildly enamored with it at first; after 4 or 5 plays however the shine wore off - every game tends to feel the same, regardless of the characters chosen. Maybe one of the expansions fixed this, but I didn't hang on to it long enough to find out. Traded.

RATING: 7
I wanted this to be "Pandemic, but more," and that's exactly what it is. It's brutally hard (we lost our first game despite doing nothing obviously wrong, corrected for that game and lost for a different reason the second time), fun to lose, and has a lot going on without being needlessly complex. The rules are well-written, clear, and easy to grok, and the self-consciously '80s aesthetic is fantastic (as are the components, un-based dragon notwithstanding).

Adding chance (the dice) to Pandemic's luck (cards, outbreaks, etc.) works surprisingly well. And unlike Pandemic, it's not often obvious what the best course of action on anyone's turn is -- there are usually several, and a lot changes from turn to turn.

The character powers are well-balanced and fun, and it's neat that each character has several instead of just one. And also unlike Pandemic, very little managing of each others' turns took place -- lots of discussion, but no one was in charge.

We play pure co-op, ignoring the victory point rules. It took us three plays to win it for the first time, and losing is fun -- the key to a good co-op for me, and the key to most great games.

Played for the first time last night.  I liked it.  It is truly Pandemic ported over to a fantasy setting, with a little dice rolling attached.  The only quibble I have is some of the proofing on the cards could have been better.  Overall, a good game.

OK, so co-op games are hard, they are meant to be else you'd get bored with the lack of challenge. After all, if you won every game you played of - say - Steam, you'd be pretty bored playing it (wouldn't you? I would). It's even worse with co-ops, 'cos you all win/lose together. BUT!!! Did they have to make it so freakin' hard? (Even Launius says he only wins about 30% of the time, and he knows what he's doing. Our hit rate is FAR lower.)

All that aside, I love this game and have almost every expansion that I can get for it. There's great play variability and replayability and it always pans out different (even with the same nominal setup). The threat of impending doom is palpable and the theme really comes through (despite the somewhat Pandemic-like "Darkness Spreads" mechanism). Every time new minions get put out - and every time a General moves - there's a collective groan around the table. On the other hand, when a General bites the dust it's high fives all round the table.

RATING: 6
Has some elements of Pandemic to it, in particular the tension of the escalating minions, without the feel that you could just play the game solitaire. The game clicks along nicely though as the bosses slowly head towards the city & if they reach there, the players lose, too many minions, the players lose, too much corruption from the minions, the players lose, so there is always that feel that the game is clicking over & not stagnating.

Not bad.

Pandemic-The RPG! Thanks to the art by Larry Elmore and the overall theme, it really looks like Dragonlance the board game, and I approve wholeheartedly since that was one of my favorite series as a teenager. Great production value (components, huge game board, great artwork), good table interactions due to strategizing as a team, always tension due to constantly changing situations.  Add to that the random element the dice give to combat, healing the land, and searching.  With the number of hero choices available compared against the changing numbers of enemies, their movements, and chain reactions, and you have one of the best fantasy-themed games I have played so far. Recommend.

RATING: 8
Fantasy? Co-op? Variable roles? Can get it to the table? Yes!

This is at least an '8' rating. It's very Pandemic-like, so much so that we keep using Pandemic terminology, but that's not such a bad thing. It's often the "we lost our game one move before we would have won" sort of tense, so that's a very good thing. I need to play it some more, but it's fun so far.

It's a bit longer than I expected, long enough that it might be an issue for someone expecting a Pandemic-like fantasy experience. But this is a minor issue for me, because I wanted something more immersive with a better theme. It does mean a little less table time, because I'm less likely to find an opponent and not that keen on playing solo.

I'll still pull out Pandemic with my son, because he prefers a shorter game. But I'll go with DotR with anyone who's willing.

A highly enjoyable game of co-op tower defense.  You and the other players are working together to protect Monarch Ciry from the marauding demons, dragons, etc that are approaching from all sides.  However, there are many other things you have to keep an eye out for that will lose the game for you other than their approach to the city.  Each character brings unique abilities and feel to the game, and your fortunes will ebb and flow excitingly during the game.  Just when you think you are doing great, something will happen to make you think you are about to lose, etc.  Very fun, but it can turn into a fairly long game.

Feels like I got a more fun version of Pandemic (a game I dislike.) There is a lot going on so players are more apt to take a turn without somebody taking it for them and telling them what each of their moves will be. The dice rolling can be frustrating, but being a team game, it isn't such a big deal. Although not as much as some other games we own, it is still very thematic, I like the artwork, looks classic D&D to me.

RATING: 7
I'd simply describe Defenders as 'Pandemic with a Fantasy Theme'. Players work cooperatively to keep down the numbers of enemies across the land whilst building the power to finish off the 4 bosses moving upon the centre location.

Turn sequence is simple and straight, usually consisting of moving to places where you can either kill stuff or source more cards for special actions and killing bosses. As with most games of this type there's plenty of choices to be made though, and threat management is key to standing any chance of winning the game. This could well be seen as a negative though, as it can be spoilt by the usual coop related problems like follow the leader.

The plastic factor is nice even if the 4 forces of evil are all represented by the same cultist shaped mould.

The game is run by a deck which leads to similar problems seen in other deck run systems, namely there's always that chance the game will be over before its started with the wrong card draws.

Its a good game all in all though, and makes a sound alternative for gamers turned off by Pandemic's theme but still looking for the same feel of game.

Carving out the time with the kids to play is the biggest deterrent to more plays with this game.  A losing effort can be quick, but you're generally looking at 90 minutes + for a coop win.

RATING: 6.5
Even though my experiences are still limited playing this game, based on what I've played and what I know about how the game can be played I've come to the conclusion it's one of the best ones of 2010. It has the stop the spread of evil type feel using the amazing pandemic like mechanics, it has the great fantasy feel to it without being bogged down in too much fluff and character build-up (both of which can slow down the pacing of a game which is based on urgency) and finally it has the evil generals slowly descending on the capital as time runs out which feels like Castle Panic in some ways but with a sense of doom and gloom and a final battle awaits you that Touch of Evil or AH showdowns give you. It blends all of this well in a coherent game that still is simple enough to leave room for expansions, doesn't take too long to learn, has lots of room for strategy and just enough luck, and has a climactic ending where you feel like things are coming down to the wire--all in a span of just two hours. This game is definitely worth at least the 9 I'm giving it.

UPDATE: Still a great game but my criteria and standards have gotten stricter. I still recommend it but it doesn't hold to the same level as other games I give a 9+ to.

Defenders is so alike to Pandemic that the comparison is inevitable, and unfortunately, it comes up just shy of the genuine article in almost every way – mostly owing to the much more significant presence of randomization.

Approved.

There are a lot of rules and a long FAQ for what should be a relatively rules-light game.  I'm also not a fan of the art style.  There is a good game here and my group really enjoyed our play, but I am not really motivated to play it again.

Secret Santa 2010 - I like Pandemic a lot, but after many plays it gets a little dry.  Richard Launius described Pandemic well - it's a puzzle.  Defenders of the Realm adds just enough game to a really great mechanic as to be a real blast.  Looking forward to expansions.

A slightly lighter version of our beloved cooperative campaigning games. This takes on more the LOTR style theme as you and your band of heroes try to stop darkness from spreading.

Our Rating Guide (1 = Disappointed, 3= Hit & Miss, 5= Owned it!)

1. Originality: 5 - a rare blending of independence and teamwork, with layers of options, and often unpredictable turns of events.

2. Artwork: 5 - the character cards, the game board, it's all pretty.

3. Quality of Contents: 4 - Cards are definitely starting to bend and poor Sapphire can't support her own weight.

4. Storyline: 5 - Each character is unique and the abilities reflect that. Even the Minion groups reflect the General they serve.

5. Playthrough : 5 - I just really love this game.

6. Instructions: 5 - for a more complex game, this rulebook explains things pretty well. Plus, love that they over multiple pages for your list of actions which is great for those quick reminders.

7. Replayability: 5 - I can't count how many times we've played this 2,3 and 4 players. It's always a great game.
	
8. Two player: 5 - still fun and challenging.

9. Large Group : 4 player limit

10. Fun Factor : 5 - especially if you get really into your character!

Very fun co-op. I love Shadows and BSG. Defenders feels as good in every aspect. Lots of options, and not enough time. Tons of pressure and a ticking time bomb that you know can go off at any moment, but you just can't quite get everything you want done in time! All the Characters feel different, and everyone I have played with has enjoyed themselves from ages 10-52 (so far, and counting!)

Warning, this game is very much like Pandemic.  If that didn't send you running then you may enjoy this game.  The font and color choices are poor as is the rule book editing.  Get past all of that and this game is a lot of fun, there is a nice amount of variability in the different player roles and the four enemy generals.  I like the Larry Elmore art though it feels a bit forced at times as you can tell it is cut/pasted from paintings you've seen elsewhere.  The component quality is insanely good.  Thick cardboard all around, nice box, plastic minis and good quality card stock.  All in all one of my favorite co-ops.

RATING: 8.5
So far this is by a mile my favourite co-op game.  Sure, it doesn't offer much in the way of new mechanics or innovation, but it takes elements of co-ops before it and streamlines them into an immensely enjoyable experience.  The theme and components are fantastic.  I can't wait for expansions.

Game is in fact a mix of Talisman and Pandemic, as many people correctly observe.
However, it manages to take the good things out of those two games: Talisman's settings and Pandemic's cooperation.
Games are very short (probably because I regularly lose!), from half hour to max two hours. Setting is well bound with the rules, even though it lacks a story behind (those 4 "generals" advancing through unknown places....). Rules flow smoothly. Actions are not so straightforward as in Talisman and cooperation is not so leader-driven as in Pandemic. It is a well-done mix!

Defend the realm as best you can! This is an epic cooperative game. A lot of people compare this to Pandemic in that the players do their four actions followed by the game doing it's spread of diseases or in this case evil minions across the board. That is a good base for comparison...but it ends there. This game is a totally different experience and feels nothing like Pandemic beyond the way turns are worked out. 

First, lets start with the components. The bosses and minion figures are outstanding and the cards are nice linen quality and thick card stock. I still felt the need to sleeve them because with the addition of the expansions and the slightly varied cuts of the cards it was annoyingly difficult to get a good shuffle. The board artwork is strange, however, it is difficult to find locations because of the elven font used. Also, the board color is interesting, but the burnt orange against the light tan text is really difficult to see. Hey, I still play the game...as I said this is just a weird choice of board colors.  

The game is really easy to play. But I have to say, I don't always get this game to the table because it is difficult to remember the rules, especially in regards to teaching new gamers on the spur of the moment or even coming back to it after not playing for a couple of months. The rules are not difficult...but curse my brain for not remembering. I think I could remember it with just the base game information; but adding in the expansion rules...that is another story. Set up also takes time, setting the decks just right and weeding out the cards that you don't need because of your choice of bosses.   

There is an awesome selection of characters you can play, and this only gets better with the expansions. The game is difficult to beat. You must keep any or all four of the bosses from reaching Monarch City. You will be able to go on quests that may yield helpful artifacts. There are also an impressive number of options for actions you can do on any given turn. All of these things make this game an easy game to play, fun game to  play but with massive replay ability.

RATING: 8
Pandemic but with a die roll everytime you want to clear a cube, plus lots of die rolling to cure a colour once you have enough cards. Add the fantasy theme, the nicer components and the twice as long game-play and you've confirmed the Ameritrash feel and that it's horses for courses on which you'd prefer.

RATING: 8
Pandemic on Steroids: Take the awesome game of Pandemic, put it in a fantasy setting, throw in a load of D6 dice, add miniatures and a much larger board, have Larry Elmore beef up the artwork, have Richard Launius put his spin on designing this co-op game, finally give each enemy it's own characteristics along with big bad boss Generals, and you have the very fun and meaty Defenders of the Realm. The more I play it, the more I like it.

Much replayability with the different player roles and the quest cards.

As usual for a co-op, the group must work and think together in order to survive.

So many details to get wrong with this one. Rulebook needs a 2nd edition. Use the FAQ.

Epic co-op game

RATING: 7
What I like:
- Great theme, pure co-op, good components
- Pandemic-ish mechanics plus dice, but different enough from Pandemic that you could have both

What I don't like:
- I *really* dislike that generals each require a single all-out attack, rather than chipping away at them
- Seems too long (2-2.5+ hrs)
- Each game had long periods with little tension
- Not sure the extra complexity (over Pandemic, for example) is worth it

Overall, I have to compare it to shorter cooperative games like Pandemic or Flash Point DotR has a more appealing theme (yay!), but it just doesn't seem like the extra complexity and length result in more fun. I would prefer a shorter, crisper gaming experience. 

Our first learning game went 2.5 hrs (we won). The next one was stopped when we ran out of time, after 2.5 hrs. We were not close to winning or losing (1 general dead; board in reasonable shape). Third game was a surprisingly easy 3p win in 2 hours.

I think the weight is a bit heavier than the BGG-voted 2.7. I'll say 2.9.

All 2P games but a lot of fun. Like most co-ops of this nature that I've played the game can swing between "in the bag" and "no hope left" in a single turn - and that's what is fun, especially when you still manage to pull off a victry at the end

RATING: 7
Played once. It`s the game I was looking for - perfect combination of german-style mechanic and adventurous (Classic D&D style) theme. Next games tell the truth.    

Edit. After about 20 games later I consider "Defender" the best adventure game I ever played. I can have my RPG experience altogether with good boardgaming engine (and not copied from RPG). "Defenders" are also very open for making house rules. It`s easy to scale the difficulity without braking the gaming experience. 

Only one thing in this game makes me nervous. It needs too much time, even up to 2 hours. I think it should shorter and more fast-paced. But neverless, I still consider "Defenders" a gem in its genre.  

Edit: Rating lowered to 9. A bit to long for what You get.

I really like the idea of a fantasy themed Pandemic-like game. I just wish that the playtime was a bit shorter. It slightly overstays its welcome. I've also gotta give props to the designer.

I wish the expansion wasn't expensive.

It's like Pandemic with dice and less predictability. I enjoy this way, way more than I do Pandemic. The theme is great, components are decent but I enjoy not having the knowledge of what's coming out. Keeps the game tense the entire time and questing is great.

Update: Played a few more times and I have to say it keeps getting better and better. Now granted, I've had varying degrees of difficulty with this game. We played a 3 player game of it and did very well and actually won. I played 2, 2 player games and we got steam rolled on around every corner. Great game, but I wish it had a more consistent level of difficulty. Really looking forward to trying out the expansion.

Includes The Barbarian single character.

I like this and want to like this more, however I have some disappointment with it.

I love Pandemic as a coop and this plays similar to it, however, adds a well-integrated fantasy theme.  I like the characters, powers, and fighting the bosses.  Taking out the corruption is challenging.

My main complaint is that when the players lose, it happens out of nowhere.  In most coops, the players know when things are going bad and stacked against them.  In this game, sometimes it feels we're winning then one specific type of villain phase comes up, cascades, then knocks us out.  I didn't like the instaloss out of nowhere.

Great game if you're looking for a more thematic Pandemic.

Love this game.  It's Pandemic but with options.  There's just more going on and it's one of those I could play any time.  My only knock on the game is that the rules are not well documented.  You can play the game fine based upon the documentation provided but you will find constantly that you need to look up how something should be defined but there is no answer available.  This is equally an issue with character powers on the cards.  My opinion on this is pretty well supported by the huge volume of FAQ/Errata for this game compared to the short included rule sheets.  

Still.....Love it!!!

Just bumped up my rating from 8.5 to 9.25 after adding in several expansion elements.  Just makes the game even better and more epic.  Wow.

A great co-op that my wife and I enjoy playing together. At first I wasn't so sure about it but it's really grown on us. Shares some similarities with Pandemic.

Pandemic is more deterministic, dry and short. This game is more grand adventure and working together to up the probabilities of success. They are both great games.

Might slightly personally enjoy this one a bit more than Pandemic, but Pandemic gets played more.

The expansions really increase the variety and I highly recommend them.

Love the co-operative tension of this game.  The special quests, quest bonuses and abilities make for interesting choices in which team members to send to do what actions.  The hero card powers vs. their color/dice make for interesting choices.  And killing evil monsters is always a good time!

10/14/14 update:  This one slipped a lot in my eyes.  It went from a 9.5 down to a 6.  The quests are fiddly, the locations and characters are hopelessly cheesey or generic.  The expansions didn't make me want to play more.  With so little time for a game, I'd rather play something tighter and cleaner with less fiddle, or something really immersive if it's going to be fiddly.  We traded this one away in '12 or '13, but I forgot to update the rating.

Pretty nice coop game. We actually played with a couple wrong rules, which probably caused or demise, but the gameplay is very nice and the characters really do feel different. It also feels tight but not impossible (Ghost Stories anyone?). We really like the theme. Due to the comparisons between this game and Pandemic, I will probably not get the latter. I play with wife and kids, and they get the idea of stopping an evil army, but not so much of stopping a disease.

Great cooperative fantasy game.  It's your heroes against four factions of pure evil and their minions.  Reminds me of some of the best fantasy novels brought to the gaming table.  You get to play a great fantasy character deciding how you will help to defend the realm or perish in the attempt.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The same basic mechanic as Pandemic but more variation, resulting in much more replay value. It's an expensive game, but if it's your thing you will definitely get your money's worth.

My main quibble is that, while it does lend itself to variants, the mechanic is so heavily ingrained in the rules and game components that it isn't as open-ended as might be expected for an RPG-esque game along these lines. (For example, it's very difficult to come up with any variation that doesn't involve the generals in some way, or to develop one that clocks in under an hour.) Still, there's tons of gameplay built in, so only -1 star for that.

Lots of expansions are available, some more reasonably priced than others. None of them drastically alter the gameplay, though several enhance it.

So should you get this game if you're already tired of Pandemic? That's tough to say. Some of your fatigue with the Pandemic mechanic is bound to transfer over, but I find DotR to be much more fun and engaging than the cold calculations and predictions involved in Pandemic. So you will probably still enjoy DotR, but it's a toss-up whether you'll break even as far as return on investment.

Truly loved this game for it's gameplay. However the ultimate reason I got rid of this game was that after buying expansions this game would take twice as long to setup as it would to play even with some rapid tricks I had.  Then, when they started changing some of the artwork and text with new expansions my need for consistency was bothered.  But the final straw was the disaster of the Dragon Expansion 2.0 Kickstarter. Traded it away for a number of other games I enjoy as much and haven't looked back since.  Maybe I'll get the Defenders of the Last Stand game some day, but I am very unlikely to get this game again unless it has some major changes in the coming years.

I have never been thrilled with co-opmgames. Even D&D was lacking in competition. Playing against the game system always feels more puzzle than game. That is until Pandemic arrived. It was not only a playable game, it was enjoyable. Unfortunately Pandemic often offers little more than obvious choices. Defenders of the Realm takes Pandemic to a new level. There is more to do and you never run into that I-have-nothing-to-do problem. DotR is to Pandemic what Risk 2210 is to standard Risk. More complex it elevates the game in most areas.Pandemic is good, Defenders of the Realm is better. Great theme, good game.

There have been some complaints that DotR 'rips off' the Pandemic mechanics. Let's get real here, if every game had to have unique mechanics then how few games would there be? In addition to that, Pandemic could be said to have borrowed the spreading mechanic from the old AH game Wizards Quest. Put it to rest and play the game.

I honestly dunno what all the bruhaha is all about.  Defenders of the Realm is a good game in its own right, despite whatever similarities it may have with other games.  I don't understand why it has been bashed so much because of similarities when alot of other games tend to share similar feels/qualities as well.

Its nicely balanced, I like the different heroes and how they each feel so unique.  I don't mind the dice and appreciate how it causes tension each time I fight.  After all, in real battles, it doesn't take a great swordsman to kill you... just a lucky shot.

I've only won once and I look forward to playing this game alot more in the future.

Really enjoyed my first few plays of this game.  The mechanics are really basic, but not dull.  This is a good game for the beginner crowd or a group people that want to have conversation while playing that doesn't necessary focus on the game.

Update:  I don't really understand why, but this appears to be my wife's favorite game to play with me.  I still feel it is a bit dry compared to other games I play, but I'm going to buy some add-ons since it appears I will be playing this game more often.

Update 11/2017: I have now tried playing this with some of my friends at higher player counts.  It is a disaster!  When playing with two, you can have a few drinks and get really excited to run from here to there and kill a bunch of stuff.  When playing with 3+, there is a bunch of down time and the lack of theme really starts to show.  By the end of the game no one was really enjoying it.

With 3+ players, the game feels like:
1. Run somewhere with lots of enemies
2. Roll dice
3. Remove figures
4. Spawn more
5. Wait 10 to 25 minutes for everyone else to do the same, which is not really interesting to watch
6. Go to Step 1

After my multiplayer experiences, I'm bumping this one down to a 6.  I'm not really interested in games that are only really suitable for 2 players.

wishlist - Co-ops are enjoyable with the kids.  But with Forbidden Island, Pandemic, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, and Forbidden Desert, and Hanabi I'm not sure there is room for a 6th.  So I don't see myself pulling the trigger on a a co-op this big/expensive.

Am neutral towards this Co-op Fantasy "Save the Realm" game. Game lacks tension (enemies take forever to move) and can become repetitive after a while. Needs an expansion

This ranks up there with Age of Empires III for me in terms of a sweet-spot for games.  It's got enough going on to keep the guys interested, but is elegant enough for our wives to want to play.

The theme is very good, but I wish the minions were different molds instead of just being different colors.  It seems odd that a game with such high production values would skimp on the minions and have them all be the same.

Having said that, I'm Larry Elmore's bitch when it comes to his art.  He can pretty much have his way with me.  Without it, I might have passed over "Fantasy Pandemic."

All things considered, I expect it to be one of my new go-to games for playing with groups of people with different tastes.  It has already seen maybe a dozen plays in the last couple of months.  More than any other game I own during that time.

Copy for trade is in outstanding condition with the following specifics:
-one bottom corner has a ding and the bottom of the box has a slight crease running the length of the box close to an edge. I can take some pictures if you want, but it's not that big a deal. 
-I upgraded two minis (Eagle Rider & Sorceress) to painted ones sold by Eagle Games. So you'll get one painted and one regular for each of those two heros.

Why oh why did this have to use Comic Sans? It kills me when people say it looks hand-written. It doesn't. It looks like Comic Sans.

Edit: Now that I've played the damn thing, it's a pretty brutal game! In a good way. Rougher than Pandemic, variable player powers that are more dramatic than the Pandemic roles. With expansions, very customizable. The font isn't an issue when you're playing. I feel like kind of a jerk.

A really strong co-op. We really enjoy the theme and the dice rolling aspect to fighting. It also seems a bit more free in what you can do. Your charcter's abilities does not necessarily force you into a certain role. Everyone really needs to work together or you get smashed. Unfortunately it lasts a little too long for our attention spans and doesn't hit the table that often.

RATING: 4
What did Pandemic need? Oh, I know, now every single action requires dice to resolve rather than just a straightforward action! And let's double the length of the game and halve the tension by removing the ruthless repeated attacks on hotspots and replace it with random boss advances that cannot be predicted or planned for to any degree aside from hoping you can field 12 cards of a color before they draw the YOU LOSE card.

There's something to be said for the intangible thematic additions to it. Slaying monsters is infinitely cooler than curing cubes. The art is beautiful. It's hard, but in the "roll over 18 on a d20 to win" sense and not in the brain-burning challenge sense. 

It barely feels like Pandemic because most of the changes are almost antithetical to Pandemic's design. Dice and mad scrambles and losses creeping up on you rather than the orderly chaos and ever-growing dread of Pandemic. It's way longer than it needs to be but isn't painfully bad. There isn't enough of a narrative in the mechanics though to create memorable "Oh my goodness we triumphed against all odds!" moments.

If you want to throw lots of d6s at monsters and Runebound has too many dice sides for you and isn't nearly co-op enough, get DotR. Otherwise, get any other thematic co-op instead for a better game AND story. Robinson, LotR LCG, Eldritch Horror, Sentinels of the Multiverse...

I realize people like to play this cooperatively with a group win, but that takes the heart out of the tension caused by players seeking to complete their quest in addition to the other actions that might be needed.

Can see the Pandemic roots in the cooperative game, but adds twists (roll die for success, generals moving in, group battles) that increase the luck factor removing this game from the straight puzzle aspect of Pandemic.

A bit concerned if the game stands up to repeated plays as the minion tension seems a bit less obvious than Pandemic.  Part of the fun of the first game was seeing the patterns in the game and discovering the quests and special hero cards.  How will it stand up to repeated play though?  And can it be played in the stated 90 minutes?

Follow-up - yes, it can be played in 90~120 minutes easily.  Repeated plays?  The general movement is strongly draw deck luck dependent and uncertain if that will spoil a few games when the draws combine to make for an outlier game.

RATING: 10
I have had this game since I started the Tabletop gaming hobby. The base game I rated a 8. When you add the hero's expansions and the dragon expansion and also the upgrade expansion(at least that what I would call it) this game becomes a 10 in my book. Everything in this game is just awesome. The hero's expansion add all together 21 different hero which all play different and are all unique in there own way. The dragon expansion is by far one of the best expansion in all of gaming IMO. It gives you 3 different General(4 if you count the new sapphire which I always use whenever I use any other dragon general from this expansion.)which changes not having to fight the same General's every game. This expansion adds 5 different Scenario's which can give you a different challenge and even uses Dragon as agents which can change from game to game as well is mixed from game to game. Also this expansion add several new thing to the game like Fire which make it harder to enter and to be in different locations, Global effect which affect what can or cannot happen from round to round, royal blessing which is added for a easier game(for beginner players or to help with very hard scenario's, King champion variant which improves a character from game to game , and also many different variants to ramp or de-ramp your game. And finale the last kickstarted expansion which was really several different thing. That expansion gave 3 more different Generals, many more global effect, a whole new quest deck(bigger cards)with over 100 different quest which make each adventure different, it adds relics to make Generals harder and different, it also adds High council that help make the game easier and gives players different choices every time generals move, it also adds legends which gives your character different abilities every game if if you use the same character every game. and it also adds different mini minions which all look very different that add to the theme to the game. Also this game is also very easy to each to new players. If they love Lord of the rings this games puts you in that world which comes to life while in game play. There is always talking at the table while I play this game and everyone I have taught this game to just enjoy playing it when it hits the table and most are even amazed how thematic it really is and feels. All of this is the reason why this game is a 10 in my book.

Based on one solo play using 3 characters (as suggested by the designer), this game provided an engrossing, ticking time bomb of a puzzle that really did come down to the wire making for an exciting finish and leaving me looking forward to future plays, especially with the introduction of some of the various expansions...

Pros
I really like the variable player powers
Excellent art (I like Elmore)
Nice bits
The quests and special hero cards make the tactical side interesting

Cons
Set up is a bit involved
Learning curve is steeper than you think. I have played Pandemic a lot, which helps but that is only the start. You'll need the FAQ due to all of the player-general power and card interactions.

24-01-2014. Downrated to 8 from 10. The more I've played the game, the more I kind of am done with it. I will play it, but without expansion I beat it all the time. I am waiting for the new generals and have to play the dragon expansion more!

01-10-2013. Defenders of the Realm (DotR). What to say, I really enjoy this game. It's kind of like pandemic, but with a little fantasy fluff added. I like generals moving in, the dice-rolls to defeat their minions.

I dislike the look of the board, it feels a bit antique and it's not as pretty as some other games, but the mechanics and game are solid.

One solo play so far. I really enjoyed it. Kind of a cross (in my mind) between Pandemic and Arkham Horror. I really appreciate the theme and components. I don't have enough experience to rate the challenge accurately, nor the gameplay over the course of time. But I do think this is a game that will have a lot of life and replay value for me. I just need to make time to get it to the table. I think this game will shine both solo and multiplayer with the right group. The solitaire option is what has me very excited.

Need to play this one again. The game lacks a sense of urgency, as the generals pretty much didn't move the entire game. Also, with only two heroes, we had a tough time gathering enough cards to take down a general, as well as being in the same location to defeat him. Keeping minions in check may be more important than the generals, but they're a really unexciting (and repetitive) part of the game.

I have the same criticism of this game as everyone else. It's too much like Pandemic, but less tightly designed, with less interesting expansions. That said, I still love it enough to have both in my collection. Sometimes I want a Pandemic-like experience that feels grander, harder, a little less solved, a little more random. It was also one of the first games to really draw me into board gaming, so there's some emotional bias.

Pandemic clone.  While this fixes many of the problems with Pandemic it also makes that you can not lose due to running out of the pile.  On the other hand a few bad pulls the general can get to the city in 4 - 6 turns.

RATING: 8
I love Pandemic. 

This game captures some of that, and does benefit from increased complexity (and a bit of randomness), which means it will take a longer time to 'master' and begin to feel samey. The addition of new bossess, new monsters, and the steady drip of smaller expansions provided often free of charge by the designer is nice, and pushes this game up for me.

However, the game itself is not brillaint. The luck element is nice, but sometimes I feel it makes the game a bit 'swing-y' as you can fail through no action on your part, and the influence of Pandemic means that that game deserves points for originality. That said, it's a solid game, and a strong-retheme. I'd play it.

Great game, ordered it after my first play.  Love that  it can be played solo and I was looking for a new  solo game.  I am also hoping it might go over well with my kids, but not certain.  I felt the theme came through and the game play wasn't completely dominated by 1 player.

RATING: 6
Defenders of the Realm has taken the system of Pandemic and added a lot of extra mechanics to create a pseudo-RPG out of it. I don't think the Pandemic system supports that. The game ends up being long, convoluted, and rather random with little tension or narrative flow. I'd rather play Pandemic as a quick puzzler, or the D&D games as a pseudo-RPG. It's also very expensive.

On the plus side, I do enjoy the differences between the characters, and I grew up with Larry Elmore's art so liked to see it used for the game.

Świetna gra kooperacyjna w której stajemy w obronie krainy rodem z fantasy. Dość wymagająca, zarówno pod względem rozgrywki jak i czasu potrzebnego na grę. Jest losowość w postaci decku rozprzestrzeniania się najeźdźców (orków, nieumarłych, smoczego ludu i demonów), oraz przy rzutach kością w walce lub wykonywaniu questów, ale przy koopach nie jest to specjalną wadą ;) (dodatkowo można ją w pewnym zakresie kontrolować).

It would have been nice if they had put a map in the cards in order to make the search easier.

Good, fun game to play with the kids.  I like the fantasy flavor and love the Elmore artwork.  The cooperative structure makes it fun with the kids, as we can band together against the game.  The character special powers are strong and differ widely, which makes playing different characters interesting.  There are a couple of downsides.  I wish DotR played in the 1 hour range like Pandemic. Another downside is a few bad rolls can effectively end the game such as failing in a fight with a general.  It takes a long time to accumulate enough cards to attack a general, and so having to start from scratch again gives the general too much time to get to Monarch City.  Still, we always enjoy playing the game and I am glad we have it.

Very enjoyable and easy to teach game with a very very strong luck component (you'd better draw the right card and the right roll the right numbers)with a fantasy medieval theme and a ton of fun expansions. The rules were very vague on several important points though (the FAQs the creator posted in the files section are a MUST); the dice are extremely cheap and several were unbalanced, which is unacceptable in a game that retails for 80 bucks. Finally, the game is really overpriced. There aren't that many components (except for the extremely ugly and generic minion figures) and the components, for the most part, aren't that high quality (board came warped; several dice unbalanced, very low detail miniatures). It is a very good game, especially for new/casual gamers, but wait for a sale.

Great intersection of co-op and fantasy theme. I think the luck element that the dice bring helps with the game-plays-itself criticism you find with many similar co-ops. I find it easier to not have to quarterback this game, too, since on any given turn there are a number of fires that need to be put out. As a result, the people in my group feel more like they are playing a role instead of occupying a chair. Game can be brutal, but the result is that I feel a genuine sense of accomplishment when we actually manage to slay that 4th general!

Edit: I love the game but I sold it after a solo session where I was clearly in a foul mood (that's like going to the grocery store when you're super hungry. Just don't). Basically: I had a run of consecutive games where a general got a run of movement cards and I was drawing nothing of the matching color, meaning I could clearly see him bearing down on the capital with no way to even stall him. For some reason that took me out of the thematic element and left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't find a good thematic reason that we would *know* an enemy was coming but just stood there like incapable idiots, and it ruined the game for me for some reason. Every time I looked at it for the next couple of days I just shook my head in disgust. Posted it and it sold in like a day, and now I regret that haha. But seriously, that was a pretty pissy game session.

I wasn't expecting much more than a fantasy version of Pandemic.  Although there are many mechanics in common, this title has a surprising amount of depth that puts it in a class of its own.  A lot of interesting moving pieces that fit together well because of the solid adherence to the theme.  One downside is the rulebook that is missing quite a few key clarifications.  Fortunately, there a 19 page FAQ that is required reading, IMO.

Update: raised my rating a bit.  It's been a big hit with a wide variety of players.

EPIC! ITs my fav game as of 2012! Basically, it's not too hard to get into for beginners.However, finding locations will be a headache for everyone at the start. There is a really well made map guide on the forum though.... get it before u play. 
Defenders create a lot of player interaction to come up with strategy and delegation of different responsibilities to win the game. The hero expansions,simply add a ton of variant strategies and ways you can play! 
I like co-op games and this one does the best job so far. You REALLY feel like you been through an adventure after winning. ITs GREAT.

At first one can write this off as a Pandemic clone, and although it has some of the same mechanisms, it is anything but. I've introduced this game to a few people, and it has been a highlight for all of them. Not many games I've played lead to the whooping and hollering and fist-pumping that this game leads to. Each session feels epic. Not only that, but the support from Richard Launius for this game is in a league of its own.... no other game that I own have I seen the designer so involved with the community, and offer out loads of variants, options, and customization (often free over the internet as Print N' Play). This alone jacks the replayability through the roof, and a big thank you to Richard for caring about this game and its fans as much as he does. A hallmark of my collection.

This definitely reminds me of Pandemic. I don't know that I like the mechanic where folks who get the most kill shots on generals can be the overall champion, as in the game I played at the meet-up, folks were way too focused on that and not focused enough on dispatching minions. 

While I prefer Pandemic, this game is still quite entertaining, and I expect to play a lot more of it.

This was a blast. I loved the "Pandemic" mechanics in play here. The expansion of the foes and the movement of the bosses made for great tension as we all tried to work together and come up with a plan to keep the world safe.

Two through four, it's really quite fun all the way around.  Getting into the theme makes it even more enjoyable.

Really enjoy watching the generals make their way across the field and trying to avoid all of those hideous losing conditions!  The more I play it the more I'm enjoying it.

My wife and I love this game! We do have Pandemic, and enjoyed it as well, but as we dug deeper and deeper into the hobby our lust for more got the better of us, and purchased DotR. It offers a deep adventure experience, and more immersive than it's inspiration. My favourite mechanic is the marching Generals. As they descend closer and closer to the Capital, the sense of desperation constantly grows...

Pandemic still has a place on our shelf, and like to bring it out when new players are in the session. But for seasoned gamers, I would highly recommend Defenders of the Realm!

RATING: 6.1
This is a cooperative game like Pandemic, but while I like the fantasy theme, I wonder whether it has lots to do without a sufficient reward in enjoyment. Still, I'll enjoy it while it still captures my interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It works with non-gamers and kids just as well as with experienced gamers.  The exploding monsters mechanic is much better here than with Pandemic because it is surrounded by a great fantasy theme.  Also, the alpha gamer element seen with other co-ops is lessened here as it is legitimate for each adventurer to go off on their own to complete their individual quests.

Feels like Pandemic-with-a-fantasy-twist. There are some neat additions here, of course (e.g., dice rolling, so the game isn't entirely one of deducing the perfect solution; variety of characters with different abilities; the "taint" can be fought back). But it feels an awful lot like Pandemic, and I'm just not a big fan of full-on cooperative games. So I rate both games similarly.

RATING: 7
This was fun, I think I need another play to decide how much I really like it.  The fantasy special powers are fun.  The mechanics borrow heavily from Pandemic.  I wish the movement of the monster lords was tied more to the status of their minions; it would give you a little more control.  Also the boss combat seems harsh--basically all or nothing.  We fell 2 dice short of killing a boss and lost ALL our cards; we then had no way to stop another boss from marching into the city.

This is one of three games in my whole collection that my husband actually asks to play! It's Pandemic with more theme, more choices, more time to accomplish your objective, more fun, and very addictive. The designer is always adding scenarios and expanding the game is various ways so it keeps it fresh and challenging. Well done!

Epic, fantasy game that's kind of the same as Pandemic, however the theme and the difficulty will make sure that whenever I'm in the mood for a coop, I will select this one.

RATING: 6.5
The comparisons to Pandemic are apt; this adds a generic fantasy theme and dice combat to get a little more welcome unpredictability going. Very nice components and colorful artwork help the atmosphere. But it just adds too much length and too many modifiers to track.

RATING: 7
Great fun. The similarity to Pandemic and the comments about the art work had put me off, but this is just so much more enjoyable agame than its inspiration. It also has some superficial similarities with 'Castle Panic' but again this is so much better.

If you know Pandemic and Castle Panic then you 90% are on the to play this game. What makes it so much more fun is the theme and the pacing, you get a bit longer in DOTR to set your self up with cards and quests. Another difference is the characters - they are less specialised but have more interesting powers than in pandemic. The last and for me best change is that you dont spend any time trading cards - they are used to get you into the action of fighting the bosses

I think I am unlikely to play DOTR again having played Legends of Andor

Defenders of the Realm is a Co-op in the same vain as Pandemic.  The world is in trouble with only you (and the other loyal players the table) to save the day.  Each character had interesting and unique abilities and play very differently than each other.  I think this gives this game much replayability.  That and the fact that this game is hard to win.  The board is garishly ugly.  I feel like throwing up when I look at it and if I did that on the board it wouldn’t have hurt its aesthetic.

RATING: 3
Rather appalled at the quality given the price.  Comic Sans fonts and absolutely awful artwork do not really help to convey the theme.  The suspect cardstock and invariable miniatures also feel like a punch in the gut for a game this expensive.  Do not buy this game for full retail price or you will be sorely disappointed.

But if gameplay is all that matters, surely you can ignore the price, right?  Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't terribly hot, either.  It's like Pandemic, I hear, but I found it incredibly boring.  Go here, roll some dice, go to another place and get more cards.  Rinse and repeat.  Fall asleep waiting for your next turn.  Were this a $20 game, this might be perfect and I wouldn't mind.  For $60, I expect both fantastic production quality and a complex, engaging experience.  Neither was delivered.  Play someone else's copy before you buy to see if you like it.  I wish I had.

The obvious comparison is with Pandemic.  The board doesn't necessarily feel quite as malevolent as in Pandemic, but there is more need for co-operation between players, particularly when attacking the generals.  A little more going on, a little chancier, much longer.

Thoroughly enjoyable co-op dice chucking pandemic style questing game. The dice fest is off set nicely by the strategic opportunities provided by so many actions, quests, and hero cards. Hero cards are triple threat enjoyable boss killing suits/ special abilities/ and enhanced movement systems. The balance seemed spot on though like all dice based games the occasional (and fun filled) moments of baffling defeat and impossible victories crop up a few times during the game. With such a variety of mechanics to keep in mind players will have their hands full defending the realm. An excellent choice for cooperative and/ or fantasy fans.

Pandemic in fantasyland!  This monster-riddled co-op is a fun romp, and like any good co-op, a nail-biting experience.  I spent rather too much money to acquire all the pre-painted heroes and generals, which look great when marching about the hideous board.  (Yes, a lot of people go on about Larry Elmore, but geez, all I see is cheesy - in a bad way - 80s fantasy illustration.)  But one of the best parts about this game is how much the author, Richard Launius, has continued to support it over the years.  Between all the different heroes and generals, the published expansions, the variable difficulty levels, and the free, downloadable scenarios, I could play this game dozens of times and have a very different experience each time.  This is one I'd like to keep around to play with my two little boys when they get older.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7/10

Full Disclosure: I helped playtest Defenders and am friends with the designer.
Despite playing the prototype many many times, I still throughly enjoy this game and look forward to my next opportunity to play.The game has quick turns, lots of fighting, choices between personal and group gains, and special powers. The only thing missing is that there is no character development.

Ah well, something for the expansion perhaps.

RATING: 6
Fun while playing, yet no real desire to play again.

Fantasy Pandemic, with plastic minions swarming over the land, and bosses heading for your city. Barely co-operative, except in the sense of sharing out work, then combining to attack bosses. No synchronising / card sharing like Pandemic.  Slightly irritating that minion strength isn't listed on your player mat, only the monster card, so there's more hunting for "what do I need to roll?" info than there should be. Base game functionality sacrificed to facilitate expansions.

Mix of things to say here. The game is interesting, with the spreading minions to fight and quests to complete providing interesting things to do.

The rules are badly written. A FAQ is critically needed. At least the designer has been good about answering questions online.

The components are very impressive and pretty, but its very hard to find locations on the map with no cues on the cards as to where they are, and its sometimes hard to tell which areas connect.

Defenders is remarkably un-fun to lose. Some co-ops have a really exciting spiral out of control/fight for life and death endgame. Defenders just kind of fizzles. It never has felt like we "played" wrong, just like the cards came up badly or the dice were bad. Poof, bad draw, you lose.

Fundamentally, the game is written as a competitive game where all the players try to score the most points while defeating the generals. That's  utterly uninteresting to me; its too dependent on cooperation to make such a game of back-stabbing and sandbagging fun, and I'm much more interested in a true cooperative game.

By the way, it doesn't FEEL like Pandemic for all the mechanics it has in common.

This game is to Pandemic what A Few Acres of Snow is to Dominion.  It takes a great engine and uses it to make an even better game.  My first play was a lot of fun and only took about an hour plus some time for rules explanations and lookups.

A solid co-op experience that offers much more game than Pandemic.

Decent game.  I am finding that I do not really like co-op games where there is not a person playing as a DM.  Since the AI is card driven, I find it hard to get into this one.  I also find the game runs a bit long for what it is.  The rules leave a lot of critical gaps, but the FAQ (just as long as the game rules) and forums fill in the gaps.  Well supported by the Developer which is always a plus.

Game in itself is ok. Not as tight as Pandemic, nor that immersive as Runebound or even WoW: The Boardgame (played cooperatively).

Yet we had good fun using the basics. Considering the fact that after one play I was already wondering about replay value, I'm quite satisfied with the fact I jumped in on the Minions kickstarter for it to grab the whole slew of goodies: global parameters, more quests, 18 more characters, different end-bosses etc. That will definitely round out the game to be a worthy alternative to fully kitted Runebound (with all mini-expansions) or Pandemic (with both Virus Alarm as Artscow printed event cards and global deck). Also, the KS addressed a minor other point I had: the lack of distinction between minions (thematic they feel just a bit too much like 'points' now instead of minions. Might as well go for cubes ;)).

So in fact, only one quibble remains: the board art. Horrible, garing colors and retro feel (which I'm not fond of). However, I can live with that.

Fine game, but if you get it, do get some expansions as well. As the base game alone cannot hold a candle to Pandemic in my opinion.

[APR 2017] The niche this game is in becomes ever smaller: the 2p fantasy favorites are currently either Runebound (still going strong) or World of Warcraft: The Boardgame (coop variant), the multiplayer coops have been supplemented by both Agents of SMERSH, Yggdrasil and Legends of Andor which, besides the classic Pandemic, are all superior options as well. So it simply does not get any playtime anymore.
Will be traded or given away to a friend as a present.

I passed on this for years because I found pandemic boring.  I wish I had not because I really like this game.  I grew up on Larry Elmore art in the 80's so it hits a soft spot for me.  The whole presentation is dorky fantasy but I love it.  Quite possibly my favorite Co-op.

Pandemic with dice!

I'd absolutely never buy it as it's shockingly overproduced, but the dice make the game just that little bit more chaotic and so less solveable than Pandemic. It still suffers from all the other problems co-ops have, but this almost makes up for a lot of it.

I enjoy this game so far and expect that the rating could improve with just a few more Hero types (expected in future expansion).  For example, Assassin, Druid, Elf, Illusionist, Halfling, Monk.  

Ideally, I would like to have had the game playable solo using just one character, to focus on one skillset, and at this point, to play solo, you really must run about three characters.  I'm hoping to see future adjustments to allow this to happen.

I have no problem with the artwork.  I think it looks fine and the map is large enough to hold all needed pieces without overcrowding.

Upgraded to 8.5 after quite a few plays.  There are great possibilities for future expansions.

7/11 - New releases of the expansion and the new characters sends this game catapulting to one of my all time favorites.  Have upped the rating all the way to warp 10.

I enjoy Pandemic, but it does feel a bit abstract to me. Being a fan of theme-rich games, I think I'm going to enjoy Defenders of the Realm even more. The gameplay is certainly similar, but for some reason Defenders feels a bit less fiddly. I love the variety of heroes in Defenders, and expect that will keep games feeling fresh for some time to come. A small downside is that the game felt a little less epic with two players. I think this really needs four players to shine.

A less static version of Pandemic with a similarly catchy  theme. At least that's how I see it. I like the sinister plot of Pandemic, but I also like the kingdom being threatened by evil warlords. And what I like most about it is that you have to duke it out against the minions and the generals, thus making it a little less static than Pandemic, where you're guaranteed to remove X cubes when using X actions.

This game is sort of strange in the fact it has a lot of fun mechanics and is well designed and balanced, but... just isn't as fun as you'd think. The huge, glaring problem is that their is an automated villain turn (think Sentinels of the Multiverse) that is based on a combination or pre-set procedure and random effects due to draw. 
And it takes FOREVER. 
It's just really painstaking to dredge through this automated turn every round, translating what happens and placing all the pieces accordingly. Later as the players kill off villains, the remaining ones act more, so it never dies off either, really. There's absolutely no skipping this because it determines villain progress, which is your lose condition and the timer effect of it being the only thing that prevents you from trying and re-trying till you win.
Each character is unique and it totally changes how you play the game and that is, no doubt, super cool. But it really just isn't enough to make the game more fun than chore. About half the villain turns, jack squat happens, the other half, horrible crap will occur and the whole team will waste a turn mopping it up. The worst part is if you've managed to clear out three of the four villains while the last has been dawdling all game (likely, since you tend to target the foes furthest towards difficulty). The board is probably half cleared and the players have killer hands and quests set up, the fact that you're going to win is obvious... and rolling it out to be sure is just... painful.

Leacock-like, cooperative game. The randomness of the dice (and the risk involved in committing to a fight with a boss) help the decision-making not feel procedural.

If you fail fighting the first boss it can take a LONG time to build back up. Not as difficult as I had hoped.

[thing=65532][/thing] is a game known to be a close relative to [thing=30549][/thing], and sure enough there is a lot similar:

- the "outbreaks" of minions;
- the necessity to acquire cards in order to defeat the 4 generals;
- the actions points system;
- the travel with cards (portals / charted plane);
- the cooperative gameplay;
- the different classes with unique abilities.

Of course, some of these similarities aren't really close ones:

- the "outbreaks" happen differently for different types of minions (the blue and the red requires less minions ina place);
- there isn't a fixed number of cards in order to defeat a general: the cards give the player one or two die to roll in the fight, so with more cards, more dice;
- the classes are really apart from each other, not only one, but three different abilities for each.

Also, the feel of the game was really different for me. [thing=65532][/thing] was closer in feel to [thing=128445][/thing], and not only in theme, but also because how the classes worked in unique ways, making you work inside the game differently for each class you asssume at the start of play. Both these games also have a higher amount of random elements (dice-rolling, positioning of minions/Events, movement of generals/Necromancer, and others).

[thing=65532][/thing] has a lacking manual that left us wondering on the proper use of some of the special cards and effects of Quests, and we had to making some "I guess it is this" to get the game going. The rules aren't hard to learn, however they are one or two steps up from [thing=30549][/thing] (also closer to [thing=128445][/thing] on this matter).

The production value is high - the minis are well done, the cards are OK, the board if huge (and, for me, ugly), in order to have place for all the miniatures on it, and the players Hero cards and tokens are of a thick stock. The box is also huge, due to the board.

Playing time is around 100-120 minutes, again closer to [thing=128445][/thing] ([thing=30549][/thing] clocks around 60 minutes).

All things considered, I found [thing=65532][/thing] more enjoyable than both [thing=30549][/thing] and [thing=128445][/thing], although it might suffer from the "sameness" of play issue that I have with [thing=30549][/thing], but I can't say for sure as up to right now.

I love the epic-ness of DotR! With all of the minions marching closer to Monarch City, spreading taint crystals, and huge bosses, it's hard to know what to take down first.  I've played this a bunch, both solo and two players and had fun every time.  Great theme; some tense moments.  Not everyone is a fan of the art work and it is a table hog, but it's a great co-op game!

This game is the best cooperative game I have played. It's extremely fun and very challenging. It provides a wonderful sense of dread and a real feeling of accomplishment when something goes your way. Winning this game will always result in elation and high fives. What more could you ask for from a co-op? Very well designed.

On the negative side, the graphic design is horrible.  It's cluttered and hard to read the board. Defenders deserves a reprint with a real graphic designer. The game is just too good to be sullied by such poor GD work.

I'm not a fan of co-op games since the experienced player(s) usually just tell the new players what to do (or heavily suggest).  I also don't like "sharing" a victory.  This game while being co-op takes care of those two concerns!  One, there are enough things to do that there is no "right" action to take on each turn so you won't be told what to do much.  Of course your gaming group might affect this :-)  Also, while you can lose as a group, there is a way to win individually!  In my one play I wanted to save my Purple special cards to try to help with my individual victory, but wound up using them in teh team fight - great tension in a co-op game!
Only played once, but can't wait to play more and trying it with different groups to see how much "group think" affects game play.

Updated - played more!  I really like this game IF you are playing for an individual victor after "winning" the game!  This means the cards in your hand are NOT public knowledge.

RATING: 7
Nice bits and iteresting card driven mechanic. I like the group effort, and the enemy is really hard to beat. Looking forward to the Dragon Expansion! I'm really getting a feel for this game, there's a lot more to it than first meets the eye, as each hero has different abilities that you don't see all at once. Have yet to win after several plays with diehard players, though they tell me it can be done.

I've now won once out of several attempts, it's really hard!

More...I've had a few wins, but losses vastly outnumber the shared victories. I really like this game!

Screaming 10 out of the gate!  Very nice blend of the interesting decision making challenges of a good Euro and the whup@ss fun of a rollicking Amero.

It is very difficult to beat this game, which makes it so much better.

The unique abilities of each hero character, the map, the baddies all make for a rich theme.

Tension mounts as the Darkness Spreads more rapidly throughout the game.

I also love the Quests, bc they are not too difficult to accomplish and give a nice little reward, really carrying the adventure-style theme even further.

One of the brilliant innovations of the design is how the "hit points" of the character and the "action points" are the same; so that if he/she takes damage this impacts how many action points you will have available until you heal up.

I'm really hoping for continued expansions.  The new Heroes look pretty awesome as well.  

Great Game!

This is probably the best coop game I've played - partly because it does not really feel as much like a coop. Lost in a pathetic way to goblins running out on first play, but was still thinking about the game an hour later - always a good sign. A bit too long with some downtime between turns, but I'm definitely looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 8
Rating might very well rise if subsequent plays prove to be just as enjoyable as the first. What I like about Defenders, is that it gives you more freedom in choosing where to spend your actions on than similar games. In Ghost Stories and Pandemic, for example, every action must be part of a tight planning if you want to beat the system. In Defenders it is OK to spend some actions to play your part in the team, while spending other actions to just do what YOU like to do. In that sense, the system feels less like it is playing itself. In addition, I like that boss fights really are a team effort and victory therefore really feels like a team victory. The only part of gameplay that I am not sure of are the very powerful special action cards - they make individual actions feel futile in comparison. It is a terrible shame that they made such a mess of the graphic design and used terrible type setting and fantasy artwork from the 80's. Miniatures (except maybe the dragon) are mediocre at best. And why was the manual so badly organized? The game really deserves the production values of Arkham Horror or Ghost Stories.

Rating pending because the version we played had all the dragon cards added in, creating a sort of wonky experience. Still, I think I'd have to be talked into trying this again-- it's not Pandemic on steroids, and it's Ameritrash, but the extra level of chaos makes the game more frustrating than I'd expect. 

If you fail to slay a general, it seems like it's too hard to catch back up-- and because it's dice-based, it means that you could fail to slay said general even when doing all things right, which makes it even more frustrating. Well, that and it takes hours. I don't think I like coops past a certain time limit :)

Love the theme.  Fantasy co-op akin to Pandemic.  The game at first play seems very difficult.  I hope it will get a little easier with repeated play.  Birthday present from my wife 2010.

Edit: raising my rating from a 9 to a 10.  It's not an easy game to win and maybe that's why it keeps us on the edge of our seats.  Meaningful decisions abound.  I like the quests, how developed the characters are (including the generals)and the uncertainty the dice add to the combat.  All this provide a strong narrative that leaves a lasting impression with each play.

Edit: After 25 plays I have to say this is probably the greatest game I've ever played.  The addition of the Dragon Expansion has made this game insanely re-playable.  The new generals and minions are awesome.  The 3 hero expansions add so much.  This game has turned into a game system.  The designer has provided a tool kit for great thematic adventure and no two games will be alike.  Even after only 25 plays we have compiled a long list of "do you remember the time when" experiences.  More so than any other game I've played.

For what amounts to the same damn game, Ill take version that is vastly more terse to the game that has the edge thematically.  This is just a longer, more interesting version with much slower swings.

Despite the similar mechanisms, this game is actually a lot more than a remake of Pandemic on a fantasy theme. 
Things that Pandemic doesn't do:
- Minions can move and spawn and fight in distinct fashions (color matters)
- Minions move with their masters 
- Side quests
- Monsters need to fight with, not just get removed by one character's action (unless s/he's the slayer of their master)
- Characters can get hurt by staying with the evil
- Characters play in very different styles
etc.

Lots of tension, lots of cooperative planning, and a great fantasy theme.

FOR SALE.

A long clunkier version of Pandemic with the randomness of Flashpoint: Fire Rescue, but without the charm of either game. 

The additional playtime doesn't add interesting gameplay mechanics. The quests are 'meh'... Fighting the generals is 'meh'. They feel tacked onto the engine of a better game.

This game was dead-on-arrival in our collection. There was no reason to own it. If we want Pandemic with randomness, we've got Flashpoint - it has a rescue dog. If we want an epic fantasy coop with randomness and minis, there's Shadows of Brimstone. If we want a fantasy adventure with puzzles, there's Mage Knight or (shorter) Legends of Andor.

"Our Liege is in desperate hour! From what grievous cause have these accursed races arisen? Orcs, Dragons, Demons and the Dead make haste towards Monarch City. The King and Countryside of Monarch City is in need of valiant Heroes!"
\13\\13\
Will you answer the King's call?
\13\\13\
In the ancient Citadel of Monarch City, the King calls to arms the finest Heroes to defend against a Darkness that engulfs the land. You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before any of them enter the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Fear! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King's Champion.
\13\\13\
Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King's Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defenders of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!

By all means, I should be blasting this game. The blatant rip-off of the core Pandemic mechanic, the god-awful color palette, the ugly card fonts and the pure cheese imagery of Larry Elmore. Really, it's a disaster. Except for one little thing...

It's designed by Richard Launius, who seems to have a knack for taking other people's designs and improving them ten-fold. Defenders of the Realm fixes every complaint I had about Pandemic. There seems to be so many things you can do on your turn that it never feels like you are locked into a puzzle that has only a single solution. It's also incredibly modular, so you can mix and match the different enemy invaders to make each game challenging and unique. The game system is also very robust, as Mr. Lanius has proven with the sheer variety of downloadable content he has released for the game. There are group quests, a "prequel" game set-up that features the heroes as 1st level adventurers and multi-session campaigns that add even more of an RPG feel. Essentially, Defenders of the Realm is just flat out more fun than Pandemic, despite borrowing so heavily from it. I highly recommend it!

Mixed feelings on this one.  On the one hand, the special abilities and theme are more fun in Defenders of the Realm than in Pandemic.  That each of the races (diseases) have different properties is a fun twist.

On the other hand, the game is just not nearly as cleverly designed as Pandemic.  For example, there's a great tension and lots of strategy in Pandemic added by the mechanic of shuffling the used cards and putting them back on top of the deck every Epidemic. No such mechanic exists in Defenders--minions just pop up randomly all over the map for the entire game.

Furthermore, many of the "borrowed" mechanics just don't make any sense given the theme.  For example, minions (disease cubes) don't ever move (like disease cubes), despite the fact that thematically the general is leading them to war against the central city.  What?

I like the theme of this game more than the theme of Pandemic. The main problem I have with it is the unpredictability of all the dice. It's disheartening to roll an entire handful of dice attacking the enemy and not get a single result high enough to do damage. I prefer Pandemic's simple "remove cube" mechanic in that respect, because at least you can't fail at it.

This game goes on for above 90 minutes, but lacks tension beyond the first 20 minutes. Everything after is a slow descent or ascent, and neither feels like anything matters. After you've killed the first general, the game becomes easily managable. That means the game (whether you succeed or not) goes from high tension to low tension, which is a killer for any game that lasts as long as this one (well over 2 hours on occasion). Alternatively, if you are on a losing proposition after the first twenty minutes, the game predictably escalates to certain defeat. It's snow balling upwards or downwards, and the progression runs on rails, minimizing the importance of player input.

The final knock against the game are crazily unbalanced items like the boots of speed, which grant a player two extra actions *per turn*. It's like drawing a card which says "Congratulations! You've just dialed the difficulty of the game back by a couple of notches." It's victory on the cheap, because the game throws it at you without any accomplishment or input fromy our side. (Cf. the effect of golden items in FFG's Descent.) Which is a killer when the sole objective is to beat the game on the basis of one's decisions, their merit and strength.

A terrible design, whether you look at it as an Euro or as a theme game. What theme there is in this game is laughable - no flavour text on the event cards, amateurish use of art and font.

Super Fantasy Pandemic with dice! Even though it takes a while to play, people always seems to walk away with an epic story against the forces of evil... even if they lose (which usually happens).

Even better with expansions (more choice, quests, modules to add and adventure) as those increase the different ways to play beyond counting (though don't add them all in at the same time) Hands down the best and most immersive non-card cooperative game in my opinion. Bonus: Wife likes it too!

This is a game that brings back fond memories for me.  I feel it has a lot of theme that allowed me to immerse myself into my character and reminded me of the good old days of classic D & D.  It is a co-op game but players can go on their own quest to build up their character.  Meanwhile, hordes of evil creatures are marching towards the fabled Monarch City hoping to gain control for their master.  Or worse yet, the evil master enters the city and instantly wins the game.  Although I have won all the games played, 3 out of 4 games were exceptionally close to losing and in different ways. If you enjoy working with your friends and like a fantasy theme then this is the game for you.

Addendum:  Played with the Dragon expansion 5 times(with only two characters) and haven't won a game yet!  Wow is it tough and still fun.

I find Pandemic to be rather boring so wasn't sure what to expect from this seeing as though it is touted as being like a fantasy version of Pandemic. It is but I guess the theme takes over here as I found it much more fun to play.

If you think that the one thing missing from Pandemic is being able to attack the disease cubes with dice - and I do mean the ONE thing - then this game is for you.

There's borrowing a mechanic, and then there's lifting 75% of a game's rulebook.  Defenders of the Realm falls into the second category.

Also, could the names of the board locations be any more goofy?

Rating after 2 late night plays. Very good cooperative game in the fantasy combat genre. You and your fellow players are trying to destroy the 4 monster generals before they can conquer the realm. You can defeat the minions by yourself but have to defeat the general with other players. The more the better. My first and second games were losses. It is not easy.

I bought Defenders of the Realm when it was first released last year under the premise that “I’ll play it with my kids eventually”. What I didn’t know is that the time would come so soon!

My son is 7 and every weekend for the past few months he and I have played Defenders of the Realm. It warms my heart when he chooses a boardgame over a videogame.  

What really sets this game apart is the active community and the incredible support from the designer. Richard Launius releases official variants and downloadable “expansions” faster than anyone in the industry. He has created a game that is different with every play depending on the characters, the enemies, the variants, and the scenarios that are chosen.

But even though this game is incredibly fun and challenging for my son and I, that’s not what keeps me coming back. It’s the high fives we give each other when we roll a 6 at the last second and slay the dragon. It’s cheers and pumping fists when we narrowly avoid catastrophe. And it’s even the pain of defeat we share when our heros fall. There has yet to be a game that I have ever played with my son that I enjoy as much as Defenders of the Realm. I foresee us defending the realm together for a long, long time.

Really enjoy this on first play.

We managed to win but it was looking pretty sketchy between the third and fourth generals.

I can see how playing different characters will make the game very different which is cool.  Also liked the tension at the end.  I dont think this as tight or tense as Yggdrasil on hard mode, but its really good.  We may have used two of the more juiced characters and admittedly rolled well.

This definitely took more than 90 minutes on our first play as we were getting acquainted with all the rules.  The rules arent overly complex.  I think the overrun and crystal mechanics could be a bit more clear.  We had the correct interpretation though we felt compelled to stop play and verify.

Update : This is a really good game out of the box, but the best part is that its a GREAT co-op platform.  Its perfect for tweaking and building your own scenarios, monsters and characters.  upgrading to 8.5.

I've played this game a couple of times now solo. It works really well solo. I can't wait to play it with a group and see how it goes. The game does seem to be heavy on the luck factor, but there is still enough strategy to keep people thinking.

One of my favorite Co-ops with a Fantasy theme. It is like pandemic in some respects. And Can be like a puzzle after playing the base game a few times, but the Number of hero combinations and expansions add fresh new challenges to keep the game from getting stale, and the ease of adjusting the difficulty level make this a good game for veteran gamers and brand new games alike!

Good game, but a little too short & simple for my preference. And price in the UK is excessive.
If you prefer 2hour games & can buy outside the UK this is probably perfect...

A surprise. The art (it's not [i]all[/i] bad, hero boards look good) and font choices are definitely questionable, but the game plays like a meaner Pandemic. The fantasy elements (questing, attacking) are pretty well implemented and don't seem tacked on. Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, mainly because the board/cards are so ugly.

A simple, introductory level coop. Easy to learn and teach. It goes on a little long for what it is and downtime could be tough, but it's quite a good game.

Slightly boring co-op, which mostly revolves around rolling dice and hoping to draw decent cards without much strategy. Production values are lacking as well, with an ugly board design and expansion cards that aren't exactly the same size as base game cards.

Played a demo session at Origins and just finished our first game here at home. GREAT fun! Love the Elmore art and the co-op fantasy elements. We managed a narrow win in our first game, a real nail-biter at the end! Very engaging stuff. Will get LOTS of plays in the future! 

Here's hoping for many expansions down the road...(are you listening, Eagle Games?!?!?)

I would rather play Pandemic. The first time I played this game it lasted 4 hours :( BORING. I could have played a hole bunch of fillers or a descent game that takes four hours.

Finally got around to picking this one up.  As has been pointed out by many others, it is very similar to Pandemic.  However, the production values are top-notch, and I think the fantasy warfare theme works well.  It feels less abstract than Pandemic, and the dice-based battles are a good touch, adding a bit of random RPG feel while still allowing for plenty of strategy.  Overall, quite pleased.  This will likely replace Pandemic for scratching my co-op game itch.

Defenders of the Realm is a very fun game that is quite challenging. Don't be fooled into believing that everything is well under control and it will be an easy victory. In this game, things take a turn for the worst very quickly. Plague markers/overruns can explode quickly and Generals are relentless on their march to Monarch City. Of the four games played so far, my group has only won once. I'm looking forward to the expansions and whatever the future brings for the game. Finally, each of the character classes feel unique from each other and thats a big plus in my book.

If not the "best" co-op I've encountered, this was at least the most enjoyable co-op first play I've had.  Turns move relatively quickly because you don't need a bachelor's degree in the game to navigate the rules (a la Arkham Horror).  Decision trees are manageable because the game state is relatively intuitive (unlike, say, Pandemic).  And while Shadows Over Camelot is certainly beautiful and elegant, DotR had me feeling less helpless, more in control of my fate.  For me this is the best of a bad genre.

Defenders is an alright game, but I find that it suffers from a large dependence on the draw deck. You can sometimes get atypical draws that can make or break the game all on their own, such as a series of cards that force one boss from start to the capital without pause. On the other side of the coin, you can get draws that repeatedly do nothing for moving the bosses, allowing for a relatively easy game.

It is fun to run around and fight minions and bosses, or to set up a party of 2+ heroes to make a last stand against one of the bosses on the capital's doorstep. The game can last a bit longer than one would like, but if you enjoy the "us-vs-them" style player vs. game mechanics, it's not a bad pick-up.

blows the pants off games like Pandemic and Flash Point. I think I like it more because of the theme. This is LOTR type scale and theme, and that does it for me. First play, and we won. I think this could be incredibly hard to win depending on the card draws, but I could enjoy this even in defeat. We had one general left to beat, and he was one step away from victory, and we barely pulled it out.

Pandemic: Fantasy. Kidding aside - it is a lot like Pandemic but adds some nice randomess as well as a strong fantasy theme. The characters and quests don't seem stoo balanced but who cares: this is not an Euro :)

If you enjoy a fantasy setting and still want to play co-op, this is the game for you. The battles are dice heavy but in my opinion this only favors the game and leads to screaming and kicking once a very much needed dice roll fails and the Realm is in danger of being lost.

It's like some guy sat down, looked at Pandemic, and said, "Hey! How can I make this game for Zyrallus?" Seriously, this is my Pandemic. You all can have your wooden cubes, I'll take this cooperative masterpiece any day of the week. In Pandemic, you give other people cards and send them on their way. Here? You band together and take down evil. You don't do it a hundred miles apart. No. You do it together, in the same location, for the same goal. That's cooperative, and that's why I love this game.

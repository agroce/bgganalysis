Praises for OCS are ubiquitous on BGG and fully deserved at least for this title (the only one I have played so far)
Beyond a refined, solid and fun game system, 3 more reasons comes to my mind :
- Great introduction to the serie (scenarios of different size and length)
- The system gives you an insight about the decisons belligerents took. The north invasion followed the Pyongyang - Seoul - Taejon - Pusan axis because of the supply network. No rule prevents you from launching a major offensive, say from the north south road on the east coast - it's just logistically not viable. The choice of Inchon for the American landing makes perfect sense for the same reasons but no rules forces you to land at that location. Etc...
- The huge replay value : Right after finishing the Invasion of South Korea scenario, I was eager to play another game. Now, add to this the numerous and interesting options and I have found a game I will always find great interest in.

My favourite OCS title. Big in scope but very playable. Even smaller scenarios give you the whole conflict at a manageable scale. Also both sides are on the offensive at different points of the war but play very differently (slow infantry based Chinese armies but with the advantage of numbers) versus smaller mobile UN forces.

This is the best game in the OCS series for teaching newbies. Low counter density makes it quite playable. If your new to the system playing the North Korean/ChiCom side lets you ease in, they have little to no airpower or tanks allowing you to concentrate on learning the core mechanics.

Well, all OCS games get a 10 for me until proven otherwise because I love the system. Korea is a particularly appealing title because it's sort of "in the middle". It's not as sparse as Burma, but far from the unplayable monsters of GBII or Case Blue. It has a lot of range, with all sides having lots of toys at various points, and with the interesting terrain of the Korean peninsula. Also, unlike the true monsters in the series, Korea comes with a good range of playable scenarios.

I've played the campaign once, lost as the US/UN, but would play again anytime.

RATING: 10
We're half way through the campaign as of this writing and I have to say that of the titles I've played so far Korea is my favorite. I generally prefer the smaller two player titles and Korea, compared to Tunisia, seems to emphasize maneuver more and has less random influence from weather and mud. But I haven't played Tunisia since I started with the series so I will need to revisit it before deciding for sure.

RATING: 9
A very good game to learn the OCS system (low counter density, very few air and naval units), even if the situation is scripted : it goes down to Pusan then it goes up to Chineese border, and down again and up... (which happened during the Korean war).
Even if OCS is an operational system, there is a lack of chrome in the political rules. This was for the drawbacks.
The rest is neat, just like OCS !

A monsterous 3 mapper, but the unit density is relatively low. Gorgeous artwork on map and counters. Functional yet pretty, and not too busy. This may be the nicest map of the series.

They say this game is a good intro to OCS, and I'm looking forward to trying it. After reading the OCS rules, they aren't as intimidating as I'd imagined... not so much an all new system as a logical evolution of SCS with more bells and whistles. I will update my comments after I've played a game.

RATING: 8
A solid presentation of the Korean war, using the OCS system. The lower counter density makes this game a bit more playable, but also punishes careless players who leave their rear unguarded, perhaps a bit too cruelly. It's a see-saw affair, and compared to WW2 campaigns, it often feels like the flow of the war is being scripted by external political events. (Because it was!) I don't quite enjoy it in the same way as the WW2 games, but I respect it.

RATING: 9
A fantastic introduction to the OCS system and a great game.  Scenarios range from one map low counter density 4 turn scenarios to massive three map campaigns with nuclear weapons, air, naval, and land power, and more cardboard units than you can shake a die at.  This is a must have.  The OCS system handles the korean war perfectly and the scenarios are well researched and well written.  Doesn't have the massive scope of DAK or Case Blue, but is a great intro to OCS and has a lot of interesting scenarios and situations.

3 fullmaps, but Korea is a peninsula so the net area is small. Nallow width of battlefield is very nice to learn how to fight on OCS system. And KOREA has 2 situations: low-density retreat/pursuit, high-density inf divisions attack against well mortorized regiments. Good introduction for OCS. Good instance for OCS's ability to represent various situations.

I own, have played and love OCS Korea.   I didn't see the need to pre-order the reprint, but two things got me across the line:  the reprint has some minor changes to the original - enough to get me interested.

Part of my reasoning for pre-ordering was to make sure the game got back into print, because it is an outstanding OCS design.

My rating is for the system.  I have fiddled with Korea, but I've only played Tunisia and some of Sicily.

This system is pretty tough and it's hard to play well too, but essentially that is what you should expect.  OCS is a simulation system and the emphasis here is on getting things right.  This is not to say it's not fun though.  It's just easy to make mistakes, especially if your opponent knows how to capitalize on your blunders.

The perfect introduction to OCS.  I've yet to play the full campaign, but all the scenarios I have played have been wonderfully entertaining.  The wave-like nature of the front lines makes this much more of a mobile war than some of the other OCS titles, giving you a real treat in the handling of fighting retreats and then real effective counterattacks.  And as boring as it may sound, I'm waiting for someone to to get an expansion for the final two years, just so I can play out an entire war in OCS!

Not everyone likes the big role that logistics plays in OCS, but this game makes is a great introduction to the system in that there is a lot of movement and fighting without too many units or "advanced" rules to weigh you down.  Captures the back and forth of the first year very well, and then doesn't bother with the rest much.

OCS

Enjoyable game and easily playable due to several smaller / one map scenarios.

Campaign game seems to initially play out very well in terms of movement, combat and supply but then, in my opinion, suffers to key breakdowns.  The first is the US buildup & intervention.  Supply constraints seemingly keep the US from coming anywhere close to their buildup, counterattack, and breakout (and yes - be prepared for the massive US artillery advantage to sit useless due to lack of SPs).  The second seems to focus on the Chinese intervention which seems equally starved of supply, in turn, limiting and kind of attack by the Chinese that initially pushed back the US, ROK, and Allied units.

Now I have no issue on the system making supply key, but when on the best of turns the US can't move enough supplies into Korea to move & fight with 2 divisions (well, you could wait about 3-4 turns to do it if you wanted...), I have my concerns.

A warning: I haven't played this game, so folks are welcome to dismiss this review, but based on a thorough reading I'm unlikely to push cardboard on this. Many folks have recommended OCS to me and Korea as a starting point. As I have an abiding interest in the campaign it looked like a good place to start. But oh! The system seems overwrought and full of completely redundant and unnecessary chrome, such as the surprise bonus rule, which appears to be there to only create more a interesting battle narrative. The supply system seems to add a pleasing ebb and flow to campaigns, but possibly places the generalling duties a fraction too much in the hands of logisticians.

reasonably approachable by the standards of OCS. however, the enormous arty values as compared to the 1-step units gives reason for pause, but it works well enough in the end.

Such a good introduction to the system that it may actually be the best opus of the OCS series.

Reasonable counter density, high value counters that are fun to handle, air and naval forces yet not in an obnoxious way. And a "back and forth" scenario that lets each player have fun within a reasonable time.

RATING: 10
Large maps, low counters make for a very good mix. The BEST game for showing the 'what happened' and 'why did it happen' of this war. There will be learning issues for the UN player because of the low counter density, but this remains an exceptional game.

Korea has been my first exposure to the OCS system and as we begin our fourth campaign game of 2007 I remain extremely impressed with the OCS system, with the 4.0 rules, and with OCS Korea as a game situation. The low counter density and the high tempo of activity in the summer of 1950 make for a game of aggressive maneuver as well as assault; two of our games ended with KPA decisive victories in 8-10 turns, reinforcing my conviction that in the game, as in reality, the KPA has to win by the end of July or not at all.  The high physical quality of this product is particularly impressive.  As previously noted I have a strong personal interest in the Korea campaign because my Dad was there with the US 7th Cav from July 1950 to April 1951.

RATING: 9
The ROK have a tough time surviving the first month. The defence of Seoul is particularly important, being a key rail junction connecting the rail hexes to the east and south of South Korea that the DPRK needs for trace supply. The ROK must defend against a far numerically superior force and avoid being enveloped. This means conducting an orderly withdrawal of forces to form temporary defensive lines. When these lines are likely to be breached, that is before they are attacked, it may be necessary to fall back without giving combat to avoid a flank threat.

The roads in South Korea are very well developed and the DPRK can move vast distances along them. The UN player's saving grace are their air forces, which can roll twice on the Barrage vs. Facility Table and potentially place two trainbusting markers.

The first series of attacks by the DPRK will set the tone for the rest of the first month. With a lot of luck and some expert manoeuvring, it is possible for the North Koreans to break through the Pusan Perimeter and seize the entire peninsula. The DPRK don't have many supplies and historically both the DPRK and CPVA conducted operations on a shoestring supply buildup. Failed attacks will have enormous consequences for the DPRK, wasting not only men and materiel, but what little time they have before the UN build-up and potential Inchon amphibious landing.

An otherwise superb game that suffers only because I tire of the OCS system fast. I'd rate this significantly higher otherwise. OCS is fun sometimes, but to get good at it, you have to play it a lot. I don't, and that detracts from the overall enjoyment. Were I an OCS fan, this would easily be a 10.

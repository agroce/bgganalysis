I've only played it a few times (and only solo), but here's why I like it:
- Each adventure has a fairly distinctive feel to it. Along with the main story cards, a portion of the adventure decks are swapped out.
- Story is enjoyable as each card has it's own flavor text and a given quest or monster is well themed.
- You have a decent number of heroes to choose from and each is reasonably distinct and offers an interesting backstory
- Hero does have a noticeable amount of growth over the adventure with acquiring skills and equipment
- Combat is a satisfying puzzle. With the addition of the new combat tokens in the UB expansion, each monster type will have it's own set of tokens and present it's own puzzle. Enemy combat is now more scripted, but as such can be mitigated as your hero grows in skill.
- Combat is also not overly long, as it will usually end in 2-3 rounds
- Decent amount of variability with being able to swap out skill sets and the amount of equipment is decent.
- Rule set is manageable. It offers a good amount of depth without bogging you down in to much fiddlyness.
- Solo game play can be accomplished in a couple hours after a couple plays.
- Set up and tear down is not too involved.

Cons:
- One of the adventures is not well suited for solo play as written, but there are variants that seem to make it more interesting.
- Can have a decent amount of luck to it if you prefer a more strategic game.

In summary, it's an adventure game with a well done theme is that meaty enough to keep my interest while not bogging me down in the minutiae of the rules. I probably would not recommend it as strongly without the unbreakable bonds expansion, but it's quite enjoyable with it.

Great game.
Besides the dices (plastic dice with stickers... seriously ?), components are really good. The map is awesome.
When i play, i have a real feeling of an adventure, i'm always happy after, even if i lose.

Before play, i think fight with token will be painful but...I love the combat mechanics.
No dice for combat, just token with two faces : luck are here but not much. The combat system push not your luck but your hability to anticipate and choose wisely which token activate and when activate it ( there many combo with cards, equipments, skills... ).
Many opponents can kill the hero in one fight, it's really rewarding and stimulating to win !

Still long, random and snowbally. Not a good combination. Also, having tried the combat tokens I do not like them. They are difficult to shake and tend to land either overlapping or widely spread out. Sadly I think this is a step backwards from the second edition.

An improvement on 2e, which I loath. I love the combat revisions; one now thinks tactically while engaging in combat. I also love the idea of the skill system, the surge system, and non-combat encounters. More content would be nice.

Lowered score from 8.5 to 7.5, in large part due to a lack of enthusiasm to suggest the title for a session.

Every once in a while a game comes along that makes almost every other game that came out before it look like a stupid, dumpy piece of shit that was a total waste of time. Runebound 3rd Edition is one such game. If I was a designer or publisher right now, I'd be committing suicide, because the contest is over. You not only lost by not making this game, you came in dead last with every other idiot designer and publisher who decided to make any game that wasn't this. Put a noose around your neck, drown your children in a river and write your suicide note because there's no point in trying anymore. Better yet, skip the note because I'll be too busy playing this game to read it. Goodbye, loser.

My favorite traditional adventure game I have played. I feel the game is best with three people as it allows the person who just had a turn to run combat and the next player to start their turn smoothly. Playing the game with people who don't take it too seriously is important though. The games I have had see non-combat turns lasting less than 20 seconds, which really keeps the game moving. My only complaint is that I want a lot more scenarios than I see here.

Really nifty adventure fantasy game with some interesting ways in which dice are used for movement, resting, and so forth. I have not played the earlier versions of Runebound so I cannot compare, but the token flipping combat system is another aspect that I haven't encountered before that I thought was sweet. The board looks great, the hero miniatures are good, and the artwork is top shelf like most Fantasy Flight games. One gripe here might be that there are only two big bads in the core box, and four might have felt like a more fitting value for the price. But you can play against each of these a bunch of times with different results and adventure cards along the way, and they're expanding it soon. Has a nice 'RPG lite' feel.

The third edition is fluid and streamlined, providing a reliable fantasy questing adventure. The game is particularly suited for solo play, as there is little interaction between players. Oddly enough, I found myself wanting more randomness, as the location and nature of encounters are predictable by design. Like Talisman, players find themselves seeking encounters solely for the purpose of increasing their characters' aptitude, rather than achieving this goal incidentally while exploring story-driven circumstances. This can give the game a bit of a grinding feel, common to many RPG video games. This is mitigated somewhat by good flavor text on quest cards and the like, though I was hoping for a more immersive, epic experience. Perhaps expansions will help. Still a solid adventure game if you don't expect too much.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Component quality of this game is typical of FFG games; great artwork, thick cardboard, and plentiful cards. This game has an interesting story arc and leave you with the feeling that your characters are progressing throughout the game. The built-in timer works well to urge players not to dawdle while still leaving enough time to do things such that players won't feel rushed. I particularly enjoy the combat mechanism. Rather than a simple competitive die roll, you toss your combat tokens and then make decisions as to how to manipulate the results to your benefit. Despite the flavour text on many of the cards, I didn't feel engaged with the story or world as presented. Regardless, it's a fun game and I would enjoy playing it again. This game would be best described as "MageKight lite".

RATING: 9
The best adventure board game in comparison to Mage Knight, Talisman, Relic, Runebound 2. Ed, WoW - Adventure Board Game, WoW - The board game, Return of the heroes

+ You can customize and optimize your hero as you wish
+ Token system is so much better than the dice combat before: Very tactical, very optimizable and full of tough choices
+ During your turn you have a lot of decisions to make how to play your actions the best way -> You feel free to do anything
+ time pressure of the board and racing aspect according to the other players is very well implemented 
+ hero progression feels that you have achieved something: More tokens + more chosen skills = more possibilities, more combat choices
+ better balanced: Everybody can win the game. Nobody falls behind that much like in 2nd Edition

+/- direct player interaction is not really there or is not really worth it

- downtime is very high when you are not involved in combat
- game takes very long
- I would not play it with four players again


Summary:
A great designed adventure game. A huge improvement over the 2nd edition because of the much and many more meaningful choices to make in the game. Do you want to save the trophies the learn the better skill or do you want to learn the 2nd best skill to have it? Maybe the next time you exert you have to discard one of the good skills on your hand...
The whole combat system feels so fresh and innovative. It is very involved, but you have so many great choices to make: Boost your damage, flip your tokens, recast tokens of the enemy, exert to boost your powers....fantastic. 

Big credits to the designers: The have made a fantastic job for this edition. The whole feeling is the same: Level up, get better items, slay the evil bad buy. But, man, it is so much better designed, and that much deeper according to your choices.

Thank God, FFG did not create a casual edition with this 3rd installment of Runebound. It stays a gamers` game with a fresh design. And that is a huge achievement for me.

Adventure Game based on Terrinoth, the world of Descent. Absolutely great and fun. It remidns me very much to Descent, but with less interaction between players, and also to Tales Of The Arabian Night, with the similar adventure feeling.

RATING: 9
My rating is based on the base game WITH the solo expansion, Unbreakable Bonds.

4 plays in and the last 3 games went smooth. The game fills a nice niche in my game collection.
- World questing
- Limited 2 hour playing time
- Streamlined gear hunter
- Thematic game
- No dice in combat, but chits(disc) based
- Good solo combat AI.
- Tense and challenging.
- Not difficult to learn, rather good rule book.

Advice for solo players (and co op probably). The Unbreakable Bonds expansion is a MUST HAVE to play RB3 as the new AI Combat boards and AI combat coins are a great replacement instead of cutting your own heads off in combat :)

So as the new solo expansion adds a good combat AI: a good thematic game with a fresh coin combat and a decent AI.

Went into this with no experience with the previous editions. Was quite happy with what I've found. Game has has a nice balance of theme, flavor, and meat to it. Nothing too thinky obviously, but not completely braindead either. The much discussed combat system is quite a bit more enjoyable than just comparative dice rolling, but it does take up a a fair amount of time in a pretty long FFG style game. I do wish there was a bigger pool of story cards for the scenarios. Haven't found the adventure cards too repetitive. I do wish the game wrapped up a little quicker, as it is I doubt I'll play it with more than two people. That said it's a lot of fun and the pacing is fine.

I'm all in on forthcoming expansions. :)

This game has a lot of Amerithrash elements (high luck, high theme) but essentially no player interaction which I find to be not a great mix. I've only played with 4p which is far too long for what it is. Since it's a FF game it's got above-average production quality which helps. The board is beautiful and the minis are nice but the only way I would play again is with 2, maybe 3 players.

Az első játékunk rendesen elhúzódott (4 játékossal több, mint 4 óráig tartott szabálymagyarázattal együtt), bele kell jönni, és akkor gyorsabb lesz. Szép térkép, klassz kártyák, változatos küldetések (+ majd remélhetőleg a kiegészítők is rendesen hozzáadnak a változatossághoz, amint megjelennek). Mindenképpen úgy javasolt kipróbálni, ha legalább egy játékos tisztában van az összes szabállyal és nagyvonalakban el tudja magyarázni (utána érdemes elkezdeni játszani és menet közben sokminden kiderül). Úgy érdemes elkezdeni ismerkedni a játékkal, hogy az első nekifutás után legyen idő egy második játékra is, amikor már mindenki vágja a szabályokat.

Ajánlom!

RATING: 8
I hadn’t thought I’d enjoy Runebound so much: actually I’m more of a science fiction guy than a fantasy enthusiast and figured that it was the typical RPG-lite game that almost any other fantasy aims to be.

Yet, even though my suspicions were true (it is an RPG-lite game), Runebound doesn’t feel like anything else I’ve played: first of all, it isn’t either a cooperative nor a semi-cooperative but a straight competitive game, which is a huge merit of the game.
Then, you have several things you can do each turn, not just smash and slash everything, and every task feels different enough to give you the impression of a living world, not just a scripted event in a cardboard environment.

And there’s more: although I usually love games that make you roll buckets of dice, I’ve discovered I also enjoy tossing Runebound’s tokens. They’re a new way to resolve combats, add a new layer of strategy (read «comboing») and, most of all, feel like your shiny new piece of equipment is finally helping in a fight somehow.

As such, everything in Runebound third edition contributes to make it feel appealing and different from any other game: and it is even fun to play!

First off... I like the casting.  Works great, and all the complaints that I heard about it were completely off.  I really like the "Adventuring" part of the game, and trying to figure out when is best to attack the big baddy.  Have played the Zombie & Spider missions so far, have not beat either, but both felt very different.  Really like this game, and this is my "adventuring" game of choice at this point, and might cause me to purge a few games since my wife likes this one as well.  A little long... but I get lost in the game and totally forget about time.  Probably wouldn't play with 4, but really liked it at 2-3 players.

AVOID.  Too much downtime between turns.  Adds flipping or "casting" 2-sided chips for combat; and some chips allow you to flip others or reuse others... this is a bit better than simple dice success of fail.  Still has the clunky dice movement, and now the dice are cheap sticker-based dice.  Also adds 3 adventure decks (one combat, one exploration and one social) which is interesting.  Also, adds the ability to customize the var pl powers of your character with some game changing abilities when you turn in trophies (completed adventure cards).  Likely best with 2p, and too long and boring (downtime) with 3-4p.

Man, this sucker is long!
The combat is kinda interesting, but after the novelty wears off, it doesn't really feel any better than the previous version (aside from the fact that now it involves a second player). It's just different for the sake of being different.
There's a couple other interesting mecnanics/systems, but they don't really make for an especially fun game.

If you have the option, stick with 2nd ed.

Third edition is definitely an improvement over 2nd edition.  Skill cards are great.  Having to chose whether to exert an unlearned skill by discarding it for a game bonus, or to save that skill to learn at a later time is awesome.  The three different types of adventure tokens are a great improvement.  Casting combat tokens instead of dice is a very unique game mechanic.  I kind of like it, except for the fact that all enemies use the same 5 (or 6 in act 2) tokens.  Having the other players get to control the enemies you fight gets them involved on different turns besides their own, helping with the solitaire complex that 2nd edition suffered from.  Unfortunately there are no rules for attacking other heroes besides some limited game events.  I hate, hate, HATE, how they chose to do skill tests.  Draw skill cards to look for a little symbol to decide if you succeed?  Stupid.  It way overuses the skill deck.  Instead we roll a d10 on skill tests and succeed on a 1-4, which is the same ratio as the little symbols appear on the cards.  The game can be tedious to set up, separating the cards from the expansions you want to use takes a while.  It is also very long, a typical game taking 5+ hours.

Interesting refresh of Runebound.

Pros:
- Combat is more tactical.  The token system adds interesting timing elements that can result in some satisfying combat rounds.
- Interesting decisions around what equipment to buy based on the symbols on their tokens.
- Quests are revamped and a more important part of the game.
- Timer forces the game to end.

Cons:
- Only one level of encounter.  No more thrill of risking a blue or red encounter early.
- Timer can end the game without anyone winning.
- Token flipping is not as satisfying as dice rolling.
- Stickers falling off the dice.
- Skill system is clunky and too random.  Some skills are much better than others.

I like 3rd edition, but I prefer 2nd.

I liked this title a great deal. The gameplay is fun and the mechanics are solid. I'm not a huge fan of casting tokens, but i've seen more gimmicky mechanics. 

I was hoping that it would fill that Mage Knight itch when I didn't have the time or desire to play it solo over a couple of evenings. Unfortunately, it just made me wish I had played Mage Knight.

I might circle back on this later when the kids are older. Might be a better fit for multiplayer than solo.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the second edition of Runebound but it's very bland in terms of artwork and production. Not a failing but it's par for the course based on when it was released.

This is much better, So shiny and new and I love the updated art. I was skeptical at first but I LOVE the token casting as it also has the added bonus of including another player in the combat proceedings so there's a little less downtime. Great game.

RATING: 5
It has a really fun token combat system. I like it very much. However, the game is quite long and you can be stuck with your starting skills and no or very few items if you are unlucky. You want to fight monster but they are stronger than you. So you want more tokens what items provide. So you want items what costs gold. How do you get gold? Well, you want to kill those stronger monsters. I know there are free 1-2 gold quests or so but still it is hard to break this downhill circle. Once you are behind that it is rewarding. But really not too much to mitigate the luck factor. Overall I was disappointed especially because the characters are otherwise interesting.

This is the vision of Runebound that I always had.  Blows second edition out of the water. The token combat system is ingenious and makes adding equipment to your arsenal feel more meaningful.

Quite different from 2nd Ed.  The board and components are beautiful, but some people will not love the new combat system that uses token-tossing instead of dice.  I happen to like it, but my friends don't seem to.  The combat system does, however, let more than one person do something during a single turn, since two players have to resolve each combat.  I still haven't made my mind up between 2nd and 3rd Ed.  They still feel more or less like different games to me.  I'm glad I own both.

RATING: 8.25
Classic RPG adventure game, you are controlling fantasy character, travel through the land to fight monsters, solve quests and shop in cities. You became stronger by equipping better stuff and learning new skills to finally stop the main villain and won the game. The game provides solo and multiplayer gaming (both cooperative and competitive - when including Unbreakable Bonds expansion) and several different scenarios.
The game consists of some innovative mechanics (combat tokens, skill learning through adventure trophies) and has nice production quality (as always by FFG).
It has also the time tracking so the game is rally a race game to upgrade your hero as possible under limited time and beat the main boss.

What I like:
- This is the RPG game with leveling characters, ambushing creatures, wandering through the fantasy world, shopping in cities to finally match the final boss. I know this is cliche, but I like this theme a lot.
- Various scenarios, each feels quite different from each other with different goals and different approach (also variable difficulty). So everybody can choose and the replayability is high. So far there is 6 different scenarios 
- with inclusion of Unbreakable Bonds expansion, there are three modes the game can be played (solo, multiplayer competitive and multiplayer cooperative). This is very unique that the game allows both cooperative and competitive setting. This also means that some scenarios have different version between these two modes.
- The combat token mechanics is very nice. I love how most equipment have their own combat token so your token pool grows and you are stronger with each equipment added.
- I like how leveling up is not done by simple increasing stats when reaching new level as usual, but instead of learning new skills, which make your hero stronger. The skill system - learning skills using trophies gained from adventures, is also very good.

What I dislike:
- the setup of the game is long. It took some time to pick scenario, create three adventure decks (to have 30 cards each, 10 scenario based, 20 basic - which means to remove some number of basic cards from each to get 30 cards exactly), create skill deck (you should have 3x2 skill sets only, it means you should prepare sets first and then shuffle selected into one deck). Similarly shuffle equipment deck using just some sets. Set adventure gems into the map, creating pile of different tokens, gold. Setup and clean up can took 20 minutes easily. I helped myself with this and use each equipment in the game (not selecting subset of it) and also the most possible number of skills (by now it means 3x3 sets). This means decreased setup time, but also increased random in market (as there could be more numbers of items of the same type) and also in skills (the skills test is more random than usual). 
- The game is a race against time. You constantly feel you couldn't possibly manage all you want in time. This is very strong in this game and I must say I would gladly prefer if the game was more "relaxing" with no such a time pressure (at least in solo play)

RATING: 8.5
I enjoy this fantasy adventure game.  Move your hero around Terrinoth interacting with Combat, Exploration and Social adventures.  

The hero development is fun with different skills that can be learnt and weapons and equipment and other goodies that can be bought from the cities in Terrinoth.

There are only 2 scenarios in the base game, which is classic FFG stinginess.  Although I enjoy the base game so I'll probably end up buying some expansions!  (Which is of course exactly what FFG want.  Ah well).

I think this will be my go-to adventure game when I want a lighter option than Mage Knight.

I've not played the 1st or 2nd editions so I can't compare.

RATING: N/A
Oh this is an awesome adventure game.  Quickly becoming a favorite.    

Game 1: Corbin had 5 ruins and a big-ass sword to save the day.

Game 2: Elder Mok got spanked with only 2 ruins as his special ability didn't pay off enough, even with 3 extra draws.

Game 3: In a quick ending, Lourel of Bloodwood, armed with a big-ass sword, 5 extra health, and 6 Ruins charged! Dragon gave in 8 damage in the first round, then proceeded to heal itself 3 rounds in a row to give me a very satisfying drubbing. Then Mok, also armed with a big-ass sword and extra health got a thrashing.

Game 4: Lord Hawthorne rocks carrying the Truesight Bow, and Forest Garb, with skills Marksmanship, Conversion, Sense of Weakness, and Hardy, and with 5 Ruins, 10 gold and 2 extra trophies.  Get some speed early!

Game 5: Superstar Lyssa parlayed Streetwise and Black Market into Nobel Steed, Truesight Bow, Forest Garb, Potion Kit, Stamina, Stalwart, Conversion, Iron Will, (Ascendance for awhile), and 6 Lore.  Out of sight! 

Game 6: Master Thorn is the master.  Streetwise and Black Market again to get Manipulative, Cunning, Ascendance, Magic Shield (replaced Meditation), Runic Armor, Lighting Rune, Shards of Fate, and 3 Ruins to rock.  

Game 7: Elder Mok gets his revenge.  Early Winged Boots and Black Market led to Scavenging, Taxidermy, Ascendance, Conversion, Sense Weakness, Runic Armor, Lightning Rune, Shards of Fate and 4 runes to make mincemeat of the Dragon.  Next up--the vampire..

Game 8: Laurel needed his revenge.  Taxidermy and Offertory just didn't get enough cash as it was slow going.  Mirror of Souls, Spiked Mail, Sense of Weakness, and a lucky find of Truesight Bow, armed with 5 lore made easy work of Margath, right outside of Tamadir!

Game 9: see session report for glorious 4-player game

Game 10: solo Vorakesh!  Well it's very ugly with 15 zombies and only 4 allies.  But I had 9 gold unspent and no weapon, and 5 trophies unspent, but time is short.

See my session report for more.

RATING: 9
Runebound again, though generally better. Presumably, stuff like Allies and other features will show up in early expansions -- for now the game is solid, though, and more strategic than past Runebounds even though it lacks some of the fun variety.

Admittedly, this is with the mini-expansions added so not fair as a pure rating for the base game, but bumped this up to 9 (1/23/17) after playing some more and appreciating how much more strategy there is in this version of Runebound.

RATING: 8
Great adventure game with lots of options and possibilities and the core is just scratching the surface! Love the different assets, skills, adventure cards and the combat tokens. Very smart.

Could have come with more scenario's, only 2 is a bit meager. But that's just how the FFG heroine model works. Take a shot and leave you begging for more.

RATING: 9
Game which is meant competitive, but which can be played cooperative easily, which is done by us frequently. Although replayability is sufficient because of different heroes, variety in available skill and asset cards, and appearance of adventure cards, the number of two scenarios is scant. Limited playing time for this kind of game is more important to me than the loss of some depth compared to the 2nd Edition.

Single play. This game is going to have plenty of warts but it was fun the first time out and I expect it to remain so. 

Edit: Nope. Way, way too long and the green quest mechanism is completely broken. This is clearly a game for the breadth-over-depth, RPG-lite crowd, not for me.

Great blend of theme and mechanics. I love the way the token-flipping combat works, it is MUCH better than the dice rolling of 2nd edition. Overall, this version is much more strategic than the earlier ones. 9/10.

RATING: 5
Had it, played it, traded it away. I was put away by semi-competitive mode that core game is based upon, which doesn't make sense for me, and also by FFG strategy, which was a result or cause of it - to not include solo and co-operative modes in base game, instead making it separate expansion. I don't see spending 50$ for a game that needs another big box expansion for 40 to let me play the ways it should from the start (same with Elder Sign). Small expansions add another 60$ to this (if I am lucky), which makes it 150$. No thanks FFG.

Updated thoughts June 2016
I recently played my Runebound 2nd edition and 3rd edition back-to-back.  I have much fondness in my heart for 2nd ed, and really expected the older version to hold up well.  However, I found I no longer get much thrill from running up to challenges and just rolling against their to-hit number.  Games have evolved beyond that, and so have my preferences.  The mechanisms of 3rd ed are much more interesting.  Most obvious of these is the new combat system.  It has just enough decisions but still plays fast, and I really do enjoy it.  I especially like how new equipment gives you a new pog.  This would have been even better if it was all custom dice, but that was likely cost prohibitive.  This token system works almost as well.

As far as character development, you have a choice of several ways to go.  You can try to learn skills to boot your stats, allowing you to succeed at social challenges.  You can go on quests to earn cash to buff up through equipment purchases.  You can just go monster bashing.  Or you can do a mix of everything.  It is a highly versatile system that offers many possibilities without too much fiddle or upkeep.

The game has clearly been structured so that it can accommodate expansions without becoming bloated.  FFG has learned their lesson, as evidenced by both Eldritch Horror and this game.

This game also plays pretty well solo.  It is not too hard to make choices for the monsters, and if there is more than one reasonable option for them, I'll just roll a die to decide.

This game doesn't replace Runebound 2nd ed. for me, because it is actually a pretty different game.  However, I am afraid I don't so much enjoy 2nd's style so much any more, so I am very glad they reimagined the game they way they did.

Call this Mage Knight Express.

This is a game that I've wanted for the longest time.  It's semi-co-op only in the fact that all players will lose together, but only one can win - at least with the two scenarios included with the game.

Having never played the previous editions, I can't begin to tell you what's different; instead, all I can say is that the basic mechanic is an action-point pool and you can spend them however you like.  Movement is covered by rolling bestickered terrain dice and moving into appropriate hexes by spending them, with allowances for moving along roads (because they're roads).  Littered throughout the map are adventure tokens which can be flipped for a matching adventure card in a deck that has both common cards and cards peppered in from the big baddie you're fighting.  In the base game, you can fight either a massive dragon or a lich king.  Moreover, each deck contains various things from binary choices to fighting random enemies.

Speaking of fighting, this is the coolest shit ever.  Each hero starts with 3 discs that have icons on both sides.  As you gain equipment, you gain more discs.  When you get into combat, you toss all of your discs and in a heads-or-tails fashion, that determines what you can do during a round of combat.  However, luck be damned, there are ways of manipulating the discs in your favor... that is, of course, if your opponent doesn't have abilities that can do the opposite.  This is a fun way of resolving combat and definitely beats dice rolling on a CRT or drawing cards a la Runewars.  I'm actually surprised I haven't seen this before, but it's a great tactile way of getting players involved in combat.  The only hit here is that the game takes up a bit of table space so you need to find some room to toss your tokens.

Unfortunately, the scenarios included amount to little more than "kill the bad guy to win", but the gameplay is solid and each boss provides a different challenge despite the overall end result.  The dragon allows players to explore the map freely, completing quests, getting equipment, and basically gearing up for the inevitable fight.  The lich king, on the other hand, poops zombies and allows players to have a gaggle of companions using nifty multipurpose "lore" tokens.

The map is divided into hexes and looks absolutely stunning.  Looking at previous editions, they definitely made a go of updating the map.  Unfortunately, there's no hex numbers so it's often a hunt when trying to figure out exactly what hexes a quest card is pointing to, but you eventually get to learn the layout pretty fast so it's not a huge hit against the game.  There's lots of places to go, but without the expansions of previous editions, you do get the feeling that the map is a bit limited as time goes on.  Hopefully they will pump out some expansions for this edition right quick.

Bottom line is this scratches that Mage Knight itch without the overall complexity or fiddliness of it.  The games can exist side by side to suit your mood.  If you want a quick (relatively-speaking) adventure and romp through fantasy lands, you're not likely going to go through the whole hassle of setting up Mage Knight (at least I won't).  And speaking as a guy who loves Mage Knight, that's pretty good praise for Runebound.

Also as a huge plus, Runebound is totally suited for solo play.

Instantly one of my favorite Fantasy Adventure games of all time!   

Great quality components, beautiful artwork and an amazing experience for solo play.   The wide variety of adventures, skills and assets with the ability to switch out sets with the scenarios and expansions means I'll be playing this one every chance I get for a long time.   

Also very enjoyable with two players.  I never felt like there was any downtime since I was always interested in the other players' choices and actions during their turn.  I haven't tried with more them two players yet. 

My only critcism is the stickers on the movement dice...seriously!?

I don't have much to add over what the community has already said about this game... really thematic, good fun, but not a lot of interaction (in the box scenarios at least)and combat can be involved. Unless other scenarios come out that up the interaction, then I would stick to 2 or 3 players as adding a 4th doesn't add much to the play but will add to the time. I ordered a second set of combat tokens to help with a 4 player game, if I decide to give it a shot.

Spiritual successor of "Talisman". Much better gameplay (there are decision to make, you need to have actual plan to win this game) but I  feel that in Talisman theme comes out stronger. Nontheless it is really solid game for 2 players - with bigger number of them downtime can be a problem.

Edit - rating goes up to 9. Great game that gets better with time. Much better than Talisman, there is actually game there that requires strategy and skillfull decision making. Greatest fantasy adventure game that I have ever played. And yes, I have played Mage Knight before.

I cannot imagine playing this with more than three people; two is probably ideal.  Combat slows the game down a bit, but like everything should get faster with experience.

I felt like almost everything in this game was a refined version of something I'd seen before.  Being able to exert at any time to mitigate bad terrain rolls is situational but handy.  Drawing a random card before shopping means you might get something even better.  Casting tokens instead of rolling dice makes the combat much more engaging (albeit slower).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The character skills, assets, and combat tokens were a lot of fun to manipulate. I also enjoyed the different Quests, Events, and enemies that I came across and thought their effects on the game were satisfying. I don't think I can ask much more from this style of game. It really delivers as an adventure game. The combat tokens were way more fun to use than I was thinking. They represent the equipment you buy, and can trigger powerful abilities with their associated cards.

I've beaten the Margath scenario with every character now, and still want to play it more. I find Margath to be a solid challenge, and while I know what to expect now, I still really enjoy the journey of it.

Decent adventure game. Skills concept is neat and leads to some interesting choices.

I feel like the scenarios are too short, even though the actual playtime is long. In a given game you get 2-3 items and 2-3 skills before heading out for the big finale. You also spend most of the time in your corner of the map as there's not a lot of time to walk around.

The game decks are quite thick but you only see a very small portion of them. Maybe 10% over one game. That's good from variety point of view but at the same time it feels like not much happened between the start and the finish.

Man, what a step backward from second edition. Don't get me wrong, some design decisions are really great. But having any monster attack you whenever (like Talisman) is terrible compared to the old colored system. Buying items feels much less empowering than the crazy power combos in the old edition, and combat is TERRIBLE. Man do I feel uninspired by flipping silly tokens.

The wife's a huge fan of RB, so this is going to be a must-buy.

I've tried this only once, and my initial impressions are:

Mind. Blown.

This is the fantasy adventure game that all other fantasy adventure games wished they could grow up to be.

This is a slick playing, ingenious piece of art right here. The game is so variable right out of the gate, I can't see getting bored of the base game alone in less than 100 plays.
Everything about this is top notch. Of course the production is superb coming from FFG, but the absolutely genius-level changes in how the game plays are incredible.

I'll comment at length once I get a few more plays in, but Runebound 3rd. is looking to be hands-down, THE best adventure game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

So far, in a word - SLICK.

Further comments:

The name of the game is character development - and Runebound 3rd. has that in spades. They nailed it on the head here.

After several play-throughs with the wife, I'm finding the character development to be the most interesting bit. The sheer variety in which you can take as a path to victory, and how you outfit your character with items and skills is one of the best implemented I have seen.

The final battle is combat, but you can get there without having a single fight and still be completely capable of taking out the big bad at the end.

It's still maintaining it's rating for me - I have never been so enamored with a game before. I honestly can't wait for more to expand it. But, there's still plenty of meat in the base box to keep anyone satisfied for quite some time.

Don't knock the token combat either - it's an awesome and innovative system that allows for a lot of expansions and variety to be added without the usual expansion bloat. Lots of people are wondering 'Why not dice?' and I honestly can't see the combat system working any other way, unless you introduce custom dice, which would then be a lot more $$ based on the number you would need.
You can just add your own dice or something that can generate a 50/50 result as well, but the tactile feel of the tokens is a nice touch. Plastic token replacements would be cool, but not necessary. I play with them like poker chips during down time. Toss them in the box lid for less hassle, and less mess.

Downtime is reasonable, and you're always engaged in what's happening on the board. And that's because stuff is always happening! There is never a dull moment in this game. It's fast-paced, but you never feel rushed. So far I have always felt there is plenty of time to develop your character and have some cool adventures for a good while before needing to take on the boss.

It has a perfect balance between healthy rule meatiness, and quick play time. Less than 2 hours for set up and tear down, and not once do you ever feel you didn't have enough time, or weren't prepared.

A truly great game.

For the thirst for fantasy. The combat system in this game is its biggest double-bladed sword. Some like it (like I do) but some might find it a way too time consuming and tedious and I kind of understand that.

While my rating of this game does not strictly follow the rules of BGGs system, Runebound is great fun as an evenings experience over popcorn and beers. But not "always want to play."

[b]tl;dr[/b] — A solid storytelling/adventure game that's best with two players; the token-casting combat system is better than dice.  Can end up feeling more mechanical and rushed than evocative, however.

[COLOR=#CC0000][i]There's something deeply satisfying about taking a whip and an axe to a necromancer.[/i][/COLOR]

Say, friend—are you looking for a game with

- expendable sidekicks
- wizard-scalping
- the "Festival of Scabs"
- and a French-kissing ettin?

Well, this is it!  I found these things in the box—[i]and more![/i]—and so can you!*

[b]After 10 plays:[/b]  [COLOR=#979797](5x 2p, 3x 3p, 2x 4p)[/COLOR]

[i]Comparison with 2nd Edition.[/i]
I am a HUGE [i]Runebound[/i] fan—having burned through 1st Edition and collected a complete set of 2nd—and I really like what 3rd is up to.  It's an entirely different game, and doesn't supersede or obsolete 2nd in any way.  I will continue to play both, for different reasons:  2nd to bask in a fully-realized fantasy adventure world, 3rd to explore the new thing.  Comparisons between the two at this point are useless—remember how thin and spare 2nd was when it first came out?  3rd is just a new beginning...

[i]Emergent narrative.[/i]
When it comes to games in general I'm most interested in the stories they tell; when it comes to adventure games it's [i]all[/i] I care about.  I don't give a fig for the systems, mechanics, or underlying math—[i]I just want a good story.[/i]  My only questions are "Was it fun?" and "Was it memorable?"  3rd nails both, and so far [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/plays/thing/181530?userid=9685]the stories have been fantastic[/url].

[i]Build the character you want.[/i]
Everyone I've played this with really enjoys the fact that you can build pretty much any kind of character you want to play.  Though each character starts on a path you are not forced down it—you can change it up based on how skills and gear come out.  Lord Hawthorne can become a powerful mage even as Master Thorn deviates into a combat monster, leaping from wall to wall lopping off heads...  It's cool to hunt for killer combos of abilities/skills/gear—there's a lot of very powerful synergy hidden in the game. 

[i]Play time.[/i]
Count on at least one hour per player; you can knock 30 minutes off the total if everyone's experienced.  This means 2p in 90 minutes (!) but you're still looking down the barrel of 3½ hours for 4p.

This is, first and foremost, a story game—and as such it suffers at max player count where there's just too much story to pay attention to.  With 2p you have your story and your opponent's story (as well as being engaged in every round of combat, either doing it or running the monster); delightful.  With 3p you have two other stories to pay attention to; a stretch, but not unreasonable.  With 4p you have [i]three other[/i] stories and I find it's just too much story flying around as all the action becomes a mishmash of narrative elements to no good effect.  The sweet spot is definitely 2p. 

[i]Final analysis.[/i]
While I could go into more detail about what I've come to love about this, I won't, for the simple reason that it's a game of exploration and adventure—and that means it's best experienced in person over time rather than laid out for you here.  You're going to have to figure out for yourself how to become a hero in this world—how best to prepare for that final fight as the clock ticks down; how to interleave movement toward your next goal with mundane pick-up-and-deliver jobs and exploration quests; how best to utilize and sequence your interactions with the three kinds of encounter decks... and so on.  You could sit down, read all the cards, and min-max your way into an empty, soulless win bereft of surprise or novelty—or you could [i]just play[/i], explore the world organically and become that hero through trial and error across many raucous sessions with friends.  The resulting stories are the real treasure here.

[b]After 20 plays:[/b]  Utlimately, this ends up as a third-tier adventure game for me—meaning I would rather play [thing=27627]Talisman[/thing] or [thing=21523]Runebound 2nd Ed.[/thing] instead.  There are two key issues:  1) the mass of mechanical processes and 2) the countdown timer, both of which actually make it harder to experience a satisfying adventure.  The game's various systems—included here to increase the number "meaningful decisions" and ameliorate any feeling of lack of control—end up working at odds with good storytelling, rather than enhancing it.  Often I am left with the soulless sensation of moving cardboard levers in service to math, and find myself struggling to keep my head in the glorious mind-movie I originally sat down to experience.  This is a personal failing, and one you might not suffer from, but for me it leeches all the gold from the magic circle.  And the countdown timer, a great idea on surface, ends up making the game feel rushed—there's no time to luxuriate in the world, or explore its corners, or take side quests "just because"...  In other words, there's no time for [i]adventure[/i].  The whole thing feels like a bucket of mechanisms to be rushed through as the clock ticks down.*

[size=7]*"Balanced" has all the letters in "Bland", and in the right order, even.[/size]

Don't get me wrong—I will still gladly play this, it's just that it's much more of a struggle to find and maintain the narrative thread than in other adventure games.  And sometimes I don't want to have to put in the extra work this one requires.

This is such a fun adventure romp. Definitely less complex than our favourite, Merchants & Marauders, but not too light. I really enjoy the variety of options to do (quests, shopping, combat, etc.), and the different characters' powers. I've never played the 2nd edition, so had no expectations going into this. The "pog" combat system is great - both my husband and I really like it, and it makes for some really interesting decisions. My major issue with it is that it plays too long for my liking. I'm OK with longer games, but this game can really start to drag, and that's with 2 players. Would never play with more than 2.

RATING: 6
I like it but its very long even at 2 players and we find it drags a bit.

Downgraded it from a 7 to a 6.5.  I wouldn't refuse to play it but I don't know that I would volunteer.  It's not bad but its soooo loooong but without a feeling of buildup.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is currently one of my favourite games, both solo and multiplayer.
 
I've now played it once solo and once with 3 players. I really enjoyed it both times. Solo play requires no rules modifications at all, just ensure you make the best (i.e. worst for your hero) decisions when playing as the monsters.  

The content is very high quality (as I've come to expect from Fantasy Flight), especially for the price. Make sure to shop around as I managed to get it for $60 Australian (brand new), when most stores in Australia were selling it for $130.   

The miniatures are detailed; not quite Games Workshop standard but close. I painted them and they were tricky; small and with parts blocking other parts, e.g. an arm in front of chest/belt. Still I'm happy with the end result.

I have nothing but praise for the game expect for length of play. My mates had to go home because it got late before we finished. There's a bit of down time for players whose turn it is not. Wasn't too bad though. My mates feel it'll be better next time now they have the hang of the rules. 

We all really liked the innovative token combat system (even the guy who kept casting misses) and the terrain dice (even though I rolled mountains when I didn't need them and didn't when I did). 

Overall, great game mechanics with quality components.

Damn.  This is better than 2nd edition for me.

It turns out that I like the tokens.  And I think the different types of encounters, the markets, the healing, and the attribute tests are all better.

I wonder if I'll ever play my collection of 2nd edition stuff again.  Maybe I could try & use the best rules from 3rd edition...

Not usually fond of adventure-style board games (would rather just play an actual RPG), but this looked like one of the better ones so I figured I'd give it a shot. Components are nice (might even paint the minis sometime), combat is unique, and it tells a decent (albeit simple) story with a lot of "flavor". Played solo a couple of times, but will have to play with others to give it a full rating.

Long but fun. Fairly anticlimactic when you invest all the time only to discover you have no shot at the final boss. That problem has not been an issue after getting used to the game but the game is still long and it can still feel pretty disappointing to invest all that time to fight the boss and fail, even when it's clear that you could have beaten it with a better initial casting of the tokens. There are plenty of games I don't mind losing even after investing a ton of time, but something about this one just doesn't create the same tension-filled nail biter when you have the final showdown and can't quite pull off the win. Great for creating the sense of world and story, though.

Walk around, do quests, level up, get better gear and be the first to defeat the big baddie.

A good sense of adventure and questing and the combat tokens are a neat way of doing combat.

The one thing I can kind of fault it for is the dice. It's kind of random and hard to plan your turn around in some cases. The other thing is that the dice require you to put stickers into recessed areas when you first open the game which is a bit of a chore and can be error prone leading to possibly unusable dice at a later point.

A revised take on the RPG genre where players can level a character fully in one sitting without relying on a 6 game campaign (e.g. Descent). I found it an improvement over Runebound v2. Its more streamlined, and leveling much more engaging than a stack of +2 tokens.

That said, downtime was quite noticeable, possibly because of the new combat system. The tokens do add quite an interesting twist over typical dice combat, but I'm not sure its worth the additional downtime.

Overall a solid game, but perhaps an expansion or two, with more distinctive monsters might improve the experience for me.

I don't know what it is, but runebound seems like a really interesting game. The rolling of dice to move seems really stupid thematically, but in gamewise it makes moving so interesting (and I cannot explain why). Also the fight system with all the tokens is really weird and awesome. The game itself feels a lot like Relic which I also like so perhaps that is why I like Runebound too.

An excellent light adventure game, hindered be the fact that the game seems to have too many mechanisms going on at once. The token casting combat mechanic is quite fun and unique, although it makes storing and finding tokens for new gear a pain in the ass. Overall though a fun way to get in a conflict-light adventure game in 60-90 minutes, though I recommend no more than 3 players at once or it will tend to drag.

======================================
13 November 2016 Update: 

Just played it with my kids (3p), definitely better gaming experience than soloing it but again, we have defeated the dragon and non of us feel the desire to repeat that scenario. It takes a long time too, we played approx. 4-5 hours, we better play [b][thing=65532][/thing][/b] instead!
========================================
12 November 2016 Update: 

so, I finally bought it and played it (solo), it wasn't the gaming experience that I was expecting to be... I was disappointed  by that, as soon as I ve finished it I looked at it and said to my self that I ll give it one more chance to play it with my family. 10 minutes later i was reading again the rules of the Runebound 2nd edition to refresh them because I had so much fun with it and I want to feel the same again..

Nice artwork and concept.  Love the combat token casting system in place of dice.  Two major problems:  (1) Quests can be much more accessible to some players putting others at big disadvantage (quests should be placed equidistant from players on the map rather than set location), and (2) The Dragon in the base scenario is WAY TOO HARD to KILL.  His regeneration ability is overpowered and characters don't have enough time to power up to match him.  So the starting/teaching scenario is almost impossible to beat.  Bad play testing.  I've also heard that the 2nd zombie scenario in the base game is broken too...losing player can become spoiler so no one wins.  That is probably the biggest issue with the game:  players who know they are going to lose can mess with the winning player so that no one wins.  Maybe some of the expansion scenarios fix this flaw.  Game needs to be seriously house-ruled to make it playable.

Played a co-op game with SO and we had a blast!  The chips for combat work wonderfully and the upgrading of skills  is really clever!  My only complaint would be the terrain dice, stickers?  Unacceptable for a FFG product that is typically a notch above the rest when it comes to quality.  Already had a couple of the stickers come off the dice.

More expansions with generic cards (social, combat, quests) would be nice.

Step 1 , get Runebound 3rd edition in a box...


Some odd initial observations I noticed between the 2nd and 3rd edition. 

1) The 3rd edition box is a about a half inch shorter than the 2nd edition box. 

2) The 3rd edition map is a small subset (zoomed in version) of the 2nd edition map.

3) The insert for the 3rd edition is not as nice as the 2nd edition insert. 

4) Everything else from the 3rd edition whips 2nd edition's arse. 

Still working out some games and some setup adjustments but giving an initial solid "8" so far.  The smaller box did irk me a bit.

Two distinct scenarios give shape to your adventures in Terrinoth, challenging you to battle undead or outwit a dragon, even as you explore lost ruins and forgotten forests and take on quests across the realm. New adventure cards and story cards for each scenario make every game unique, alongside the ability to customize your hero with over one-hundred different skills and assets. Whether you play as a mage bristling with spells or a powerful warrior, every game of Runebound invites you to experience an incomparable adventure. Take your first steps into the world of Terrinoth!

The new combat system is not for everyone and that includes myself. Not sure if the designer was inspired by Pogs or what but I'd rather chuck dice than throw cardboard tokens around. Also I would rather spend stamina instead of discarding skill cards. Milling through a deck for skill checks was also not my cup of tea.

That being said, if you missed out on Runebound 2nd ed, maybe this would be a good place to start.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The pog system for combat is actually kind of interesting. However, I found the rest of the game rather bland. The battles can also take some time to resolve as there are actually decisions to be made at times so there can be down time although we just let the next person go. Considering how hard gold can be to come by, I also didn't much care for the adventure cards that let you "steal" a card from any marketplace - it felt considerably overpowered. This is very much a streamlined game of building up your character and being the first one to take out the big boss. In all, I'd play again, but I'm not enamored with the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable but overlong choose your own medieval adventure boardgame. The game takes a mininum of 1 hour per player and feels very solitary. The fun is immersing yourself in the theme and the stories that are on the cards. The gameplay is simple with the exception of combat which brings a very brainburning element to the game.

The game's pace is too slow. It takes a very long time to level up your character enough so that it can challenge the boss of the scenario. Still, when you do manage to get that expensive and powerful weapon from the market, it feels very satisfying. 

So this is a great storytellng game with a great theme, that will take up quite a chunk of your evening and is best played with only 2 or 3 players due to its play length.

This is it... this is the game I've been looking for! I hadn't played any of the previous incarnations of Runebound, so I didn't have any baggage to make me question the changes made to the 3rd version, but I really like what they've done.

I have always been looking for a grand adventure game that tells a story, lets me develop a character and kick some butt along the way! I've tried Middle Earth Quest, which has some cool elements, but ultimately didn't work for me because it won't play solo. I tried Legends of Andor and found it to be beautifully tedious puzzle game. Talisman is somewhat amusing with a group of drunk players, and Thunderstone is just a fun little card game about collecting points. Dungeon Run gave me the runs. None of these games ever really immersed me into another world that I felt I could explore at my leisure while striving to overcome some growing evil presence in the land. Runebound does this, and it does it well.

Unique movement dice dictate where you can traverse across the luscious map of Terrinoth. Heroes and weapons come with unique combat tokens that are rolled like ancient runes to determine the fate of the combatants. Players can choose between 3 different adventure decks. Each deck offers a different set of quests, events and characters or monsters to interact with, and some offer choices which can be made to enhance or escape certain situations. Story cards pop up and populate the map as the game timer counts down, introducing group quests that offer the heroes new ways to defeat their enemy.

The core box offers two scenarios which allow the players to competitively fight against an ancient mighty dragon, or a wicked necromancer. Future expansions should open up a world of exciting adventures filled with brave heroes and malicious monsters. 

Fantasy Flight has really been firing on all cylinders lately, and this reboot delivers an epic gaming experience with the potential for unparalleled adventures in fantasy board gaming. I couldn't be happier with the purchase, and look forward to future expansions.

All in all it is a fun game that nicely fills adventure style boardgame niche that I have been missing.

Interesting combat revamp, nice story immersion, quite streamlined with very little downtime (only combat has downtime, but it pays off due to the interesting choices). Skill system is great, ensures that the game is not repetitive, while not sacrificing each hero's uniqueness (heroes don't feel generic). The game visually looks stunning which helps with immersion. 

However, the game has some flaws (for my personal taste) which have resulted with only upper mid rating:
-	There is no feel of urgency – players don't „feel“ the darkness is rising and lack of the penalty for being defeated (except in final battle) benefits the players to take risks which are out-of-character.
-	board is passive, except for a dragon traveling towards the city for few rounds, the world doesn't feel „alive.“
-	I feel there are some balancing issues (but still haven't played enough to be certain) – e.g. combat heavy character are better suited for scenarios (since victory can only be achieved with combat), some skills seem OP (puppet master makes final combat too easy imho)
-	There is too much focus on combat, which results with low immersion for any non-combat characters (like master thorn)

Nevertheless, global design of base mechanics is great, and expansion heavy system of the game will allow possibility of evolution of the game into something greater and mitigation of the mention flaws. In the meanwhile, Runebound 3rd edition will serve as a fun adventure game to play from time to time, but will fail to offer epic adventuring experience.

Compared to Talisman which we've recently resumed playing after acquiring the excellent Cataclysm expansion, Runebound 3rd edition just feels too mechanical for our tastes.

There's a lot of nifty combos and synergy to be found in the skill and asset decks, but acquiring all that seems more like work.

I want to be immersed in the story rather than worry about mechanics.

I understand the appeal, but I'd rather play something more thematic and immediately gratifying, and evocative, and Talisman with the expansions delivers that in spades, having an enormous variety of playable characters and encounters. 

Still, Runebound is okay for  when we're in the mood for a longer game.

Used to play the 2e, today played 3e first time. It took 5 hours with 4 people, but 1 left after 3. We lost the game - we find it really hard to get enough gold/equipment. But love the way it changed. It is way more tactical, from to choice of adventure to fight strategíes. The design is pretty, the skills are interesting. Recommend it for 2-3 players! With 4 players it may be sometimes a bit slow.

Very good fantasy board game. A bit long, but still my type of game.

RATING: 8
FUN: the game clock, scenario structure, experience system and turn structure are all a big improvement over 2nd Edition.  

UNIQUE: the new combat system is very unique as it uses different two-sided tokens instead of dice. It's not faster than the 2nd Edition system, but it's a lot more interesting.

UNIQUE: Too bad that, despite all these improvements, the game is still pretty long.

Je n'en retiens que le bon système de combat. Pour le reste, trop basique, trop solitaire et trop long. Le système de quête n'est pas plus poussé que celui de Runewars alors qu'il est censé être ici central. Pourquoi ne pas s'être inspiré par exemple de Robinson pour générer des conséquences à nos actes lors des quêtes et créer une vraie évolution du monde ?

I like this game. I really do. I would not subject most of my friends or family to it because it can be kind of boring and there is a point in the end where you just want it to be over. This makes the winner the person who finally ended the game.

epic adventure game. love it! takes some time. great with 2 but also good with 3 or 4. of course you have to be interested in the adventures the other players have. and forget about the rule regarding who controls the monster in a fight. in a 3 or 4 player game, we always play that the monster is played cooperatively by the other 2-3 players. this way everyone is involved.

I really like fantasy games and so this became part of my collection. I usually play this with my board-mates and we loved the game (took so long though). But after moving out from the boarding house, it became hard for me to bring this back as my wife is not fond of "take that" mechanic and it kinda breaks my heart on games that I try to crush her (ex. combat games). So to make space for more Euros, this has to go.

Update (October 2017)
Since the first expansion came out, where the combat with monsters was automated, I'll probably buy back this game.

RATING: 9
Love this game. It's superior to the boring dicefest that was 2e.  The "pog" combat components work like a dream making each combat a competitive, intellectual exercise involving the other players.  The pogs have you building out your character in surprisingly fun and very satisfying ways that make the game a delight to play.  It takes us a couple of hours (sometimes a little longer)  playing with two to finish it but it never feels long.

This game is amazing. Fun to play solo, it is basically a different game vs. the 2nd Edition, and I am ok with that. It plays relatively quickly and I like the idea of using the tokens. Great fun!

high 8+ after 1st play solo hope to get to multiplayer table.. and hope will increase score if it has more staying power after more plays
1st play was a warrior played a few thing wrong but good vibe, hack n slashed to victory
2nd play played elf. picked up a trader skill and instead off adventuring ended up trading to gain gold to buy items to then battle the dragon.. lost 
3rd play multiplayer 3 players.. i rush a dragon battle and died.. 2nd player took it but 3rd player was having terrible luck. still enjoyed by all 3..
4th 3 players again, i bomb terrible luck as the orc and hawthorn lead the charge as a tank immune to damage with some great luck on money making scenario quests buy high end defensive gear!, the ranger player did will picking up movement dice and questing about..
Also got a 4 player games in.. 3 hours with rules explanation we didn't finish 3/4 through  /2nd play i will push to do stuff during others turns and i think we can get play time to with in 2 hours 2/3hrs?

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  Totally delivers on its tagline, "A Fantasy Adventure Boardgame."  That's exactly what you get in this box:  fantasy themed adventure in a boardgame format.
[b]+[/b]  Component quality and artwork are typical FFG high quality (with one exception below).  The board looks great.  The cards are nice.  The artwork is well done.  The tokens are thick.
[b]+[/b]  Both of the scenarios have a different feel to them, offering different strategies of success and gameplay.
[b]+[/b]  I played three of the six available characters, and they also have a slightly different feel to them.  Each one has a different starting strength, ability, and stats.
[b]+[/b]  Lots of variety in the cards, especially playing a single role:  adventures, items, and skills.  You won't even see one-third of these in a solo-character game.

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  There are only two scenarios in the base game.  That seems one light to me.  Maybe it's my love of Schoolhouse Rock, but in my mind, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0]Three is a Magic Number[/url].
[b]-[/b]  There is no Player Aid, not even on the back of either rulebook.  On one is a listing of all the icons in the base game, which is nice, but a simple turn order and list of actions and their costs seem like a no-brainer to me.
[b]-[/b]  Seriously?!  Stickered dice?  That's totally acceptable for a PnP game or even a new publisher.  But for a company of FFG's size and market share, printed dice are really expected.  My copy of Runebound was barely used when I received it, and my stickers are already peeling up around the edges.  I have contacted FFG for a new sticker sheet.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  Runebound takes one-third the brain power as playing Mage Knight.  But it also takes one-third the time.  Depends on what you are in the mood to play and experience.
[b]~[/b]  Once you get passed the "weird" idea of token-chucking as a replacement for dice-chucking to resolve combat, it does add small, but potentially important, tactical decisions you just don't get from straight up dice value comparison.  However, it does add to the game's length.
[b]~[/b]  There is still some luck involved both in card draws and those tokens, but it doesn't seem as much as with dice.
[b]~[/b]  The double rulebook format that FFG has embraced works fine here (unlike in Warhammer Quest: ACG).  But I still don't understand why it can't be combined into one cohesive rulebook.

Can't really call it "playing" if there are 4 players.
With 3 ... it's kind of "i can play it" but i'm actually playing less than half of the time.
With 2 it's a really fun game.
It would be really nice to have the possibility to interact with other players.
The disc-based battles, are nice, and feel quite unique, but are a little too slow for more than 2 player games.

HUGE improvement over the second edition. Runebound is now my go-to open world fantasy board game. There are so many little innovative aspects to this game that I came away feeling very impressed with it. For a new edition of a game that really didn't feel like it needed one, Runebound delivers in a big way. It's just a shame that there are only two scenarios in the base game, though I suspect that they'll have a decent amount of replay value.

UPDATE: The fact that everyone can lose this game, especially in scenarios that should be cooperative (Though they're not), really started to bug me after awhile. There are some cool, fresh mechanisms here, but the game isn't sure what it wants to be. As fresh as some of its mechanisms feel, I ended up getting rid of this. If I want something in a similar vein where I don't feel as rushed, I'll play the WoW board game.

The game worked smoothly as a 2-player game.
I however foresee that as a 4 player game, this will drag on.
The travel "quests" are flawed when reaching the end of act 2, since you're gambling with taking discovery-cards, since there's a high probability they won't be possible to finish.
Compare that to the other decks, which have fewer of these missions, you're better of trying those.
This scews balance of the game.

RATING: 6.5
6 Plays - After multiple plays, I've come to enjoy this a little more, though it still seems to lack the fun, character building/ adventuring theme it's selling and expect. It is fairly sandbox-y (which I generally do like), as you kind of just see where 'the flow of things' take you. You need to take advantage of emerging opportunities and simply try to engage in/ interact with as much as you can. You do this to gain a good balance of skills and items, which you do need to be pretty efficient (and a little lucky) to achieve. 

Then suddenly, the end of the game arrives out of no-where and you experience a sudden 'squeeze'. The game story draws to a close and you realise that you're inadequately prepared for the finish line. In a last ditch effort you cash in what you can and have a shot at taking down the scenario boss, losing as often as you win. Will play if I'm in the mood and want to play something that I'm not too invested in, though probably wouldn't suggest. Though this has improved over more plays as I've gotten better at, it just doesn't seem to give me interesting strategic choices.

OWN: 2nd Edition + all expansions
OWN: 3rd Edition

----------------------------

3rd EDITION COMMENTS...

Not entirely convinced by the new combat system. It's ok as a micro-game I guess, and very different to simple tossing dice. Just not sure we prefer this to 2nd Edition overall. I don't yet know if we'll bother getting any expansions for 3rd Edition, as we have a complete 2nd Edition which we still enjoy. Storage space & price may be a factor here.

...more detail...

Many changes from 2nd Edition. Main change is the new token casting combat, which is certainly unique (will be interesting to see how expansions might further develop it). Still has the movement dice & terrain-matching system, moving across a board to tackle various quests on gems/markers (movement now seems much quicker/easier).

Quests are now split by type rather than by difficulty. And instead, difficulty of all quests/monsters jumps at one point, part-way through the game.

The game is still not heavy on PvP, and is a race game, as was 2nd Edition (first player to become powerful enough to tackle the end boss!)

Character development / abilities / skills system seemingly adapted from Descent 2nd Edition... much simpler here though. I guess many of FFG recent games are quite similar in this area though.

Two adventures included in base game, and there are some cards in the various decks which are swapped out depending on the adventure.

Slightly concerned that when expansions start releasing, it might get very messy/cumbersome to constantly switch out A/B/C asset tokens & cards, and the 6 sets of skill cards. 2nd Edition simply allowed most of the smaller expansions to be mixed in as you saw fit, while keeping the new adventures (small or boxed) to separate decks that were easily swapped.

----------------------------

2nd EDITION COMMENTS...

Awesome RPG on a board. It does take a while to play, but the adventures you get to have along the way make it well worth your time!

Compared with Return of the Heroes, Runebound tends to take longer but is meatier (more complex abilities & items etc.) and much more varied, while at the same time having much less convoluted rules, and being easier to tweak to your liking if required. It also has some of the feel of Talisman, but with many more choices to make.

Plays well with 2 players, and it's faster that way too.

Great components. The box is extremely over-sized, though in this case it could actually be useful for storing the expansions...

The HUGE number and variety of available expansions can only help the replayability (and the base game is hardly lacking in that area to begin with). Definitely a game that we'll be playing well into the future!

Some of the expansions encourage PvP combat, but the system doesn't really lend itself well to beating up on other characters. The base game seems to play better as a friendlier affair, although there are occasions where an attack on another player can be a good move, particularly if they're already weakened from an earlier combat.

NOTE: Includes unpainted grey figures (for player-characters only). With games like this I've recently taken the approach of blu-tacking small coloured poker chips underneath the figures (with a matching chip on the table in front of each player). This helps differentiate the figures when you don't have the time or desire to paint numerous figures.

The first play through was fun and very interesting, but unfortunately after a few more play troughs the game becomes very repetitive and as a player you quickly starts to lose interest. There is 4 small expansions, that adds a few new scenarios but all in all nothing new just more of the same.  The combat and equipment system with tokens is fun and very interesting, but at times it can drag on and bring a lot of downtime for others players.  FFG have announced a big box expansion, perhaps it will bring some fresh new things, but until then the game is just collecting dust.

This game seems a bit of a mashup of Arkham Horror meets D&D Expert (Marsh/Cook) wilderness exploration rules. There are lots of characters, areas, skill and gear to explore and exploit. I have two quibbles with the game. The economy part... gearing up... seems very slow considering the turn limit imposed on the game. Buffing characters enough to slay the big bad takes too long. Combat is also tricky and deadly in the 2nd act. Not playing frequently enough to keep on top of combat timing will make this a frustrating, infrequent game.

By now I just played once a 2 player game but we really enjoyed it. We spend 180 min in the first play, but we did not feel it too much. 

The new combat system is a good improvement as it gives to the game more player interaction and a tactical control of the luck management (better than only with dice).

This game is going to be in my fives or dimes for sure. Just waiting to play it again.

EDIT: I've played it again with 3 players and it also was really fine. The time was almost the same as our first play, 2:30h.

Really enjoying first game. Also 11 & 9 yo loving it. Was concerned what the dice would be like but I like them - look nice with the stickers & good weight. Combat token system is fun & I think a cool mechanic, after a few battles. Casting the tokens works fine with a stubby cooler as someone else suggested:). Really wanting to play all the time!

05-12-2015. Rated after 4 plays. I do like Runebound 3 a lot, and I'm a player of the older second. Each hero tries to adventure towards defeating the final enemy first.

During your turn, you can move, encounter, heal and shop. Encounters come in 3 types, in which events, quests or combat encounter predominate. If you attack, you get an innovative coin flip token combat. 

All in all, I really like Runebound 3 and the changes it makes on Runebound 2.

It's different enough, but, while I haven't played MK, my impression of MK is there's some real hand management that's more a trait of Euros than Ameritrash. RB3 has some hand management with the training cards (see the rules) but it's not Euro-brain-burning. More like, "I don't want to use this card for its Skill use, so what else can I use it for?" Long-term choices are more like understanding how to best use your trophies (experience points) and gold to buy skills and items. While RB3 isn't random choice, it's a race game, so you *can* press your luck with another encounter (combat, social, or quest) rather than rest. At four players, we had a small amount of "who can get there first" interaction.

The tokens won't wear out any more than any frequently handled cardboard component in any of your other games. Do you have any worn cardboard pieces? Yes, I do know someone who would rattle the tokens in a dice cup for several minutes before casting them.

Short review: Could get a higher vote if more variety were granted by some more scenarios. Extremely solid game, fastpaced (2p plays in less than 90 minutes) and fun to play. The token system could seem dumb, but actually it's not. As a general note, the game has a huge potential: the core set is just the skeleton for an entire world of adventures.

RATING: N/A
The movement mechanism is almost the same as Second Edition, the development of the characters, using cards, is better, the Doom Track is easier to handle and more intuitive, shop in the markets is easier, but the progress of the encounters is better in Second Edition. Besides, there are a lot of quests in the decks, and I like more the combats and the tests. Overall, I think I stay with the old one, probably out of nostalgia, but this shows a lot of improvements.

Fantastic 

:) Improves and balances 2nd edition in nearly every way
:) New combat system is innovative and awesome
:) New different decks work really well
:) Good amount of choices to customize your characters
:) Unique scenarios having their own cards in the adventure decks, and their own event deck really make the theme stand out
:) Flavor Text is well done, everything ties together to tell a story, even combat

:!block: - A few gear shows you some really cool things they can do with the combat token system, but for now it's just a tease

:soblue: Needs more gear/skills already
:soblue: The 2 scenarios are a little too samey 
:soblue: Downtime at 4 players
:soblue: Too lengthy, didn't have to be

Aside from the the vastly superior, and better paced, gaming experience it offers, I'm really impressed with how FFG managed to tidy up the mess that the Runebound setting used to be, and to make it coherent to the other titles involved with it. Although perhaps not that compelling a backdrop, this aspect, along with a focus on more varied adventuring and a much more fluid character development engine, have hugely increased my enjoyment of this. I would say this is the best adventure game in my collection.

Another variation on the works of my least favorite designer: A.C. KABOMS (Accumulate Cards and Keep a Bunch of Modifiers Straight). Runebound follows a tired script: Start out with a character with a bunch of cards and special abilities, acquire more and more cards and special abilities as you go, keep getting more, more, more until the table is a mess of possessions, skills, and ongoing effects. Tough to find a fantasy adventure game that doesn't devolve quickly into this predictable pattern.

Did not rate the game as I haven't played it, below are just impressions. But it's enough for me to pass on it.

Watched the preview videos to see what FFG plans for the upgrade was.

Horror. As for the new stuff: it seems they have just incorporated the Descent skills system but in a dumbed down way. Then I realized that as there are no levels on the map but 'thematic' encounters, that is dumbed down to prevent players from taking on too much (one of the factors providing much excitement in the base game imho: am I strong enough to know I can take this yellow/purple quest? Can I afford to wait?). Then I realized that for me there would absolutely no incitement to break out Runebound 3rd above Descent, so somehow they seemed to have succeeded to take out all the fun of the 2nd for me.

To me, 3rd is 2nd with added 'FFG Generic Sause'. No thanks, I'll pass. 

However, great that this new edition is coming, as people are dumping long-sought after expansions left-right right now, providing me the opportunity to finally get these at decent prices! :)

I really enjoyed the majority of time spent playing the second edition - except when PvP reared its ugly head (I don't generally mind conflict, but it somehow felt out of place and unnecessary in Runebound). But PvP is probably only a problem when playing with someone who's into that, so playing with someone who isn't super aggressive could be a bunch of fun. The token mechanism certainly looks intriguing an unique!

Light fantasy game with high amount on randomness. 

It is a bit long( 1.5h for a 2p game), however it flows fluidly. There is not much downtime, and no reason for AP.

A well designed game, that feels very polished.

Highly thematic and exciting experience.

Mage Knight is a better adventure game, however this one is lighter and has a radically different feel.

Runebound plays like a lighter version of Mage Knight. The challenge of hand management and deck building is removed, instead you must use limited actions to skill up, adventure, and purchase equipment with a timer moving toward the proverbial midnight. Adventure games like this and MK have an issue with low interactive parallel adventuring. Runebound deals with this during combat by having the player to the right of the active player running whatever enemy is being fought, and there are meaningful decisions that can screw your opponent. In the end everyone loses or one person wins and the other just don't lose (sort of like WWII).

Easily the best iteration, at least mechanically. I really enjoy the oddball combat system. I wish gameplay had more angst; usually the choices are clear, just the resolution is cloudy. Which fits for most adventure games, but in a world with Mage Knight, it's a harder sell to get on the table.

RATING: 9
This is the best fantasy adventure boardgame I've played yet.

I prefer this game over Mage Knight because Mage Knight is for me too rule heavy and pure calculation. Runebound has much lighter rules and allows for adventure immersion.

About the tokens... I was like most players reluctant on tossing tokens. But to my surprise it really works. Each combat turn, ie token toss, makes for a nice micro puzzle. There is luck of course on how the tokens land but the total is managable.

Each scenario has a game timer so it's not a long epic game where for can develop every aspect of your hero. Instead you have to focus maximizing your available actions. It doesn't feel like an extreme optimization eurogame but it does have that aspect that you need to optimize every action. Otherwise you won't survive the villian fight (which is perma-death btw). But it's all accomplished through really fun adventuring, choosing where you go, what to buy, which quests to go on. There are enough heroesm skill and quest cards to make it replayable. A few more scenario's would be welcome. Note that I did buy the expansions.

I'm not entirely happy with the skill check where you draw cards hoping for a success. But it's not game breaking. Also, I suspect 3 players is the absolute limit time wise.

To conclude, I'm really pleased to take the plunge and buy it. It's a well designed and all round fantasy adventuring pacakge.

Disclaimer: I haven't played Runebound 2nd so can't make a comparison with that edition.

Fantasy story line RPG board game reimplementing 2nd Edition. Setup random tokens for mini encounters, combats, and quests on the map board to face using the familiar terrain movement dice system.  Combat now uses a pog flipping battle system.  Encounters are run by non-active players which isn't my favorite.  Cards for hero skills and items offer an interesting exertion system.  Events are activated as the scenario timer counts down.  Limited AI for the encounters and combat is a bit dissappointing compared to evolution of this aspect with its peers.

Fantastic for solitary play! About an hour tops. It´s very easy to define the best options for the monsters. It can get hard sometimes but the tokens provide an amazing level of strategy that is simple yet mindful. If the game becomes too easy you can alway reduce the number of rounds until it gets difficult enough.

A refined adventure game system. This is a go-to game for the build up an adventurer game. The combat tokens get some getting used to and a fiddly set-up with the different cards decks from the expansions (hopefully there will be an official FF app to aid both of those).  

The unbreakable bonds expansion fixes the multiplayer 'almost' solitaire by making it cooperative! It is a bit fiddly but it is an experience that is rarely replicated.

Enjoyed this over 2nd edition, but even as a solo game, took several hours to play.  It's still a long game, and I don't think I'll have the patience to play with more than 2, as I got antsy even with the exhaustive length of my one player experience.  Disagree with comments saying it's just 60 minutes per player.  After two plays, first play with 2 heroes and one play with one hero,  both games were 2+ hours in length.  Not gunning to play again right away.

RATING: 7.5
Hugely enjoyable fantasy game - needs expansions and I've ranked it 7.5 because I think there should have been more in the base game. A bit cheeky by FFG in my opinion. It should have at least one extra boss enemy in addition to Margath and the Corpse King. Needs more cards and equipment. The potential however is evident. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Runebound Mark III introduces some nice improvements over 2nd edition: unique token-based combat that involves another player (acting as the monster); an increase in the number of actions per turn (which, along with a smaller map, facilitates long-distance travel); a satisfying skills menu; and a "light at the end of the tunnel" rule that puts a hard limit on the number of turns.  The game is an engaging, if generic, fantasy bash, and so far most participants have enjoyed the experience.

As far as player limits go, there's an overwhelming consensus that the game is best with two.  With more, some opponents become listless bystanders due to their non-participation in the active player's combat.  Plus, a higher player count makes the game longer, but not better.  I would play again with three (never four), but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Anyway, 3rd edition does seems to be a successful reinvention of the original. The game, however, is not without its problems:

The time limit is a welcome addition, but as designed it makes the game tough to win.  Some examples...

*Players are dependent on the right asset(s) becoming available for purchase at the right time in the right location.

*Combat defeats, particularly in the early game, can cause negative swings in momentum that are potentially insurmountable.  Not only does the losing player forego the money reward and the trophy, but s/he also has to waste precious time recovering health.  "Rich get richer" has always been a strike against race-to-kill games, and time limits only exacerbate the problem.

*Late game quests are often pointless, as there isn't enough time to complete them.  (Possible fix: Draw 2, keep 1 in the last 1/4 of the game?)

*Players have to travel to the boss location to engage in the final climactic battle, but there might not be enough time to both adequately prepare for combat and make the trip.

Generally speaking, it's not clear that players can win without synergistic items/abilities that generate an overpowered damage effect.  (See also bullet #1 in the time list, above.)

Money scarcity is brutal, particularly in combination with the time limit.  So far I'm 2-0 because I scored early trade goods and was always victorious over early-game enemies (yay rewards), and by game's end my combat tokens were amazing.  It isn't clear that anyone else had a shot at winning, frankly, which I find troubling. 

If so inclined, players can ensure that the potential leader is slowed to the point where s/he might not win. Examples: A player might shop in a city for the sole purpose of discarding the leader's next purchase from the marketplace, or (in the zombie scenario) the non-leaders might agree to stop killing zombies to make the boss villain more difficult to vanquish.  For the game to work properly, given the harsh time limit, players should agree to cooperate to give someone (anyone) a chance to win.

Finally, there are two issues specific to the zombie scenario:

*The scenario doesn't scale well with fewer players.  Fewer players = fewer player actions to track down and eliminate zombies (particularly those in hard-to-reach places), which means that the boss is harder to kill for no good reason. Also, dispatching zombies is an unrelenting grind that isn't particularly entertaining. (Fix: For story events, the # of spawned zombies isn't set, but is instead  = to the # of players + 1.)

*Players can spend an inordinate number of actions to obtain a companion, only to have it arbitrarily disappear on a later turn due to a bad die roll.

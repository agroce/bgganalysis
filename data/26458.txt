RATING: N/A
From Ebay for $29 on 01/11/09.  New, unpunched.  One of the few GBoH title I didn't preorder on the P500.  Review was very favorable, so I ended getting a copy.

My first GBoH game!  Very enjoyable solo.  So many delightful elephant rampages.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure the rules about not being able to attack make for a very good game.  The simulation may be excellent, but as a game I think it suffers.  It's still an interesting exercise, and perhaps I just haven't figured out how to use these armies effectively.

RATING: 8.25
I like the game for diferent things:
first one: the historic moment, war in India before Christ.
Second: I am fan of GBoH.
Thrid: The game have a a lot of and diferent scenarios.
Fourth: I can use chariots, a lot of archers and war elephants his special rules, (more interesant this rules)
And finally in the game are new ideas; for example a nigth attack;or grade,

The optional rule of dharmayuddha is very interesant because is more historic and normally I use this rule. the other rule, random selection, normally not use.

Definitively, the game is well balanced and more entertaining.

My first play of GMT game. Love the packaging, map, counters, scenario/historical details. Rules are wide and deep and took several reads. Found myself continually flipping pages. Played first scenario, Pataliputra, solo. A good intro to the system. Nandas stomped. Clear fields are a bit boring so looking forward to next scenario's play.

A nice addition to the GBoH Series. The scenarios with the Macedonians and Seleucids are next on my playlist. Very Cool! Rating increased after more playing...excellent game!

I'm more of a HI/HO type really but this game is fun despite having close to zilch heavy infantry (apart from Seleucus).

Very novel take on the GBoH system. Well worth trying out.

RATING: 7
rating could go up with more play. This is a decent package and entry into the GBOH line. The scenarios are varied including Indian vs Indian and Indian vs Macedonian, with sieges and pitched battles to boot. It has its own modifications to the standard GBOH leadership activation/command system but nothing complex, I enjoy this as much as SPQR.

RATING: 8
Repeated playing has forced me to raise my grade.  The India-specific rules for this game are distinctive, and reinvigorate a system I have been playing for 17 years.  Still, I have never felt that GBoH handles Elephants well, and there are Elephants aplenty in India. The notes from the Designer, found on both BGG and CSW, are great.

The GBOH system can sometimes be challenging, but it is far from impossible to learn.  This iteration is no different.  My wife is fascinated by Indian culture, so the theme should make this one easier to get to the table.

Very interesting, I would not recommend it as a intro to GBOH but if you are familiar with the system/happen to be a fan of this period/location it will give you plenty of bag for the game buck. Its a good game, some very interesting situation, just not as fluid as a game like GBOH Alex.

There is a good variety of unit types and terrain in this game.  Chandragupta is a worthy addition to the GBoH series.  The game's best feature is the chance to use a completely different model of army than other games in the series.  Elephants and Chariots are your strongest units in melee.  Indian Archers are the strongest ancient missile units in the series and using them correctly is important to victory.

An interesting new take on the GBoH series. A good mix of varied scenarios with cool terrain and units unique to the ancient Indian era of battle it simulates.

Tactical ancient Indian warfare at its best . . .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First, let me say that any game with elephants gets a thumbs up from me.  I very much like the fact that this game has some of the strange quirks of ancient Indian warfare built into it.  It's frustrating but authentic to have your elephants and chariots stare aloofly at the enemy infantry instead of trampling them. I'm not so keen on the small piece size although I could see the game being adapted quite nicely on a larger map using miniatures.  The game actually plays quite quickly.  Set up does take a bit of time though so I can see why the game has a listed play time of four hours.

Improved Alexander "engine"! New units - and tactics :) Kudos to designer and developer, because battles require very different strategies than in more famous Alexander or SPQR.

Historicity of scenarios can be somewhat suspicious (less than ideal sources), but I don`t mind. Did I mention there are Greeks here also? :D

Great addition to the GBoH line. This is really a very fine game about a very interesting topic. The rules are very well written and it offers a good variety of units and scenarios.
I think it might go up in rank after a few more plays.

RATING: 5
GBoH is probably the great system most wargamers seem to worship. It is also certainly a major undertaking, and its titles have a clear pedagogical added value. This one has also a certain exotic spin to it. 

But it's just not for me: way too old school, fiddly and ultimately unwieldy (with all those hidden counters trying to keep track of the history of each unit...). This one is better than RAN (the only other title in the series I own) in terms of rule ambiguity (or maybe a I just tried a little harder here), but still the enjoyment I get from this does not offset the effort required. 

Normally, I don't necessary dislike retro or fiddliness, when it serves a purpose I like, so I think my partial dissatisfaction just boils down to my preference for grand strategy over tactics.

Interesting situation between the powerful hammers without the backbone of anvil.
I was required to change a style from Western.
But I think that the matrix CRT of GBoH is suitable for a fight between the armies of the different system.
I want to try play with Macedonian army system on the next time.

I think is the most creative game idea to enter the GBoH lineup. I pushed counters finally and like a lot more. Hence I've upped my rating. Thanks, for bringing this obscure (at least in the west) topic to us.

Different feel than other GBOH games due to the lack of Heavy Infantry and using old tactics leads to poor results :)

The unique rules do a great job of giving flavor (Elephants, Chariots and the Mauryn command structure.)

Further the battles are different than other GBOH titles with city attacks and sieges included.

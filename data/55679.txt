An interesting game. Setup and the rulebook are a big turn-off, but gameplay is smooth once you get the hang of it. However, the game is not very immersive. It has a "mechanical" feel. But maybe it's just the solo scenarios...

My rating is for the Xbox 360 version (as counterproductive as that may be).  The physical version would probably be closer to an even 6, since having to do the book-keeping myself would likely bog down an already sluggish experience.  Yes, it can be a bit of a slog, but it's pretty good.  Certainly worth five bucks for the digital version.

I give this game its rating based on how well it does what it does, but not free of thoughts about what it could have done, instead.

The system is sound, and quick-playing.  It reflects well the hard-target/soft-target dichotomy, and terrain considerations.  It has a decent representation of relative strengths for various units, and also models special abilities well.

What it does not do, that in part made the original PC game so enjoyable, is model campaigns and their effect on units, as they improved through combat experience.  This, IMO, is a substantial "miss" in the system.  For a large portion of those who purchased the XBox Live version of this game, this may well have been something they didn't miss, as the average owner of an XBox probably never even saw the PC game.  But for the rest of us, this is something sorely missed, and I think "retrofitting" the current system to accomodate the experience factor will be problematic and thus unlikely.  

Again, though, this is quite a good game in its own right, and if you're interested in WWII, not familiar with the original Panzer General, and want something with more "teeth" than Memoir '44 (without much being added in terms of complexity), I do recommend this game.  It is fun and fast-playing, and lightyears ahead of M'44 in giving the player an idea about the relative strengths and weaknesses of U.S. and German units, and effects of terrain.

After another play of Panzer General I stand by my rating and also my comment. I do like Panzer General, but I do prefer the setting and the streamlined and more accessible ruleset of Summoner Wars over what Panzer General has to offer. Seems like I don't need terrain effects in my skirmish games.

[2010-12-09 Rating: n.a. -> 7]

This rating is based on one play of the game and might change once I get the chance to play again.

Comments:
----------

* Had I known this one before Summoner Wars, I guess I'd liked it better than I did. Although they are both tactical skirmish games, this one seems a lot more fiddly. Especially the combat could have been a bit more streamlined. 

* I liked the multipurpose cards. Since they can be played as an action respectively unit or as support in battle, there is a nice hand management aspect.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Some just remarkably poorly balanced cards.  Good idea in general, but "Deploy a giant tank for free as far forward as you want"?  Could only get through 4 games before I felt I was just playing War.  Flipped a good card!  Yay!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players are WWII commanders trying to achieve scenario objectives.  Straightforward card game, played on a nice "board" made up of attractive terrain tiles.  Players commit unit cards from their hand onto the board, and move them hidden into contact with the enemy.  They are revealed when adjacent, or when they choose to support an attack.  Combat is quite a lengthy procedure, with a few elements of bluff tossed in, but works quite well and tends to favour the offensive player.  I liked this - quite easy to play, allows for some subtlety and worked well.  Capping the length to six turns seemed just right.  A keeper for now.

RATING: 5
Mechanics amount to a lot of fiddling and twiddling but don't generate many meaningful decisions ... a strong attacker bias means you throw in what you have when you have it, because your guys probably won't be there the next turn if you give the other guy a chance to attack. It is a faithful reproduction of the computer game, which means you get to spend a lot of time hand-cranking a paper computer. Memoir-44 paints similar situations in much broader strokes and I prefer it to this game, which seems to revel in granularity for its own sake. Wouldn't refuse a second game but it is certain to fall into that, "Why play this when there are so many other games ..." gap.

I like the game, but I think that it's a bit long and complicated for what I think it is trying to be. The long setup and long battles seem to be longer than they could be. I realize that the long setup is simply part of the trade off, as you have lots of re playability, as you can make many different maps, and you only use a quarter of the cards in a given game.

Rating the XBox version which I understand plays nearly identical to the print version.   On the plus side, it is a good looking game (based on BGG photos of the print version), and game play is simple, so it can serve as a good entry level wargame. Surprisingly, luck is not a huge factor in this game, especially in the combat system.

However, for me, play is too simplistic to keep my attention.  It generally seems pretty clear which cards are best to play and/or sacrifice at any given time.  Maneuvre is not compelling, and the battles are unexciting.  The prestige mechanic just does not feel right.  Maybe abstractly it represents higher command reinforcing success.  

A few people have compared this game to Up Front, and that is what motivated me to try it.  However, it really plays nothing like Up Front.  I did not knock the rating for that because I don't think the game is trying to be like Up Front.  But if you are expecting an Up Front-like experience, this is not it.

RATING: 5
After 3 plays (2 solo).

I wanted to like this game so much..
  I've bought it for 2 reasons:

1) [b]to play solo[/b] - and in this mode the game works so-so.  It quickly becomes repetitive (within individual game) - constant combats are a bit too long and tiring (although you can speed them up after you get used to the mechanics).
  There's too little planning and strategy for my taste.  Above all you feel the game is *tedious*.
  There's absolutely no 'wow' effect and an impression of uninspired design is quite distinct..
In addition the game is very abstract.

2.) [b]to play 2-player games[/b] (mainly with my 10-year old son).  All objections from the solo mode apply for 2-player game and on top of that - here, we have this overwhelming feeling: 'here I advance 2 units and destroy your 3 units, then you advance with 4 units and destroy my 3, then I push with my 3 units and destroy your 2 etc etc.'.  Frontline is consistent, individual strikes move it 1-2 fields in one way, only for it to come back to original form a turn later.  Tug-of-war.  Boring and uninspiring.  No room for dynamic play, brilliant manouevres, cunning plans, heroic actions, raids and rapid turns of events.  Pity.

I can imagine it's a good game on XBOX (never played), but boardgame implementation doesn't deliver.. sadly...  This games seems very fitting for the electronic platform, BTW...

This is definitely a working design (with very nice touches like wide variety of units and equipment and their different attributes), but either the boardgame was made to order (with unknown designers and unsatisfactory result) or this specific electronic game is not fit for the boardgame version..

Warning: The manual is FULL of gaps and understatements (esp. regarding solo mode).  Grrrrr...

Sold.

After a couple of games i'm enjoying this. The combat is a little slow but after one game you should no longer require the 'cheat sheet' and things can flow a lot better.

The game play would probably score it a '4' but the fact it has (for me) a more interesting theme (it's nice to have a historical rather than fantasy themed game with a CCG feel) gives it an extra point!

TRADED! Was too slow and clunky. Better 2 player games available. Shame as some good ideas in here.

I liked it on XBox, so I was interested in the board game.  I like the use of the tiles to lay out maps, although a full map takes a lot of space.  I wish there was more varied terrian.  Maybe if there had ever been an expansion we'd have seen that (I haven't played Russian Assault).  I actually bought a second set to be able to make maps with more rivers and beach tiles.  So obviously I like the game.  It's fun, not spectacular, fairly limited.  The amount of errata and rulings for what is a fairly simple system tells you how screwy the rules are in places, but it's easily fixed with house rules (or reading the errata).  I would rate it a 5 based on its own merits, but I really do enjoy it despite its flaws.  Not super-deep though.

At first look and plays, it was very promising; however, it just seems too fiddly . . . mainly due to the combat system.  I am going to give it more tries as the components are good to very good and it is somewhat of a "novel" approach to WWII combat.

Rule book, though nicely designed, has many mistakes, including the "Carentan" map, which is the wrong one printed in the rulebook! Who the heck proofed this--if anybody? Doesn't mean it's a bad game or hard to understand, as many positive comments on BGG attest. However, it's ironic that this was based on a computer game, because the rulebook is so atrocious, it reminds me of the types of wargames published in the late '70s and '80s that opened the way for computer games to supplant them--that is, needlessly and hopelessly fiddly, with badly written rulebooks that were just too much work to decipher. Maybe there's a good game in here somewhere, but why play this when there's a computer game on the same idea, plus a whole new generation of clearly-explained, easy-to-play wargames? (For that matter, why play this clunker when there's any war game on the same subject?) Purchased new, October 2010. Played twice. For sale.

I first played Panzer General years ago on the PC. When I saw the demo on XBLA I recognized the name instantly and tried the demo. The graphics were a bit disappointing (compared with CoD and GoW) but the game play was addictive. I bought the full version and play it regularly. It is very well done. 

When I heard there was to be a 'hard copy' edition, I wondered how all of the calculations would be handled. Now that I have played I can attest to the fact that the game is as fluid as the XBLA version.Play is nearly identical. 

The game appears to have some of the best elements from Up Front, Magic, Memoir '44 and even a bit of GMT's Manoeuvre. It is tense, challenging and a good deal of fun. I hope it is popular enough that they can expand the series. 

It is a bit more difficult to learn than Mem'44 but the payout is significantly better; this is a great game.I believe that even Magic players would enjoy the game.

Just tabled this game a few weeks back and tried the solo play a time or two. Great production quality and packaging, but the gameplay(solo version at least) is a laborious procedure, with combat taking too many steps to resolve. I get what they were going for here, to make it play like the video game, and in a lot of ways it does, but the mechanics just keep this game from living up to it's full potential. Too bad because the production quality of the components is very good. The cards look great and the tile system of map is a great and novel way to customize the game board(even if it is a bit laborious to set up tiles before each game)

Vom Ansatz her okay: Einheiten in Kartenform, die sich auf einem modularen Bord bekämpfen. Sollte rasche, harte Action sein. Ist es aber nicht. Die Sequenz für Kämpfe umfasst etwas mehr Teilschritte als die fünf Bücher Mose Kapitel. Jeder Tiger-Panzer rostet, ehe er das zweite Mal gefeuert hat.

Interesting entry in the "cards as units" genre that's become so popular recently (Summoner Wars and Mythic Battles are two that spring to mind). It's well produced and the rules are clear and simpler than they appear at first glance - the rulebook is a bit of a slog. There's a huge amount of variety available in units and board layouts, plus solitaire scenarios included.

The big problem is that the game was developed out of a PC design, and it shows. There is an unusual level of bookkeeping and state-management; combat could and should have been drastically streamlined. Not a bad game at all -- it's just a little too much like work... and simultaneously too abstracted to really enjoy that work in the name of simulation.

Actually, no, that's not fair. I think it's a better game than I'm making it sound. My problem with it is that it needs frequent play to work smoothly -- it's got a lot of unit/action variety and text to take in, plus processes with many steps; to be able to appreciate the strategy you have to fight past all that. It's like wading through mud. With regular play, with fluency, it would start to shine.

Rating would be 7 or higher if I were able to give the game more attention, but as it is I will avoid playing.

I played this game at Gencon and I found it to be a lot of fun. I would recommend it for anyone who i looking to play a miniature game without having to lug around hundreds of dollars in miniatures.

(My rating is for the Xbox 360 version of the game, since I haven't played the physical version yet.)  Single player is fun.  Unlocking cards is a great incentive to play through the missions, or to replay them fast enough to get a gold rating.  However, many early missions can be won before the enemy even gets to move by grabbing his unguarded HQ, and some late missions require very specific cards and AI exploiting.  Every unit has a role to play (at least in certain terrain), although most units are identical for both sides (The Pershing and the Tiger are really just Generic Heavy Tank with different flavor text).  I can't play on Xbox Live at the moment, but even when the game had just come out there were few players online.

Panzer General: Allied Assault es una mezcla de juego de cartas y de tablero donde tienen lugar rápidas partidas de combates entre unidades alemanas y americanas durante la 2ª Guerra Mundial. Primera partida algo decepcionante.

Bought this for the Xbox and really like the game.  Missed seeing this at Gen-Con, so will be very interested in seeing the board game version when it is released in January.

Properly a good game but not really my taste. I must confess that I have expected more "wargame" from it but it seems more  too be a  mix/mess between a card game and a counter game. The design is very appealing and I like the idea that you assemble the game board in a 6x5 tile grid, this could open up for a great way to design your own scenarios. Unfortunately I find all the game components too clumsy to fit together and I find the set up time for a game to be too high for a game lasting less than an hour. But at least it is great that some try to make new wargame mechanisms as in this case.

Panzer General strikes me as kind of dull and quite frankly, unnecessary. There are already hundreds of WWII games out there for the hardcore wargamers and fans of lighter wargames have the outstanding Memoir '44 and Tide of Iron to scratch their D-Day fix. All of which provide far more interesting gameplay than what I found in Allied Assault. Every turn is essentially the same. Draw a fistful of cards, move all your units one space forward on the grid, then attack. Play all your cards (and everyone has so many, that it doesn't even feel like you have to strategically use them), add up a ridiculous amount of support modifiers, and then check to see if you won. Wash, rinse, and repeat.

Panzer General's not awful...but It certainly is not going to make me retire Axis and Allies any time soon.

A very good port-over of the classic SSI game to a board game format.  The battle system is relatively simple and the game plays out fairly quick.  Combined arms often carry the day as they do in the electronic version of the game as well.  Plenty of unit choices and scenarios give the game good replay value and the solo option ups the game a notch as well.

Outstanding game, I'm just not a fan of 2 player games in general.  I wish I would have waiting for the eastern front version instead - Russian front just hold more appeal.

Doesn't feel like WWII at all -- you're really playing "an engine," and a pretty fiddly one at that.
Not for me.
I'd much rather play Frontline D-Day.

OK game, but there are several I would rather play instead.  Not many maneuvering decisions other than to move forward and/or attack.  Most of the decisions are related to how many cards to draw, what split of action and unit cards, and whether to play the card as an event or sacrifice it for a combat modifier.  Combat has way too many steps for the amount of strategic decisions you can actually make.  Much of the game is spent calculating fire and defense modifiers.  The artwork on the cards is the best part of the game.

A port of the Downtown system to a different conflict.  I'm not so sure about how some of the pieces fit, but many things work quite well.  There are some gaps in the rules (for instance, it is not clear how to plan raids when the EAF is on the attack, but it's not impossible to figure this out if you're familiar with Downtown).

Good enough simulation but the mechanics are not streamlined. I can see why the designer wants to show the gory to the players. However the number dice rollings are too many. Some of them could be abstracted out.

Middle East Downtown.  EV is definately interesting, but whenever I get the urge for this type of game, I tend to go for Downtown instead.  I guess Rolling Thunder just grabs me more.

Rating based on this being the same game as Downtown, basically just new scenarios.

Charts and die rolls in spades but addictive and detailed.

I feel that GMT determines their complexity ratings based on these elements because while EV is a "7", Ran is a "6." EV, however, frustrates me much less. The real difficulty of getting in to this game is the amount of record keeping and aid referencing. After the tutorial scenario (which I really appreciate!), the rules feel fairly intuitive. At this point, I feel my main trouble will be knowing which chart to reference next.

The plentiful paperwork and double map layout make for a large footprint. Also, expect to be printing out additional note taking sheets.

If only GMT would reprint Downtown because I'm aching to play it too!

See my review for more details.

Rating as for Downtown.  Having read the rules there are no significant differences to warrant a changed rating.  If anything, EV will be better as it's less asymmetric, making the game more interesting for the Egyptians than it is for the DRV. 

UPDATE: Played a few times.  Better (as a PBEM) game than DT as more even workload for players makes it more interesting for both sides.  A few rule book glitches might catch a player unfamiliar with DT, but designer support is first-rate.

very interesting system. I like maneuvering aircrafts on map and trying to outguess your opponent. 

Maintenance of game with all switching on and off of all SAM systems and radars can be little bit tedious but thematic feel and fun is definitely there.

I also own Burning Blue which I suspect I will like more because system seems even more refined there.

After some more soul searching I bought this as an companion to Downtown. Downtown fills one need with its more detailed EW modeling, while Elusive Victory has a more two-sided battle going on, with force on force operations, interesting hardware, and more of that stylish artwork.

What I'm really looking for would be a step forward in time to the 1985-2020 timeframe and central europe, packaging Gorillas against the Soviet blocks finest, and vice versa - In essence the grail game would still be Zulu Alert in a downtown package - even though this AWACS idea Lee is tossing around has me hooked!

I want to like this game more, but the game sequence, the flow of the game, is too awkward. Lots of dice rolling to generate statistical results, without having the sensation that 'things' happen, and lots of pre-raid work.

Also there are many loose knots in the scenario rules and you have to fill the holes with house rules.

The components are good and the historical information is superb, but it makes more as a reference tool than to play a fun evening.

Worthy sister game to Downtown, in fact many of the scenarios are more interesting, because the EAF has both defensive and offensive options.

Uses the excellent Downtown system to portray the air war over the Sinai in '67, '70, and '73.  Plenty of scenarios and unlike Downtown, both sides get to launch missions during the same game which creates a more interactive dynamic.

A great look at the air war.  2-8 hours to play, most scenarios 5-7 hours.  The system is a fair amount of work to play, but allows for detailed tactics to be used.  Battle outcomes can be quite dramatic, easy to get pulled in to the life and death struggles.

From the old Avalon Hill game:

"IT'S DEPERATE! THE SITUATION'S DESPERATE" the commanding officer of a Bar Lev fortress shouted to his superiors at Southern Command HQ.  "WE HAVE LARGE BREACHES ON THE CENTRAL SECTOR, AND ON THE SOUTHERN--WE ARE BEING ATTACKED BY SCORES OF TANKS."  He cut into the radio net again, but this time his voice was more emotional, "IF I DON'T GET AIR, THE SOUTH AND CENTER WILL FALL. . .AT LEAST 200 TANKS ARE POURING THROUGH, I MUST HAVE AIR . . ."

Solid offering from GMT and a deserving sister game to Downtown. The rules are understandable and complete. Few questions have arisen that could not be quickly found in the rule book. Quality graphics and components as we have come to expect from this Company. Vassal and Cyberboard online gaming support available on release with a wonderful set of Tutorials on how to play available in the Vassal vmod. A hearty well done to the design team. :-)

As a Playtester I'm probably not unbiased but I think this Game is great. And not only because it has lots of beautiful aircraft counters. :)

Like Downtown this game is not about 'flying' a single or a pair of airplanes, rather it is about planning and executing a whole raid. One counter represents a flight of aircraft (usually 2 or 4) and the scope is definitely more operational.  

Not an introductory wargame, Rules are not complicated but a whole lot, some bookkeeping, lots of counters on map. You have to put some time and effort into it.
But well worth it.
Besides there are no other Games on this scale that I know of.

I found this more fun to play than Downtown because the Egyptians can be more aggressive with their air force in the War of Attrition and in 1973 than the North Vietnamese.

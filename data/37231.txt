Strategic eurogame that is situated in 12th century Italy, very nicely related with the subject. There is no random factor. I like it and I don't understand why it is ranked so poorly

We found this a bit fiddly to begin with but after two plays (3 and 4 player) we got it sussed and the game has some very nice interlocking mechanisms. A solid 8 in my book. It's let down slightly by some sloppy production issues, including the fifth orange player being supplied partly with yellow pieces. The player aid available on the geek is essential for assisting smooth play. Overall, highly recommended.

An interesting combination of mechanics.

The bidding for the cards is reminiscent of Amun-Re, where each column can only have one bid and players can bump others by bidding a higher amount.  Bids are transferable if the player spends a pilgrim and if the bid outbids the new space.

The cards are used to place/upgrade buildings and walls.  Players get one "free" building and wall placement each turn.  Additional ones are available by spending craftsmen.  Craftsmen can also be spent to finagle the level of the building/wall in order to add onto an existing structure.

Instead of placing a bid or collecting all placed bids, players can take income.  Income is generally based on which buildings one has built recently (since the last income).  Income is vital since it provides the resources needed to bid, perform additional building actions and stockpile soldiers (military) for invasions.

What I like least about this game is that individual players often have little control over the timing.  The timing between invasions is measured by the collection of building plans.  Collect enough of them and an invasion hits.  This is critical since not only are invasions the source of negative points, but they can also be the source of positive bonus points.  An individual player's timing is critical to success, yet they have almost no control over it.  That just bothers me.

The theme is dry but the gameplay makes up for it.  Plays very quickly, even with 5.  (We played a 5-player version, with 2-3 learning, in about 1 hr 10 min.)  It's fun and interesting, but a little chaotic with the timing.  There's a nice balancing mechanism with the invasions whereby the leader is hit harder than others.

All in all, a fun game that I would like to play again, but I'm not wowed by it.  My opinion may change with further plays.

RATING: 5
A building game with four types of building and four types of resource cube.  Building cards are acquired in Evo-esque auctions.  Every so often the Comuni are invaded and those who fail to defend themselves lose vp's.  The interesting decisions in the game revolve around the invasions and balancing your builds and resource harvesting to ensure that your city is adequately defended.  Everything else strikes me as unengaging and mediocre.

Plus points for the very good looking artwork are balanced by minus points for choosing brown and black for two of the resource colours and for giving orange Milano yellow playing pieces.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game with a neat bidding-ish mechanic. The invasions are a sort of catch-up mechanic but they end up setting up a "prisoner's dillema" situation which can be extremely punishing. A player reaching for the hero medals and failing sets them far behind (taking damage, as well as not getting the medal) and everyone else far ahead (reducing their damage by this amount) which seemed too swingy in the game I played but multiple plays could likely remedy this.

So-so gamer's game.  Too esoteric to join the ranks of the better cube-pushers.  Poor production values and atrocious rulebook proofreading continue to plague this design team.  Rating based only on practice play, so despite my wishing it were better, I am anxious to try it with actual people.  Player aids (not included in English) are gonna be a must, I'm afraid.

EDIT:  It bombed with my game group big-time.  The battle portion and the steep learning curve overall were surely part of the problem, as well as the weird tie-breaker rules and the abstractness as a whole.  It's too bad; I was actually really grooving with it for about the last third of the game.

It's quite dry and all but new mechanic-wise. Nevertheless, the theme emerges thanks to the good artwork (and thanks to actually living in one of the Comuni...) and every player must make some decisions during the play.

The game plays very easy after a rather long explanation. In the beginning everybody played in the same way, but after a while each player went his own way.

Deep resource management game with simultaneous auctions and coop elements. After one play I have to say this game is difficult to grasp. Some of the abstract elements take a while to become clear. But halfway through the game most players seemed to grasp the game enough for play to speed up. Game is all about timing. Time your scoring, time the invasion so they hurt others the most and time your resource gains so you can use them most effectively. Not a game for casual gamers. Game could really benefit from a good player aid. It strikes me as really odd that nothing like that is included.

Allthough there appears to be a nice catch up mechanic there seemed to be a runaway leader problem in our first game. Could be due to inexperience so we'll have to see if this happens again in future plays.

RATING: 5.5
card draft, auctions, set coll. The game consists of collecting and building sets of cards to create income engines (for 4 different types of goods cubes) and to create better defenses (taller city walls to boost the strength of your soldier cubes).  It has interesting mechanics that theoretically provide balance (e.g., your VP total impacts your defense costs), but ultimately the game was not very enjoyable or satisfying.  It's more card auctions than card drafting, but gold cubes needed for raising bids are so scarce/precious that it's more like staking a claim than a typical round-and-round auction.  There's a good deal of randomness in what cards are available in the auction lots even with the stacked (ABCD sequenced) deck.  I really dislike blind-bidding with soldier cubes for the invasions; the results tend to be too swing-y and unpredictable (e.g., you may spend everything and end up one soldier short of protecting your city entirely, costing you as much as 4 or 6 VP, and meanwhile you've helped your opponents if you made a sizable contribution to the public defense).  Also, the cards are acquired/depleted too quickly (each time triggering invasion), not allowing much time to prepare defenses between the invasions (especially in the 4p game), but perhaps this occurred due to the way we played (aggressively acquiring cards and not slowing the  pace of the game by taking income and preparing for invasion).  It's pretty simple and straightforward once you figure out the rules, but it really needs a player aid (none are included in the box) so print several before your first game.

RATING: 6.75
Interesting game where not building stuff is often better than building stuff, (even though more buildings is more VPs) as the more buildings you have, the more powerful the armies that attack you every time a quarter of the bulding cards run out.

You really have to play this more than once to understand this.

RATING: 3
Didn't like this at all - uneven starting positions mean you're forced down particular routes (to get the stuff you're missing) but then you are further forced by what cards are available where in the draft.

Graphic design issues - 2 colours looked identical to me, so you can only diferentiate based on symbol, but then you can use wild cards ... meaning I have no idea what type of tower has been built. Not good.

Built in catch-up mechanic didn't seem to work. Overall feel is a game where you should be able to make strategic plans, but can't because of the draft mechanic, so instead it is a bunch of tactical decisions, mostly over who is going to overbid who ...

And I didn't care, game looked dull, theme was dull, game play was dull - I just got bored.

RATING: 7
This bidding game has an innovative mechanism in which a run a way leader will be fast crushed down by the game. The wider the Vp spread from the last to the leader is, the more powerful will be the invasions, especially for the leader. So as a tip, invest in city walls! They are essential. After that conecentrate on gaining vp.
In endeffect it´s a bidding and building game. You have to manage four kind of resources. To get income from one resource you need to upgrade or construct a building form of this type of resource to reactivate the income from this resource. A complex to handle game, but a good one.

Rating based on one play (5 players) at BGG.CON '08.  Game felt very chaotic, but that may just be because my brain refused to wrap itself properly around the rules.  I would like to try it again now that I think I get the rules -- and probably with fewer players.

This one was a bust considering the fact that at one point, it was #1 on the fairplay poll at Essen 2008.

It's an uninspired cube pusher. Finicky and abstract.

A bunch of mechanics plopped together.

Built-in catch-up mechanisms are usually a bad sign, and this one is no exception. A heavy punish-the-leader-so-the-loser-can-catch-up design pervades the game.

Many better alternate choices over this dry exercise.

I don't see myself playing this a third time.

Played once with 2 players so rating might change after a few more plays. With 2 players went on quickly but with more players there might be more problems with AP and downtime. Had some nice twists but is basically the same old resource maximation game as so many before it. Felt somewhat similar to Pillars of the Earth although I can not quite say why.

EDIT: Played a second time with four and it didn't help. This is not a game for me.

RATING: 6
Pretty dry and ultimately quite repetitive and boring. The basic game play is actually interesting: I like the auction mechanism by which you either place a bid or take one back (thus giving opponents only one shot at outbidding you, at the expense of not doing anything else on their turn). I also like the timing mechanic of the invasions: as more people take cards, the invasion comes closer, and the players can "game" the timing of the invasion by refusing to win their bids (and thus delaying the invasion slightly).

Unfortunately, it gets really repetitive: by the end of the game, your turns are no different from the way they were at the beginning of the game. This lack of "progression" means that the gameplay just gets tired and uninspiring towards as the game goes on. If it were 30 minutes shorter, or if the later buildings gave more significant point-scoring abilities or special powers, I think this could be a great game. As it is, it's a toss.

Not bad.  The beatdown mechanism (invasion) is interesting because of the balancing mechanism (if you are ahead in points you have to spend more resources to defend yourself than your opponents).  After a few plays though the game feels scripted.  I don't see any opportunities for clever plays and the winner is often the person who happens to be "in the right place at the right time" with regard to the card draws.  It's OK.  I'll play it, but I'm not going to keep my copy.

RATING: 8
First impressions are good - a mixture of worker placement & bidding to acquire buildings which give victory points as well as more resources to fund bidding etc.  Somewhat reminiscent of Kingsburg, in that you need to defend against a number of invasions or lose headway, and with some bonus VPs at the end for control of guildmasters, majorities in resources held etc but that seems to be just jam as the bread and butter points from building appear to have the biggest impact.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really enjoy the feel of this game where it seems like timing is everything.  The tension of the oncoming attacks is really neat.  Players generally try to time your builds to happen just after an onslaught since players with more buildings get attacked more harshly than those with less.  However, it can be a difficult task since you're not completely sure how quickly the next attack is coming since you can only control how fast they come a little bit; it's largely up to the actions of the group as a whole as to how rapidly the attacks come.  It's really a challenge when it's best to bid on buildings, claim buildings, or take income, and balancing the three to get the most out of each action while also handling the attacks in stride seems to be the key.  Overall, a fairly unique game that has something going for it!

I've seen a few complaints about the rules, but I actually thought that while they may be a little longer than they needed to be, they were very clear and easy to understand.  I was able to grok the game by just reading the rules in about a half hour.

The game may basically work, but it left me never wanting to go near it again.  Uneven player starting positions, unnecessary fiddliness (two cards the same colour, the wild cards meaning you had to know what was underneath, the number played on top of the pile not necessarily the number you had to multiply it by), slight passive-negativity in the game play, not very interesting bits and theme, just makes for an uninspiring yawnfest.  This game is outright distilled dull.

Only took me about three years to play my copy. Not sure why, except that probably the buzz died off pretty quickly. It's actually a decent game, although there are a couple corner cases not well explained by the rules, including scoring. It's a little funny that I played this after Cargo Noir came out. It seems like CN practically ripped off this game's bidding system. I like Comuni better though, in that you place one bid in one turn, or take ALL bids (or take income). It's a bit of push your luck, but the luck comes from other players, not random elements.

Surprisingly deep and interesting. The resource cubes are actually not generic. Each serves a different function and provides a different benefit. Which buildings you build will be determined by which sort of resource(s) your strategy depends on.

Also, each of the 5 players gets a different set of starting resources and a different base income (of resource cubes), making each players' options somewhat different.

There's also an interesting and unique semi-cooperative element. During each of the 4 invasions, the players combine forces, each contributing army cubes to a collective defense force. How many cubes to add to the cooperative effort and how many to use just for solo defense is an interesting mechanism.

Altogether, a much deeper, more unique and more interesting game than I was expecting. Nice find.

Comuni has interesting mechanics, but they are horribly unintuitive.  It takes a long time for new players to wrap their heads around how everything works.  So although there are not that many rules, it feels like their twice as many as there should be.  More than 10 times during my last game someone would realize that they have forgotten to update something or another, completely changing what others would have done previously.  While this rule set could have worked ok as a computer game, it does not work well as a board game.

In our 1 play, this game dragged and dragged.  This is the kind of game I'm not a fan of...long games with few meaningful decisions.  Joked around a bit about it...but really, the game kind of plays you.  Kind of step on to the merry go round and see what you end up with.

If there is a strategy, it needs to be heavily focused around building walls and collecting enough black cubes.  But in order to do that you need to get the right cards...which is out of your control.

I'd play it again, but certainly wouldn't seek it out.

This is a game that could possibly enjoy more than I have initially rated it.  The placement of your workers and the auction system is interesting.  It's also the sort of game like Kingsburg and In The Year of the Dragon, where the players are having to deal with bad stuff at regular intervals.  Here are the things that I find to be particularly wrong with the game:  The rules for the way you build buildings is fiddly, the way you calculate VP/building value is fiddly, the way you calculate your defense scores when manning walls is fiddly.  There is also a lot of wasted on the side that players get to look at especially considering how many people feel the rules are finicky.  I think there could be a decent game once everyone understands how to play the game properly but I would probably rather play In The Year of the Dragon instead.

Comuni is one of last year's Essen crop, and I am glad to have got it to the table at last.  It is, for the most part, a run-of-the-mill economic engine but has the additional effects of a reining-in mechanism in the form of four invasions.

This gives a feel of Kingsburg with added control.  That is a good thing in many ways; however it is perhaps also an indication that if you own one of the two you probably don't really need the other.  Having said that, they are different enough to excuse owning both - Comuni certainly has more control.

I am likely to play this more; I can see my rating rising but when you've seen as many building games as I have some of them start to seem very alike.  While that won't put me off the game itself, it might put this game out fo my collection.

Comuni manages to build quite an interesting game from a couple of standard cube-pushing mechanisms. The major challenge is timing your moves correctly in order to develop your city and still defend yourself from the frequent invasions. I like that the timing of the game end and all the invasions are very much in players' hands and the path you decide to follow has an immediate and very palpable effect on everyone else.

Sehr unterschätzt untergegangenes Kartensammel- und Ressourcenspiel vom italienischen EGIZIA-Autorenkonglomerat mit schönem Zockerelement und verbesserungswürdigem Regelwerk. Wer vorne liegt, bekommt in den gemeinsam zu bewältigenden Attacken am meisten auf die Mütze und muss auch das Meiste an Militärstärke aufbieten. Und wer hinten liegt, gewinnt das Spiel nicht. Fein.

Perhaps I'm suffering from Advanced Euro Fatigue (AEF), but Comuni struck me as being a perfect example of a game that really need not exist.  Place marker, claim cards, build, get resources...sheesh!  A whole lot of the same old, same old, with no compelling theme or mechanisms.  After 2nd play it's getting better, but while I'd play it again, I'm not craving the experience.

Decent auction placement game, but not nearly as good IMO, as say, Nefertiti.  One of those games that looks deeper than it turns out to be. Also, of the 4 games I played or observed, the Sienna player won all 4, so I wonder about balance...but I haven't played nearly enough to make that statement.  The game REALLY needs a player aid; turns are structured, and would be a lot easier to pick up with one.

Good mid-weight boardgame, around the Goa or Amun-re kind of level.  A turn-the-cubes-into-Vps game that was lifted for me by the joint defense of the city requirements.  Well made, good components but the lack of a player reference card was silly.

Il gioco è ambientato circa 1000 anni fa dove esisteva una forte competizione fra i comuni e i suoi signori ma dove allo stesso tempo in caso di emergenze e invasioni non si perdeva tempo e si faceva fronte comune con tutte le proprie forze, ma sfortunatamente false promesse e tradimenti erano sempre da mettere in cantiere

Interesting mechanisms, but I had difficult to grasp it and fall in love with it. I doubt that I will give it a new chance, but if somebody suggests it I wouldn't turn it down. The resource handling and the blind biddings of soldiers made me feel uncomfortable. It's also difficult to catch up if you make bad decisions in the beginning.

RATING: 6.5
I have only a 2 player game under my belt and all I know now is this game needs at least 3 players. With 2 players there is too few competition for resources, barely no interaction and no problem to fight down the invasors every time. The rules are not that greatly written. Many little details that could be played wrong because of forgetting them. I missed player aids.
The game is a bit on the mechanic side with an exchangeable theme. The soldiers needed to face the invasion could be as well food units to feed your people in winter. So it may be considered dry from some gamers. The game is balanced and solid based on mechanics but nothing breathtakingly new nor a must have.

Played it once so far, and it was a lot of fun. I particularly liked the mechanic of simultaneously revealing how many (if any) armies you are committing to the common defense. That was quite exciting, trying to determine who's gonna screw ya and when, trying to figure out what their motivations for helping or not helping the common cause are, and trying to figure out whether the potential gains of not helping out outweigh the downside. This is a euro with some teeth, even though it may not seem as such at first glance.

Finally played the game. Looks like this and Kingsburg are doing the same, while taking different ways. Building is nice, being attacked is nice and having enough different options is also nice.

I think this is the better game of the two, atleast for strategy players. I don't see this as repetitive as Kingsburg and there's much more to think about in this game.

Blah...This game has some interesting concepts, but lack of playtesting left some huge flaws.  We had one player that through a combination of poor luck, being screwed, etc, had significantly less than the minimum vp at each invasion.  This meant all of us which were scoring points were faced with a huge number of invaders from the end if the second age on.  In the end, building walls and scoring as little as possible won the game, which was extremely dissatisfying.  Not a game I would play again.  The catch up mechanic was obviously not tested with a player intentionally using it as their primary strategy.  0

A dull, themeless Euro with mechanisms borrowed from elsewhere. At least in Evo when you're outbid you can instantly rebid, here you must have a 'pilgrim' or you lose your action.

I like this game a great deal.  The invasion process is great.  I love the way the invading forces have a different strength based on how attractive/(well) a city is doing.  My only complaint is the quality of buidlings being depicted by a number which totally confuses most first time players with level of a building.  If the designer had used say symbols instead of numbers, (for example one, two, three or four flowers, or stars, or whatever), it may have prevented this.

I've only played Comuni one time, so my initial rating could go either way. Not difficult once you understand it, but it takes a while to comprehend what is going on and what you should be trying to do. One thing it has going for it is that it's definitely unlike any other game in my collection. Lost by one point on my first play and could have won had I really understood what was happening. I kind of like games such as Comuni that have a learning curve, but definitely not something I'd introduce to a new gamer. Actually kind of excited to play it again soon.

RATING: 7
An interesting little game that ends precisely when you want it to, given its weight and interest.  There is some novelty here for the resource colletion genre.  However, the game really needs a cheat sheet.  Its a bit like Brass in that you have to remember what part of the card you are measuring for different elements -- sometimes its the number of cards, sometimes its the numbers on cards.  Sometimes its a pyramidal scale of cards.  That you have a player screen without this on it is almost criminal.

Quite innovative.  I really have no complaints (well, maybe the balance of agressions and everyone's willingness to repell them is questionable), but the game just didn't grab me so much that I want to buy it.  It is a solid design, but I prefer to play it at a friend's expense ;P

RATING: 5
Very initial rating 1 play 4 players Essen 08

This was by far our worst explained game at Essen so even though we played and had most things right by the end I think it did detract from our expereince.

It did have a very slight Leonardo feel to me where you are bidding for things in common areas ie worker placement and building with them, I never knew at the time it was the same designer but there you have it, to me though Leonardo is the better game. 

The usual things are seen here, some set collection, some resource collection, then there is a 'pissing war' aspect and finally invasions. A big punish the leader aspect was included which made sure the further you got ahead of others the more you got punished. At the end of a round there is somewhat of a blind bid in which everyone decides how much of their army will fight for themselves and how many for fight for the cities.

It all comes together well enough but I'm not sure the sum is greater than any of the parts, pretty lacklustre as a package. Sorry not the best explaination on this one hence rating and comments are very preliminary on this. Looks like it might be another 'decent' Euro that a bad explaination and some subtleness partly hid from us BUT from what we did see it wasn't that impressive and we won't be seeking it out to replay anytime soon, certainly topping the Fairplay poll was unjust.

First comment by somebody having played this game here on the Geek. Yay!

Similar complexity as Acchitoccas first release Maestro Leonardo. This one seems to be more strategic than the tactically dominated Maestro. Players have different resources and therefore can use different strategies. Although this might not be the case with more plays as the soldier resource feels a bit overpowered which might lead to similar games. The most interesting mechanism is bidding soldiers for the community or for yourself.

Too much importance in war,War is the real Breaking Balance Factor of the game because the difference in points done by building is usually small.

The problem is that I don't see the point about putting soldiers in the common pool other than in the last 2 round ,because it's really most important to try to give enemy negative points...and the first 2 round are valued too low...I'd prefer to have a 6 - 3 premium in all the War rounds....
The Best things of the game is the mechanic of placing,building,producing IMHO War should be rethinked completely....

Comuni doesn't offer anything new -> it's just a mix of well-known game mechanics. For me, the biggest issue is, that one player makes all the decisions he want to do before it's the next player turn -> means more or less downtime problems. I've seen many games, which mix these mechanisms better than Comuni, so that's why I don't get excited here...

A bit of a worker placement game with other interwoven mechanisms that wasn't neither amazing nor terrible.  Another game I started losing interest in as I continued to play and just wanted it over - and I even won the game.  I did like the concept of upgrading buildings, Evo style bidding for building cards, city wall defense vs community army conflict (although I'm not sure if the benefits of being one of the top two contributors to the common army outweigh the benefits of defending your own wall or seeing your opponents suffer since they were counting on you to help).

The rule book is the real minus of this game. That makes that it doesn't come on the table very often.

Auction Hybrid. Bid for cards to build your city and walls to protect from the upcoming raids. Scoring track is really overly difficult when trying to decipher how many points of raid damage you must defend against. Otherwise the game is an OK auction, card management game.

10/24/09 Played a four-player game, to completion this time. A constant sense of doom throughout, as you never feel you have enough armies to defend your holdings. Some of that is OK. Two hours of dread becomes a little tedious.

Interesting game of bidding for and then erecting buildings to improve one's city.  At the end of each round the cities are attacked.  Players work together (or not) to help fend of the invaders: it's a blind-bid mechanic that improves the Comuni defense (defense of all cities).  As a catch-up the richest cities have more to defend and must make up the difference after the Comuni defense has been established by using their city walls.  

As the game progresses the decision-making gets much more interesting as the competition for resources & the strength of invaders become stronger.

Players score points for the levels of their different buildings + hero points for contributing the most to the Comuni defenses - points for each level of undefended attack.  There's also T&E inspired bonus points for having a city with a good balance of different building types.

Vassal describes this as a 'viscous' game, but it may not be played that way here.  Bidding for cards to make buildings that is broken up by 4 invasions from which all players must defend themselves. They may contribute to a common defense system and gain points, or leave others out to dry.

I have a feeling this one doesn't have the zing factor.  Would want to play first.

In 12th century Italy, players collect income, acquire cards or bid on cards. Cards in hand can be used to build up four different suits: military, gold, monks and culture. When cards run out, an invasion occurs. During an invasion, players can choose to use their army units for themselves, or in a group cause, to potentially earn VPs. Game ends after four invasions.

The invasions seem like a big hit and miss for me, and it seemed beyond analysis especially with 5 players. It did seem chaotic to me. I have only played once, and was a bit lukewarm on it. The mechanics are okay, and I suppose I could give this another try in the future.

One of the best offerings from Essen 2008, and very quick with four players.

The construction/production cycle is pretty nifty, and along with the choices available in the first phase of a turn, creates rather interesting decisions: You always have too little time do everything you want. The balancing scheme is brilliant: By scoring too high you're making sure that you will get hit hard when the next invasion comes. And if the other players know what they are doing, the invasion will occur when you are the least prepared for it.

RATING: 6
A non-typical card set collecting game with some nice features. The problem is that each game plays the same as the last. Card come in 4 types - gold, pilgrims, armies and craftsmen - and valued 1 up to 4. They're placed out in lots and a turn may be to "claim" a lot, but you only get to pick it up if it gets back to your turn and you haven't been bumped by another player with a higher bid (ie using gold cubes or brown pilgrim cubes). It turns out this is the crux of the game - what to bid for and for how much to avoid being bumped. Everything else is just playing out and reaping the rewards of these claimed lots. Another turn may be to claim income - ie get cubes for the card colours you've built since last time you built. Builds are a laying down of the cards you've collected, and each level built in a colour gives more VPs and more income. White craftsmen cubes are used here to allow you to build cards on levels they're not usually allowed to (eg a 2 card as a 3rd level). After each 25% of the game is done, you need to spend your black army cubes to protect your VPs (there's some blind bidding here for bonus points which is always an emotional mechanic). You can later use your brown pilgrims to eradicate VP loss chits if you don't have enough black armies. The game play is mostly about watching what colours other people are collecting so you can either aim for cheap lots in other colours or have an informed guess on how much gold is required for a bid on a communally desirable lot to prevent your bid being bumped. Each colour has a different benefit and you'll want to build a strategy on what to collect and how you'll want to spend it. You also want to get into a cycle of increasing your collected colours by 1 card, build them, get income, then repeat, so as to maximise your cube collections, which can then be spent wisely to further increase your cards and cubes. As such, it's very Euro. It's a bit different and that provides some interest. There's little drama or tension though, just card and cube management for 75-90 minutes and the inevitable adding of VPs through the game whilst aiming for VP bonuses at the end. Decent, interesting, but my view is that games will be a bit same-y; probably too much so for much replay.

This is a game in the same vein as St.Petersburg as it is a cardgame disguised as boardgame. Players bid for cards on the board and build various buildings and walls with them. Nice feature of blocking the leading player. Still it feels a little bit too long for my taste. My rating may still go up with additional plays.

Gioco italiano di nascita ma tedeschissimo per meccaniche. A una fase di piazzamento e costruzione abbastanza tradizionale (ma un po' macchinosa) si contrappone quella "semi-cooperativa" delle invasioni che è davvero ben pensata: in un colpo solo si introduce un evento asincrono che spezza il gioco (e strategie troppo ottimistiche), si obbligano i giocatori a tentare di scappare senza staccare troppo il gruppo (o di farlo quando si hanno spalle sufficientemente larghe) e si aggiunge aderenza all'ambientazione. Dopo qualche partita il gioco tende però a ripetersi un po': rimane un titolo sufficiente. L'errore di stampa nell'indicatore dell'invasione non è determinante, ma comunica una sciatterìa che poteva essere evitata.

Welcome to the new BGG where the game ratings are more a popularity contest than anything else. I can't believe this game is over a 7.

The best thing about the game is the game production quality, which I have to admit is top notch. Nice board, not warped. Nice card stock. Nice wood cubes and nice looking art.

As far as game play, I saw nothing here that was worthy of coming back. Not to mention the bash the leader element just for the sake of helping the loser.

Very few games handle semi-cooperative mechanics well. Comuni deserves a high grade for being one of those few games. A convoluted rulebook and fiddly tableu build/upgrade machanic make the entry barrier a bit tougher than it needs to be. Not a very complicated game once you get past that.

This is not a bad game but it is slightly confusing. There are four types of resources which are used quite cleverly for building buildings and defending them against attacks. A big plus for the game is that it feels fairly heavy but plays very quickly. The game looks good but the mechanisms feel slightly unpolished. With some more playtesting and ironing out some complexities this would be a very good game.

Continual bidding, building and income generating in a way that keeps you on your toes, timing your run until the next invasion. As you begin to explore the game you discover how important it is to keep hold of (max 2) certain cards to construct on an income generating turn. Then a strategy starts to develop and the game begins to feel less random. You learn to hold back armies for future rounds, maybe such up a few invasion points in the early rounds, time your big builds for the final rounds (or go ahead early). There's lots of little things to think about here - nothing that'll really screw up your game, but clever little ways you can do the job that little bit better.

The nice thing about this game is that although the choices are not brain burning there are some interesting ones to be made. Sure there are other games where you generate cubes to pay for points, but this one plays fast and is entertaining to boot. Not sure exactly how much replay value there is in it, but for a few outings a year it'll be very welcome.

You'll want to play with no more than four players. With five the extra few cards in the deck don't compensate for the speed at which the deck can be depleted. There's a much better feeling of control in this game with less than five players.

Tenki games játékai eddig nem voltak a kedvenceim, kezdve a Krumble,Shark Park remekektől a tavalyi Chang-Cheng káoszig. Idén már meg sem néztem Essenben a játékukat, mert egyszerűen leírtam őket. Nem volt jó döntés, ez a játék végre egy igazi remek darab, nagyon belenyúlt a kiadó. A szerzők (azért írok többe számot, mert a fantázianév egy lelkes olasz fejlesztőcsapatot takar) nem ismeretlenek, már elkövettek olyan játékokat mint pl a Lenordo da Vinci.A szabálykönyv nagyon el van nagyolva és a túlbonyolítva, éppen ezért elég sok fordítási eltérés van a szabályok között és mi csak a németet és az angolt vetettük össze. Igazából egy 10-15 perc alatt el lehet mondani a szabályát. A játék kb 60-90 perc de nagyon sok holtidő nincs, a játékosok köre relatíve hamar lemegy és egyes részeken még a körén kívül is bekapcsolódhat a játékmenetbe.
Röviden a játékról. Az észak olasz kis városállamok kifejlődésének lehetünk részesei, mindenki megpróbálja a sajátját a legpompásabbra megépíteni, mindeközben a politikai, egyházi, gazdasági és politikai hatalmat megszerezni. Mint a történelemben, időnként itt is jönnek hódítók, akik megirigyelve a városállamok gazdagságát, megpróbálják kifosztani azokat. Nagyon fontos a játékban, hogy az ember jól felkészüljön ezekre a csatákra, mert jelentős mínusz pontok szedhetők össze ellenkező esetben. A játékba nagyon sok játékelemet gyúrtak bele, de nagyon szerencsés módon, teli van újításokkal és jól működő részekkel. Egyetlen szépséghibája a táblán található katasztrofális, figyelmetlenségből adódó nyomtatási hibák. Az első két parti 2-3 személyes volt és mindkét esetben jól működött. Nagyon megszerettem.

Originally I didn't think much of the Community Defense mechanism. It seemed like you'd never really want to contribute to the community defense - that just helps your opponents, and the points you get for contributing don't seem like much until maybe the last round. The third game I realized that in some cases it does seem to make sense - like when your opponents appear to be able to defend themselves with no problem. In that case you're not really helping them at all, so you might as well go for some points. So maybe the dynamic amounts to the leaders contributing to the community defense, while the trailers mooch off of that... I don't know how accurate that is or how common that situation is though.

While I gained a little respect for that mechanism, and I enjoyed the game more than I did the first time I played it, I still did not think too highly of it.

It doesn't get much more "Euro" than this. Comuni offers a very engaging and fulfilling experience that forces you juggle numerous issues at once. The simple auction mechanism creates tension and keeps players at the edge of their seat and the absence of long downtimes keeps the game running. The artwork is compelling and adds enough color to brighten up a rather dry "theme". Well done.

Sure it is more Cube management and drafting, but I find the difficulty of manipulating the system intriguing.  This feels like a semi-coop game where everyone is out for themselves and the system is trying to beat everyone up.  

It is very difficult to learn from the rules, I played this with some seriously hard core gamers, people that are used to figuring out blind prototype rules reads, and it took us an hour and a half to get our first game to run smoothly.  Even still we were a little shaky about a couple rules.  If they provided a clear player aid, it would have helped significantly.

Unlike most engine games, I feel that there is a real opportunity to catch up from a bad situation (within reason).  There are a number of ways to score and the invasions attack the leaders more than the weaker positions.  

Despite the fact that this could be considered yet another cube mover, the economics translate to cubes that are essentially four different currencies that allow for significantly differing kinds of actions.  They aren't just abstract commodities.

1 play, 4er

An interesting game, but I just did not get it! Maybe 'cause I'm fighting a cold? You need to get into a cycle of acquiring cards, building buildings, collecting income, then repeating -- and I did not seem to figure out how to do that! Also, I was overbid several times, essentially wasting several turns not acquiring cards. Anyway, although it seems like it should be a decent enough game, none of us seemed to enjoy it very much! It felt as if it was taking much longer than the 108 minutes it actually took!

Still, this is probably worth another try at some point. But it wasn't inspiring enough to actually go looking for such an opportunity....

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player's starting money (and basic income in game) is based on turn order. There are 4 decks of cards, A-D; start at A. Fill the display (lots of 1-3 cards) with cards and mark the count of remaining cards in that deck on the Invasion track (update this whenever needed). 

On your turn, either:
- place a bid on one of the lots by using one of your 3 tokens; may add gold to your bid. If overbidding someone, they may immediately spend a brown cube (pilgrim) to move the bid to another legal location.
- claim ALL your bids: retrieve all cards (some lots also give you a cube of your choice) and refill the display. 
OR
- collect income: earn 1 cube per level of active building, +1 cube for each Guildmaster, +basic income (based on your turn order)

Then, if you ran out cards in the current deck, there will be an invasion (exception: D deck -- for this, everyone gets a final turn, THEN the invasion occurs). The strength depends on the deck (A 4, B 8, C 12, D 16). Players simultaneously blind bid by placing black cubes (2 golds may be used for 1 black) in left/right hands: left for personal defense, right for group defense. All group defense cubes reduce invasion strength by 1. Then, players may man their walls with black cubes; each cube provides 1 defense, and each manned wall provides strength = level of wall. Current player gets a bonus of 1 strength. Players need to reach different strengths to successfully defend = (invasion strength) - (last place player's VP) + (your VP). If you fail, take 1 Plunder marker per shortage (worth -1 VP at end of game). If no one took Plunder, the 2 players who contributed the most and 2nd most earn VP counters (Heroism markers).

Next, you may build: use the cards (numbered 1-4, in 4 different colors) to build. Must use number at least as high as the level of the level you're building. Flip that color's income card to active side. In addition, may build a tower wall (use any color card, face down; numbering rules still apply). Then, may spend white cube (craftsman) to repeat. Also, during any of these builds, may spend white cubes to increase the number on the card being used.

Then, if you have the tallest building of a color (but at least 2 levels), claim the Guildmaster card of that color.

Finally, may spend 1 brown cube to discard 1 Plunder. Pass the Current Player marker leftward.

After the final Invasion, players score bonus VP:
- 3/Guildmaster
- Most of each resource cube: 2
- Heroism counters from each invasion: as shown
- Each plunder: -1
- Lowest level building: level of building

Most VP wins (original turn order is tiebreaker)!

A bit borig I must say. The flow of the game is not very intuitive and not very tense either.
I like the strategy involved though and that's why I rate it a 6. It could improve once you know what to do better but I guess this is one of those "2 times a year" game.

City-builder with bidding and resource management elements set in 12th Century Italy. The principle is to acquire projects for buildings via a bidding process. the buildings can be improved throughout the game and provide resources such as military, religious, economic and cultural, and it is with these resources that players manage their strategies. Four times throughout the game an invasion takes place and the players have to group together to defend against it. This is the most interesting aspect of the game as each player decides on how much of their resource they are prepared to commit to defence without knowing what their opponents intend doing in that regard. This leads to some unpredictable turns of events and ensures that a runaway leader doesn't often emerge. Reminiscent of 'In the Year of the Dragon' this is a game where you have to be continually planning ahead because if you don't bad things are going to happen to you. It very Euro but very good too.

Very nice game. It's the typical Acchittocca style, with cubes and actions and projects, everything puts together perfectly like a clockwork. Not right my personal kind of game (this explains half a point less of what it likely deserves) but anyway an excellent choice for all "german style" gamers. If you like Caylus, don't miss Comuni.

Interesting game. I have some initial balance concerns, but I suspect that with players of equal experience the bidding system will even things out. I also wonder if an asymmetrical building strategy can compete with the perfect-balance approach and need to play more to find out. The different specialites of the four houses would imply a perfectly balanced building strategy isn't essential to win, but so far it seems the balanced-build approach is difficult, if not impossible, to beat. If balanced building is requred to compete, this will probably go down a notch in my ratings.

The game has many little rules, but it is simple. This sentence describes Comuni. It is a good game for Euro gamers. We play always with the variant that when you bid for armies, you have one bid. With what you bid, first you mount all your walls and what is left goes in the League defense. This variant and the why behind it is here in BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Comuni is a game about building towers and then defending against invasions, where you can either defend everyone or yourself, or some combination.

There's a central card area, where players can bid workers for piles of cards. Some piles have one card and a resource cube, some have two card and some have three cards. Cards come in four different flavors and with values of 1 through 4. You want cards to build your towers (and your wall). Higher cards are just better than lower cards (we got this rule wrong for most of the game and thought you needed low cards which apparently you don't) as you need to play a card equal to or higher than the level of tower that you're building.

On your turn, you can either put a bid in for cards, or take all the cards you've bid on, or collect income.

When a player places a bid, he puts at least a meeple above a pile of cards. He can augment his bid with gold if he chooses. Other players can outbid him, by placing their meeple on the same pile with at least one more gold than the last bidder has bid. If a bidder is bumped from his pile, he can either take his meeple back (but not the gold he bid) or move his bid to another pile. If he wants to move his bid, he must spend a brown cube. He can only move to a pile with no bid or where his original bid would be overbidding the current bid. He cannot increase his original bid.

When a player takes a pile of cards, he takes back his meeple that was bid and the invasion track is lowered by the number of cards taken. If the invasion track hits zero the game pauses while an invasion happens. If not, the card pile is refilled and the game continues.

You can always build after your main action. Building is done by paying a card of the correct color (there are four: white, gold, brown and black) and a number equal to the level you are building. So to build a third level in yellow, you'd need to play a yellow three or four. If you want, you can play a lower number and augment it with a white cube for the difference between the card's level and the level you are building. When you build your towers you get points for the level of tower you are building. As part of your build action you can also build a wall level. Walls can be built with any color card, but follow the same level/number rules (you flip the card over as the backs show the walls). You can spend extra white cubes for additional build actions.

The third type of action you can do is collect income. You have a placards for each color and can only collect income by flipping the tile to the used side. You take a cube for every level of tower you have in that color. (Note: towers top out at level 4 but if you build more than one tower you sum their levels... so a level 4 yellow tower and a level 1 yellow tower would give you 5 income in yellow.) Additionally, you get a base income of two cubes which is different for every player (and is shown on their player screen). Finally, whoever has the move levels of tower in each color gets an extra cube of that color when they collect income for it. You can collect as many color incomes as you have available, but once used you cannot, until you build another level in the color, at which point you unflip that color placard.

When an invasion happens, the game stops and everyone defends against the invasion. You put a marker next to everyone's score on the score track. then you look at the lowest score and see how far it is from the current invasion marker (invasions get progressively worse). So if the lowest score if five below the invasion level, everyone's invasion marker moves up five spaces. If the lower players is above the current invasion, then everyone's marker moves back that many spaces.

Everyone has to defend against however many invasion points their marker is next to. You do that by spending black cubes. Players choose how many black cubes to put into their right hand, which defends everyone, and how many to put in their left hand, which only defends themself. All the cubes in people's right hands are totaled up and all the invasion markers are moved down that many spaces. The player who contributed the most to group defense gets a bonus (which gets better as the game goes along).

Then the cubes you kept for yourself are applied to your remaining invasion points. If you have no walls then each black cube deducts one invasion point. If you have walls then they are one point each plus the level of the wall segment you put them on. Two cubes on a two story was are 5 points (the cubes are a point each, plus the 1 level and the 2 level). So all four levels manned with cubes are 14 points. If you don't defend enough you get negative point markers for every invasion point undefended. These can only be gotten rid of once a turn by discarded a brown cube to lose 1 point or 3 brown cubes to lose two points. It's either/or one time. So at most you can lose two negative points a turn.

Defending against invasions is a really interesting part of the game. If you think a lot of people are going to defend you can save your cubes and use them later in the game. But if you guess wrong you could take a lot of negative points. If you decide to commit your cubes, you might end up spending cubes that you didn't even need to. If you try to win the bonus for contributing the most to defense, you might give someone else a free ride, or you might make the cubes they spent to defend themselves useless... and you may or may not be the one who contributed the most. there's a lot of think/double-think here.

At the end of the game, which is the fourth invasion, the invasion doesn't happen immediately. Everyone gets one last turn and then defends the last invasion. After that, there's a bonus where you get points equal to your lowest level building (a level 1 = 1 point, level 2 = 3, level 3 = 6, level 4 = 10). Then you deduct any negative points and highest score wins.

The game is interesting. I got outbid in the early game a couple of times and was really behind on building. But that meant that I had a low score and jacked up everyone's invasion tokens. When I didn't contribute anything towards the invasion, everyone ended up taking a lot of negative points. That leads to interesting situations where no one really wants to be too far ahead of the last place player or they'll have to pay more cubes to defend against invasion.

A pretty uninspiring Euro. There were some sort of interesting decisions at some point - I really liked the one action per turn between bidding, claiming bids, or collecting income - but most of the game was waiting and deciphering/remembering unintuitive rules like wall building, triangular scoring, and what color cube meets what. It's not anything I need to return to, but it wasn't an entirely unpleasant experience.

Did not expect too much from this older game that was heavily discounted at Essen 2013, but I was pleasantly surprised. It feels like a push your luck game, where all the luck comes from other players' actions. As such, it can be played pretty cutthroat. The first action of each of your turns brings a lot of suspense, as you have to estimate when the invading armies will arrive, so you will need to have your defences ready. Played once with the full compliment of players, and would like to play again with the same group of people. We all made some mistakes during our first game, as the rules are a little fiddly and unintuitive.

Unique title that seems to have flown under the radar in '08. Tension runs high from beginning to end because of the seemingly constant threat of invasion, and the economic system is clever and engaging. The four different currencies are all powerful and you feel pressure as you struggle to upgrade your buildings so you can "untap" them for production, all the while trying to time your momentum to get the best deals on the cheap and worrying about not getting ahead in VP at the wrong time. 

That all being said, I have my reservations about the invasion mechanic. It seems to create a prisoner's dilemma situation where everyone is incentivized to defect, especially if the trend is established in the first couple invasions. I'll have to play more to reassess. On the surface the narrative arc of the game seems monotonous but I think the subtlety here lies in timing of your momentum w/r/t the invasions. I think there's a good game here worth exploring but I'm not yet sure...

This is OK.  It comes with some of the frustrations that are a part of worker placement games (cuz it is one), and despite the way that I like my games to squeeze me, it just leads to frustration more often than not.  I wouldn't turn down a game of it (especially now that I now how the game flows), but there are other games I would play over this one.  Oh, and I can see this being ridiculously chaotic with 4 or 5 players.

I'm yet to run it, but in some ways Comuni feels like a precursor to Troyes, in that you spend a bit of time establishing yourself, slowly building an engine of sorts, then get smacked by invaders XD
Comuni's systems may seem odd at first contact, but they're very straight-forward. Hopefully it'll eventually play quickly and be a nice half-step to the complexity and length of Troyes.

A tough game, a bit along the lines of In the Year of the Dragon.  We played it pretty defensively, so not too many people got hurt by the invasions.  I wonder how it changes if someone plays more aggressively and drives the game to invasions more quickly.

In second game, one player didn't build many walls and then carried the rest of us contributing cubes.  

Want to play again to see what results are typical.

After 1.5 plays. Everything worked well but the building of walls early is essential. You must be able to defend your city.

Played only once with 5 players (3 were new to the game).  The game description is correct that this is for experienced players. If you make a mistake early, you'll get behind on the income generation without a chance of catching up. 2 of us got a late start on acquiring cubes and we were clearly out of the running early. For me, it became a death spiral to protect myself from the invasions instead of trying to do something productive. The game is not for me but the 2 experienced players really enjoyed the game. Would be helpful to have a player aid.

kind of a set collecting, resource spending game with "invasions" that can set you back, it's hard to teach, but once everyone "gets it" then it plays well...

After One Play: I like it a lot - probably because I won. A little bit of everything: gathering resources, bulding, auctioning, fighting. Very nice mechanics that work very good with each other

Some rules seems forced to fix balance issues.

Well designed, good mechanics of play. No luck, no dice. Quite hard to recover from disadvantaged positions, actions in the first steps are very important.

Semi cooperative city building game.  Challenging game play with no chance involved.  Fairly easy to learn and best played with 4 players.

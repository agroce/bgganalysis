Fun game to play with your kids.  Mine love it and request it regularly and I've tried it with adults too - who also liked it.  

It will teach children a bit about card games which they'll meet later, too.

I REALLY don't like the American name of this though - yeuch!!! - it sounds much better as Kleine Fische.  Indeed that is the version we have.

04+ or 06+m 2-4 players, best with 4, 20 mins. Holiday box. Rating from children's perspective. They LOVE this game! Easy to adapt for younger children who can count the ducks even if they don't recognise the numbers. We play a few rounds and for the older child there is some fun maths in adding up everyone's scores. Have played lots of games of this with V. Light fun. Worry about the way it promotes risk-taking in him though.

My four year olds first ‘push you luck’ game. It does the job well and I think the fish edition fits more with the mechanics than the duck edition. My daughter likes it but the octopus card is hard for her to accept at the moment (people stealing her cards). With time she is slowly getting a handle on this though. It’s small and portable, a good game for out and about.

RATING: 5
An enjoyable press your luck game when played with kids.  Features some colorful cards and easy to understand rules.  A lot of fun found between each card draw and die roll.  Really simple, but its a whole lot easier for my younger cousins to understand vs. Incan Gold and plays quick enough as to not annoy me too much (annoying in that I'd rather play Incan Gold).  So for children under 8, definitely pick this one up, but for older kids and for adults, see Incan Gold.

This game reminds of Knizia's Circus Flocati, only its fun.  For a quick and very light card game, this one provides all the press your luck elements you want in a nice package.  The game is very approachable and is a good gateway / introductory game.  I much prefer the artwork and 'theme' of Kleine Fische over the recent reprinting as Duck Duck Bruce.  Either version though is a nice filler to have on hand when your tired but still want a fun game to play.

(KIDS) I call this Circus Flohcati for little kids.  My 3 and 5 year olds really like this game and, of the kids games we have, it requires more thought than most and is one where kids and adults can both try their best and have a very competitive game.  Highly recommended... my favorite game to play with the kids.

Fun little push-your-luck filler.  Good for families.  Not just for little kids -- my eight-year-old enjoys it, and I imagine kids up to 11-12 would also enjoy it.  Also:  it scales well from 2-6, which is rare in a card game (though with 6 players there is a bit of downtime  as you wait for your turn -- turns are shorter though and even as a spectator you can enjoy the suspense of another player's turn).  Very versatile.

Rated for kids.  Another compact game we take along to restaurants, the doctor's office, etc... that my daughter requests frequently.  Excellent press your luck game for kids with colorful artwork that my kids really like.  This game has really helped my daughter with her counting into the 'teens and twenties because the ducks are shown graphically on the card to be counted individually if you'd like (not just numbers listed on the card).  Great game for young kids -- I think as early as 3 yrs. old or so - but holds the interest of older kids too.

Gamewright.  Rating from kids' perspective.

This is the first press-your-luck game I have played with the kids.  You have a stack of cards with ducks doing various things.  There are about four "Bruce" cards (the dog).  Players press their luck by continuing to reveal cards in an every-increasing line.  They can stop at any time and collect cards.  If there is a match any cards in between are discarded and remaining are given to the player.  Only the highest value of the suit counts.

There's more about Bruce and few other rules, but that's the low down.  

I like it because it teaches some strategy on pressing luck depending on probabilities and card values.  When Bruce comes up it teaches who to pick, and strategically fight for how many cards.

Out of print, which is a bummer because it's a fun one.

Kids - draw 'til you lose or stop sooner.  If you get Bruce, roll a die to see if you can steal.  The player with the highest total (counting only the highest card per suit) wins.  This is a good game for younger kids (age 5+) up to 11 or 12.  A good intro to push-your-luck duck games.

It's a simple concept that works great.  Flip cards: "duck, duck, duck" and hope not to match another suit of ducks you've already flipped.  Get a "Bruce", pick a player, guess a 1, 2, or 3, toss the dice and hope to get the roll you wanted and maybe get cards from your opponents.  This is truly just push your luck, but it's a whole lot of fun.  Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a great time.

Rated based on playing with children.  This would work as a good introduction to push your luck games.  Based on my experience, kids definitely need to be coached and reminded of the risks, since when we played they almost always "busted".  What's nice about this game is that as long as you bust in the Circus Flohcati way (not with the octopus card) you still get something to take with you.

Massively luck dependent and very light, but quick to set up and the play is lightning fast as you're just flipping cards off the deck, comparing colours, summing scores and assessing contentedness with your turn versus risk of going for more points. We don't really play competitively, so it's more about having 5 minutes of silly fun with the cute ducks before moving on to other things. A great travel item and push-your-luck trainer for little ones.

Light push-your-luck filler with cute fish cartoons. The luggage fish is strange but probably represents some German pun. The nonstandard six-sided die adds a nice twist to the game: try to steal someone else's fish and risk losing one of your own if you get the wrong roll.

This is a really light, fun game that uses 'push your luck' as the central mechanic.

The scoring is what adds that little extra spice as only your best valued card in each type (or suit) will count, so some memory of what has been collected already is useful.

Kids love the theme of the cards and the ability to steal, which is not always guaranteed, makes kids giggle.

This is one quick to play totally 100% filler game in push your luck style! I like it for just that! You draw cards...saying Duck each time. You may keep your ducks at any time...but if your ducks match you loose the match plus any in between and if Bruce shows up you loose them all! The specialty die allows a player to steal a number of cards from an opponent! Beautiful cards and die! Simple fun!

A flipping tiles, push your luck game. I liked how you only lose the tiles that repeat and those between rather than lose everything, making it a touch more friendly. It's very playable, but every turn is the same. You are trying to gather as many of one type as possible, so there's at least something to aim for, but the superior Circus Flohcati offers more choice and decision.

RATING: 5
Circus Flohcati clone except this is more forgiving when flipping a duplicate colour: both discarded as well as those sandwiched, but you get to pick up all the previous flipped cards, hence the deck is depleted quicker (several rounds are played). Strangely this leniency is counterd by harsh card stealing, with 6 octupus cards (in the German version) allowing the player to instead choose how many random cards to take off a target player, success relying on a die roll, you fail if rolling a number less than stated or having the stealing backfire if -1 rolled. Scoring is similar to CF as only count the highest value, but get to that you have to sort out all the card. As a clone it overstays its welcome because it lacks the tension of missing a turn of picking a card, lacks the variable actions of stealing and flipping and strangely, and resolving the scores in CF is cleaner as colours and numbers in DDB are overpowered by blue and the values are on the card edge. You can't help but admire the fleas over the dog in this case.

Played this a number of times, the kids, especially my 4 y.o. always kick my behind at it too, therefore a must have. Rating from my kids' perspective, and I enjoy seeing them win on thier own merit, not because Daddy gave them a hand.

It's a mindless version of Zirkus Flohcati.  Basically the same game without melding or the gala show bonus or even knowing what is in your hand (which is a big minus when trying to decide whether to press your luck or not).

RATING: 6
(Note that the game we own is called "Kleine Fische", but according to BGG this is the same game.)

A surprisingly enjoyable light push-your-luck game, with added randomness (and screwage) introduce by the "squid" cards (I gather the squid is the eponymous Bruce) which result in rolling a die to steal cards from another player (but possibly end up with them stealing from you!). It's all very silly, and really not the kind of thing I usually care for, but this is both very quick and really quite good fun. Really the appeal ought to have faded fairly quickly, but it hasn't. This has been a semi-regular filler for my game group since at least September 2014, and we often play 2 or 3 times in a row as well.

Good with kids. Good counting practise at the end of each scoring round. If you're a fan of Circus Flohcati then this might appeal to you - fish instead of fleas and the stealing cards replaced by a push your luck dice element. Not much here for the adults though.

Kleine Fische German edition. 
The level of illustrations is pretty terrible. Theme works.  

One of the lightest push your luck games in the Blackjack mould. On your turn you turn over card by card as far as you want to. If you get two of the same type of fish, you lose most/all of them. When you draw an octopus however you can steal fish from other players. Score is: biggest fish in every type. 

Kids on gaming workshops loved it more than we imagined it just because it's so so simple, and simpler is always better (I'm not liking this trend, but so it is). Some groups reportedly got very excited about the octopus cards and based their strategy on them. 

For me it's not as exciting as Incan Gold for instance, there's zero psychology, it's all odds. But it's really really easy to just pick and play.

Duck Duck Bruce:  A simple but fun "press your luck" game.  For adults, I'd take Can't Stop or even Pass the Pigs over it.  But as a kids' game, I'd rate it an 8.  Definitely not one of those Gamerwright stinkers (Slamwich, Chomp, and Hats Off, for instance).

Excellent first game for little kids  and a nice introduction to both the push your luck mechanism and to scoring only the highest card of a suit.  

Especially good for restaurants, waiting rooms, airplanes.  Requires no set-up and very little playing space.  It's reasonably fun for the adult playing, but not something you'd play unless a kid was involved.

Simple press-your-luck game with a bit of a memory element. Similar to Circus Flohcati, but without the set collection. Simple, quick, and reasonably fun, with cute artwork. Virtually no set up. Great to play with kids, especially when you're limited on time and/or space.

Push-your-luck game for kids: draw cards from the deck or claim what's shown; if you ever draw two of the same suit you have to throw a lot back. If you draw the dog, it's possible to steal cards from another player.

Not my favourite genre in the first place, but the die-rolling nails shut the coffin.

Nice art, though, and I like the way it gets players saying "duck... duck... Bruce!".

Another game where the BGG title is different from the edition I played.  Much more similar to Zirkus Flohcati than to Can't Stop.  In fact, if Zirkus Flohcati didn't do this just a little bit better, I think Kleine Fische would have many more fans.  Cute artwork, good game.  I'll play it again.

When I first introduced my son to this game I beat him three times (nights) in a row and was worried he wouldn't want to play ever again, but I was wrong .. 

Luck was on his side on the fourth night and he crushed me to the point I only got three (low scoring) cards in one of the rounds, because he kept getting Bruce and calling/rolling 3 ..

Great game to play with the kids, or even for a quick light filler ..

Duck, Duck, Bruce may be the most charming press-your-luck filler yet. Players collect ducks from 10 unexpected locations (the gym? space???) while a shaggy dog threatens pandemonium.  A couple of gamer-y twists give the adults in the group something to dig into.

Duck Duck Bruce is for kids and their parents/teachers/caretakers. It's a fun game that you'll enjoy laughing at and playing, and kids will learn about risk taking. The game is full of simple, fun choices - from deciding how many cards to steal to how many cards to draw. You can play it until you're sick of it - which may happen, but I think you'll have fun before that point. Comical artwork and a funny theme help elevate this kids game to one that will be requested often. And adults won't roll their eyes when it is. See my review for more details...

german kleine fische. Highly recommended as first game for 4,5 yr children.

Super simple push your luck game with twist that you can risk 1-3 steals on a dice throw if octopus turns up. Favour this original scratchy art over duck, duck, as the newer version's art looks like typical saccharine stuff used for shite card and board game rip offs sold in supermarkets - ie dull and lifeless. Only slight prob with original design is that the tiniest fish are possibly too small as you need to wince to check whether it's a swordfish or a puffa etc.

Ideal first push-your-luck game which is super kiddy friendly. Deffo in my 4,5,6 yrs top 10.

This is a great game for my six year old.  It seems he wins a lot more than he loses, and you don't have to throw the game to make it fun for him.  Although if he is tired the game can turn ugly.  I like the game because I enjoy the time with the kids.

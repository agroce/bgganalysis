A strong 18xx feel in a game without a board. Really nice. Although I play horribly, loosing every time in those few games I had.

I particularly like paying dividend from treasury and how that affects share value.

RATING: 7
interesting, but I am not sure if the massive learning time required is worth it. the training game is very long with newcomers, and you'll need a few games before full game is feasible time-wise. and at that point I am not certain if the game will really provide interesting enough scale of strategies, or will have everyone basically doing the same thing...

my suggestion is try it only if you have a stable group willing to devote a few evenings to this without changing who plays.

Rolling Stock strips away the fun stuff in 18xx, such as track placement.  Instead you get to bid on companies that randomly flip over much like Power Grid.  If you get some good synergies, you can form a strong corporation.  My starting corporation failed hard early.  I'm not very good at this type of market manipulation, so I was unable to get much out of this game.

RATING: 9.9
Initial impressions:

Very interesting system.  Very open, and yet dangerously limiting.  

Tons of room to stab yourself in the face repeatedly with the shifter as a result of attempting to drive a bus on a dangerous clifftop - but there is also tons of room to grab the shifter, grab the wheel, and then jam the shifter into gear and navigate successfully.

But it must be an unwieldy bus on a dangerous cliffside that you navigate, and there is no choice in gear other than overdrive.  The slightest mistake can result in severe skidding - and the only way to survive at that point is to steer into the skid.

It's a PnP economic game that is like 18xx without the board play (just stock manipulation).

I don't think the game will be for me (e.g., I hated Ponzi Scheme), but I do love the following comments from BGG User CmdrOverbite:

"OK so this is what you would see in the dictionary next to "niche game" if you had a dictionary that had an entry for "niche game." Which you don't. It's a bit like someone took an 18xx game and stripped out all of the board play and visual flair and replaced it with the slow boring of hard boards. If the idea of setting up a second shell corporation to buy up the non-toxic assets of your first corporation and leave the first corporation in a death spiral while you cackle at the suckers who trusted you with their hard-earned money sounds like a fun-ass way to spend a Saturday night, you've found the right game. And should probably seek professional guidance.

Do I love this game? I do, so far. The thing about our man clearclaw is that when he's right he's right: this game is a sandbox. It gives you a simple set of rules and some objects to manipulate and basically tells you to grip it and rip it, not unlike in junior high gym class when they rolled out six soccer balls on one field, divided the class in two, and spent as little time as possible refereeing. Except: while it's true that you have a variety of possible strategies to pursue and considerable freedom to execute them, Rolling Stock is also a game of terrifying precision. Tiny mistakes in valuing assets, especially early in the game, basically screw you to such an extent that you've effectively eliminated yourself and you don't even know it. There's no notion of a catchup mechanism in this game. If you want to take down the leader, you'd best figure out how to do it yourself.

Not that I know how to do that, but in my defense, I've only played one game.

So, in short: a great game, if you're me. If you're not me, maybe maybe not but probably not. But: It's practically free if you have access to a color printer and some miscellaneous bibs and bobs. It's portable. And it's an amazing intellectual challenge, thematic in its way, and brutally interactive if you want it to be."

Brilliant, brilliant game. Every decision is tough. Every dollar is important.

There are so many strategies to try out and each one can fall turn into a spiral of death with one mistake.

I love this game so much I made a website where you can play live or async...

The training game is nice to learn with. The short game ends at the wrong spot and is quite violent with how it will pummel all the players except the one with a blue company.  Skip that and just play the full game.  The game is very unforgiving and rewards collusion.  If two players make a grand deal and the others do not the two will jump ahead of the curve.  I wonder if the game would be better without the foreign invester? Or maybe with one that is not as wealthy?

Here is sand. Here are some ways you can make things with sand. See what you can build! Oh, some of the sand is broken glass, you're bleeding uncontrollably and there's a Grue that eats people. No, I am not pouring ketchup on your head.

In broad, this is a wildly open-ended sandbox game that happens to feature well known train companies, shares, a stock market, rules for stock price and market changes, dividends, public companies and holding companies etc. The game is full of sharp and punishingly fatal edges and is astoundingly easy to lose and damned hard to win. It is a game by a financier for financiers.  There is no equivalent, no matter how faint, to train company operations: it is all financial manipulation.  However the similarity to the 18xx beyond being something of a financial simulation pretty much ends there.  

Rating: 8.0 based on an early prototype. May fall to 7.5.  

Update: Raised from 8.0 to 8.5.  9.0 is possible but seems unlikely.

Update: Dropping back to 8.0.

Impressions/thoughts on Rolling Stock after about 5 plays:

The game is not forgiving.  This gives it a steep learning curve for beginners.  Essentially, your cash supply is very tight through most of the game, and the ability to get new cash is mostly via buying new companies, which ramp in cost very quickly.  Also, your existing companies rot quickly.  Finally, there is a "Foreign Investor" that prevents you from trying to get into a profitable metastable state and stave off the rotting progression.

I think this steep learning curve turns many people off.  In two games, I've seen two players essentially eliminated by running out of cash to move forward.  Neither time was it me, but mostly through dumb luck.  I'm not sure if this needs to be fixed, but I could see it as a detriment to encouraging new players.

The game has some depth.  There are definitely multiple algorithms that can work.  The game makes me want to write a computer program to simulate various strategies.  This to me means awesomeness.  I love toying with these ideas.

There is randomness, due to the fact that the companies that come out and their order is random.  I like some random.  The amount here seems like the right amount.

The game makes you think.  If you cannot plan 1-2 turns ahead, you run a strong risk of running out of cash in key phases.  When we played our most recent game, we paused for 2 days in the middle.  In between the active player we probably discussed strategies with each other for several hours -- and they were a fun several hours.

There are cool concepts in the game -- the most notable is probably the dividend / stock price calculation.  It seems like much closer to how a "well behaved" stock market should work (I'm not saying it reflects reality!).  The abstraction of track laying into "synergies" is a cool idea, too.

I suppose this turned into a mini-review, so I'll just finish it off.  I'd give this game a 9/10.  However -- if computation / deep thought / almost abstract games are not your thing, you will not like it.

RATING: 8
I have built a prototype copy and have now played several times.  There is a lot to think about, and the game has resemblances to 18XX games but the strategies you need to employ appear to be quite different.  We finished a 3-player Training Game in under 2 hours with all of us playing for the first time.

It is a difficult game to play well.  It is easy to get into a liquidity trap from which there is no exit, and this can eventually eliminate you from effective participation in the game.  For this reason it can be discouraging for beginners.  On the other hand, the challenge can be a draw for others.

I continue to be very interested in seeing more of this game.

A very nice investment game. Not at all involved as some people make out, and much more dry than most 18xx games.

Getting the turn sequence down is the hardest part in my view. The stock adjustments are almost always on a basic formula.

Not fun for those who don't enjoy math.

RATING: 4
In summary, it could be considered as 18XX stock market on steroids. The idea is interesting and you actually control all the sides of the economy, but I think the game is almost broken. In fact, it's a game very hard to grasp where a single mistake can cost you the game.

The math behind is relatively complex, especially when evaluating the value of your company. The reference sheet are not that useful. They should have put bold keywords on each phase so that we know in a glance what each phase do. 

I think the main issue with the game is the low income, there is not enough money that comes into the game, so little money reaches your player, and there is nothing you can buy. We did auction the 2 first turns, and then we could not auction companies anymore, because we did not have enough money. Companies has so little income that they have an hard time surviving and never paid dividend, so your player never gets money. I think income should at least be doubled.

Another idea would be to start auction at the minimal price, so that a player without competition could get a company below the face value and actually make profit this way. This would have promoted auctions is the last half of the game.

Yes you can emit shares to get money from the bank but not only that drops the value of your share but you also need higher corporation value to pay for those extra shares. Good thing if you can buy new companies into your corporation, but when the player has no money all the time, it's very hard to buy new companies. You have to wait for the foreign buyer and all other players are waiting for that.

And then as the time pass, you get a penalty maintenance cost on the old companies, so first you could barely survive, now you pay money to survive. 

So there is a serious game balance issue with little way to catch up. One error and you are out. There are various things you can manage, but I think you must manage them all in order to be able to play. You cannot for example not form any corporation at all and only buy shares, I am not sure it would work, but I would be willing to try it. But it would have been cool to have a game where each player can play the same game in a different way and still have chances to win the game.

The company synergy is interesting but excessively confusing. Why did they just not put categories and make companies of the same categories have synergies. That's it, no need to have unique synergies.

On the other hand, it gave me some ideas for a solitaire Stock Market game, because since you control the whole economic wheel, it is almost possible to play this game as solitaire.

So unless you are a huge fan of 18XX or stock market games. Stay away from this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very hard economic game that is difficult to play well but certainly rewards those who do. While playing I often found myself wishing to play an 18xx title instead, as I enjoy the stock and dividend aspects of those more along with the addition of the track laying.

RATING: 3
I hated this game.  The game actually has some interesting elements with the foreign inventor, that move the game along.  The stock market is interesting with only a single price for each company and that can allow you to jump or fall spots in the market.  

The game is NOT an investment game.  It is tight, very tight cash flow game.  You need to really micromanage your cash flow trying to pull out a dollar here and there.  I hated the stock tables in the game.  

The game ought to be re-named, Certified Public Accountant: The Game.  I am not likely to play this again.

Played two training games so far (3-players). Seemed very interesting and quite opaque (which I like). I have a hunch about two possible strategies so far and I'm sure there are tons more out there to find.

Now played two short games too. Still very interesting. Beware! Totally unforgiving, there is no catch up mechanism, but since there is no significant randomness it's all your fault if you fall behind.

Finally I finished with my print&play job...

Update: After three short games my impressions are positive. Next time we play, we probably play full game. 

This print&play job was definitely worth it. This is a very good game which just manages to hit my personal gaming sweetspot. There are some issues there and another pne there but these are minor compared to ruthless and juicy experience this overally offers. Does not beat the best 18xx but beats some lesser ones. My rating of '8' is strong (closer to 9 than 7). If full game goes well my rating might get upgraded.

Update #2: Rating upped to '9' after the first full game. Not the most convincing '9' but still.

A brutally unforgiving, heavy economic game that plays in under 3 hours (for 4-player training games and 4-player full games). The full game is superior to the short game, though I would happily play either. There are no guardrails, and it's easy to drive yourself into a pit of illiquidity from which it is impossible to recover.

Quasi-mutualistic (truly: parasitic) cooperative strategies seem to be more powerful than isolationist strategies, which makes the difficult task of evaluating the value of companies key. Rolling Stock seems to be won by single dollars too many or too few here and there over the course of the game.

There also seems to be quite a lot of room for tricky maneuvering, the extent of which I'm looking forward to discovering.

I think I like playing with the always-include-max-companies variant.

RATING: 10
A perfect, beautiful game. It has very simple rules, 2 pages plus 2 pages of glossary, but at the same time it is incredibly hard to play and open to creative, personal play. The rules are so clear and so perfectly conceived, like tools that let the players build their own strategy. High interaction: the games are very tense.

It is a pure economical game, similar to the games of the 18xx family, but there are no railroads (they are simulated by synergies between companies): so there are no rails to build, there is only the stocking manipulation, the part that I prefer of the 18xx games. But there a lot of other  differences with the 18xx games, the main ones being: 1. the price goes down “before” selling a share, the price goes up “before” buying a share; 2. the company values goes up and down depending on the assets that belong to the company (in all 18xx games, as far as I know, the share price is usually related to the company paying or not dividends). These two apparently small changes have an enormous impact on the way the game is played.  Although I have played a lot of 18xx games,  Rolling Stock appears to me as more natural, avoiding tactical nasty moves, but at the same time leaving the possibility to strategic conflict between players.

The game is so hard that the first game can be quite terrible. It is a very unforgiving game. The other side of the coin is that it gives enormous pleasure to play it well, one can surprise the other players with clever moves. 

It is almost a cards game, because company and even share prices  are simulated by cards. It is a P&P game that can be downloaded and easily assembled by yourself. The quality of the distributed material is very high. Besides the rules and the components, there are two handbooks: a user guide and an extremely useful “strategy” guide that is a pleasure to read. All for free! 

This is one of the best games I have ever played, one can feel the love and the care the author put into designing it, and it is free! (although its is possible to buy a copy at All-Aboard Games).

It has three scenarios with different playing time: the full advanced game lasts around 4 hours that pass very quickly, the others last less. The strategy handbook sums up the times that the game requires for each scenario depending on the number of players. I played the game in 3 and 4 players and it seems to scale very well.

If you like heavy games open to creative strategy, easy to learn and difficult to master, this is THE game for you. A masterpiece!

RATING: 7
18xx without the board. The key difference is that withholding money increases share value, and paying dividends decreases share value, so it's very hard to increase you net worth.

There is much less money to be made. One mistake can send you into a death spiral.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Learning game twice, so I can't comment on the full/short game. It's most definitely a brain burner and there is a constant death spiral with your stock dropping in price, keeping money personally and issuing shares to the bank so that you can pay your share holders. Argh! Super crazy game but there is a lot to explore. I can't wait to play a full game with 3-4 players. 2 players was interesting but a lot to keep track of.

This is a numbers game though, so if you NEED a theme, this is incredibly dry. I'm definitely itching to play it more though.

My wife and the rest of our local gaming game club  seem to have fallen in love with this obscure print-and-play game. I find it as dull as ditchwater - it's basically a card-game version of the 18xx series (and my wife isn't even a fan of these, although the rest of them certainly are). Like my wife, I dislike 18xx games, but unlike her I find this to be even more dry and lacking in interest (if that is even possible).

This is clearly aimed at 18xx veterans who want to try something different. Altough I like the occasional game of 1830, I'm not part of the target demographic. My one training game with three players took nearly three hours, which is just too long for me. The game does not provide enough interesting decisions to justify that. Too much time is taken up with bookkeeping and arithmetics.

In addition, the game is much less dynamic than traditional train games. In my game, all players ended with only two or three stocks and buying and selling them hardly happened at all. Liquidity is so limited that you usually don't have the funds to buy anything at all; it's usually only the corporations that have to make decisions.

However, I do admire the design and can see why it's interesting for the kind of player who likes games of financial manipulation (which this game is as much as 18xx). I'll give it a 6, but I have no real desire to play this again.

I love the game so far, but I've only made it through one training game.  I'll hold off on the rating for now.

After my first "complete" short game (we ended when the result became apparent) I'll rate the game an 8.0.  It's an awfully unforgiving game.  I don't have a problem with that, but it could certainly be off-putting for some.  I'm excited thinking of the challenges that will be ahead when our whole group of players are completely comfortable with their strategic options.

I'm going to preface this by saying I have never played an 18xx game before. I want to, but haven't had the opportunity to. 

My board game journey has come a long way and I see this as a milestone for me as a gamer. I've gone from Ameritrash, to Euros, to heavy economic/finance games. 

Building up private companies only to float them and then control them to do your bidding is utterly fascinating. At the same time, you tiptoe around and try to build up capital, while stopping people from trying to take your public corporations over! 

The final round involved me and another opponent intently staring at the middle of the board trying to calculate how many shares of my corporation we could each buy, all while realising that as we bought shares we were gaining value. My company went from a company that wasn't worth shit all to being the one worth the most in a single round. All of this in the training game version. I am seriously impressed with this game.

I must admit that I lost by $20. I don't know how exactly, but I want to do better. It's the same feeling of wanting to do better as in Age of Steam. 

The really crazy thing is, we only played the short version. I desperately want to get this to the table again.

This is where my 18xx journey begins.

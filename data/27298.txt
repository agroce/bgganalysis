More fun than you would think it would be.  Excellent length.  In a four-player games, we probably only got about 5 turns each--perfect.  First game was 45 minutes, with explanation.  I continue to be impressed by the Japan games.

Update: Now that I've played [b]Hab & Gut[/b], I doubt I'd play this again.  Traded away.

Stock market stripped down to its barest minimal. A quick and fast game that may be a bit too fast reaching the end before the companies could even move much. 

Strategy is very dependent on the die rolls eventually.

Light family game that leaves a lot to be desired for main stream gamers.

{1 play • 4 players}  I want to like it more.  It's short.  It's stock-markety.  It has dice.  But my one play felt weird.

For one: there was very little volitility.  Two of the other three players had played a few times before and assured me stocks could go way up or down.  They didn't in game.  But wouldn't they mostly not?  The bulk of potential die results seemed rather mild and balanced to me.

For two: the game felt a bit too short.  But I think that's because it wasn't very volitile.  One of the veteran players said he's wanted to try going around the board twice (rather than once, as written), but I don't see that helping, either, as by the time you're once around, it's seems like a lot of the shares would be kinda committed.  So there'd be very little buying and selling.  I think.

But worst of all: I'm not really keen on playing it again to solidify my thoughts.  The game just didn't grab me.  But... it's certainly short enough, so I suspect I'll have another go at some point.

Bizarre roll and move/stock market game. This game is ok, there just doesn't seem to be much game there. It is very easy to figure out the "system" to this game. Concentrate on 1 or 2 color stocks only and move up the fund payoff line as high as possible. That's it. I was expecting a little more. But, I did get it for a very good price on Tanga, so it's a wash.

Though the speed of this game makes it on that fuzzy border between 'filler' and 'real game', I really like the dice aspect, the press-your-luck aspect, the strategy, and the ease of explanation.

Overall, just a fantastic game, and it's a shame more aren't playing it.  It's crazy-easy to teach, it's elegant, you can play it as hard or easy as you want...  man.

RATING: 7
Deceptive game.  At first, seems like a simple version of Acquire with some odd luck thrown in.  However, I'm still interested as further play has caused us to notice the differences in the colored dice and strategies around the black die are still to be discovered.  Maybe this will fade but right now, it seems that there is more to meet the eye than initially seems.

I'm typically a fan of stock/share trading games, and this one was a surprisingly good entry in that field!  I especially like this one as it offers plenty of opportunity for opportunistic money making (as well as screwing others out of their money).  It's not a game where you buy shares and sit on them; you're constantly buying and selling based on the current game situation in order to squeeze dollars out.  Great stuff!

This was an okay longish filler. I felt it was bit chaotic. The luck factor is a bit too high. And I'm okay with luck factor. The problem is that you don't really get enough turns as president of any one company to be able to benefit from a normal distribution. A few bad rolls and you are sunk.

Yuk! This game seemed unfinished. There was too much luck and no control. Some stocks offer nothing and the die rolls seemed to make your stocks worth even less. The board is a throw back to the 70's. Maybe I missed something but it seemed a pointless random excercise.

Light and short game about buying/selling stockmarket shares and competing for the presidencies of 4 companies. Original system. 
We think the game is too short so we play around the board twice and that works alright with 3, 4 and 5 players. (Not tried with 2 players).
Good mix between luck and skill. 
This is the game you wanna play when you don't have 8 hours to play 1830 but still want to drop the presidency of an almost bankrupt company on an innocent shareholder...

Fabulous, quick economic game of trading stocks.  There is quite a bit of luck in the game with all the dice rolling.  But, at its heart, its fun exercise of trading in/out of different companies in hopes of changing your economic position.

Plays very well with my kids.  Highly recommended family game.

Update September 2009 - Raised rating up to 7.25.  This is an excellent family game.  Monopoly in 45 minutes.  Whenever we play this one we seem to play two games of it in a row.

Buy and sell stocks in four slightly different companies. The game is so quick and simple that it seems like it should be part of a larger game. (But it was fun.)

I'd read on the forums that the 5 player game suffered from each player getting very few chances to act before this (very quick) game ended. We decided within a couple turns that we'd play two "laps" around the board instead of just one... seemed to work pretty well.

Note: paper money. We didn't even unwrap it, but broke out the poker chips instead.

RATING: 7
I like the game, but it's a tough sell due to its light weight, high randomness, and being slightly deeper than its length allows.

Duration: Fast, and due to its structure, doesn't get too long with more players.
Design: The game contains the elements of collusion, betrayal, takeovers, and metagaming, but feels too short and random for them to emerge. However it's what I like: stockholding with sales, minus the other junk (trains or countries).
Strategy: You can freeze out other companies, force a poor president to keep putting in cash.
Components: The dice look cheap, and putting the stickers on them is really frickin' annoying. However the art is very pretty and the stock certificates beautiful.
Theme: This one is an economic abstract, and I wish they had themed the companies (Yellow = startup, Blue = media, Red = ?).

RATING: 6
The game is too short - you just begin to get into it when it finishes!  OK - so I've just discovered it's more about buying AND selling; you have to spot when to get out of holding shares.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Talk about a short game!  45 minutes?  Actually took us 20-25 minutes with 5-players.  Perhaps we were doing something wrong?  When it's your turn you buy/sell stocks (optional), advance the purple pawn around the board (1-3 spaces) and do what is on that space.There is not much game here, as is it feels like the game has not been completed.  There are much better games out there such as [GAMEID=433], even [GAMEID=2680] is better, IMHO.  I'm rather disappointed in this one, although some players were already coming up with house rules to make the game better.

The dice: aren't we past the point where we have to apply stickers onto dice?  And there are six in this one...  I can see these labels waring/peeling off fairly quickly.

The four modular "L" which make up the board's contour is interesting, as it allows the board's layout to change from game to game, but players often moved the board (accidentally) and it seems we kept replacing these sections.  Perhaps a "puzzle" type approach would have been better?

On the positive side, the stock tokens are a good size, and the thickness is excellent!

[u]Edit[/u]: Upped rating from 3 to 6 after my gaming partner suggested each move be 1 or 2 squares instead of up to 3.  It made the game way more interesting and less chaotic.

As stock games go, this isn't my favorite. The game was really too short for the stocks to develop in an interesting way and largely depending on what happened in one or two turns.

This is game is much better than I thought it would be after reading the rules. Our game group sat down and played it 3 times in a row in our first sitting.

The rules need to do a better job of educating you on the dice.  When you examine the dice and see the different possibilities, it greatly influences the choices you should make as stockholders in the different companies.  The game is nice and light, and moves quickly enough.  I can see how there is a lot more depth to be explored, though the luck of the dice play a huge role.  I'm not sure if I'll have the group willing to play this game much more.

Probably not at its best with only three players.  The more players the better in this quick dice fest of a stock market game.  Dice determine whether share price goes up or down although if you don't have enough to pay the fund when the pawn lands on a stock of which you are president, your stock price will go down.  Each of the four stock dice are different and red allows you to help other stocks improve, blue allows you to crash other stocks more often, while the other two are more independent and do not effect other stocks.  Only the president can roll the die for the different companies.  

Sold in the Lydia charity auction.  No plays foreseen for the future.

A surprisingly good little game of buying/selling stock which offers some good decisions and rewards clever timing.  It plays in about 45 minutes which is very appealing to me, although players seem to get caught by surprise at the end, expecting a longer game.  Just enough randomness to give it a true 'stock market' feel.  Not something everyone should go of their way to hunt down, but if you like stock games and want something fulfilling in a short play time, this is certainly worth a look.

I did enjoy playing this game -- the actions and decision making are fun. Also, the game is quick, which I like but I question whether it finishes [i]too[/i] fast. With a limited number of turns there are certainly some big flaws in turn-order advantage (those who go first are likely to get more turns). Too add on to those issues knowing that your opponents won't have another turn also provides huge end game advantages. Without these problems my rating would be much higher.

Nice 30 min stock market game. Each turn a player gets a decision on which of the next 3 squares to land on, which depict the 4 companies and some special squares (div payouts, etc). If you land on a company square, the owner of the most shares (the president) rolls a die which may increase / decrease the stock price or pay dividends. Alternatively, you can roll an event die which should score you some money. Basically, buy anything and hope the dice roll in your favour and your stock increases in value. And if it has, maybe sell it and hope the stock decreases in value. After 1 play, it seems a fun luck-fest, but it's family fare and works well as a simple stock game. Not a lot here to explore for the gamer's gamer I suspect.

RATING: 5
Very fast for this type of game. It has the potential for a good stock market game but the quick playing time prevents the game from real development. As a filler it is better than most but simply does not compare to something like Shark. 

*** We have played the game with an additional round skipping over the "Goal" and "Start" spaces at the end of the first round. The game is significantly more enjoyable as there is time for the stocks to move (radically in some cases). Playing with the double round method results in a game better than Knizia's Buy Low and Sell High. When playing this way I would rank the game an 8.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If the game was longer, it has potential to be an interesting and competitive stock game.  However, the short game length means that things rarely develop enough for any real planning or meaningful decisions.  I'd like to try a longer variant, maybe something that goes at least twice around the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First plays very static with very little movement in the stock prices.  I suspect there is some tactics around forcing other players to roll when moving the pawn, but haven't found it.  Otherwise, the game lacks some interaction as events on a turn seem to have little impact on others.  Or perhaps this is a game of small increments - move the stock price a bit to gain a slight edge rather than the killer deals.  Or this is just a light dice game with an interesting  theme to be used as an opener or closer.

RATING: 6
Typical stock game of buy low, sell high, but this time luck gets the biggest part of the cake. The modification of the stock values depends on dice rolls, and the player basicly are limited to buy and sell stocks and to move a pawn around the board in order to select which die to roll, or to perform a special action. Just do your thing, cross your fingers, close your eyes, and let the dice do the rest. The game is very fast; it ends before you even know it has started, leaving you with almost no chance to think of a strategy, or even to have something meaningful to do.

I love the midgame, that's what makes the endgame even more depressing.  I'd love for it to end well, but the problem is that you either end up with people having more turns than others (which is really significant here as you might only have three turns compared to another player's four).  

I can't help but feeling that it should be more dynamic. More action from the board, more dice rolling.

RATING: 7.5
This is an entertaining take on stock holding games. Each company has a control die with different possible actions which include market price variation of current or other company, status quo and dividend payment. The majority owner of each company has the control over the company die.

Everything seems well balanced. It's not as luck driven as it seems. Game length is perfect and components are nice. Looking forward to playing again.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Perhaps I'm overrating this, as there is quite a bit of luck in the rolling of dice, but I think there's a lot of psychology in trying to find out who will increase the value of stocks and who will decrease the value of various stocks.  I consider this a good choice as a light and quick economic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very light opener or closer. Be careful in not investing completely in one company - if it goes bankrupt, then you are pretty much doing nothing for the rest of the game.  Trust me on this.. you know it's bad when you are hoping to move the pawn to Goal to get the final $100.

RATING: 5
Doesn't take too long and I enjoy stock games, even ones like this that are pretty mindless.  Controlling the companies is fun, especially driving your prices up or your competitors into the ground.  Still, it's fairly random, so I probably rate it higher than I should, which isn't saying much.

[Z-man 2006 edition] {Stock market; dice-rolling, commodity speculation, economic; optimal 3-4p} It's a very nice family game - good theme, easy game play, mild luck and some decisions. The theme is vivid (everyone likes to be a company president!). The player interaction is good (with some nasty tricks :) ). The game time is fixed due to the fixed number of 'walkable' spaces. The modular board provides some degree of replayability.

The design of the 4 companies is clever, which allows different tactics. 3 or 4p seems to be the sweet spot, suitable game time and control. 5p seems chaotic due to less control. However, I think 4 moves is too much for 3p game - it makes the game too fast.

The components are attractively illustrated. However, I would rather Z-man provides custom dice, rather than stickers. The pawns look too childish, too.

It's a nice stock market game. I am glad that Z-man imported it from Japan.

RATING: 7
Kind of a standard stock market sort of game where you buy shares low and hopefully sell high. The stock market up's and down's are decided by dice rolls, so if you don't like this kind of randomness then it's probably not for you. There is more to it than that and I found it enjoyable and it didn't drag on too long, there was a good fun element to it to because of the dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A quick Clever simple and varied stock market game, with plenty of difficult choices. 

Each company has a die that is biased in favour of generating income from dividends, growth in share price or affecting other companies to rise and fall in value. Add to that a ruthless method of allowing the Prseident of each company to cream off profits at the expense of the shareholders and an event die that can cause companies to go bankrupt plus a number of other options and you have the best light Stock Market game in the world; period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game.  I could easily rate this a 10 if it holds up to more plays.  It goes beyond simpler stock games in that each of the four companies has a different die.  So do you invest in a company simply on its price and value, or because you want to control its special powers?  I like the variable board setup and the game simply races to an exciting conclusion.  Only caveat to the game is how poor the dice are: the stickers are nearly unreadable, and well, they have stickers -- yuck!  Everything else is top-notch.  And don't forget to be a good CEO and raid the company fund!

I can easily recommend Owner's Choice, simply based on the wide audience I think it will have. One need not be a mathematician or stock analyst to understand the basic nuances of the game. Players can win without controlling any one company, but to control them is fun - merely because of the decisions they can make. With practically zero downtime and a short playing span, Owner' Choice is a game that hits a sweet spot for me - stocks - without becoming a grueling, lengthy affair. The modular board keeps it fresh, and the interaction with other players keeps it human.  See my review for more details...

A random auction game, yes, but the unique dice makes each company different, and worth controlling for different reasons.  This creates different strategies, and its intriguing to see each player vie for different companies.  The tension is huge when someone is rolling a die that could drop your companies stock into bankruptcy.  This to me is one of ZMAN's lesser games, only going to show how great their games are.

Much too random and chaotic for my liking.  It's possible to look ahead and predict what the next person may choose to do, since you can only move the pawn 1-3 spaces on the board, but beyond that there really isn't much strategy to Owner's Choice.  The dice as the means to affect the stock price is an interesting choice, but doesn't necessarily makes it fun to play.  While it is really quick, I'd much rather spend the time on a better simulation of the stock market than a filler for one.

This game has few rules, is easy to learn, but just does nothing for me or my family. In fact when we first played it it seemed to finish before we started - and I had to re read the rules to see if I had missed something.

GAME: La Bataille des Quatre Bras
RANK: 2426
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It simulates the desperate struggle that ensued on the Brussels' highway at the crossroads of Quatre Bras. 
You can test it and compare it to the SPI's "Ney vs. Wellington" game, which is mostly the same scale and area to fight this battle! 
Both games show similarities and will bring you down to the tactical scale of the Napoleonic Warfare! 

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

Positive "9"-rating is for the very good possibility as a "learning device" to the La-Bat-system AND for a comparison to puter game systems/ scales. Just invision to show a novice wargamer the differences of 
* Quatre Bras in "La Bat" (100m/hex; 20min/GT)
* Quatre Bras in "Ney vs. Wellington" (91m/hex; 15min/GT) 
* Quatre Bras in "NBS 3" (180-200m/hex; 30min/GT) 
* Quatre Bras in "Vive l'Empereur" (250m/hex; 30min/GT) 
* Quatre Bras in "Shadow of the Eagle" (250m/hex; 20min/GT) 
* Quatre Bras in "Triumph & Glory/ Jours de Gloire" (297m/hex; 75min/GT) 
* Quatre Bras in "NLB/ TLNB" (480m/hex; 60min/GT) 

and eventionally in the "The Emperor Returns" level of 1,600m/hex; 6hrs/GT)!! 

That's a lot of eye opening!!

A colourful array of units. Gives a good feel for the battle. Curse the 95th Rifles!

This is a great introduction to the system as the unit count is relatively low.

Had a close look at Gemincourt farm and the McDonalds restuarant that now dominates the battlefield...

RATING: N/A
Part of my ill-fated flirtation with Napoleonics games, every one of which I disliked.  This series I never got to play.

I was attracted to this system because it seems the only one granular enough to cover facing and formation on the battalion level (the correct level for formations).  But upon closer examination it seems to have a very gradual, step loss type attrition mechanic (with units often having 6, 8 or even more steps, or "increments") with the result that units are very gradually "sanded away" rather than just killed with one attack.  That would be fine if the game had 100 pieces, but these games tend to have hundreds, or thousands. 600 or more counters + heavy rules + very gradual combat results = I'll never play it.

Almost perfect installment of tactical Napoleonic battlefield. Very good unit differentiation and tactics. Beautiful design (map and counters are gorgeous).
Very tense gameplay with big replayability thanks to random reinforcements table. 
I enjoying it very very much.

RATING: 10
I rate it a 10 without hesitation because 1) its graphics are astounding, 2) the rules are really playable (and this is even more true after the release of Regs XXX and ML) and I find this is the best system on tactical/operational Napoleonic warfare, 3) it's a one-mapper and I managed to play it several times, always getting a lot of fun.
For sure it takes several evenings to complete, but it is worth of the effort.

Second edition components are excellent and an improvement even over the already sublime effort of Clash of Arms' first edition. The command rules have a tremendous impact on the game (and the series). No more the swirling of entire battle-lines. Now you have to arrange your forces so as to be in command the next time. This severely limits the French in this meeting-engagement, as they can only activate their light cavalry division (by die roll) untill army and corps commander arrive. Only then can they activate the infantry. The chances of Ney achieving victory seem slim indeed.

One of the most playable La Bataille games. It can actually be finished in a sitting or two. Lovely maps and counters. It's a race to the crossroads and then a chore to hold onto them. Some decisions to be made, as to whether to sacrifice victory points in order to use the Guard cavalry. It's a tough test for both sides that swings back & forth as reinforcements arrive onto the field. 

Update: This is probably the best La Bataille game to get into- it's shorter than most, has a beautifully done map & units, some cavalry (but not too much) and is manageable. We finished a game in 7 hours (not bad for this type of game) over a Sunday morning-afternoon (with lots of Port wine).

RATING: 6
La Bataille Series. Recreated the romance of Tactical level Napoleonic Battles, Infantry with Column, Line, Skirmish, Square, Cavalry using charge or pursuit, Artillery fires. Each unit got their own morale rating. The best use of combined-arms-tactic in battlefield the higer chance to force enemy rout off from the battlefield. With the 4th edition cole rule added the command system and random activation, push it to a higher level of a masterwork wargame. I will give La Bataille Series Games a Rating of 8.

La Bataille de les Quatre Bras is a 32"x22" map game re-created the fight on June 16, 1815. Around the woods of Quatre Bras.

The Advancing Corp II of French meet the frontal defend of Anlgo-Dutch units. This is a classic meeting engagement, with historical arrival time table, we need a allied player because a aggressive french player will reach Quatre Bras fortress on or before British units arrived to the map edge.

This game is a good for learn how to play La Bataille series.

High rating based on initial introduction. May reduce as reality sets in. Beautiful counters and map and surprisingly comprehensive system that doesn't bog down too much.

Edit - spoke too soon. Assaults become very roll and check-intensive. Post-contact, even small fights feel tiresome. Will revise on final completion of game.

Completed a game and found that even with ML rules, game becomes very slow, even in small engagements like this. Wonderful chrome, amazing content... gameplay, less so. Still, a system worth playing!

La Bataille with very polished graphics. Unfortunately that still doesn't necessarily help playability, the regimental numbers on the golden belt badges are really hard to read.

The system is La Bataille, so no surprise there - really old, but somewhat revived by Terry Doherty if you play with the Regulations XXX or Marie Louise rules.  Overall, somewhat more polished than the Ney vs Wellington system, though much more baroque. 

For a system this slow, and a battle that is a meeting engagement, the randomised arrival times are actually a really bad idea. Yes, it adds in a bit of surprise, but shifting arrival times can easily make it unwinnable for one side. Will only play this without dierolling in the future.

---

Update: Randomness also dominates normal play. Far too slow for the degree of luck. Any tactics are ultimately dominated by the six-to-hit nature of the combat system, but normal six-to-hit systems balance this by having many dice to roll, here it is one set per combat.  I tend to roll more dice *per combat* in Eagles of the Empire than I roll in a whole turn in this game - but this one takes about 20 times as long.  One of the more unpleasant game experiences I can remember, even while the actual detail gameplay is quite interesting.  Add to that the way in which Clash is trampling its customer's wishes underfoot to have a clear series rule system with exclusive rules for each battle, and I am starting to rue my investment.  

Update: Looking at the AAR's here, I thought it was very hard for the French to win. A playtester confirmed that they never saw Ney reaching the crossroads in playtesting, even when houseruling the Allies by deducting "a couple of CPs" (massive if one considers that the French have 2, total).  So, docked another point for serious imbalance and bad development.

Final update: the map artist has pointed out that the map scale is off by about a third - the line to hold is much shorter than it should be given unit frontages.  This explains why the attack doesn't work. Unfortunately makes the game useless.

I have played the 1st edition solo, using the 3rd ed rules, and it worked fine. Of course, the fog-of-war early in the battle is pointless when playing solo, so you either have a bolder French approach or you role-play and simulate Ney´s historical approach. Either way is fine. Components look great, even in 1st ed. 
It´s hard to actually recommend the system to any one. I mean, it is fiddly, it takes time to learn and to play, there are many different rule sets that may suit different battles and different tastes, and the games could be much more user friendly. Still, I have great fun playing these games solo. This is my favourite era and my favourite scale in wargaming, and no other games draw me in like La Bat.
QB is a good entry point. It´s one map with few units, and they enter play a few units at a time. The special rules for the battle are not very complicated, and you may even play without some of them your first time.

My favorite Napoleonic battle to game, for the color and variety of forces engaged, the personalities present on the field, and the wild way the battle swings back and forth as reinforcements arrive on the scene. 

As a one mapper it looks like an excellent introduction to La Bat. 

2nd edition.

RATING: 8
This offerring in the La Bat series is an excellent one-map game in the La Bataille series. Unit density starts low and slowly builds asd the forces for both sides increase. One of the nice options provided in the game is the vaiable unit reinforcement roster. Formations can arrive anywhere from 2 turns early to 2 turns late, which acts to give the side commander the sense that they are the commander in the field.

This was my first experience with La Bataille system. I choosed this one because I thought it would be easier to start with a single map battle. This is one of the more complex systems I ever played and I guess it drives players to hate it or loving it. It reflects every detail about Napoleonic warfare. It is necessary to take into account such as numerous aspects, that it is very easy to forget something or to make a wrong judgement about a battle issue. There are two kind of rules you may apply to the system, the classical or the new rule set. I own first edition about this game, so I played it with older rules. Now I want to try the new rules set. Main difference is about Maneuvering Units (MU) in the new set of rules, what makes initiative unpredictable, that is, much more interesting. It is worth the time you spend learning it. 
In Quatre Brass, reinforcements are the key, specially for the allied player who starts the battle in an inferiority condition. Depending on how Allied player manage dummy counters and how early reinforcements arrive, he can hold his positions to stop Marshall Ney and start a turning point. 
Time dedicated to do every turn increases as the number of units grows up, so when all forces are present, a single turn can take hours to play, so I imagine in battles such as la Moscowa it can be really hard to play.... but sure it deserves a try.

The most manageable of the three La Bataille series games on the Waterloo campaign. Like SPI's 'Ney vs Wellington' was to 'Wellington's Victory', LBdQB is a nice introductory game to the series mechanics - it's got everything the larger game does but on a smaller scale. Add to that, it's a good even fight; one that Ney probably should have won, but one both sides can win.

Quite fun for how simple it is. I like the strategic use of the rest mechanic and deciding who rolls what and when. Very simple but fun. Always comes down to the last roll, which provides a lot of fun tension.

Opened the box. It looks so cool, so retro, so damn playable.
Two hours later... it is cool, it is retro and it is so damn playable. My daughter and I played three games in those two hours, including a rule read too. First game, we managed only seven of the chapter cards. Second attempt we progressed through twelve of them and then failed by one of us falling down a flight of stairs, taking the characters final health point. In the third game, we final made it to the Dark Castles Overlord, The Terror of the Underworld. We were still fairly healthy at 16 health points each at this point. He took us down, destroyed our hope and banished us to oblivion. What a fantastic game!
I own the kick start edition. I look forward to more from Themeborne.

If you are looking for an atmospheric and ultimately fun cooperative game then this is definitely for you!

This was an amazing introduction to rpg's for my 8 yr old. The mechanics are simple enough to learn (10 mins max) and each turn of the chapter card presents the team with a new challenge. Dice rolling and decision making is at the core of this effective little RPG.

We turned the lights low and put on the atmospheric music. My son whispered in my ear "I'm a bit scared Dad" to which I replied "Don't worry, we're in this together!"... we didn't escape that time, but we had fun trying!

I very much wanted to give this game a 10/10 but i cant give it that (yet) as i have only played it once and that was only the demo version displayed at UKGE 2017. However; this game has captured my imagination in a way that games haven't in a long while, I remember while play testing this game, with 2 strangers and my long suffering better half, the way I felt when I first played Heroquest many years ago and I had the same sense of anticipation before playing it that I had before playing Heroquest thanks to the clever TV advertising of the 80's and the excellent YouTube film produced to promote Escape the Dark Castle! The whole feel of it is pure fighting fantasy, dark dungeons, swords and monsters nostalgia and I'm a sucker for that but its also a really really good game. I felt tense and excited while playing, each card turn brought some new challenge or monster with different choices on how to tackle the 'chapter', the final encounter had us all grimacing for the worst as it came right down to the wire and the group really wanted the win and worked hard together to achieve it. I'm not huge into role playing and this isnt a role playing game but EtDC got me involved effortlessly and i enjoyed every minute of it, i think this game is even better if you buy into it a little bit more than usual, like a mini game of Knightmare!
EtDC was the first game I wanted to see at UKGE 2017 and I got my wish and wasnt even bothered that I had to (unsurprisingly) wait in line to play, it added to the tension. I cant wait to receive my copy of the Kickstarter in November when I will hopefully enjoy it enough to up its score to 10!

RATING: 8
Cool game, short set up time, easy rules and short overall game time make this a casual game that is dripping with theme. Lots of interaction between participating players. The game also adjusts in rather simple yet clever ways to the number of players participating. The quality of materials differs slightly: While the cards  are very nicely made, the dice don't quite reach the quality of the cards (some color overflow). Still a very cool and (to me) novel game with lots of player interaction. Recommended!

RATING: 7.5
Very simple, almost overly so. You flip a huge card over and have an encounter, then have a couple rounds of combat where you roll a single die. Or you're given a narrative choice or maybe need to roll a die one time to represent an RPG-like skill test. You work your way through a random encounter deck and eventually fight a boss. The difficulty is high but it's so quick to setup and easy to play that you'll return to the Dark Castle again and again.

Despite the simplicity and the feeling that there's really not much there, this game is actually really damn good. The randomized encounters feels like a choose-your-own-adventure the black and white aesthetic really supports the unique atmosphere. As a really light story game, this is absolutely worth the time it demands and will keep getting played. It works better solo since the number of decisions are few, but is worthwhile maybe playing with a non-gamer or roping your family into it. 

In many ways, this is the Ameritrash version of Friedemann Friese's Friday.

Very good fun and easy to learn, this game promotes teamwork and communication. I love how you start the game with literally nothing and have to somehow survive the horrors that await using only your bare hands and a mouldy apple! The replayability is great and the artwork is just superb. If you liked Fighting Fantasy books from the 80's - 90's, then the art will transport you back to days of getting lost in a world of fantasy!

Beautifully presented, easy to pick up, atmospheric dice-chucker. The 4-player sessions I've had with this had some of the most nail-bitingly tense teamwork moments I've ever experienced in a game! 

The lightness of the system is actually its strong point - a game will last 30 minutes at most and the simplicity of the rules allows gaming veterans and newcomers alike to feel on the same level. Also, from what I can tell so far, very well-balanced from a challenge point of view. You will lose often, and it makes actually escaping the castle feel like a real triumph.

Clearly made with love and skill, a wonderfully grisly little adventure game!

Escape the Dark Castle is an excellent, atmospheric, fast casual game with old school artwork and sleek modern mechanics. Addictive, even if you lose most of the time. :-) Highly recommended. Works well solo (you run two characters) or in coop mode (I have played only with another player, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work just the same in a 4-player mode).

Backed on Kickstarter, really interesting and engaging gameplay.  My wife actually enjoys it, and she normally wouldn't be a fan of such things.  The co-op part is really fun, and the monster player count scaling is a solid mechanic.  We've played two games so far and haven't yet escaped, it's pretty difficult, which is good, but we'll get better.

First of all, the game is flipping brilliant  But imho, too many important things gated off for Kickstarters only. The replayability of the game is seriously hampered but having 2 of the 5 bosses of the game only available to those of Kickstartered the game. I get that there have to be some incentives, but bosses are a pretty important part of the game. Hopefully the extra cards will be sold as an expansion at a future date, since they were great.

RATING: 7
Kickstarter backer. Received January 24, 2018. Great cooperative narrative storytelling dungeon crawl. Recommended if you like Legacy at Dragonholt or the Expedition RPG. The hand-drawn illustrations are baroque and gothic and creepy and very old-school. This absolutely captures the spirit and difficulty of the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. Gameplay is scaled down: each card is a different encounter, with a final boss to defeat. There are three skills represented on d6, and players must roll and match symbols with the creature dice on the table during any particular combat. The game is difficult to win since there is the element of chance, and also since virtually every card we encountered was a trap, negative benefit, or combat. It plays fast and is dripping with theme and we all had a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the art style and the narrative on the chapter cards. Game is fun, but doesn't have a lot of meaningful strategic choices. There's a touch of 'push your luck' to the game. Rules are simple, and take almost no time at all to teach or understand.

I got my copy of the game from Kickstarter campaign. I'd never played a co-op game before, nor one that was adventure-based, and I absolutely loved it. It's got great graphics, the game pieces are beautifully illustrated and large and the dice are novel.  

It is super easy to pick up as well, takes just minutes to learn the rules and you can learn more as you go along. The first time we played with friends, we played a second game immediately after, and would have played a third time had it not been so late.

Definitely recommend getting the soundtrack to play in the background too, such a good idea - really adds to the atmosphere.

I will be recommending this game to everyone, good for all the family!

RATING: 4
I love Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and have huge nostalgia for them. I've played several of them recently. But this game in no way scratches the same itch. I would describe it as a very, very short gamebook using a simply combat system, a small number of items and offering very little decision-making. In every way I found it less enjoyable and less engaging than any gamebook I've ever played. I couldn't even recommend it as an introduction to game books or RPG-style games for a young child, as the content is not suitable. The artwork does lend an 80s gamebook feel but the decision not to use a colour cover illustration baffles me as that is an essential component of the genre.

Love this game! I play with my wife and 10 year old son, both of which prefer lighter quicker games. The description "atmospheric game" is spot on, especially with the soundtrack which is PERFECT for this game and the neighborhood haunted house we'll put on next year. You can find the soundtrack on YouTube if you didn't back the KS. I like to put it on my phone at the table and place the box lid over it to give it more effect. 
The dice chucking is a lot of fun and the different encounters and bosses provide really creative and unique scenarios. All this makes for tremendous replayability!!

Had the opportunity to play this game at the UK games expo, Whenever we tried to get a game the tables were always full which instantly said this was a good game and once my partner and I had a go we could see why, A very good game which is simple to learn and a great game to play regardless of your gaming level, Ideal for solo play, and groups of four which is perfect and such a good design aspect!

This is a simple game. It plays itself. That said, it is a pretty good diversion. My first play through was somewhat disappointing due to poor dice rolling and only having chapter cards that don’t have any options. The second play was better. We felt more immersed in the story that was unfolding and more of the cards had options. I wish that there were more cards with options, and sometimes that there were more options in general than just flee or fight. We had a good run the second game, almost won but didn’t, and there was just enough tension to pique my attention and make me interested to play again. I bought it to try to introduce my wife to dungeon crawls and that sort of world before we move on to bigger and better things, and perhaps it worked. I think it will also be fun when my kids are a bit older but not yet ready to take on heavy rpg gaming.

Only played solo for now - but it's lots of old school fun and thrills. So easy to pick up and play with simple decisions and dice rolling that can often be mitigated. Really hard to win as well, which is great.

RATING: 7
As good as I hoped it would be. Light hearted and straightforward dungeon crawl, thematic and with high replayability. Some dice chucking for even more fun. It's also going to be so easy to create more xpansions to add to the game, in fact the only thing it lacks is item cards, which I would recommend in the next expansion
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Thematic, easy game. If you like dungeons, short play time, dice rolling and deluxe components, this might be for you.
The bummer here is the lack of decision space. Because it's so easy to pick up and only lasts around 30 minutes, this is a dive rolling fest, no more, no less. Also your chances of escaping are strongly correlated to the chapters you draw. All in all it's still a cool thematic experience and I'm pretty sure this will see some more plays.

For me the key criteria include: a challenge but not too formidable; fairly easy to learn; good fun to play; having a good theme to it; variable number of players (especially 1 or 2); not too long; a nice touch and feel to it with quality components;  and the ability to try different strategies. Escape the Dark Castle meets all these criteria and has been a big hit with all my friends and family with whom I have played it. For me an excellent purchase and money well spent!

This game is simple, but exciting.  The black and white art style makes for a great atmosphere.  Even the simple components and rolling a single die somehow help make the dark feel of the game more suspenseful.  Both games I have played with others were close.  The game we won came down do the very last die result, and it was so satisfying.  It is extremely easy to bring to the table and get a quick game in.  The only downside to this game is ironically one of its upsides - its lightness.  It can very easily leave you wanting the game to be deeper.

Another play-tested game for the UK Expo this year that is heavily influenced by the Fighting Fantasy books of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone which I think is a great idea as these were very popular. I imagine that the game is designed to encourage co-operation between players in order to effect their escape from said castle, dark or not, so the characters need to have a mix of abilities of which there are but three. Because we had not played before, we had to look at the rules regularly, so may have misunderstood these on the first run-through, but those who role-play will understand the need to choose a mixture of fighting and studious types. We did not....

Each player is one of several prisoners, wrongfully incarcerated (they always are), and whether they be of noble stock or chicken stock (a gag I borrowed), they must all attempt to escape the perils of the unknown passageways generated by a mixture of obstacles and individuals they must either negotiate or pass through using combat. All of the current six character cards - abbot and tailor being two of them -  have three attributes of varying power consisting of Might, Cunning and Wisdom exactly like those Fighting Fantasy books of yore. There is a unique character die which reflects the strength of each character's primary, secondary and tertiary attributes ranging from 1 - 4. .

The encounters vary, as mentioned above, and I believe there are around thirty or so different 'chapters' that are randomly shuffled into a book so that each player takes a turn in leafing the next page and reading aloud the story line and the choices before them. The permutations would not be so great in the longer term although the separate item cards will help to vary the this a little more. I do like the stylised artwork on both card types but the components for every game will be down to personal preference in this regard. At the beginning of each game, fifteen of these chapter cards are drawn at random from a larger deck to create a unique castle every time.

The co-operation theme runs very strongly through the game and each chapter represents a new  chamber or passageway. Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it. In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed. Bribe the drunken guards or attack them? Charge the beast or lure it out? Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving? The three attributes are used for skill tests in a similar vein to all RPG's and the unique character die is a nice touch as it is used to push-your-luck as a group, which did not end well for the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker, as we fell to the Steven Segal like cook who objected to us stealing his pies..... You have been warned.

When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy. They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage. The cook, given it was three to one odds in our favour, chopped us all down although we did not select a combat focused character so we would not make that mistake again. We did not do particularly well on our dice throwing either, so pun aside, combat can be a little hit and miss and too random for some. We perhaps missed one of two options as the rules were being used straight from the box, so on balance, I like the idea but the low permutations on the adventure content would make this game less attractive without expansion cards which I am sure would be the intention.

A straightforward game that may require a couple of plays to pick up the rule nuances  around blocking, resting, and the use of weapons, relics and potions. All chapters must be completed and defeat the final master of the castle so keeping everyone alive is key to escaping as any player killed immediately ends the game.

Some of the simplest instructions ever for a board game I've seen yet.  Game is set up and taught to new players in less than 5 minutes!  Average length is 30 minutes...if you don't lose early in the game, that is.  Word of caution: difficulty adjusts to match the number of players.  You get more hit points the fewer number of players you have (increasing combat survivability) but monsters are harder to overcome since you now have less dice to fight with.  The vice versa is also true: the more players you have the more dice you have to fight monsters making combat easier(?) but your hp significantly drops making combat potentially more lethal.  
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Escape the Dark Castle is as much an exercise of interactive storytelling as it is a game. If you loved the old adventure gamebooks, and have a fun group of players willing to use their imaginations, you can have a lot of fun. The mechanics are simple, and easy to explain to new players along the way. But you choices are limited, and the difficulty is very hard -- your group must be prepared to perish!

Really liked this, seemed a little on rails at first but as we got into it it became clear how important all the little decisions were and how the equipment selection and use was key to success.
The art style and feel of the game is spot on, very evocative and immersive.

Three games and two escapes in, this is atmospheric, enjoyable, and (as advertised) quick to set up, explain and play. The rule book stresses the importance of reading the story on the cards, and it's definitely more enjoyable with dramatic narration and the original soundtrack playing in the background.

Reasonable replay value from the sheer number of story cards, and the decisions you can make are generally well-balanced. I think some players would be put off by the high dependence on chance and the relatively-simple combat.

This game plays fast, and can keep four fully grown bearded men amused for half an hour - with whoops of joy at good swings of luck, and cries of “oh no!” when things go south in a battle against a horde of evil wolves. Escape the Dark Castle is simple, and can be set up and explained in 2 minutes.

Also works beautifully with kids, and (of course) women gamers.

If you’re a fan of the art style and gameplay, hugely reminiscent of Fighting Fantasy, then this is the filler-game you’ve been exploring dank dungeons looking for.

I’m definitely the target audience for this game, and I LOVE IT!

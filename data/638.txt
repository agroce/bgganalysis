RATING: 8
Interesting and sometimes evil 2-player game, with lot of confrontation and hard-to-memorize card abilities. I liked it very much, but after a couple of play I burned out with it. Still, I recommend it as one of the best games in the Kosmos-line.

RATING: 6
A fancy version of Stratego.  It's quite fun, but my wife finds it dull and frustrating - too many rules.

It's not an easy game to follow, but it can be worth the effort.  One day, I may find a player who likes it more than my wife and then I may uprate - but only slightly.

I haven't played this game that much. The only couple of times I did was with then current girlfriends. They never really liked it, because of how games tended to end in stalemates, with winners declared by the amount of moves still available. 

I'd still like to give it a chance, though my fiancée probably isn't going to be up for it. The rules weren't always clear to me, especially with regards to how special cards with numerics should be played. For instance, are Pythia's abilities playable from your hand or only activated by putting her on the field? The rules aren't really clear on that bit, in spite of being very clear with the similar rules for the Pegasus-cards

I do like the artwork and Stratego ís a childhood favorite of mine, so I'm still kind of on the fence on this one.

RATING: 4
In this game, we had to repeatedly look up each special card. Too luck oriented since one of the many Pegasus cards could have easily ended the game by drawing the hostage. We also didn't see much action from the 3rd and 4th rows, and the order of the columns didn't really do much except by chance. And then even winning battles didn't seem to give any real advantage. It feels like the most likely outcome is a default victory where a player cannot spend their action points. A dude in my books, I'd rather play Battle Line. Theme itself is decent, but the art is merely okay.

For a two players, this game is grippingly great!
Tactics; suspense; intrigue; strategy; luck... all there!

As it says on the box..."Divine Feud for two"

I bought this game as a gift for my wife, which we now easily take on holiday together as it is essentially a deck of cards.
A great tea time game which has us back to play it again and again.
We're looking forward to playing more of the Kosmos 2 player series! Rated 7 (18/01/11)

November 2011 update; I am reducing the score to 6. Largely because there is a bit of a flaw in the game; which by simply hanging on to certain cards; you essentially guarantee a win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Light-weight theme, but gorgeous and evocative art. I think the claims that this is a combo of Stratego and War are pushing it a bit: H&Z is its own entity, with only minor similarities to the other two games.

If you think this is a game determined by luck, you're either new to the game or playing it very, very poorly!

Another fun game of the Kosmos 2 player series.  I think it has more to it than Lost Cities and Balloon Cup, but not as exciting as Jambo.  It gets a little frustrating that you cannot move your cards around, and get "deadlocked" with extra actions to take that you don't necessarily want to.

We are Hera and Zeus, quarreling and taking hostages.  There are several ways to win.  The most obvious is rescuing the hostage held by your opponent, but you also need to pay attention to the speed with which you are working through your draw pile (no card to draw - you lose) and to keeping a presence on the table.  Some well conceived special abilities add spice to what would otherwise be Stratego with cards.  A typical Kosmos two-player; light rules overhead, some luck, a fair bit to think about, doesn't outstay its welcome.   

Artwork and production quality are both decent.  Sure it would have been nice to have text on the special cards rather than crib sheets, but as a veteran of German editions of games I don't find that a major issue.

A dleightful game of one-on-one play between 2 players who really are made to feel like opposing divinities! Better yet, like Caesar & Cleoptara, it's a battle of the sexes!
Seriously, H&Z is a clever and well-designed game (but read the FAQ to get over a couple of rules trips). Play is a little more varied than C&C and it has more replay value and a better sense of combativeness.

RATING: 7.5
Great 2 player game. Like stratego with cards. Has a few cards with special abilities (bring back a dead warrior) and some cards have extra abilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game plays fast (between 4 and 20 minutes) and like most card games, luck plays a big part.  That being said, there are numerous chances during a game to make strategic choices and a good player will usually beat a lucky player.  I suggest that this game be played in a series of 5 or 7 games so the luck evens out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really like how this Stratego card game can be over in 5 minutes, or maybe 35 minutes, depending on what strategy you try (and what cards you start with), but then, I also like regular Stratego.  The variable ending/victory condition really work for me, as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The special abilities of the cards are not that intuitive, so your first few plays take a lot of looking up to see what your cards do.  I thought there are better bluffing games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One of my first strategy games, so it is hard to remember it in detail. I did like it better than Lost Cities or Caesar and Cleopatra though. Played like a simple version of stratego, slightly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's not terrible, but too much of the game involves blindly targeting your opponent's cards.

When the cards are targeting each other on the game board it's not that bad because you at least have some information and control -- and there's room for bluffing.  Still, it often feels pretty random.

Worse though, is how much of the game involves randomly picking out cards from your opponent's hand.  If you hit the right cards you can lose a lot of power or even lose the game outright.  Often there's nothing you can do about this.

So basically, there's a lot of chaos and chance in the game, and I think a little too much.  But there's some good stuff here if you are willing to play quickly and frequently to get past the influence of luck.

I think I'm going to trade it away and focus on other two player games like LoTR: The Confrontation, Jambo, Blue Moon, Battle Line, and Lost Cities.

(As a side note, it takes a little effort to learn the game as the rules are complicated and not well organized, and the cards don't have their special abilities written on them.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Girlfriend enjoys it, and that's enough for me.  It IS actually pretty fun though, a bit deeper (strategically) than the other Kosmos 2-player games I've tried, but it's simple enough to teach and play for anyone.

RATING: 4
A dissappointing game play experience.  It is possible, perhaps not likely - but it has happened, to lose this game on the first turn by drawing the protected card from the opponents hand.  Even before they play.  Game length = 1/2 turn.  Even if this doesn't happen, the game is a dressed up version of the card game War.  The theme is not tapped enough to alter the gameplay from this perception.  [GTI Code: xPCL]

This is Stratego with tons of more interesting game mechanics and interactions.  The game moves 10 times faster than Stratego as well.  Also can have a poker-esque feel to it, as talking to your opponent and attempting to extract information/read your opponent can play a part in the game.

RATING: 8.5
Fun game, but learning curve is steep for such a simple game.  Specifically, given that there are six or seven victory conditions, it is unclear when you first begin playing exactly what you&#039;re supposed to do in order to move towards victory.  Only after playing four or five games did we start to &quot;get it&quot;.  My girlfriend hated the game at first, but I insisted we play it three more times before she gave up, since I knew it was well-received here.  Now she enjoys it quite a bit.  I don&#039;t have a problem with the card powers being on the list, and some instructions could be better (Dionysus is overly verbose, as is Pegasus), but this over-verbosity seems to be a trend I&#039;m detecting in these games that come from Germany - cultural bias, I guess.

My second-favourite Kosmos two player game, mainly because my son prefers it to other games like 'Lost Cities' etc. Plays quickly and allows for many routes to victory (or in my case - defeat)!

We have also found that you can come back from seemingly lost positions - one column left and no cards in hand.

The rules can seem fiddly at first but persevere and it becomes second nature.

Highly recommended.

Very random and swingy game with some mildly strategic choices. Yes, this is Stratego the Card Game, but unlike Stratego, this game could end in literally one turn. In fact, it's not unlikely for that to happen.

My understanding is that this initially had a "Stratego" theme to it.  Once you play it, you can see how that fit.  I like the game very much, but I can't find anyone else that will play with me.  It does have a learning curve to play it well.  Up until that point, you are just going through the motions.

Most of the cards have special powers, but since there is no text on any of the cards you have to refer to a help sheet. The Norse mythology themed remake "Thunder & Lightning" has text on the cards, but is otherwise almost identical.

I am terrible at this game, but I still enjoy it. I do not like CCGs, mainly due to the fact that both decks are different. The decks of the two players are identical and once you get to know the cards it's a blast to play. For those of you who like to build custom decks you might not like this.

RATING: 5
It felt like one part Stratego and one part Command & Colors. The tipping point seemed pretty early, and the first player to win a challenge can get a huge momentum advantage since the number of actions are already so low. Card draw luck is also a big factor, but not overwhelming. It's a clever bluffing battle game, but not one I'd want to play often.

Really solid two-player card game.  Lost it in a divorce.  Oughta find another copy some day.

RATING: 8
Two plays: one quick loss, one slow one. Quick loss: I drew only three numbered cards, and so I died when my fiancee decided to go on the immediate offensive. Boring. Slow loss: I realized, too late, that having Medusas and other defensive characters in the front row seriously limited your options, esp. if your opponent hides her Io/Argus in that column. Another lesson: Dionysus is VERY valuable, don't waste it on something stupid. Frustrating, frustrating loss, but now I want to play it again.

UPDATE: Very, very fun, but quite stressful. Resources are both limited and random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game, though swings of luck can be pretty large (when and how your "goal" card comes out is obviously a fairly major piece of information). Given this, probably not as skilfull as the Settlers of Catan Card Game or Caesar and Cleopatra, but the game is more lively and exciting, which puts it on par with those games for me.

Stratego++

If you like Stratego and Magic: The Gathering, you should definitely try this out. No deck customization, but each player has their own deck to manage throughout the game which provides some nice variation. Occasionally one player just wins via a superior draw, but the cards have enough varied synergies and players have enough control over the action that you can usually adapt to your draw.

This is an excellent little game that is very well balanced (both players have decks with equal values). Game play is fun and there are many ways to win. However, there are also an equal number of ways to lose! Thanks to a few very powerful cards, there are ample opportunities wherein a successful bluff can lead to the annihilation of your opponent. 

Cons:
Zeus and Hera tokens are utterly superfluous and serve only to double the price of the game.

Richard Borg (3 plays) This game is so convenient.  My wife and I can get a couple of games in before the kids even realize this is going on.  Fun to try to get in each others heads and it's light enough to not care who wins.  Could've put the cards rules on the cards.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn if you know Stratego but, continuous reinforcements ends the tedium and ads flexibility to the play.  The random element adds a tension that increases the fun level.

It took 5 plays and a number of rereads until we finally played it correctly but, it was worth the patience and it is a real winner.

Be patient and you will be rewarded.  It is a blast.

I basically like this, but it seems to suffer too much from a balance problem. If you draw weak cards early and lose one or two columns, you're pretty much out, and sucks out loud. Oh, and what is the purpose of the Hera/Zeus card?

This 2 player game reminded me kind of Stratego with cards, however, it is much deeper! You still need to remember where which cards are where, and if you always forget that you’re probably going to have a hard time. However, it’s not mandatory to remember every card, and you probably can’t as the cards can be moved around. 

There are lots of different cards to keep track of (16 different, 43 in total), and it probably takes a couple of games before you really know what you’re doing, knowing the cards and are able to plan a real strategy. Sure there is luck of the draw, and I think it’s a little lame that you can lose the game if you’re opponent randomly draws your prisoner, but it’s probably not very likely to happen. It seems that there is a bigger risk of losing when you’re out of actions, i.e. for instance if you’re filling up your columns with the maximum number of cards and put Medusas (i.e. bombs from Stratego) in the front row so you cannot attack. So you have to manage your display and your hand. Oh, and you also need to count the number of Amazons in your deck, i.e. the “bomb-destroyers”, otherwise you’ll not be able to win by capturing the prisoner if it’s protected behind a bomb.

I would like to play it a couple of times more; it’s definitely meatier than, for instance, Battle Line, but it also takes a lot longer.

RATING: 6.7
This game is sometimes a real dud -- like when it ends early due to somebody getting his hand nuked early in the game just after drawing the hostage card -- but it can be really engrossing when it goes long.  I've had individual sessions that I'd rate anywhere from a 3 to a 10.  Fortunately, the dud sessions are usually over very quickly.

The basic idea is similar to Stratego.  You need to invest several initial plays to become familiar with the special powers and relationships of the different cards.  If you get behind it's difficult to catch up because you get fewer action points.  Although this isn't a bad game, we prefer Lord of the Rings: the Confronation, and traded this one away.

I need to get another play of this done, since I'm thinking we may have initially been too harsh.  The basic problem with the game though seems to be that it's too long for how light it is -- or too light for how long it is.  Definitely didn't like it the first time through, but perhaps should give it a second chance.

UPDATE:  Upon more plays, I've elevated this to a '6.'  It has more strategic depth than I initially gave it credit for, and there is some fun in figuring out how best to exploit the card play given the number of actions you may have on a given turn.  The core problem still remains, however, that the length seems out of proportion to the game's weight.

RATING: 2
C'mon people...this game is _vastly_ overrated!  Sloppy, fiddly Stratego-like card game with more memory and luck than tactics and skill.  Completely irritating art, rules, and mechanics.  Game can be won by a terrible, lucky player (which has happened a few times to me).  There is absolutely no reason to play this with excellent and vastly superior games like LOTR: The Confrontation available.  Worthless, one of the worst European games I've bought.  YMMV, of course...

The card powers REALLY should have been written on the cards, though, instead of all the tedious reading and referencing you have to do to get through early plays.

RATING: 8
I think this is a fantastic game, but it does not show its depths very quickly.  There are all sorts of complaints people have about it, but many of them are related to poor play.  For example, if, on your last action, you draw your prisoner, your oppenent can win by simply attacking your hand with the pegasus card.  But this doesn't mean that you got unlucky--you never should have used your last action to draw a card!  Unfortunately, I don't have a regular oppenent for this one.

A very nice little gem for the light 2 player game that it is! :) The basics are similar to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1917/stratego]Stratego[/url] but with cards. I like it much better than Stratego, though. One of Hera and Zeus' big advantages over Stratego is that it doesn't have hidden trackable information. I hope it will get a reprint, it deserves it!

IMO Hera & Zeus is 2nd best Kosmos 2-player game (right after LotR: Confrontation). Some luck involved (drawing cards). Even the losing is fun (several ways to lose or win). Many tactical variations to choose from. Fun, intriguing and quite thrilling little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Scratches the itch that Stratego never did. Adapting your play to what the deck gives you is vital. 

Note: A slight majority of games I've played have been decided by whose deck runs out first; blowing through cards is only a good idea if you're losing on the battlefield and need to survive, or if you have good reason to believe pushing your advantage will give you a win in short order.

Components: Good mood-setting artwork in each of the two unique decks, and the numbers are easy to read. The card quality is average. During my playings I was repeatedly looking at my face-down cards to remember what they were, so I would prefer to play with some sort of stand to keep the cards upright.

Experience: I definitely prefer card games with fewer special power cards and more clever mechanisms, but Hera & Zeus is mildly entertaining, trying to balance controlling the sites with not burning through my deck too quickly.

This is a fun one but it goes too fast in my opinion.  Before the columns are set and fortified, one side usually gets an advantage and keeps it.  Also, several games ended with a lucky draw of the hostage card from the opponent's hand with one of the 9 pegasus cards.  9 Pegasus cards plus a card that lets you draw 3 of them back really cuts down on the strategy element in my opinion.  I like the game but it could have been a little better.

Reminds me a little of stratego, but better.  You have a more narrow front that consists of 3 cards that can "challenge" the opposite card...higher number wins.  There are several cards that have special abilities.  Medusa is like the stratego's bomb...it kills everything, but cannot attack.  A "hero" is like a miner.  It kills bombs, but loses to almost everything else.  The difference in strategy is that you have 3 action points per turn. You can play a card, draw a card, or attack.

This game is really interesting and is also quite unique.  The one thing that bugs me is that at certain points in the game, the win conditions seem too indirect or unachievable, and you feel like you're just spinning your wheels.  If both players play defensively, the game will sometimes end with the unsatisfactory win condition of someone running out of cards.  This usually causes me to play too aggressively, and my partner will react by playing defensively and winning.  Also, the game rewards the skills of bluffing and reading your opponent, which she excels at.  This could be why she likes this game more than me!

[Borg] Decent two-player game, usually lasts under an hour. It requires much more thought, bluff, and strategy than 'Lost Cities'. Yet the payoff of feeling like "I really made the difference" just isn't there for me... it's often lucky hands or long grind-down-my-opponent marathons. I recenttly learned Netrunner CCG and am amazed at how much Hera & Zeus borrowed from Garfield's design.

I used to own this, but I traded it away. I wasn't too crazy about this game- my wife was even less so. CCG-like feel, but not as good as a CCG. Basically an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. Room for strategy, but still too luck dependent for me, and too much depends on random guessing for the complexity of the rules.

RATING: 4
(Or "Stratego: The Card Game -- Greek Mythology version") We thought this was a decent enough game, but the lack of information on the cards slowed it down too much for us. If you don't mind going back and forth to the cheat sheets (or if you get enough plays in that you remember what the cards do), it's not too bad a game. 

Traded it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a card game that has elements of Stratego or LotR: Confrontation.  I like that a lot of the cards have special abilities and that some of the cards have multiple special abilities.  It's too bad the info wasn't on the cards but after repeated plays it shouldn't be an issue keeping track of what's what.  I like that it has an action point system in the game with a variable number of actions based on position in the game.  There is also a number of ways to win. While it's a decent game, I would probably rather LotR Confrontation.

Edit: This has been re-implemented by Thunder & Lightning and now has text on the cards. While I'm interested in trying it, I still really enjoy Confrontation.

Played twice.  Pretty good.  Be warned, though, there's a bit of a learning curve as there's no text on the cards, and several that have multiple ways to play and special abilities.  Once you get familiar with the game, this won't be an issue, but expect your first couple of games to go slow.  Art is good, and I enjoy the "hunting" aspect of this game.

RATING: 5
Decent card game conversion of stratego. I didn't feel that it was too memorable though, especially with contrasting the rest of the Kosmos 2 player games. For that bluffing/intrigue feel I'd rather play LOTR:TC

Additionally beginning to play the game was a little complicated for euro standards. Cards have no text, there are reference sheets for the cards, but the concept was a little weak. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's a variety of ways to win, very Knizia-ly, I must say. This gives the game some variety in strategy, thus a decent replayable factor. But much depends on your target card (Io or Argus) - when it comes out and in what situation, and that can put the player at the mercy of the card draw for a dramatic swing in the game.

Bluffing 2 player game, spoken of as card version of Stratego combined with CCG, rules and unique abilities initially difficult but quickly mastered (Flag=Io/Argus, Scout=Pegasus, Bomb=Medusa, Miner=Hero/Amazon, General=Nemesis/Poseidon, Spy=Pythia).  I initially disliked the Greek god theme, but the gameplay and mechanics are excellent, leading to a very tense game with multiple paths to victory.  The game is largely tactical/strategic, but there's enough luck-of-the-draw to make it light, and increase replay value.

I much prefer a solid winning objective, in this case capturing Io/Argus, than playing for the most points as in most German games. Hera &amp; Zeus is a very satisfying game to win. The learning curve is steep. After you and your playing partner get past it, you can play another 30 games learning all the tactical possibilities and defining your style. Good replayability because every game runs different.

RATING: 6
Simple Stratego-like game with higher numbers beating lower numbers except Medusa and the Gods have certain powers. No text on the cards which makes it a tad tricky to keep all the effects in your head (ie not constantly refering to the crib sheet). It's a nice enough game and maybe the strategies will reveal themselves with more play.

* Played 30+ times. Middleweight strategy. It was my fave 2-player game for a couple years, only knocked down with the release of Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. One of the 2 best in the Kosmos 2-player series. Great fun. Very tense if you like hidden info battle games (like Stratego) as well as cool action cards. (Bought from Sean. Traded this and Coda for Dominion.)

Just for 2.  This was one of the earlier games I purchased & I was a little put off by the different abilities of the characters and that I needed a crib sheet in order to play.  My husband wouldn't play it at all with me so I sold it.  I own so many of the fine Kosmos games now, and this was such a pretty one as well, wish I had kept it to at least retry.  My opinion & rating might be very different now.

I liked to play this game with my girlfriend. Althought the game has its problems (usually the game repeats the same format time after time and Io and Argus seems to be auxialiary for winning strategies, you usually either have to give up because you can't do anything anymore or your forces are swept away), it fun to play. The rules are fiddly at first but are easy after a couple of games. It playes fastly also.

This is a surprisingly fun game.  I read the instructions about 50 times before deciding to brave the gameplay.  It seemed like there were special rules and exceptions for EVERYTHING.

I would give it a higher score if there were less complicated rules to get started....

RATING: 4
The various special powers make this a hard game to get into, and you will constantly have to refer to the reference sheets at the beginning.

Even when those powers have sunk in to some extent, I don't really see the appeal of the game, however. The spatial aspect of the often cited ancestor Stratego has been much reduced, and the game mostly revolves about trading blows on the front lines. Since there is very little planning beyond the short term it rarely feels like you played well and often like you just got the right cards at the right time.

Apart from having to refer constantly to the card summary (this game obviously would benefit from a text-dependent reprint) there is so much to like about this game. This might be one of the best tactical, quick-playing card games. Lots of room for bluffing and planning brutal assaults. A little luck is thrown in for good measure. Quite a few interesting effects appear because of card interactions. Very little overhead and yet a solid, meaty experience for such a small game. Very impressive!

Pros are that some of the inherent randomness and luck card games routinely suffer from can be negated by the ability to reorder your columns during card draw.  Some decision making on certain point value mythology cards offer tactical vs. strategic options. Cons equate to the mythological Hera and Zeus cards seem to be limited to the commonality of the Pegasus cards.  Tactics for certain card play combinations due become predictable.  All in all an otherwise enjoyable game.

Played this game at lunch all the time. It's a very interesting adaptation of Stratego into a card game and I think it works really well. The fact that the cards don't have powers written on them makes it hard to teach and it usually takes 2-3 games to really pick it up, so be sure to stick with it.

A good idea and nice graphics don't make a great game. There are so many interdependencies between cards that you need to play at least a dozen of times to have everything under control and play consciously.

But I don't feel like playing it again - the gameplay wasn't rewarding at all. A bit boring even. I admit - it's a good game but that's all.

RATING: 7
Mini-Stratego with hand management. The limitations of the 3x3 (per player) playing field and the fact that some cards can be as dangerous to you as to your opponent keep this interesting. The heavy luck element makes this an exercise in risk-management.

RATING: 7
Very interesting. The Stratego like unknowns in battles coupled with the mythology actions and randomness of the cards makes for an every changing challenge. Fast and surprising.

update: well, not so surprising after a couple more plays. Most common game ender here tends to be Pythia uncovering the hostage. Agressive confrontation on the table can actually result in running out of cards and the game ending because of inability to take actions. Hera&Zeus are  usually pretty useless since Pegasus can stop them, and there are a *lot* of them in the deck. (And with Persephone, you can use even more.)

Still a decent game to fill in the odd half hour though.

Three plays, and we fail to see the appeal. Each game comes down to randomly finding the captive in your opponent's hand. I guess we must be missing something. Update: killing your opponent's columns & leaving them with no actions works too.

A good game but an excellent example of how a poor theme can make a game harder to conceptualize.

Hera & Zeus started out as Stratego: The Card Game and it makes SO much more sense when you realize this. Substitute "flag" for "hostage" and the various victory conditions are clear. Substitute "bomb" for "medusa" and all the related rules are obvious -- why medusa can't attack, why only the "miner" (oops, I mean "hero") can defeat her, etc.

Sure it's an adaptation of Stratego, but it's fun! Nice artwork, interesting changes and developments. The game can end in many different ways, which means that sometimes the games are very short, sometimes fairly long. There's a good bit of bluffing and second-guessing, and the special powers of certain cards keep it lively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I do like the theme for this game because it makes it a perfect game for couples.  However, I think the mechanics leave a bit too much to chance for it to be a deep and satisfying experience.  Perhaps with more plays, we could develop better defences and learn some timing issues that could only come from experience.  The few times I've played, the game has always been won by someone's lucky Pegasus draw of Argus or Io for the win.

My brother and I played this 4 or 5 times a little while ago over a weekend and I was starting to see the fun in it.  So many surprises and deceptions, every game plays a little differently based on the cards both players happen to get.

With games like this I really wish that bgg's rating system didn't depend so much on the comments attached to the numbers. I'd really like to mark this as a 3 in terms of how likely I am to want to play it again, but I don't think its a bad game. So I feel its unfair to give it that three. It's a perfectly decent game, but it bored me and confused me a bit (yeah go ahead laugh at me its such a simple little game but I seemed to have a hard time getting my head wrapped around how to use the cards to my advantage.)

Anyway, I never say never and its possible that I will one day try this out again, but I can't say that I will actively seek out the opportunity.

RATING: 6.5
A completely fine game, but I rather play and keep "Caesar and Cleopatra" over this one, as there are some similarities.

This really is "Stratego the Card Game" and it works very well as this and I like it much more than the original "Stratego", as it more dynamic and faster, but owning all those other games, this loses ground very fast. I would play it again and everyone who enjoys "Stratego" should give this a try for sure.

Stratego, with cards. The mythological flavor keeps it going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Basically a card-game version of Stratego.  As with many card games, there is some luck of the draw, but since there are only 43 cards, many of which are repeats, there is definitely skill involved.  You have to find your "hostage", but you'll never find it if your opponent never draws it, so that's one major "luck of the draw" situation.

I like the riskiness of the Pandora card, how you and your opponent lose everything in that column if a Pandora is attacked.  Despite the risk, you really have great incentive to play it as soon as possible because  you lose everything in your hand if Pandora is attacked in your hand by a Pegasus.

RATING: 5
Luck is too important for the typical length game, and some games degenerate into boredom due to a bad card distribution, but when it works, it is very engaging.

RATING: 8
I enjoy it despite the fact that it probably has too much luck associated with it. It's extremely frustrating when that luck goes against you, for example, Io turns up pretty early in your hand and gets picked out by Pegasus.

RATING: 5
Fun but not fantastic. It could have been better if the rules text were on the cards instead of on a seperate sheet. The art is so-so. I got plenty of play out of it before I traded it away.

Years later, this is one of a few games I wish I hadn't traded away. I'm not sure I can justify tracking it down again, but I do remember it more fondly than the above would suggest.

RATING: 8
This bluffying card game gives a board game feel because the cards simulate a board, like Plunder. I like that the powers on the card coincides with the characters on the card. I love many games with mythological themes. This is the best in the Kosmos two player line. Perfect for couples because you can role play the dueling Hera and Zeus. The premise of the game is that Hera has captured IO and Zeus has captured Argus. The other player must find their person while hiding the one he/she has captured. The main reason this game is rated so high is because it is so challenging and I rarely win.  

Unfortunately, my husband does not like this game as much as I do and it does not get enough play.

I found this game to be moderately interesting but ultimately too random and two-dimensional.  The mythological theme is kind of fun, but the game turns into random chance combined with the ability to "wait out" your opponent.

RATING: 7
An interesting 2-player card game that feels a lot like Stratego, but with mythological units. Each unit type has a special power, which is held in check by another unit type, just like in Stratego: The Marshall '1' (or '10' for the latest versions) can only be killed by the lowly Spy 'S', which every other unit can kill. Now, extend this to a number of different unit types, and you have an interesting card game that sort plays like a battle game: cards are laid out in three columns, and three or four ranks deep.

It's a neat little game with plenty of strategy and tactics. I'm tempted to get my own copy, but the opportunities to play 2-player are far and few between.

It's very chaotic, but you can't deny it's fun (very). One negative point though, the rules are awful awful awful... They are vague, confusing, stupid, contradictory, non-consistent, complex for no reasons... Worst.Rules.EVER. Once both players "get" all the rules and errata , it will start to be very fun and "bluffy". Would have rated it a 9 if it weren't for the rules.

Based on 4 plays (rating may go up or down with more plays)-  I see a lot of potential in this game, but my current plays ended in fairly quick lopsided games.  I drew strong creatures to populate my line in the first turn, and in both games by the third turn I had eliminated two of my wife's columns.  (This allowed me to quickly run away with the game using my 3 actions to her 1 as she was never able to recover.)

Initial Rating: 5.5 (June 2012)

As this was a Richard Borg game and a Kosmos 2 player game, I had high hopes for Hera and Zeus, but it let me down. The theme is excellent, but the gameplay left a lot to be desired. I have only played it once and I will give it another chance, however I don’t think I will play this often, as there are a lot of great 2 players games out there.

I hate that the powers of the cards are not written in the cards, so you have to constantly refer to the aid. I feel the game has too much luck for my taste. It is reminiscent of Stratego, that is, it has an spatial element and you don’t know what is behind the card of your opponent.

On the good side, I really like the cards quality and the art. In my only game, I was sure I was winning but I lost that game because I was left with no cards to draw. I like that, you have to carefully manage your hand.

As I said, I will give it another chance but I’m not sure the rating will go up. In fact I’m downgrading its rating to a 4.0 as I feel this is not a good game.

Current Rating: 4.0

I finally played Hera and Zeus again. I had a little more fun than the last time, I also saw that we played it wrong last time. When a player exhaust his deck he doesn’t lose the game immediately. A players loses when he cannot use all his action points.

After you play it a bit, you begin to remember the powers of the cards, so the lack of text on them doesn’t bother me anymore.

It seems the game has some hidden depth I failed to grasp in my first play, however my desire to play it again continues to be low. It has a lot of luck, but as the game plays so fast I don’t mind much.

As opposed to my previous comment, the game has almost no theme, it´s paper thin. 

Bottom line, I think I will sell the game BUT perhaps I need to play it a bit more. I’m still undecided. My desire to play it again is low.

Current Rating: 4.5

I enjoy playing with my husband a lot, so it is nice to find entertaining 2-player games. I will give this a 7 (instead of 8), if our games will continue to end too often to a situation where one of us can't take an action. I would rather win by resquing the hostage. We played this after a break and I didn't like the game that much any more, so I lowered the rating still. I gave my copy to a friend.

Excellent game with subtle play that requires several sessions to fully appreciate. Luck can play a significant role, but not more than you should expect from a short card game. Reading your opponent is a big part of the game there are lots of opportunities for bluffing. What I like most about the game is how card combos and clever plays continually reveal themselves. The downside is that the game not very accessible to new players, you don't usually have a great experience your first couple of games.

RATING: 5
Stratego with cards and more special powers. Bluffing is essential, having the right cards at hand helps. Lucking into a premature discovery of the opponent's flag (hostage) or drawn out matches to the last card can both be equally unsatisfying. I don't like its classic inspiration and Blitz und Donner doesn't fare much better.

Lately I've been getting more into these CCG-ish 2-player card games.  I was pleasantly surprised by Hera & Zeus.  The theme and art don't really appeal to me, but the game is very approachable and much easier to get into than Blue Moon.  After just a couple times looking at the card manifest, you could feel pretty confident playing the game.  I like how the game plays quickly and involves a good amount of bluffing with the face-down cards.  I have the feeling that Blue Moon may end up being a deeper game, but so far it's taken more work to get into it.

RATING: 8
My wife and I love to play this game.  It's another great addition to the Kosmos 2-player series.

The closest similarity I can draw is Stratego with cards, basically it represents Hera and Zeus' neverending feuds with each other.  Both have taken a hostage, and the name of the game is getting that hostage back.  Some cards represent various figures from mythology that can be used as soldiers on the playing field, while others represent powers from certain gods.  Some cards can do either, depending on what the player chooses.

But saying it is like Stratego is an oversimplification.  There are basically three strategies, all of which can be used in combination to win.  First, you can dominate the battlefield, because as soon as you have cleared out all of the opponent's cards from the field, you win (replacement cards can be placed as reiforcements).  Second, you can scout your opponent's cards, using various powers from your own cards, and retrieve your hostage and win.  Third, you also win if your opponent can't take all of his/her actions in a turn, which is basically running our opponent out of cards, or "decking" them.

So we had a really good time with this game, especially for a 2-person game.  It turned out to be a lot deeper that I initially thought and look forward to playing it again.

Great game that may end a bit abruptly, but on the other hand cannot take too long in any case. Nice graphics too. The only minor complaint is the absence of text in the cards themselves (update: which is in fact a plus once you've learned the cards and/or own a foreign version of the game, like I do)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A well balanced, well-designed game, perfect for two players and even more perfect for a married couple. Fairly quick to pick up, but a few of the rules exceptions (not printed on the reference sheets for some reason) can trip you up if you haven't played it in a while.

A lot of people rave about the art, but I'm pretty lukewarm about it. The location of the Pegasus's eye and the Giant's funky tube legs bug me every time. Minor quibbles about a good game.

Doesn't rate more than an 8 for the simple reason that as good as it is, good strategy can be shortcut with some lucky pegasi runs. It can also get a little tedious with repeated play or when you play through the whole deck in a single game.

Cute fun 2 player with a bit of strategy.  You need a table to play this one though, not great in a car/travel.  Not great for young ones.. even in another language, sexual language is kinda' easy to understand, although the pictures on the cards seemed ok and pretty.  Fun to play with a sig other.

RATING: N/A
Card game version of Stratigo. 

Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture his hostage card from his hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of his actions during his turn.

RATING: 8
It took a few plays to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of many of the cards, and we're still changing strategies as we go.  It's enjoyable how the game changes from "what would be the best card to place here?" to "what does she think I'm going to place here?" to "what card would be the best to place here, because she knows this would be the best one to place, and wouldn't think I'd actually do it?"  Games can sometimes be lopsided, however, depending on the initial draws.

I've only read the rules, but I'm not hopeful about this. We didn't like LotR: The Confrontation, and I don't think we'd like this either.

This game is ok, I just don't like the victory condition that is common : the lack of action points at the end. To me it doesn't me sense that it is beneficial to have less than 3 action points per turn because you will end up with more things to do than your opponent (and he will lose because of that).
I know it's promoting attacking but it's also promoting things that are supposed to be a bad thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An outstanding 2-player card game that plays with the speed of a filler game but has meat to the interaction and tactics. A great tension factor is that games can end quickly or go down to the bitter end when a player wins because the other player is out of actions to take. Thus, each player must balance between the need to conserve actions and the need to conduct an offensive and organize a defense.

I found the rules complicated as I felt the need to keep looking at the roles of the characters on the player guide. My rule is that I don't teach someone to play a game with me until I fully comprehend it. They should have printed the roles on the cards itself - it would have made life easier. Maybe I should sleeve this and tuck a paper inside listing the card's role. As such, I have not played the game, but my first impression isn't too good!

Received in Feb 2014 UK MT for Al Cabohne. An interesting 2 player dueling game. This is a lot of fun as you hunt down the card you need to kill.

First play last night and I'm on the fence about it.  It plays like stratego with cards with some greek mythology mixed in.  I want to like it but it kind of leaves me with a "meh" feeling.  I'll give it another try.

UPDATE:  After a few plays, the game is actually pretty fun.  Gets tense at some moments.  There is a learning curve at first because there's so much to learn about the cards and all the different things you can do.  Once you get past that though there is some good strategy gaming to be had here.

This is another card game that seems way too busy for us. In particular, there are too many interactions between cards and special cases - it is very hard to remember how they all work. Most of all, neither of us likes card games with a "steal cards from your neighbor" theme. It makes it too easy to win or lose on a random play. Overall, the game just didn't grab us.

Hmmm - clearly potential for a 9 or even a 10, but due to the complex card interactions and winning conditions there's no way to enjoy the first games, no matter how carefully you read the rules. And that's just bad, especially with dozens of readily enjoyable games on our shelves. Maybe a reduced deck could provide a better entry point (see my proposals below). Played 5 times.

The first few times we played, the game was over in about 4 or 5 turns. Once we got the hang of the Pegasus cards, the games got longer and more challenging. This game is growing on me over time. It has more depth and strategy  than at first blush.

A card version of Stratego, but yet so much more than that.  There is a subtlety to this game and a meta to the game that develops after many plays.  It is still good to play new and with new people, but it really gains a lot of its flavor when you are playing an opponent for the umpteenth time and both of you understand the ploys, strategies and counterstrategies, and overall flow of the game.

Interesting two player stratego-ish card game. One of the more intersting of the Kosmos line. Nice theme, nice match of beautiful artwork to the game mechanics.

Balances nicely between light and heavy. Seems a bit convoluted at first but is actually not all that difficult. I do have one gripe, and that is that the victory condition of uncovering your opponents captive occurs hardly ever, and wasn't that supposed to be the core of the game? I still like the game though, since the destroy-all-your-opponents-cards-on-the-board condition is cool. Rating could go down with increased plays though, if my gripes with the game take the fun away....
It should be noted that like many cardgames an attempt was made for language-independability, resulting in no explanatory text on any cards, making you referring constantly to the needlessly long-winded player aid during the first number of plays. Bleh.

Play character cards along columns. Dominate enough columns to win, use a pegasus to randomly draw the sole hostage card from your opponent&#039;s hand or have the opponent run out of cards (aided by using Zeus).  It&#039;s not a clean game, otherwise, rating would be higher.

What bothers me most is not the fact that it's a poor man's version of Stratego, rather the fact that the rule booklet has to be conferred to too many times for such a filler game. Not as clever as I would hope. For a better Kosmos 2-player game see Medici vs. Strozzi

Game that is easier to learn how to play than what the rules make it seem. A bit of memory and a bit of Stratego.  As a 2-player game it doesn't see the light of day that often but I won't turn down a game.  The mythology theme is very appealing to me.

Update:  However, I think when the players are more familiarized with the game, it starts to slow down and other factors lead better to victory than wits (such as luck of the draw, or accidental winning conditions like Pandora).

Update 2: Sadly for this game, there's many good 2-player games out there right now, and for the bluffing parts and hidden traps, Android Netrunner does it better, even if you must deckbuild.

I love the mechanics of this game. Its really clever and fun. but dear god are the cards ugly. I mean UuuUgly. Seriously, if this game was redone with an interesting fantasy theme, of which there are hundreds that would fit well - I would play it again and try and get friends to play it too. As its stands now the cards are too horrible to consider playing it again. Sorry. I would have given it a 7 but as I am so aesthetically sensitive it loses a whole point - 6.

RATING: 7
Nice, competitive, and tense two-player Stratego variant with cards.  Tough decisions and card interactions make this much more interesting than regular Stratego.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hera and Zeus is a card game gets often compared to Stratego because of the frequent duels between hidden forces and the "goal to be conquered" and to Netrunner because of the colour of the card backs and little more (cards are played out in a two-dimensional grid, if anything). It actually lies somewhere in between both in terms of depth, difficulty and fussiness: players have got to assimilate some information about their "mythological powers" before they master the game, but there are no collectible cards and the decks for both players are symmetric.

Even though Hera and Zeus has indeed got the same departure point as Stratego (players operating with hidden powers to reach an opponent's card), some additional ingredients lead it into a completely different direction: cards from a pile are drawn to build a limited hand, players only play them on a fixed grid, there are only face-offs between cards on the front lines of each grid and players have as many moves as columns they have in play. Thus, Hera and Zeus isn't as much about territorial attacks as about timing: when and how to attack or sacrifice cards, when and how to draw cards, how to avoid exhausting the deck.

The restricted grid and hands give the game enough agonizing decisions, the variety of the decks provides great replayability and there's both tactical and strategic play (in its loosest sense). Very recommendable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Even despite some obvious flaws like the Pandora card, this is portable, endlessly replayable, and fun. Mixing up your strategy is the key to keeping it alive: if you play the game too much like Stratego, you'll come a cropper.

Further Thoughts - the flaws are beginning to become a downer on this one. It's still a great game, but we feel like we've Pandoraed and Pegasused this one to death and find ourselves wishing for a different deck distribution.

RATING: 2
This game was a big disappointment.  We purchased it with great expectations; based on the reviews I read online.
Although I acknowledge the design is intricate - the interplay of all the cards is well thought-out and the art work is top-notch - the game play is a weak version of MtG.
Most frustrating is the fact that the 'powers' of each card on printed on a separate sheet.  You must constantly refer to this sheet during play.  And the fact that a 'lucky draw' can end the game is a SERIOUS FLAW in the game's design.

This one's ... okay. Pretty good actually, design-wise, but play always feels vague to me, like I can't tell if I'm making good decisions or just wasting time. I feel like the card texts are a little vague as well, like it's not clear when the right time is to use any of them. 

It's okay but I have sufficient choices in light 2p games that it never realy shows up.

Good choice for travel games.

RATING: 7
Repeat plays are likely to provide more satisfaction because you have a better idea of what you're doing. But I get annoyed by the lack of elegance - different names for the same card (Hero, Amazon), the 27 million ways to win, the exceptions (this card loses if this happens, but wins if this happens) and so on. I'm sure they're there to provide replayability, but I haven't got over the annoyance hurdle yet.

2-player Hand-Management Take-That Bluffing Game. This Richard Borg game is a pleasure to play. Clever and colorful 2-player Kosmos card game which takes about 30+ minutes. Interesting feel to this one; I love the mechanisms mixed with the Greek Mythological theme. I think the mix of tactics, strategy, and luck are even. Mild learning curve as you learn what your options are and feel out the strategies, but it's worth the light effort. Rulebook could be better.

I enjoy this game. My gaming wife does not.

Some players have said that this game reminds them of Stratego. Though I have never played Stratego, I have to believe that Hera and Zeus stands on its own.

The artwork is not great, and detracts from the gameplay.

Traded Aton for this one on the 26th Oct. 2007... It's a nice 2-player game from one of my favourite collections, the Kosmos 2-player series. It has good replay value and is challenging every time you play it. Since the starting layout is always determined by the player, the game is played always in slightly different ways. It is the sort of game that tends to improve with players used to play as opponents, this is always appreciated in my personal oppinion.

A friend gave this to me.  I've not played it much.  It's two player only, and I have better two player games.  Plus I'm not a big fan of two player games anyway.  Also the theme is not my favorite.  Hera and Zeus are fighting with each other and using a small boy and girl as pawns?  Ick.  I should probably trade this one to someone who will give it more love.

RATING: 7
This 2-player card game had a lot of similarities to Stratego, except without the long setup phase, and obviously with more randomness.  I did like the number-based combat system with hidden information, as well as the abilities of the various cards.  However, before your opponent's hostage came out, it was difficult to know what to work toward.  In fact, I'd say that the timing of when you draw your hostage has a huge effect on the game's outcome.

The more I play, the less thrilled I am. The alternate victory rules (i.e. besides capturing the hostage) keep coming into play. The word I have heard best to describe it is "anticlimactic."

Didn't enjoy this one.

Tried playing several times, each time it was just way too chaotic and.. stupid, to really bother warranting another try.  

It's a card game, kind of like 'war' but with a bit of 'stratego'.  Line up columns of gods and so forth to fight it out, each trying to capture the other's victory card.

It just ends too quickly.  Too random.  Just.. well.. not for me.  When it comes to 2-player games, I think I'd rather play  pretty much anything else in my collection.

Fun 2 player game that becomes better with more plays with the same opponent - as you try to out-think & bluff each other.

This game is too much like Magic: The Gathering for my taste.  I don't like card building when you have to really think about how the cards interact, plus your opponent is building a deck.  It's almost like drafting, but it can become one-sided very quickly.  Games like Dominion, while you are deck building, generally are not played against a person, while this game clearly is.

RATING: 6
I used to enjoy H&Z, a non-collectible version of Magic and Stratego. But along came Knizia's Confrontation. Both have similar play and card effects which gives a strong thematic feel. Now I find H&Z alittle longwinded when compared to Confrontation, which is more accessible and no initial rule confusions. Also H&Z, with the numerous cards, is very combative with the almost continual challenging of the front row of the playing field to reduce your opponent's options. This feels punch weary at times. With Confrontation there is the tactical necessity to spatially avoid conflict. The only aspect I can see where H&Z does it better is that games may be less anti-climatic. Also gets one rating point for providing a summary education on Greek mythology.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Plays almost like a light version of Netrunner in that you put cards face down like ice and then you face smash your cards against the other player's cards.  Also has the take a card at random from your opponent's hand and when they do it to you, you're hoping they don't take your victory card.  Having the opponent burn your Hades, Dionysus, or Persephone cards really stings.

I was really disappointed in the end game in the first game I played. I think it could be better if I wanted to spend more time with it - but frankly it hasn't grabbed my interest that much after a couple more plays.
It's much like Stratego with cards.

RATING: 5
Mechanics are simple enough, and there are some interesting choices to make in a game.  However, the win conditions are very luck influenced.  I won a game by drawing a card out of an opponent's hand after they set their side of the board up to eat my lunch.  Very much a fluke that is part of the rules.

RATING: 8
A clever game and something that is very different to anything else in my collection. I always enjoy the game and still feel like I have a lot to learn about its strategy - despite playing dozens of games. Several paths to victory keep the games interesting.

Not really as much like Stratego as everyone seems to claim, but a fine game in its own right.  There is an interesting rhythm in trying to manage your flow of action points to be effective without risking running out of things to do.  It is certainly in the ball park of Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation in that they are both good two player games involving bluff and confrontation.  The asymmetry of LoTR is fun, but it very often comes down to a 50:50 chance in the card play as Frodo crosses the mountains.  Hera and Zeus has less varied powers, but seems to offer more scope for different play styles. I avoided it for years because it seemed inelegant... it is inelegant, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun once you have trained an opponent. This is actually a great game: I've played it a lot now, and each time I want to play more.

RATING: 5
I would say that it is better than some of the other 2 player games I've played. It is quicker than Starship Catan -- seems really quick compared to that. There is luck due to the drawing of cards but it is highly balanced with the Pegasus cards and the feeling of being wounded.

RATING: 6
This is a game that would benefit from repeated plays   that were close temporarily as well.  The knowledge of what the characters do is critical to playing the game and a well versed player will enjoy the game more.  I realized that I probably would never play the game enough to get to that stage and traded it away.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

This game is okay.  Really nice theme and artwork however, the game seems to be missing something.  Has a Stratego like feel almost.  A bit like Blue Moon too but not near as good.     You can win this game by luck even if you are getting dominated by your opponent.  Not sure if this is good or bad.  this needs more plays i think

we r still constantly getting rules wrong and having to check things and the win conidtion of the other player running out of actions makes it a very unintuitive 'combat' game

This game is great. My girlfriend loves playing it, and she hates most games. For me I like the different ways of winning, the bluffing, and it's good balance of strategy and luck.
She likes it because it's not too strategy oriented, and the fact that you can win even if you start losing badly.
The game length is also a big reason why I rated this game a ten. At approximately 20 minutes a game, you can play a quick best of five tournament in under 2 hrs.
This is currently my favorite game.
One last thing. The price is unbelievable for it's value.

Why oh why aren't the actions written on the cards? So many people are turned off this game because they have to keep on referring to the card description sheet the first few times they play. It's a pity, because once you've learned what each card does off by heart, then, and only then, can you really start enjoying the game. A really fun game with bluffing and tactics - for me it's the best of the Kosmos 2 player series.

This is my favorite 2-player card game.  Yes, it was a little difficult to grasp at first, trying to figure out all the functions of the different cards.  But after months and months of playing(to the point of wearing out the cards and getting another set to replace it), I still love this game.  It's challenging and fun, and isn't that what you look for in a game?  The absolute best two player game for me.

This is a two player version of Stratego.  It can suffer a bit from run-away leader, as the more columns you have the more actions you get, meaning if the other player can knock you down to one column, you'll be struggling until you draw the proper cards, but it is a ton of fun.  2 out of 3 games is usually how I play.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating. "Hera and Zeus" pits the two Greek gods against each other in a mythological battle. Each player represents one of these gods, and attempts to either capture your opponent's "hostage" card, or by essentially forcing your opponent into having no moves left. While I like the bluffing aspects of the game, I'm not as fond of the action point structure. It forces you to play either aggressively, where you want a lot of action points and you have to find the hostage card before you exhaust your deck, or defensively, where you try to limit your action points (since you're required to use them), so your opponent winds up stuck with no actions and therefore loses. It's not intuitive, but I think I need to play more before I cast judgment. One big complaint is that they give you a cheat sheet describing the rules for numerous cards, rather than just printing the damn text on the cards.

Okay two-player game, very Stratego-like.  My rating for it probably suffers because I have another two-player Stratego-like game, "Lord Of The Rings: The Confrontation", which I like better, so that game gets pulled out more often than this one does.

If I recall correctly it's possible for one player to have a somewhat significant disadvantage if their "flag" card (Io or Argus) gets drawn much earlier than their opponent's.

OK, only a one play but unfortunately for me this was a disappointment.  Tainted, I realise, by the fact that my wife (who to date is the only one I've played it with) just couldn't stand it.  I'd like to give it another whirl or two to be proven wrong.  Until you've played it enough to know the abilities of each individual card, this game would flow a LOT smoother if the rules/abilities of the cards were actually written on them, instead of having refer to the summary cards.  A small gripe, I know, but there ya go.  I reckon once you know the cards abilities it should be pretty good.

The artwork is cool.

Ended up trading it in a maths trade as I didn't think I'd be able to cajole my wife to play again.

Card, Hand Management, Hidden Deployment. This is a slightly more sophisticated cousin to Lord of the Rings: Confrontation. Smooth gameplay, Stratego-like conflict, but with a huge dose of card/hand management thrown on top. Played twice so far and both games were fun and sometimes quite tense. This game seems underrated to me.

Update: still enjoying this. Might even bump the rating up one day.

RATING: 7
Hera and Zeus is one of the very best in Kosmos' 2 player line of games. My wife and I have played dozens of games, and enjoy the mechanics. The battle of gods theme works well. While I agree with the complaint that it would have been nice to print relevant text directly on the cards, this is a minor issue. Some of the mechanics here are Stratego-esque, and I mean that in a good way. There is a nice mix of strategy and psychology, many ways to win (lose!), and it's like those potato chips - you can't have just one (we always play at least two in a row).

We sometimes compare this game to Battleline, in the sense that they are two card games we enjoy with rather different play - H&Z introduces a powerful luck element in that you don't know when you will draw your hostage, and you sure as heck don't know when your opponent will draw hers. If you're not in the mood to allow luck of the draw such a powerful role in your game, you won't want to play H&Z. But if you want to shake things up a bit, this game is the perfect thing. Battleline, by contrast, plays in a more steady manner - you can generally plan a bit further ahead, and success is usually achieved via a strategy which is developed over a greater amount of time.

RATING: 7.991
I liked this game a lot. I didn't think I would as it looked like a collectible card game, and I've never played any CCGs. It's really easy. I never looked at the rule book once! About 90% of the information that you need to know is contained on a small information card. Apparently, the idea for this game came from an attempt to manufacture a Stratego card game. The unmovable Medusa card is essentially equivalent to the Bomb. It can only be killed by the second lowest card, the Hero or Amazon. It's interesting that the Zeus or Hera card/block can be killed off by the weakest card, the Pegasus. There are several of these cards making the Pegasus essentially equivalent to the Scout while in Stratego the strongest figure card can only be killed off by an attacking Spy. The Pegasus card can also be used to attack a card in the opposing player's hand. The Io/Argus (hostage) cards are essentially equivalent to the Flag, allowing a player another chance to win.

Fun enough game, but I can't ever see this becoming a favorite.  Tough learning curve, just in that you have to keep referencing the player aid every time you get that same card again.  The picking a card from you opponent's hand is obnoxious, and can give them a cheap win to boot.  

With that said, it does offer some tactical decisions, but I don't feel that "I won the game because I played well" emotion, but rather I got some good cards and made some choices that panned out with what choices the other guy made.  If you don't like bluffing avoid it.  Still I would play it again if asked.

Played once with wife. Dislikes:

(1) Rules were poorly written:
(a) Some rules were overly verbose, taking two long sentences to say what could be said in one simple fragment. (Like telling a player they can have a maximum of four cards per row.) 
(b) Other rules were vague. (How can the Zeus and Hera blocks come back into play? As an action?)
(c) Rulebook and player aid seem to be at odds with each other. 

(2) We wish the cards had had the capabilities of the characters printed right on them. 

(3) Strategy was not at all obvious. (And not in an intriguing way.)

I bought it as a gift for my sister a couple years ago and I finally got to try it!  Worth the wait too.  The first game or so it takes a while to become familiar with all the special cards, so it's a good game to have an experienced player teach you.  Sort of like Stratego with an imaginary board, except that you still have a hand of cards to use for reinforcements and special abilities.  One of my favorites of the Kosmos series.  Update:  ranks at or near my top five two-player games.

Those rules are a bit difficult to decipher in places and some cards are really tough to wrap your head around, but once you got passed that you get a neat 2-player card game. But I think the same way about food preparation: when I spent 2+ hours in the kitchen, I want a killer meal afterwards not just a good meal. This game is too difficult when figuring out the cards for what it does afterwards. 
Plus, I think you should only play this with someone at the same skill level as you or there is not much fun to be had.

I normally do not like direct conflict game, but this one is a game I can play with my husband a lot.  It could be because of the mythological theme or the variety of cards with special abilities.  I never liked playing Stratego, which this game is very similar to.  However, I quite like Hera and Zeus.  I'm glad its in our collection as it is a different type of game which we both like to play.

Some of the strategies for this game seem obvious, but then if you go with the obvious strategy there is an obvious counter-strategy (e.g., counter Medusas with Heroes), so there is more depth than meets the eye.  Haven't ended up playing this too much.

Relatively easy to learn, quick, with a little strategy and bluffing.  Great player interaction.  It only takes a 2 or 3 games to memorize all the different cards.  Fair amount of variety and fantasy flavor, much more interesting than the vanilla Stratego against which it is frequently compared.  Really enjoy how you can focus on one of three different strategies to win and being able to change that strategy as the game evolves: (1) capture the hostage, (2) destroy all your opponents cards, or (3) be highly defensive and outlast him (have him run out of cards to play).  Since most of the battles are just high number wins, it doesn't feel mean or "take that" at all.  Solid game.  I've played this roughly 20 times and enjoy it every time.

RATING: 7
After feeling somewhat *meh* about some of the 2-player games we have picked up (despite good initial reactions that quickly diminished with further play), I was skeptical about how we would feel about this. While it will still take a few more plays to know for sure, I think that the fact that I lost (only later to realize that I misunderstood a placement rule which would have led to different strategic decisions on my part) but still had a good time loosing is a good start. Unlike when I lose at [thing=4529][/thing] or [thing=986][/thing] (where it feels artificially limiting and restrictive), my plays with Hera and Zeus felt truly my own and so any failures were also my own, not from some arbitrary restriction. Going to give this one a few more rounds to see if the tension it does create remains or if we both just fall into some predictable patterns rendering the game more dull than the first time out.

I find most of the game interesting, with the blind combat of all the gods, and the setting up of your ranks.  

However, I am not a big fan of the ending, and how it seems to come down to who isn't able to take all their actions, rather than who beats the other guys army or takes back their hostage.

In the end, I feel this has a lot of similarities with Lord of the Rings the Confrontation, and they are in the same box size, so I ultimately got rid of this one and kept the other one.

Played a few times with the wife. The game plays OK, but there are a few too obvious shortcuts. A sure way to win for both of us was to use Pythia on the opponent's hand fishing for Io/Argus, then kill it with a Pegasus. Handy Persephone and Hades helped keep the supply of Pegasi and the Pythia card.

RATING: 3
Hera & Zeus may be the most rulesy of the Kosmos 2P games.  At at its core is a dynamic variant of Stratego. Once your flag has revealed itself to you, you can  hide it in your hand or on a 12 card matrix.  The concept is great.  But the card interactions are labryinthine with no supporting card text, rendering the game almost unplayable for casual gamers.

Decent game, but not my cup of tea. Chaotic. It's really annoying to reference a sheet of paper to find out what the cards do. Why didn't they just print the text on the cards? There's no way I'd reach for this game if Lost Cities or Odin's Ravens were on the same shelf. UPON FURTHER PLAYING - Much more fun than I first gave it credit for. Entirely based upon luck. Feels like a card game version of Stratego mixed with War.

Neat fun game.  First time I played my prisoner was the last card of the draw deck.  I somehow think I'm missing soem of the magic.

It does get better with another play.  More of playing the opponenet vs. playing the system does make this a delight.  Could get bumped up with more experience.

Its a solid 8.  Nothing amazing, but very enjoyable.  Probably best when played with a similar opponent.  It really adds to the bluff and double think aspect of the game.  Fun.  

Actually the more I play it the more I like it.  It has a nice balance between luck and skill, to make this an easy to game to find opponents for an enjoyable game.

A really clever and under rated game IMHO. True is a card game, and Mr.Luck plays an important role...but you have lots of opportunities for skillful play in this game. You have many strategic and tactical choices every turn, bluffing is important as well, you can control endgame, nice theme, several paths of victory, fun, all in 30-40 min. This is a 'must have' if you like stratego and a strong recommendation for couples.

When I read the rules, I had my doubts, but it's much deeper than it first seems.  Granted, some of the combat is determined more by luck than skill, but the game is entertaining enough to play more than once.  Excellent for travel.  My only major quibble is with the cards themselves.  The artwork is bad, and the text to figure out what the cards do is on a couple of player aids that come with the game, not on the cards themselves.  Argh!  I used to have trouble teaching this one until some friendly soul here on the Geek pointed out that this is analagous to "[gameid=1917]: The Card Game," and suddenly, it's much easier for everyone to grasp.

Interesting... seems like you need to play it a bunch of times to really "get it", and feel like you actually had a strategy. If you like Stratego then I'd say this is worth checking out, but otherwise there are just so many two-player games out there I can't see this one standing out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
So, it's kind of like Stratego: The Card Game, enough so that the game is marketed as a game about battles and bluffing.  This is fine, and the game does have that sort of characteristic, but few games ever end with one player beating the other in battle.  Instead, games tend to end with one player running out of cards in her draw stack, making the ending disappointing and anti-climactic.  I'm at odds, because the game seems pretty interesting, it's just not suited to the way the game is advertised.  I'm unlikely to play this again, though, given the multitude of other 2-player games out there that I DO like.

RATING: N/A
Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture his hostage card from his hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of his actions during his turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Stratego, just with more special cards that have specific powers.  The 'Achilles' heel' feature of the hostage cards is quite neat.  Once you pick up your hostage card, you have to find a safe place for it!  In your hand or on the field, it's vulnerable to a certain extent, especially if your opponent knows it's location.

Didn't really care for my first play because when I first heard about this, it was described to me as "basically Stratego: The Card Game". While the mechanics are similar, it plays much differently, and playing it like Stratego will probably lead to an anti-climactic ending. A nice filler with some interesting decisions, and one that is almost always moderately tense (something few games I've played in its time class have achieved for me, and certainly not card games). The biggest downside for me is that drawing your opponent's victory condition card late is much better for you than drawing it early (generally), and there's not a lot you can do about that.

ok game with blind mechanism, but it almost always goes down to the last cards which I believe is a little boring, unless a good amount of luck is a factor and game can end quickly. I wont recommend, but I wont not play if thats what a buddy wants to play...

Love this game.  Simple, self-contained card game that is easy to grasp, yet presents a surprisingly deep potential for strategy.  Loads of fun!

I think the game is intriguing and clever, but I'm not sure if I like it's core gameplay loop in terms of fun factor. Direct destruction of the other player's tableau and hand is not appealing to me. I thought I wanted to try it again but each time it gets passed over for something less directly confrontational.

Very fun 2 player card game - pitting Hera vs. Zeus.  It is similar to Stratego in the way that players have hidden forces.  This game plays fast, has more than one way to win, good for couples.

Been playing this a lot recently, and came here to up my rating. Then saw it was already an 8. Great game, lots of tension, lots of ways to play your cards.

A nice symmetric strategy card game with a fun Greek mythos theme. The play is quick, and you have plenty of opportunities for bluff.

I think this game (when you know how all the cards) is one of the best non-collectable card game available.

Was originally designed to be a Stratego card game, but it got a face lift and tummy tuck - all for the better - in this version.

Would score higher except for the auto-play Pegasus cards.

My wife likes this one!  SCORE!!   
...maybe its because she always wins :p  

Play one game through and before its over you'll have all of the different card powers memorized...not difficult at all.  Great game!

This one has some good gameplay, but the &quot;win&quot; card sometimes comes out in the first few hands which can be a big letdown when you&#039;re all hyped up for some strategic play.

Gifted to crazedyeti.  I hope he enjoys it!!! Update: crazedyeti told me he hates the gifted game and also he would rather swim in hot lava than game regularly with me!  Thanks crazedyeti! ;)

And, he couldn't sell it so back it comes...

Edit: Never played the thing, so out it goes.

is it to your advantage to be winning? cause if you are, you are digging through the pile, all the while closer to revealing the card you must keep hidden. repetitive and fiddly.

Hera and Zeus is a good 2-player game.  One problem is that "success" in the game doesn't correlate to victory.  It feels like one player could be running away with the game, but then something bad could randomly happen to that player to make them lose.

RATING: 5
Seems poorly designed at times.  Shoots for LOTR Confrontation like gameplay but ends up being about who can get the more broken draw.  Besides how luck-based it is though, it's surprisingly fun, so it isn't a total waste.

Pretty good card game for 2-players. Kinda like a really simplified version of Magic: The Gathering with identical fixed size decks.

Interesting war variant. Actually reminds me ever so slightly of a card game version of the classic computer game Archon. Fun, light, fluffy, but there are better 2 player Kosmos games.

RATING: 8
Great game. Quite fun and I like the theme.  It doesn&#039;t get played as often as it should but I think that&#039;s due to the fact that there&#039;s a little more luck affecting the game than I&#039;d like.  Only so much strategy can be had with such random draws.  Good bluffing component though.

Nice cards. But, too many rules to remember!
Print this with the rules on the damn cards and I'd buy it again.

A quite fun 2-player game of bluff and reveal.  To me, a cross between Stratego and Netrunner (right down to the colors they used!)

Though the cards should have text on them, or at the least symbols, the game has clever card play, strategic choices, and some bluffing.

H&Z is pretty light fare for the modern, demanding board gamer.  Nevertheless, it's fast, has a nice feel and is good for playing with chicks.  In fact, more than one "carelessly" played IO has landed me a good rump rompin' afterwards.

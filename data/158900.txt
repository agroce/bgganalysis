I enjoy this game solitaire and with others.  It's a great little puzzle themed around a movie that I love.

It feels similar to Bauza's 'Ghost Stories', but with a lot less complexity.

A simple co-op puzzle with nice mechanics and great artwork/ components. The theme isn't really integrated though, so the game doesn't really lift off the table.

RATING: 5
Samurai Spirit is just kind of bland. The art is great, the components are great, the theme is great, but the actual game-play is.. meh. Fighting the villains is not actually exciting; you are just trying to add cards together to equal the right value (like in Blackjack). For me it was a disappointment.

At first I was sucked in by the gorgeous art, tiny box, and lower price, and then it became a must-have when I saw it was a players vs. game co-op. I'm relatively new to the world of tabletop gaming, but I've loved my experiences with Forbidden Desert & Island, BSG and Betrayal at House on the Hill in years past. Hungering to grow my co-op collection more, I compared this against Ghost Stories (same designer), and this won out because it was described as slightly less challenging than Ghost Stories and a lower price.

On the night of my first time with the game and some friends who were new to it, I managed their expectations and told them we would most likely lose the game(s), so if they liked, we could skip it and go to King of Tokyo instead (yeah, it was a Japanese-themed game night). But they were up to the challenge of Samurai Spirit.

This game has RULES. If you pick rules up quickly, bravo, but the 8-page rulebook of tiny text and a few YouTube videos still left me uncertain. Now with some games under my belt (all lost of course), I feel Samurai Spirit definitely is hard, but still pretty fun to play. The game board, ironically, is almost too small (I know I can't make up my mind on the size here), but the beautifully illustrated player tiles and fighter cards make up for that.

The game kind of falls flat in the thematic execution of samurai "fighting" waves of ever-more-tenacious enemies. In a turn, you either "fight" or "defend" against whatever enemy you draw from a deck, but it's not truly "combat." You just put a card on the right or left of your tile. Up to three enemies with symbols that match a house, doll or hat can go on the left ("defending"). You can place as many enemies as you like on the right ("fighting"), so long as the number values on their cards (1 - 6) don't add up to a value higher than what your samurai can "handle" (each samurai has a max of 8 - 14 points). The round finishes, and you remove the cards from your tile and shuffle them up for a new round. That's combat? You have to really use your imagination to think that.

So the gameplay mechanics are mathematical and abstract, cool details like activating beast mode or burning fences and houses down aside. You're encouraged to count cards and talk with teammates to surmise the best time to use special talents that manipulate drawn cards... but ultimately the odds (and the luck of the draw) are against you. It feels like a fun group puzzle, though, and the speediness with which you can be defeated encourages you to give one more try.

Positives
- Small size and price
- Beautiful art
- Cool concept
- Quick playing time
- True challenge

Negatives
- "Fighting" concept falls flat
- Odds and luck are stacked against you
- Decisions are usually choosing the lesser of two evils until someone is exhausted or you lose the game

RATING: 7
Tough coop.  Some samurais seem better with a certain number of players, but there's nothing preventing you from playing with all samurais, even with less than 7 people.  I normally hover around 4-5 samurais per game.  Tougher than it looks to hit the magical kiai number without going over, and damn those Families!  Not a lot of family defense cards in the game, so you better hope that they're picked by samurais that haven't defended a family yet in that night!

Wont ever play again. 
One of the worst "games" I've ever played. Boring to all hell. It basically consists of drawing raider cards from a single stack and deciding whether or not you want to put it to the left or right of your character card. You decide this based on what symbol it has printed and what the value of the card is. Will it attack the village? Will it hurt you personally? Does it have a symbol that you need arbitrarily so that the end phase doesnt do something "bad" to the village? Then put it to the left or right.
That's it.
Repeat this process 3 rounds through the raider deck (adding in bosses in later rounds) or until the village is destroyed.
At no point did I ever feel like a Samurai fighting Raiders nor like we were defending a village. We were looking at dumb symbols and trying to match the enemy numbers to our single "Kiai" number.

The only time you get to "attack" is if you manage to draw cards equal to your "Kiai" value and in this case you remove a single card from your stack of enemies you are "confronting". Dumb as HELL.

All the time and effort was put into the Beautiful Art (which baited and switched me). The mechanics are shallow, terrible and near pointless. There are so many other games where-in I could actually be having fun with rather than this bore-fest.

Cute little game, easy to learn and lots of fun. It may be a "glorified version of black jack" as a friend described it, but it was still a fun experience and we ended up playing two games in a row just because we did not manage to win the first one. The graphics and artwork stand out and they integrate perfectly in the theme and even the game play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I can see why people might like this one but for me it's an absolute stinker. It's everything bad about a co-op game rolled into one. The rules lead to one or two players in-the-know dominating the game. It's painfully dull, the powers are wonky and the theme is thin and utterly replaceable. There are better games to play in this time frame. It's ultimately boring, fiddly and illogical.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Clever, light, fun card game.  I don't know why it doesn't get much love.  I play it way more than Hanabi.  I guess people just can't bend the rules in Samurai Spirit the way they can with Hanabi (i.e. no amount of extra table talk is going to save your village).

It is a great game that comes in a small box and takes up little space. It can be taught easily and is ideal to be taken along on your travels for spontaneous gaming sessions with "new people". It also makes an excellent filler game. BUT: It is a wonderful game in its own right and by no means to be regarded a "just a little extra" to a gaming night. As an afterthought: Admirable artwork!

Fun little co-op game with an excellent theme, but ultimately falls prey to the issues with the vast majority of co-ops, dominant player effect.  

Pros:
Who doesn't like an homage to Kurosawa and his 7 Samurai, a cinema classic.
Fun transformation from normal human into animal spirit warrior. (I have to admit that I actually picked my character based on what his animal form was! :-D)
Tightly integrated theme that feels fun, despite it really being about just numbers and negative actions that can occur.

Cons:
Support characters (like the purple one who allows you to mulligan) can be a bit boring because all you do is lend your support to another person.  Yes, you still have to help with the overall strategy, but it doesn't feel quite as fun.

Most importantly, it isn't time based (Space Alert) and/or with incomplete information Hanabi, which is ultimately still a downer for a cooperative game.  It will face the dominant gamer effect, and new players will be "forced" to do whatever the more experienced player believes. 

Not something that I would regularly play, but it certainly hits and integrates the theme on the head and the is great for people who don't mind the dominant player risk in cooperative games.

--------------------------------------
Played twice at Gencon.  Similar to ghost stories, in that it was still difficult on easy mode.

Comparable Co-Op Game ratings:
Space Alert - 10
Mage Knight - 10 (has co-op play, just not quite the same)
Hanabi - 9
Sentinels - 5
Ygdrasil - 5

I guess this game gets just a notch over the other three co-op games I'm familiar with just because of the theme and the animal transformations :-D

RATING: 5
Found this a supremely hard-to-win co-op with decent theming, and abstract execution.  Note that I didn't say "difficult" - it wasn't hard to learn when taught to us, and the decisions didn't seem to be especially intricate.  I think the difficulty, provided we played it correctly, makes the game more appealing than it actually is in terms of mechanics and choice.  I'd still give it another whirl, but maybe I'd like to read the rules.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome game by Antoine Bauza, the spiritual successor to Ghost Stories, inspired by Seven Samurai. You play these various samurai, defending a village against bandits, and you each have individual powers and when damaged can shift into a desperate beast form which is even stronger. Not quite as amazing as Ghost Stories, but simpler and I did appreciate that despite the similarity in theme they play differently.

Samurai Spirit is an incredibly challenging game. I find it just as fun as Ghost Stories. The game is played like extreme black jack with teamwork. Every player gets powers and abilities to help resist the overwhelming powers of bandits and their leaders. I highly recommend this game even to play solo. So if you like black jack with gambling with villager's lives then this is the game for you.

Simple co-op that can be quite challenging especially at higher player counts.  The game can break at 2, unless extra steps are taken to ensure the game is okay prior to playing.  For this reason, I play with 3 samurai minimum.  The biggest draw of this game is the quick setup and play time.

My go to Solo game at the moment!

I haven't had a chance to play this game with a group of people, but I thoroughly enjoy playing this game solo!

Unlike many big box, co-op with solo variant, games, SS has very few finicky pieces that need moving every turn. Each turn usually just consists of draw a card and place it on the board where required. Low setup time, and random hero selection make me commonly play many games trying out all the combinations in one sitting.

I bought at BN 75% off sale. I'm a fan of the designer. Similar to Ghost Stories. I mostly play solo. I enjoy the art and theme. Nice game for a few players or solo and doesn't take up much table space. I prefer at the smaller player counts. The animal side of the samurai is a little unusual for the theme, but works in the game. I imagine this will get old fast, but a nice game to pass the time. Especially for those that enjoy games like solitaire.

A rather dry co-op game. We didn't feel the theme in this at all. It felt like a math exercise with some push your luck elements. Trying to trigger your super ability (Kiai) seems to be crucial. But it is sooooo hard to get to exactly your number to do so. We started to see the value later on in our defeat in the support action. Need to try again soon with more players. Our game was with 3.

REVISION 02/05/2015: I am upping my rating from 4 to 6. This actually works really well as a solitaire game. Take it from me, NEVER play with fewer than 3 Samurai, even if you have one player controlling multiple Samurai. 

Just know that the theme does not in any way fit with the mechanics. Once you get over the jarring nature of that, it's a good game. Not great, but good.

RATING: 6
This is a smaller coop game about playing cards at good times and trying to take just the right amount of damage to your characters each round. At first it seemed like an interesting puzzle of a game to figure out, but after two plays I noticed that it was one of those games where with perfect strategy and tactic, you can still lose simply because of the way the cards are dealt. While not as bad as hanabi in this aspect, it did sour me slightly. In this there are some different manipulation options at least to always give you a decent chance of figuring out a solution that works.

This is by no means a bad game, and I'd play it again without much convincing if someone else wanted to. I'm just not asking for it is all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
It appears this game really needs more than 2 players, as with 2 the game was pretty blah.  The theme does feel very pasted on, while the decisions seems mostly obvious.  Going to give this one a shot with more players, but so far this is no where near as good as Ghost Stories.

Update:
-----------------------
Ok, this one is better with more players.  Still feel like it doesn't offer enough choices, as you mostly seem to just go into combat each turn.  Does feel like Ghost Stories, but this one while tough, is not ghost stories tough.  This one also is much less interesting, so probably won't be exploring this one much more.

Who ranks this game low, seems not to have understood the possiblities on your turn. Sure there is not so much you can decide on, but when to do what and to be prepared for bad stuff Happening and still looking out to be able to Launch your Kiai effect... is a clever idea. As the game is cheap for what good components it offers, this is surely a keeper.

A really nice co-op game. Great theme and fun to play, not quite as frustratingly difficult as some other co-ops. I guess it doesn't have much reply value though, the setup is always the same and the difficulty levels don't add much.

The basic game (resembling Black Jack) actually seems quite boring, it's only with the addition of the Samurai abilities that offer the opportunity for clever combos. Figuring out how to use them is what this game is all about.

A fine game that leverages Blackjack's "hit me until I bust" mechanic with a very thin veil of theme.  The drama is inherent in the tension of the draw under dwindling options.

Everything works and the game is sufficiently difficult as a coop should be, but there is not a great deal of emotion here.  The soul of game clings ever so slightly to Kurosawa's seminal work and it wants you to think it's more thematic than it is.

Overall, the structure is very similar to other coops with nothing particularly new.

This one surprised me with its depth, tension and fun. Definitely a hard puzzle to master. Some comments accuse the game of randomness, but I disagree. Also, even if you lose, the game often features ecstatic stand-up-and-high-five moments that make the whole experience worthwhile.

EDIT: When inviting friends to play this, one might as well just say, "Come and die with me". Knowing when to withdraw from a round isn't necessarily intuitive, but is crucial for the sake of winning. New players are prone to be overly heroic and foolhardy, and heroes get killed. Nonetheless, I'd rather not have to quarterback my friends into retreating so they can watch the remaining players carry on making choices and having fun. For this reason, I enjoy Samurai Spirit most as a solo game with all 7 samurai.

While I'm not blown away by this yet, it's very much a collaborative co-op that doesn't lend much to the alpha player issue. Other co-ops have mechanics that eliminate them as a concern, and I think mechanically can be better...

Still, it's short light and challenging. Eliminate the alpha player, and you've got a pretty casual game on your hands.

Fun, easy and quick coop. Push your luck, special abilities (and talents, and penalties and more...), and great component quality. Nothing special, but a keeper for the moment.

---

Update: after repeat plays, it just doesn't hold up. The special abilities become boring, the strategies apparent, and the interest for the game wanes. With 6-7 players decisions probably get more interesting due to the multiplicity of powers, but any alpha player will destroy this game for everyone else.. Very situational at best.

Far too often can you get a deck that will be impossible to win with when you play with more than 3 characters. The randomness of the deck kills it. When you can play over and over and over and even cheat with a deck and still lose, besides the problem with not enough dolls heads cards, it shows a broken game.

RATING: 6
Seems that there isn't much in the way of meaningful choices, but knowing what's in the decks should allow for some tactics. The decisions may feel a bit fiddly (you can't really think in terms of broad strokes since you have to occupy your mind with card-counting and numbers), but in the end this is another game of risk-reward optimisation. Highly recommended not to play with more than five players.

Imaginez ... vous êtes chez vous. au coin du feu. Et d'un coup, vous avez plein de lutins qui assaillent votre maison, tentent de brûler votre sapin, ou piller vos cadeaux. Ensemble, il vous faut lutter contre cette ignominie. Samouraï spirit, c'est un peu pareil, sauf qu'on remplace les lutins par des brigands ninja, et votre salon par un village de paysans. Et vous, un samouraï. Dans ce jeu coopératif, tentez de contrer les attaques en combattant, défendant le village avec votre super pouvoir animal. Pour avoir une idée plus précise du jeu, je vous encourage à regarder le film "Les 7 samouraïs", chef d’œuvre cinématographique de 1954 (de Akira Kurosawa), plutôt qu’une énième fois la rediff du père noël est une ordure. Tiens, ce jeu est jusqu’à 7 joueurs... coïncidence ?

A simple cooperative card game that plays relatively quickly. You don't feel like you're combating anything so much as gathering a set of cards. The cooperative element of working together is rather small with the support action.

Feels like filler level decision making when it comes to your turn especially since you don't have much of a clue in terms of who you will be drawing.

Nice art and components, but Ghost Stories is a deeper game even with its dice element.

Can play a large party but you don't gain anything from more players except length.

This fixes Ghost Stories for me. It's also repetitive, but it's shorter and gives less sense of 'there's nothing I could have done anyway'.

Might actually be knocking on the door of Forbidden Desert for my favorite pure co-op.  Very fun theme, and pretty easy to teach.  Very difficult, but with good planning (and samurai placement) it's beatable with some luck.  I'v played with 4, 5, 6 and 7 players and it was popular with everyone when it was played.  Love that it supports that many players (game does get considerably harder at 5+ players) vs Forbidden Desert which only supports 5 max.

Fun little co-op with beautiful artwork and quality components that works well with 2. It's simple but not easy, because you are depending on the luck of the draw to defend or combat. It plays quickly so you can fit a game in in under 30 mins. Despite all of the benefits it doesn't really fill a niche in the collection - 7 Ronin does a much better job of giving us that 7 Samurai feel (even though it is competitive) in the same 30 min time frame, and we like Ghost Stories better as a co-op.

RATING: 5
This is another coop from Antoine Bauza, the maker of Ghost Stories, and I found it relatively amusing. The theme is the iconic movie “7 Samurai”, and your goal is to protect the village from marauders. Each turn you draw a card (marauder) and decide where to play it to your tableau in one of two ways. This decision is mildly interesting at best. One of the ways is for the number on it, and if you can get enough numbers to add up to your special number, you activate your special power which is usually just to discard cards from the deck. Since the goal is to get through the deck three times, that’s a good thing. It’s cute, and for an end of night thing, I’d play it. 

Update: After one play, whatever charm it had has worn off. Then again, it may be a function of playing with 7 people. I was able to prepare a decision on what I’d do before my turn came around (depending on what card I got) and then execute in a few seconds whereas others would linger on their turn. 

Games like this can skate by if people move quickly, but when decisions take much longer than their relative depth in any large game, the proceedings end up feeling clunky. As a result, I had a lot of time to disengage from the proceedings. The cooperative element of lending support is there, but too weak to bind the table together, at least for that player count.

Brutally hard game, could only win on Beginner level after 7 lost games on Normal level (though we came close 3x in them, one even just losing by the penultimate infiltrant card showing flames, burning down the last farm still standing).

It's this brutal since it's so easy to suffer a stroke of bad luck. If for instance :
* one of your samurai on his animal side has a card showing losing a hit point as penalty and you draw a new card with the same penalty, there's not too much you can do anymore
* another possiblity is one of your samurai already suffered 3 hit points and wasn't able yet to attach a card to his hat defensive position, you better do something about it fast, but the occasion might just never come
* always keep an eye on your families as well, as it's so easy to lose all 3 of them and thus losing the game
* you can also burn through these barricades & farms so easily, and then I didn't even try the harder levels
* and whether you reach your special kiai powers or not, is often down to some luck as well, especially in the last round, with so many lieutenants & bosses around

That said, I like the tough challenge so far. One day, the game will get beaten on level Normal and victory will taste so sweet ! :-]

I like the components and the packaging, and as a game, it was bought mainly as a solo expereince. But my one game felt very procedural, very difficult to imagine ever winning, a tad too much at the luck of the draw, and basically not fun. The theme also does not greatly resonant with the mechanic, and to be honest, I don't think I would inflict this on the gaming group. So, a bit disappointing, and it will be gone (Rating: 4.635, Aug 16). UPDATE: Gone (Jan 17).

2014 : Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.

After 1 play, I'm undecided how much I like this game. It's a nice small footprint, and I didn't like the rules so well. Watching a play through helps a lot for this game. I need more tries playing it. I have to say initially though, I don't like this game much.

A lot of randomness. You can try to mitgate it, but not always can. Fun and engaging if you get into it: "please, please give me 3". Should be better (thus rating might go up) played multiplayer.

OK. Number of decisions is too low. And somehow the itself isn't enough challanging to keep me with it.

I don't think this game has terrible amounts of longevity, and the rules have been a real challenge (it's not a complicated game, the way the rulebook is written out just never makes sense when I need to reference something), but we've been having a lot of fun with it recently. You could probably count cards in the bandit deck and make this a very math based spreadsheet experience, but we don't pull this out when we're looking to take something that seriously so usually we end up just playing what feels right. Very pretty, like the theme, builds stress well as the challenge increases while still feeling manageable. 

edit: This was probably my favorite co-op before I played Spirit Island.

RATING: 8.5
Really enjoyed it, great game in a small box. Nice theme + coop puzzle solving are the key points for me. It keeps the tension during the whole game and it makes people talk to each other in other to support and find the better solution for this puzzle. Haven't tried yet the solo mode though. It looks enjoyable but for me the main strength is the interaction with some other player who likes as well theme and coops.

To improve, for me, some art design and main board size but not a must do. I understand it keeps the game design simple, small and not expensive. 

Would recommend it if you like Japanese culture and coop games.

Heten, mint a …
Úgy néz ki a tervező nem adta fel a távol-kelti kultúra iránti vonzalmát, így új játéka egy könnyített Ghost Stories csak kung-fu szerzetesek helyett itt szamurájbőrbe bújt állatszellemek játsszák a főszerepet. Cél a kis falu (szó szerint kicsi) megvédése a 3 hullámban támadó rosszarcúak ellen. A szabályok egyszerűek, azonban minden részletre figyelni kell a képességekkel, akciókkal kapcsolatban, mert az ördög itt is a részletekben bújik meg. Ha túléltük a támadási hullámokat és legalább egy család és egy ház megúszta az őrjöngést, nyertünk. Akcióink végrehajtása során küzdhetünk felhasználva speciális képességeinket, védekezhetünk, segíthetünk társainknak vagy egyszerűen passzolhatunk (megjegyzem, hogy egy-egy jól kiválasztott passzolásnak hatalmas ereje lehet, érdemes ezt is okosan használni). Ha szerencsések vagyunk, még kiai erőnket is használhatjuk. Egyes szamurájok megítélésem szerint erősebbre sikerültek (számomra leghasznosabbnak tűnt a felhúzott kártyát eldobó 2 szamuráj – egyikük simán, de húz másikat, a másik eldobhatja, ha már van olyan ellenfele), azonban a játékban az érkező támadókon nagyon sok múlik (itt lép be a már említett előd-játékból is megismert szerencse faktor). Talán elsőre nem érezhető, de helye van az előre tervezésnek ebben a játékban is. Mindenképpen mérlegelni kell a támadók okozta károkozás jellegét. Inkább égjen a falu vagy sérüljünk? Védekezzünk egy lappal vagy helyezzük a csatasorunkba? A túléléshez alapvető, hogy sérüléseket szerezzünk, így felszabadítva a bennünk rejlő állatszellemet, aki sokkal hatékonyabban képes az ellent aprítani.
Előnye, hogy egy játék aránylag gyorsan lezajlik, kevés a holtidő, állítható a nehézség (könnyűtől a hősképzőig), többszöri újrajátszás és a korábban említett egyszerű szabályok. Plusz, hogy magyar nyelven is elérhető.
A játéka külcsínben tetszetős, sőt kártyavédőzve is beleférnek a lapok. Ár/érték arányát túlzónak gondolom, de itt is sok függ attól, hogy mennyi élményt tud adni a birtokosának.
Nekem teszik! A témát kedvelőknek mindenképpen ajánlom kipróbálását!

Neat little coop game. a Hard one at it with adjustable difficulty. Some compare it to black jack but it only gets this comparison because if the value of cards added to unlock powers (or knock you out if you go too far).

The more I play this game, the more I appreciate it and starts to see the small things that makes differences. It's a hard game but I would not take my coop games any different. Coop games needs to be challenging to be fun.

This is a cooperative game. If you don't like co-op than you shouldn't buy it. I happen to lie cooperative games and this one has some depth, but it is easy enough for my children to play it with me. When I played it with my game group they enjoyed it and it led to some long discussions about strategy. There is some luck involved but in the end, if you want to save the village, you need to work together and make some interesting choices. A few of the rules seemed difficult to grasp at first, but once you play it a few times, it is easy. I would recommend it as a good party game.

Basically the base game of ghost stories with hoodlums instead of ghosts.

A very good co-op game that is tough as nails. In order to protect the innocent villagers from pillaging bandits, a group of brave ronin must use all their skills they can muster and work together to make it happen. It's not going to be easy. Perhaps the nicest thing about this game is how it feels so epic and huge and yet it's so small, plays simply and has relatively small number of components (mainly cards and a few tokens). This kind of game could easily have a huge game-board and a lots of miniatures, but this game does it differently. But even with smaller scale, the game is epic and it's hard. You won't probably get through it alive at your first try. Game isn't unfair though. It just forces you to fully utilize all the different and useful special powers of the different samurai characters of the game. There's also a genius game-mechanic that lets you loan your power to the one player left or right. I believe that in order to truly shine in this game, that's a one thing you must master.

Samurai Spirit is in many ways a little sibling to Ghost Stories, with some advantages over the older game.

First off, it plays more quickly. Second, it is more possible to win, easier to control. Third, it is just less gruesome to look at. Fourth, the Seven Samurai theme underlying it is far more classic than the undead horror that is the basis of Ghost Storiez.

All of these are positives in my book.

At this point I don't have enough plays under my belt to appreciate all the subtleties that may be in this little co-op, but I definitely find it out appeals Bauza's earlier game for me.

Co-op game with pretty art. Cards are laid out a bit confusing. I don't know. I'd rather play The Grizzled. IIRC, you need to get rid of cards in this game like The Grizzled, and it essentially all sucks as far as what the cards are. However, The Grizzled is much more straight forward and has less components.

This was a very fun game to play and it plays very well solo. I've tried all the different samurai and all their abilities are useful in different was, although some of them were very close to being the same power(variations of the powers effecting odd vs. even numbered raiders). Some of the boards were a little bit warped coming out of the box and the samurai boards don't fit back into the insert very well, they have to squeeze in against the sides of the slot for them. I would love to see some form of small box expansion  that maybe adds new samurai. while playing solo I was able to play three games in about 2 hours although the first game I was still referencing the rulebook to make sure I was doing thing right. I loved playing this game it was simple to learn and plays very fast. The theme I love in this game and I'm sure I will be recommending to many, many people.

I like this co-op game.  It's almost as challenging as The Grizzled, but a little more forgiving.  My only complaint is that icons on the game pieces aren't completely clear for what you are supposed to do, so you have to constantly refer to the rulebook.  

This isn't a criticism, but something to be aware of: It's also very susceptible to being dominated by an Alpha player.

Antoine Bauza knocks another one out of the park with this light, fast-and-easy-playing co-op that has a wonderful theme, challenging play, and is tough to figure out.

Finally got to play a group session of this. There are a few too many details to make it a truly replay hit, but we had a lot of fun pretending to be samurai. Sound effects help wash away all the stuff to remember.

Game provides great potential to flex those risk management muscles and discuss the best way to attack what might be coming next.  Also, what I didn't fully grok from the initial rules read-through was that you use the same subset of the deck in each of the 3 rounds, which allows you to adjust odds & learn your weaknesses for the mid and late game - this wound up being an interesting surprise.  Nice art, nice components / presentation.

This game shares many similarities with Ghost Stories. On the surface they both are seemingly random, but if you dig deeper you'll find there is some shrewd risk-reward management: do I take wounds to go into animal form quickly, but risk dying and tanking the game? Do I defend early on to make sure I get all 3 icons, but risk having to confront more threatening bandits later on? If I fight, there is a slight chance I might be overwhelmed, do I risk it or give my support token to have someone else take care of it, but then risk losing a barricade later? There is also card counting which I am luke warm about because it makes the game more strategic but makes the game less accessible for first time players and those with poor memory.

While initially you will want to fight every single turn, knowing when to support and when to even pass is extremely important. For example, if someone does not have one of each icon late in a round, a player with their icons filled might pass just to increase the number of cards the icon deficient player can draw, but this also increases the risk of other players exceeding their kiai value.

This game is pretty easy to teach (though again, the strategic depth is not visible immediately), and while in the higher player counts you will use a majority of the cards each game, where each samurai ability is located with respect to the others is very important and so there is variety in that manner. Unlike most games that play their max player count quite poorly *cough* 7 Wonders *cough* this game actually excels best at maximum number of players (although it seems a little bit harder to win with more players since the farms/families don't increase accordingly)because then more coordination is required between the powers and the passers can't just pass to everyone. On the flip side 3 is suboptimal, and 2 doesn't really work unless both players control 2 samurai (solo I would also recommend controlling at least 3 samurai).

My cons of the game are 1. Like Ghost Stories, despite the strategy sometimes you can just get really unlucky or lucky and 2. The lack of hidden information and incentive to card count lends itself to alpha player syndrome 3. Although you can't be eliminated permanently without the entire game ending it is possible that your best option is to pass midway through the deck, leaving you with nothing to do for a while

Awesome. Theme is great. Easy to teach and quick to play. Doesn't require a ton of table space, and fits neatly in its small box. Winning or losing seems to frequently be a matter of fate - one lucky (or un-lucky) card draw could spell victory or doom. Still tons of fun though, and MUCH faster than Ghost Stories (at the cost of tactical depth). Love it. ^_^

Samurai Spirit is a coop game making a nice callback to the Seven Samurai (1954) by Kurosawa. You and  your friends are a group of shape shifting samurai protecting a village from bandits. At its core, like you'd do in Pandemic or Ghost Stories, you're managing a deck of bad guys by using various actions either general or specific to your character. Unlike Pandemic or Ghost Stories, you'll be shuffling back in forth with the same cards for a while, which allow for more strategy in my honest opinion. 

Right off the bat, Samurai Spirit is a coop game, so it suffers from the typical one-or-two-experienced-player-take-over-the-game phenomenon that often occurs with cooperative. That aside, I feel the A.I. deck managing is much more dynamic and streamlined than it's Pandemic counterparts. You won't be putting any anonymous cubes on foreign cities, no; you're facing the damn bandits head on sword in hand. You have options, you're more active and you'll be handling these bandits rather than reacting to them. It's quick and funny, while being surprisingly strategic. 

Now, the big problem, I feel, with Samurai Spirit and most cooperative games including some sort of special power, is that some characters are inherently more passive than others. This means some players simply do less, which is maybe unavoidable in this context but might bore some people.

Rating based on solo play only.

Quite a puzzler... there are definitely push-your-luck (a la Blackjack) elements in this, but as you have a whole round of actions before penalties are applied and the next attacker is drawn, it mostly comes down to planning and creating synergizing combos, not pure luck... however, if you hate luck in games at all, you will hate this.

Nice and quick setup, and pretty fast to play.

Liked the theme, puzzle-like game play, and the artwork. The cooperative aspect is also very well done and works for a large group as well. The negative part of the game for me was that some mechanisms of the game are not intuitively connected to the theme, and are hard to justify them, and it's a pity and is in contrast with the such a heavily themed game.

A risk management game that is based on the movie Seven Samurai.  Reminds me of Blackjack, which I also enjoy playing.  I also like the samurai theme so this game combines 2 things I really like.  I also like a game where I can get immersed in the theme.  It's awesome to be a middle-aged samurai defending a village from evil bandits.

It also has a totally nonsensical but totally awesome mechanic that allows your samurai to transform into a beast if he sustains enough wounds.

Another hit by Antoine Bauza.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Can be played 1-player, but a bit underwhelming at that player count.  Seems like it would be more fun with more Samurai working together, though.

Part of the problem with the 1-player game is that you must control 2-3 Samurai, and if you go too fast, you could be confused about which characters' turn it is.  This is especially a problem when raider penalties add cards to other samurai.  Also, as I was learning in a 1-player game, I didn't find myself using the support abilities as much as I probably would in a multiplayer game.

Not the best Bauza game.. It's a great idea to make filler co-op, but it just isn't nearly as fun as Ghost Stories for example. Components and artwork are great usual and I appreciate the simple mechanics, but it's just pretty abstract and demands card counting if you want to do well. You can win with intuition but then it's mostly luck. I like it but it might actually be the worst game Bauza has made so far (I guess that's still pretty good if you compare it to other designers..). Shame, as I was really excited by the short playing time and interesting theme.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  Samurai Spirit is basically Ghost Stories: The Card Game. The theme is different, but the general concept is the same: good guys protecting a village from the continuous attacks by the bad guys. It's a numbers game really, but there is also a story in there too. You just have to make the effort to look for it.

The solo gamer plays a number of samurai (I feel four is best but does work well at all player counts) fighting enemies drawn from a deck of cards.  Each enemy has a number and maybe a symbol on it.  You have to decide where to assign each enemy card until you reach the end of the deck.  Depending on your decisions, either you will protect a specific part of the village, trigger a special action, and/or take damage.  If you lose any part of the village before the end of the third round, you lose.

This is an odd duck of a game for me. I like it. But I'm also frustrated by it somewhat. Half the time, I feel like I'm making no decisions whatsoever. The other half, I feel like each decision is leading directly to winning or losing. There is no in-between.  The game is about managing (keeping alive) your "resources:" barricades, farmhouses, and villagers. But by flipping one Farmhouse because of an enemy, I consistently lose three at once (out of six total). It's deflating.

It's an interesting game with very nice artwork and good production quality.  But something about it just feels "off" to me.

The theme is loosely like Ghost Stories: you are protecting a village from an invading horde of baddies.  But this game takes that concept and streamlines it to such an extreme that there is hardly any game left!  You turn over cards and see what happens.  The decision points in this game are few and simple.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun co-op game about trying to manipulate the numbered cards that you draw to get the right number but not over. Think Blackjack but with a samurai aesthetic.

The art is really beautiful but the theme doesn't really come through well. This could have been about any other genre and worked just as well.

RATING: 9
Toinito did it again! Granted, the decisions are so subtle that they may seem simplistic, but that is how to make the game fast enough, so it doesn't drag waiting for your turn even in 7 people.
I'd like to know, if the people who said "the decision were really random and obvious", in the reviews here, actually WON. It's not easy.

It really does matter when to support, which raiders to defend (instead of confront), even when to pass and drop out, to recognize you're more of a harm to the team now.
Apart from that, pretty action-packed illustrations, nice samurai meeples and the small size of the box was a pleasant surprise.

Samurai-blackjack that honors Kurosawa-movies. It is a decent co-op game but I enjoy it most as a solitaire. theme is near my heart and that is why Samurai spirit is a keeper.

Őőő.. Az első Bauza játék, ami után azt kérdeztem: ez meg mi??? Nagyon kevés döntési lehetőség, és attól nem lesz valami izgalmas, hogy brutál nehéz. Attól legyen kihívás egy játék, hogy a döntéseinknek súlya van. Itt nem igazán éreztem ezt. Egyértelmű, hogy a képességek egymásnak adásában van a lényeg, de ezt én elég kevésnek találom. Kaphat még esélyt, tapasztaltabb játékosok hátha megmutatják a szerethető részét.

This game has the same unrelenting feel as Ghost Stories. Personally, I am not keen on either game, as it feels like too much work to win and there is little fun to be had. Play centres on one card being revealed each turn and it is fairly obvious where you will place it, so little decision making or strategy here. Move along please.

I've heard it described as Seven Samurai themed blackjack. And they're totally right. 

I like the variable player powers but after winning a couple times it does not seem to be as interesting on the replay in comparison to Bauza's other co-op Ghost Stories.

RATING: 7
A co-operative game that draws on classic Samurai movies as the players must work together to protect a village from a gang of Bandits (Seven Samurai anyone). 

The artwork is evocative but the gameplay is really quite simple. For some it is too simple but I think the game has to be judged on what it sets out to be...a light co-op game with a backs-to-the-wall attitude. 

I quite like it but you have to be in the right mood.

Samurai Spirit is essentially a cooperative version of Blackjack. If you enjoy Blackjack and/or cooperative games, I think it's safe to say that you'll enjoy this one. But, like Blackjack, luck plays a huge role here. I've really enjoyed my plays of this, as I think it makes for a very interesting puzzle while not having apparent choices. It's more cooperative than it seems to be at first, and I think this game has a tremendous amount of depth to explore in terms of what is best to do in certain situations. One of the most underrated games of 2014.

Cooperativo simpatico dove non è facile avere la meglio sui predoni. Il gioco è un cooperativo che prende spunto dal film di Kurosawa I sette samurai ma con l'aggiunta di elementi fantasy. Semplice nelle meccaniche il gioco si impara in pochi minuti e soffre di una buona fetta di alea, il tutto però non è fastidioso essendo un gico dalla durata contenuta e comunque leggero. Splendidi come sempre i disegni.

[i]Another co-op that in the end falls flat for me. The game play is fun, but the theme is completely lost which is really the most disappointing aspect of the game for me. I don't know how you can take such an amazing premise (basing a game on 7 Samurai) and completely fail to take advantage of it. Everything in the game feels very dry and mechanical.

All that said the game functions fine, but if I am going to play a coop game I want to play something that is much more thematic and has some kind of narrative arc to it (I'm really interested in playing Robinson Crusoe)[/i].

Purchased new at Barnes & Noble, late December 2015. Being able to play solitaire is a big appeal, plus I love the story as depicted by Kurasawa.

Seems like a fun cooperative game that seems to be on the quick side of things. Fun game mechanic with the increased fighting capability of the samurai on their animal side!

After repeated play I find this a little boring now, it's too mechanical. The Samurais don't walk around any place, there is no armies invading the village etc. I think I'd have enjoyed this more as a proper board game rather than a card game with boards... gave it away in the European Chain of generosity.

Great artwork!

Feel like Ghost Stories but with all the complexities and rules ambiguities ironed out. Only thing I'm not convinced by is the necessity of the first round.

Random and simple co-op. We don't usually play those kind of games...
 You have to think about: 'how to solve this puzzle?, where I should put this card?, support or fight' ?  
Quite fast, not stupid, but it's very random game. Lack of theme, very dry.
 It's rather light euro-style puzzle-optimization game. Pick card and decide wher it should go. 
 There's no adventure inside if You're looking for it...

Excellent and difficult pure co-op from the designer of Ghost Stories. 

Pros: Plays up to 7, easy to teach, plays quickly, excellent artwork and components

Cons: Difficulty can increase or decrease somewhat depending on which characters are in play and where they are seated in relation to one another. Sometimes can feel like an exercise in randomness with little decision-making when taking the main "Fight" action.

It's so hard! I want to beat you!  

I did it.. I only played hard. I beat that. then I played heroic. I beat it. It happened! Barely did I win. but in 10+ plays I beat the game twice. It's all about balance and maximizing your chances to win. Because if you're taking a risk, it probably won't end well.

I feel this game has a lot of subtleties, but people are going to look past it. Card counting is a definite plus in this game. Just very light card counting. Remember how many of each symbol are in the game. Try to remember what the negative effects were. So you're careful with the abundant ones. Pass your ability tokens! Very important! Don't just draw a card and hope for the best.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While Ghost Stories (also by Bauza) leaves you feeling overwhelmed as things rapidly snowball, Samurai Spirit leaves you feeling like you have a sense of control, and rather than having things rapidly escalate, they get worse in a way that makes sense, and is somewhat manageable, but still challenging. Spending your turn giving someone else your ability for their turn can feel sorta anti-dramatic, you still feel involved, and while there is some amount of alpha committeeing, overall everyone contributes in their own way, and you can all be heroes. I wouldn't mind owning this game, despite the pro-furry agenda, and I hope to play it again soon.

The only major detraction this game suffers from is the standard issue, which is overwhelmingly common from French-designed games, that the characters are thoroughly nondiverse. The common argument is that this is due to thematic constraints, but making a game thematically based on a Japanese film, but featuring elements like shapehifting into animals, and nonJapanese animals at that, sorta pulls out the supports of that argument.

the theme is a desperate defense against heavy odds and the feeling of desperation as options shrink is certainly on point with that, but it's all sticks with no carrots. early round decisions don't feel meaningful whereas later decisions are so black and white, do or die that you're (often literally) just putting out fires. because the deck is face down there can be no planning which means turns are fast, obvious, and trade clever plays for luck. unless you house rule to show the top few cards the deck will play you, or worse: one person will call all the shots while the group watches.

:thumbsup: “Blackjack the co-op game”. The core of the game is derived from Blackjack, which makes it easy to explain to a wider array of players.
:thumbsup: The sense of ‘dread’ that comes from not knowing what’s in the deck really evokes the feeling of defending the village from an unknown horde of bandits. You get more familiar with your enemy after their first attack, but the stronger bad guys remain a mystery for the next.

----

:thumbsdown: Around the time of release, desiner Antoine Bauza claimed that this game is just as hard as Ghost Stories. It isn’t. And that’s actually not a bad thing, but making such a claim is.
:thumbsdown: Not as good with lower player counts. And though it’s possible to play this as a solo game, it’s not really fun. I like it best with 5-6 players. And it doesn’t slow down with such a large player count.

#99 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

When I first played this one, I admit that I was disappointed. I had no idea what to expect from the game - I just knew that Bauza designed it, so I wanted it! Obviously, that's where I went wrong. I think I just expected to be wowed and was left wanting. However, upon more plays, I accepted it for the light co-op puzzle that it is and quite like it. Also, we discovered that we were playing some rules wrong initially. Playing correctly always helps. This game is tough. I bet we lose just as much as we win. And it can be a bit random. I don't mind that so much though when it comes to co-ops.

This game feels very much like a simplified version of ghost stories. The premise of a village being threatened is similar. I thought this game would be worth keeping because it's not terribly complicated to teach. However, the randomness of the cards can make some games punishing and others a breeze. The only thing my wife hates more than me punishing her via gameplay is the rulebook doing it for me lol.

You have only a couple of attackers that you can set aside and your special power sometimes can hardly come into play at all, and often is at mercy of the luck of the draw. I'd like to play with 3 or 4 players to see if there is greater cooperation and more of a chance to win.

There are tons of things about this game I love.  The theme (I love Seven Samurai), the designer (Bauza is my one and only someone), and the mechanics.  It's just a little too light for me to get hyper excited about, but I will give it pretty frequent play as a filler, I think.

Although it played VERY different than what I wanted, this game really grew on me. It's longer than a filler and has almost enough strategy for one of the big games of the night. I find this to be a good game when you're not sure what to play. Usually it comes out when we go "well, we don't have a whole lot of time left, but I don't want to play a filler. Do you have a quick coop?"
Setup is quick, gameplay is fast too. The only major drawback is the more players you have the harder it is to teach the game.

First Impression:
A filler cooperative with a killer theme!

The basic combination of this game is really good for me. It's pretty, it's fun, it's short and it's cooperative.

Of course shortening a coop really brings down the depth, and where depth goes luck sips in to make things interesting or variable. There are interesting decisions to make in this game but overall there is also a great amount of luck. Which is quite tolerable in a game this short.

I kinda feel we've not really worked out how to really dig into this game. We lost every single time we played so far (around  times). It feels somehow both needlessly convoluted and too simple - I know how absurd that sounds.

RATING: 9
Fantastic cooperative game designed by Antoine Bauza (Ghost Stories) that is based on the famous movie, Seven Samurai.  A village is being threatened by bandits and up to seven warriors band together to defend the village and save the people.

The components are outstanding. Artwork is gorgeous, player boards and game components are thick cardboard.  There is some iconography that will have you referring to the rules for the first few plays.

Unlike Ghost Stories, this game does not beat you down from the first turn.  In fact, quite the opposite.  You see a complete path to victory right up to the point where you lose.   Multiple levels of difficulty keep you coming back for more.

Huge fun and very highly recommended.

About [thing=158900][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
In [thing=158900][/thing] is cooperative game in the tower defense type, in which players are samurais defending a village from villains. Yes, this is Seven Samurais - there is even seven samurais to pick from.

Wait! I will stop you right now to say: [thing=158900][/thing] has almost zero theme. The game is almost an abstract with art on the card, instead of just numbers and icons - and would completely work with just these two parts. Still, is easier to sell a game with a theme. So in no moment you will feel like actually fighting villains; and little of defending a village, mostly because you have the visual effect of seeing barricades and houses being taken out.

Notice that BGG is your friend in this matter, as it doesn't list the game as thematic. But for some reason I went on thinking it would be a little more thematic than it actually is. So, my bad. 

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players in ther turn either fight the villains or support other samurai. Support is simply to lend the unique ability of your character to be used by another player for one turn; but one villain passes and must be dealt in the Invaders phase, at the end of the round. Fight is what will happen most often and is divided in two ways:
- combat: you add the villain to the right of your samurai sheet and updates the battle value of the samurai - all samurais have a limit number, and if the number been faced by the samurai passes this limit, the samurai is out of the round. The goal of players is to reach the exact limit, in order to activate the Kiai, the special power of the samurai, and get rid of one of the villains he is currently fighting;
- defend: the villain is put in the left side of the sheet, besides one of the three icons - hat, house and family - the same icon must be on the villain card, and only one card can be put besides any of the icons.

The samurais will suffer from the attacks of the villains accordingly to the icon, if any, on the most recent villain added to the right side of the sheet.

The round will be over when all the villains have been dealt or when all players passed (usually because the samurai have fallen due to the number passed the battle limit). Then the samurai will take one damage if they don't put a card besides the hat icon; one house will be taken out for each samurai that didn't put a card besides the house icon; and one family will die for each family icon that haven't been covered by the samurais.

Afterwards, the remaining families in the village will give a hand, then the invaders (villains that passed by the samurais, usually by the support action) deck will be revealed and by each card with the fire icon a house will be taken out.

If there is still at least one family and one house remaining, a new round will start, with the addition of new villains, making more challenging to defend the village.

If after 3 rounds of attacks, there are still at least one house and one family remaining, the players have won!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
When to give support and when to fight. While fighting, if put the villain on the right (in order to reach the exact limit number) or on the left (to prevent losing things at the end of the round), considering that there can be more than three cards on left side, so is important to consider value of the villain, and also what will be the damage he will cause (as they attack at the start of the player's turn).

Most of the time the decisions are easy to be made, as they hinge on the unknown: you normally can't know which value of villain will come to you next, nor what problem he will cause to you. Therefore players juggle in that line of risk/reward, and the risk seldom pays off - so, for example, there is usually no reason to not put the first villain with a house icon on the left side, as there are no guarantees that another one with the same icon will appear again to you in that round.

To support is really the most difficult decision to make during play, as they can be key to save someone or something, still it lets one villain enter the village and be dealt at the end of the round, when there is nothing to be done about it, only hope is a card without the fire icon.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very good production value: the bits are well made, the art is gorgeous, the sheets for the samurais are made of sturdy cardboard, and everything comes inside a box of the precise size required, which is great;
- The rules are a little wonky to explain, but once the game starts, things are much easier to understand and the play flow is smooth, as one can expect from Bauza;
- The abilities of the samurais are neat and is very good that all seven of them are unique;
- Modes to increase difficulty;
- Little downtime;
- High replay value: not all samurais enter the game at once, nor all the villain lieutenants and bosses;
- Language independent;
- Quick playing time;

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Puzzly as a puzzle can be;
- Little theme built in the actual playing - it stays mostly in the art;
- Alpha player prone (though this is more on the people's fault than in the game's);
- Though a timely support action can be key, there isn't much cooperation in the game in some configurations (there are samurais whose abilities affect this more);
- Missed an opportunity to name one of the samurais as Kurosawa.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Almost not as samurais defending a village. You can't use terrain, call for challenges of honor, built proper defenses (the villains don't actually come from places, they just appear from the deck), do an unexpected sortie to fend off an incoming attack, no reinforcing of fragile places close to fall under the pressure of the attack, and basically anything truly related to defend a place. It is a math defense, and by the powers of ki-addition, you might be able to defeat the villains. However, you might be able to awaken your animal spirit and become a badass samuratician, adding pawns, beaks, claws to the villains faces. You will feel more like doing Sudoku with the printed number in the grid covered, so you don't know if you choose right or not until later.

Yes, this might sound harsh, but I actually liked [thing=158900][/thing]. I enjoy cooperative games, and this worked for me and my friends. Is easy to play, the decisions, while mostly based on luck, are there, the game is beautiful, and its puzzly nature can appeal to some. It has a briskly pace and, although the cooperation isn't super-high, it is there and in an important way.

While [thing=158900][/thing] isn't the winner it could be, it can be a good addition (hehe) to many collections, with is short playing time, easy rules, kickass theme and superb art. It will surely stay in mine.

RATING: 4
Highly random co-op and the central mechanisms of play don't seem to make thematic sense. I accept that the idea of a desperation move (get really close to dying without actually doing so) will make it seem sometimes like you want wounds (wounds is not the right word; that means something else, but I forget the right term here). But the primary decision players make is, upon drawing an enemy card, you either take the damage stated, or collect the card for its symbol in the corner (assuming you don't already have one of those). Wtf does that decision symbolize?

Though this could be labelled as Ghost Stories Lite, it manages to shake off the accusation by having some very interesting mechanics of its own.

starts as a very simple coop that mostly plays itself but soon realise that it's very hard to beat the latter rounds without making good decisions early on

[+] 1 turn = 1 decision, easy to teach, fast paced, great "animal form" system, most of the time the decision is easy but there are some interesting team moments when there are multiple bad options; the flow of the game is good, starts easy and ramps up fast; normal mode is hard (which is good for a coop); can't see myself winning the hard mode! beuatiful artwork! small box, yeah!
[-] subject to luck / unluck of the draw (both give bad impression of the game)

* first impression playing an easy game at Essen, it was too easy for a coop. I hope the normal/hard game will be better.

Picked up as an impulse at B&N. Been doing a lot of cooperatives lately and Antoine is a great designer. Was originally avoiding due to some of the criticisms...This is a fun, light (not too puzzley) cooperative that is easy to teach. I enjoy it if I do not want to think too much about my moves, optimizing each carefully...as such, sometimes the "choices" are obvious. There is some times a decision about providing support is interesting, but the game works best if you know that this is a light game. Not my favorite co-op, but I like having the variety depending on the mood I am in.

I want to like this, but it's not working for me so far. Just not enough interesting decisions, the scaling isn't great (the game gets noticeably better with more samurai in play), the front-loaded randomness with the two-player variant is dumb, and the randomness in general is pretty high. But I'll persist for a while, as I usually like Bauza. But this is clearly not at the same level as Ghost Stories.

Provisional rating after first game. Nice little co-op with a number of decisions and a bit of push your luck. Seems better than I expected.

Pros:

- Components very nice
- Plays up to 7 players!

Cons:
- A fair amount of iconography to learn, could do with player reference sheets.
- 1 & 2 player game has to use a couple of rule variations to make it play properly and these make it a little fiddlier. 
- Not sure the theme is particularly family friendly!

Awesome CO-OP game.  I love the idea of either adding the number to your battle line or adding it to your defense and its just such an interesting concept.  It gives me the feeling of a tower defense game but with a Japanese theme.  Plus it literally has a BEAST mode and it makes that game even better when it unlocks new powers.  plus it adds another layer of strategy deciding when to go beast mode.  I also like that you have to decide do I need this number to bounce out my battle line or should I add it to my defense? You can't forget about defense because whatever is not defended at the end of the round causes a reaction.

I like a challenging, thematic co-op. Trouble is, there aren't a whole lot of co-ops that competently and cleanly support more than about 4 players. If they do, they're often longer affairs or have some element of semi-cooperation or a hidden traitor (not that I don't love hidden traitor games, because I do).

As in the classic film The Seven Samurai, yours is a band of noble samurai who must defend a village from the heartless bandits who are trying to tear it down. Each samurai has a special ability to help them deal with the enemy, but no one warrior alone can stop the threat. It is through teamwork and chaining their abilities together that they will prevail.

Samurai Spirit is a very clean, very densely-packed design that has all the right elements for excellence. The rules are quite simple really. On your turn, you have 3 choices: Fight a Bandit, Support a Samurai or Pass. Each choice, however, must be weighed carefully. See, there's a deck of cards representing the bandits and you'll have to deal with the entire deck one way or another before the round is over. You can take on the bandits directly but each one you fight will sap your samurai's strength. Confront too many and you risk being overwhelmed. Instead of fighting, you can support your fellow samurai by lending them your powers but doing so means you must let another bandit slip through the villages defenses. Every bandit that slips through has a chance to burn a part of the village, so ignore them at your peril.

But all is not lost. As mentioned earlier, you each have a special power that helps you turn aside the invaders. Within each samurai also dwells their ferocious animal spirit which, when unleashed, makes your samurai even more formidable.

This game is very easy to teach and highly accessible, especially since it is so flexible on player count. I personally think you want at least 4 samurai. The fewer you have, the less flexibility your team has. There are also various difficulty settings...and you'll need them, as even at the "Normal" difficulty, your limits with be seriously tested. But it is a game that manages to pack such a high quantity of decision-making into such a compact design and that is the kind of game that I love.

The components are the best thing about this game. There are few truly difficult decisions to make--often the player doesn't have any real choice at all. Still, it's an entertaining theme for a filler, and I'm always glad to have a cooperative game to pull out for my friends.

Co-op game in the spirit of Seven Samurai to protect the village and families from bandits. This is dynamic interactive puzzle of tradeoff, risk-reward, sacrifice, and acceptable losses in an intricate mechanism of balance. Yikes! And, it has a simple and very effective difficulty level system when you get bored with Romper Room level and are ready to go to Ludricous.

Alas, I love the challenge this game brings, but my game group doesn't feel it...Chickens.

This game is all right as a filler game once (maybe twice a year) but honestly its lack of depth makes you get tired of it really fast.

Beast modes are a nice extra that doesn't quite make sense in the game but maintains a high fun-factor IMO.

This game delivers a fresh feeling cooperative experience while feeling different from Pandemic/Forbidden Island/Desert. Well implemented feeling of protecting a village, extremely streamlined game play- Attack, Defend, or Support. I have not played Ghost Stories, but have heard this is a simplified version of that. I will always be Gorbei, being immune to two, four, and six is just too good.

Neat little co-op game. Feels like Ghost Stories(Same designer) but not as good

RATING: 6.2
Kicsit talán többet vártam, de ez gyk. egy gyönyörű szép köntösbe bújtatott pasziánsz. Ezért kicsit fel is pontozom a játékot, hiszen a körítés (japán falu és szamurájok) egyértelműen nagyon tetszik. Rövidsége is mellette szól, egyértelműen filler kategória, annak viszont tökéletes lehet, ha érdekel a téma és a kooperatív jelleg.

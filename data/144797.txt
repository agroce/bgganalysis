Got to play this once and loved it! I can't wait for another game. Right now I would say that my top three games are all worker placement, so it seems I have a type! This one is very different than the other worker placement games I've played, though. The "winning influence" makes for an awesome mechanic!

RATING: 8.5
Preconceived notions out the window! This game takes worker placement and casts a MEGA-SPELL on it, transforming it into a free-for-all strategy frenzy, in a race to become the new Chancellor of Argent, a magical school for mages. The amount of content that has been packed into this box is astounding and the replay factor is huge. There is potential for incredible worker combos, spell blasts, hidden information, cutthroat machinations, etc. 

I went into this game expecting to be confused by the mechanics, befuddled by the art style, and confounded by the amount of components, but I walked away wanting more and more. It's a straightforward game with a fun premise, drenched in theme and bolstered by quality components and artwork. I don't think I've been as surprised by a game.

Homemade foam insert makes setup and teardown so much easier! Copied from scothern's pictures in Argent general forum, slight modifications.

There's a lot of rules to learn for your first play, but once you start playing it, you will pick them up quickly, and rounds 2-5 should go very fast as the game starts to make sense.

Played with 2, it's a tactical affair of picking a strategy and then changing it to react to your opponent.  Extremely fun, especially when each of you goes so far down a path that it unbalances the game for each of you.

Played with 4, the gameplay is even more fun, but the end scoring is more chaotic.  It was extremely difficult for me to try to keep track of all opponent "goals" (aka who was gunning for what), and rather than being paralyzed by attempting to track it, I simply collected "a bunch of stuff" and hoped I had majorities in things that might be in the voter pool.  Oh, and I had fun nuking whole rooms and being "that guy."

Happy to have picked this up, and look forward to playing a lot more!

Long game. Especially if its first game and none of you played it earlier. Suggestion: start with fresh mind. Try to get all relationship between resources and little rules. And try to find your own combo that breaks the game ;)
- So many negative interaction. Pretty aggresive game.
- Takes a lot of space. 
- Many ambigiouties in the rules. Print FAQ and read it all before start. Make sure all players get how different workers work and whats the priority of rules of different elements.

I need to play other colors to rate it more properly; green, red and grey seem pretty balanced, if players act well.

You can win without knowing how you are winning. Or win by knowing exactly where to win. Though things do become more obvious in the last round when everyone is asking how much of X do you have?

Level 99 Games keeps getting better and better, and thus Argent is my new favorite in the line. You play staff at a prestigious magical university in the Indines world, and you've got to win influence from secret voters on a council to become the new head honcho. On the way, you research spells, place worker mages, use their abilities, the abilities of the artifacts and spells, collect influence, and have a load of goddamn fun.

RATING: 9.5
Amazing worker placement game featuring variable worker powers, variable room setup, and decks of artifacts, spells and supporters that change up the play experience every time. This is possibly the most variable worker placement game in existence and it might just be my favorite. My favorite part is that the win condition is mostly secret to the players throughout the game, so you have to work to find out what is even worth points before you can work towards it and claim victory. It isn't possible to know everything, so some things have to be inferred from other player's behavior, and that is where things get really interesting. When you ask yourself "Is he collecting gold because gold is worth a point or is he just saving up for a large move in another area?" then you have a killer game.

RATING: 8
A very cool game! Tough to play solo, but I had fun trying.  I have some problems with the production quality.  I don't like the colored disks that slide behind the mages to designate team.  It makes the bases not fit on the worker placement spots!  These tokens still make it tough to see who owns each mage.  There are also some color problems where the red appears brown in some cases. I also believe, the shadow spots should be to the right of the original spots if they are resolved after (maybe even on the other side of the card- to keep consistency with the left to right top to bottom resolution order).  Super re-playability due to the 2-sided everything and different rooms.  Also the order makes a difference.  You'll never play the same game twice here!  I need some more info on some of the rooms, a cheat sheet on every room would have been nice. It's a keeper!

This feels like Mage Knight (endless randomized spells/potions/weapons and asymmetrical starting conditions) meets Russian Railroads (worker placement for efficiency as opposed to worker placement for action type) meets Troyes (secret knowledge of a subset of endgame conditions).

5 players makes turns and the game go far too long. Probably plays best with exactly 3. I am not a huge fan of all of the randomized and secret stuff. I am inclined to make the consortium fully visible and replace gained marks with additional influence.

Also, turn order is of the horrendous Agricola style, where there is player control over Start Player, but then it goes clockwise from there...

Probably not a keeper for me, but I'm willing to play a couple more 3-player games to find out.

Oh, and there are some really poor graphic design and user interface decisions. There are critical pieces of information that are difficult to read at a glance.

(3-6 Players, 120 min) The Chancellor of the Argent University of Magic is retiring, and as an esteemed member of the faculty you've got your ambitions set on the position. But only a secret consortium of University board members and local officials will decide who gets promoted. With a group of loyal mages (sycophantic students) in your employ, you must acquire spells and information that will help you learn how the Consortium will vote, and how best to earn their favor.

Where to begin?  I actively dislike the art style so that puts me off.  The game is sprawling and over-stuffed.  There is a lot of "take that" simply for the sake of it (although I do understand some people find this fun).  The level of randomness is not to my taste for a game of this length.  

This is a hard pass.  Too many other medium and heavy games surpass this.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Dannnng this game is NASTY!  By far the most aggressive worker placement game I have ever played.  The engine building aspect is fun, along with the deduction of finding out what actually scores at the end.  The idea of each worker type having a different power also works VERY well.  This game is NOT for the feint of heart, and a LOT of people are not going to like this one.  Not sure if there really is a market for a Euro game with this much aggression, but I sure did enjoy it!

Update 1 (3/14/15): 
---------------------
First play with the expansion, and everything about it is awesome.  The additional cards just make it so interesting, with an infinite amount of ways to play.  Can't wait to play this one more.  This will no doubt be in by top 10 2015 games , and if its not in the Top 5 I would be totally shocked!

Grey, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue mages
Red - 1 Mana to wound someone to take their spot, spend 1 mana, get 1 mana for every other mage in the room - (Card flipping for variable effect)
Green - immune to wounding; spend 1 mana bump somebody in the spot and move them into another spot
Purple - can do as a fast action; place purple mage out and perform another action; spend 1 mana to shadow a mage
Grey mage - whenever you cast a spell, place grey mage as a free action; pay spell cost 1 mana
Blue mage - immune to spell, play to play to place on a merit badge slot

Spell got 3 level - place knowledge and then wisdom

This is a very involved Euro-esque game.  And this is why it works for me.  There are many moving parts and thus many strategies.  The ability to affect each others' workers relieves some of the criticisms of worker-placement games.

This game has a lot going for it, but perhaps because of there being so much variation in setup, the engine doesn't feel elegant and more like a mashup of various worker placement mechanisms. The hidden goals are interesting, but there are so many of them you can pretty much ignore it and just assume diversity is important. In 2p, there's not enough contention for spaces and there is never any sense of a growing engine. Round 5 feels much the same as round 1 and by the end we're bored.

The surprise hit from the 2015 crop, Argent has become one my guilty pleasures. It combines many things I greatly enjoy in games: agonizing decisions (not enough resources to accomplish all you want), direct interaction, and infinite replayability thanks to the random setup. Argent can certainly feel overwhelming in the first game, but it only improves with successive plays. I also love the theme and have even warmed up to the artwork, which I wasn't very fond of initially. Rating might go up with future plays.

A very interesting, ambitious game design with so many components and variable set-ups that I'm not sure I should really be rating/commenting yet. 

I love the theme and the variable worker actions: workers combo well with one another and interact with other players in interesting ways. I also really like the spells themselves, which are creatively designed (and extremely powerful) and make for some very satisfying turns and unique, variable gameplay.

Yet, somehow, the game doesn't come together smoothly for me: it's a beast on the table with so many moving parts that it just seems somehow... too much. Everything but the kitchen sink is in here... plus the kitchen sink! If I played this 10 more times, I might not think this way, but I haven't, and sadly, I probably won't, as the game's cumbersomeness prevents this from hitting the table. Too bad, because it's quite an impressive design.

Played once. I thought it was quirky fun, but incredibly overwrought; I couldn't help but think that if there had been some real development work done, this could have been a really good medium-heavy game. As it is, though, with so many variables to mess with and so much going on, and yet with only a vague idea how to win, this is a potential AP nightmare and it's really not clear all the work you put in is worth it.

I still enjoyed it, but the niche for this is going to very narrow. Too bad; I think with a little more development this could have been really good, and something a lot of people might have liked.

Spectacular! The worker placement is harsh and unforgiving, the different types of workers provide incredible flexibility, the spell cards can combo off each other in a manner that could make most CCGs jealous, but most of all, that scoring system is my favorite that I've every come across. You could dominate in one area, but still only make 1 vote- information is king here, and knowing which elements to go for, and how far you have to push it to get the vote. Love it. Awesome theme too. Level 99 knocked it out of the park.

Too many choices and plenty of 'take-that' type actions mean careful planning can come to nothing. I'm not sure about the ten hidden objectives and whether it actually pays to find out what they are when you stand a better chance of just completing some blind by choosing any other action. Good re-playability thanks to the highly variable setup. Some of the player colours are difficult to distinguish. Coloured bases for the figures would have made them easier to tell apart.

I greatly enjoyed my first game of this.   All the reviewers were correct in their assessment that it looks difficult while setting up, but as soon as you get into the game it flows nicely.  We did a 3 player game and even though it felt like during the game there was some imbalance, the final score was 4-4-4, with tie-breaking influence determining who won.  I got the votes from all 3 of the consortium I had marks on.  It really felt good that you could fight for some votes and indeed win what you are after in the few short turns of the game.  Second game and with 6 players it took 4 hours.  Maybe should not do 6 players.  Seemed like most everyone still enjoyed it though, but most people didn't really look at what objectives they could win until round 5, where it was only time to switch one or two voters.

Solid worker placement game.  I really enjoyed it.  The replay value of this game is extremely high.

There is very, very many things to do in a turn, some at the same time, some every phase.  While it makes for super strategic choices to make, it also will get any non-gamer lost in the complexity and it also make the game a bit prone to AP.  Beware the steep learning curve.

Nonetheless, this is a great addition to my collection and plan to play it again for several years.

RATING: 4
This is a well-designed game; just not one that I want to play. It gave me a real sense of being overwhelmed similar to what I get when playing dominant species.

i found it really difficult to keep track of the number of things going on and i think the game has too many similar mechanics that are easy to confuse - research vs. wisdom vs. intelligence for instance.

the pvp aspect isn't something i liked although some will likely really enjoy that. i also felt like i would have liked this game a lot more if there were a more simple intro game - something that cut down the number of rooms or options or something. the best comparison i could give would be Agricola's family game.

if there were a way to play a few shorter & simpler games of this before moving up, I think I'd have liked it better.

What a game! It's pure worker placement but I feel that it does it in such a different way than all the other games, that it should be a category of its own. Yes, it can feel unbalanced but also very, very tight. Paradoxical you say? Yes, this game has a lot of that.

And the replayability is thtough the roof! I don't think I have seen a euro (yes, it's a euro) with such modularity. Pure magic!

I am sometimes annoyed by "take-that" elements in games, but at some point a game crosses a threshold where there's so much take-that that it stops bothering me and I just enjoy the carnage and try to survive it as best I can.  This game definitely fits into that latter category.  And there's so much content!  So many rooms, spells, items, mage abilities.  I doubt I'll ever get to play with it all, but I'll sure try.

RATING: 5
I can see how people like it. For me it falls into a category of games I'm not too thrilled with. Namely, one where there are too many "special" things players can do. There's a main board where players can place workers, but there's a lot of specialization among spells, supporters, treasures, commodities, that each player can get, and which you need to pay attention to for other players. It's too much for me. Especially because you can't tell by simple iconography what the specializations are from across the table; you need to hear the cards read and then remember. All that being said, there are some interesting things going on, and an enormous amount of variability.

I love: the thematic integration, the obscured-victory-condition mechanics (and resulting mind games), that the workers have variable powers, and that it turns worker-placement into a more directly interactive sort of game via spells and battle mages... but there's consolation for doing well enough to get beat upon. Also, it has loads of fun special powers. And the art is great.

I think I've resolved my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/165775/item/2939740?commentid=4243428#comment4243428]earlier concerns about tempo[/url] - during my first 1-2 plays, I was thinking of tempo as a tactical "something to keep an eye on each round", whereas in reality, it's one of the game's core strategic considerations. If your board is slower than everyone else's, either you need to actively seek out abilities to rectify that (and avoid taking things which make it worse!), or adjust your strategy to cope with the fact that you won't get to do everything you want each round.

It can take a while, particularly with new players and/or the 'Mancers expansion, but I'm looking forward to playing more.

[b]Edit:[/b] I've now played 9-10 times with a final production copy. Overall, gorgeous and awesome. I have a few component frustrations, but the game proper keeps getting better as we play more, and I continue to be very enthusiastic about getting it to the table. (Thankfully, so are many of the people I've introduced it to.)

This game has more modularity than about any other I own.  There are so many ways to make the game vastly different, this is an absolute gem.  This game doesn't get the love that it probably deserves because of all the possibilities but honestly you can pick a particular setup and play that way until you get bored.  This game is a worker placement game that gives you a ton of options and is an absolute hoot to play.

This table-devouring game is an impressive feat of design.  It's a very simple game - place dudes, resolve them - but it has SO MUCH stuff in it.  So many rooms, so many powers, so many spells and items... hell, even your workers have special powers.

This mountain of magical goodness does a great job of killing off any possibility of AP.  There's no strategy here: just do cool things around this school, and try to accumulate stuff.

My only worry is that the actual scoring - identifying the voters and trying to max out, including guessing what the other players are doing - falls by the wayside.  You end up doing all this cool stuff, and then it just seems kinda random who ends up getting votes.  "Get stuff" is a good strategy overall, and you'll probably get a bunch of voters even if you don't know what they want.

Fortunately, the game is legitimately fun to play, so this is rarely a problem.  Just don't go into this expecting a grand strategy game.

EDIT: The scoring worry above is really getting to me.  Not only does this game take a long time to set up, but it takes a long time to go through the motions for what is inevitably, and unfortunately, a coin-flip as regards voters.  What you do in the game has little impact on scoring.  Maybe if I knew the game better, I could read opponents and make educated guesses to steal voters, but that requires (i) having the ability in game to actually gain the required commodity, and (ii) have opponents who know what they are doing.

Without that, it comes down to a coin-flip on the un-marked voters.  If it is the "most coins" mage, I win the game.  If it is "most marks," I lose.  Flip...

An unpredictable wildfire of insanity in a genre that is predictably boring. The amount of implicit negotiating that can happen between players to try and screw someone else over is delicious, especially when you can obfuscate your own goals due to the consortium voters. I've only played with the recommended starter setups with different people, but would love to get a proper game going!

Very confident this will be a 10 game for me upon repeated plays of proper setup.

Played this game 4 times within a week of purchasing it.  I didn't really know too much about it, but based off of my geekbuddies, I decided to spring for it when offered an excellent deal at my FLGS.  Wow.  This is the new standard for worker placement games.  

What I love:
1. The workers have different abilities.
2. Having more workers isn't necessarily better.  Since the players determine when the rounds end, you will frequently still have unplaced workers.
3. Highly interactive. You can mess with other people's workers after they are placed. You can take resources from others.
4. Replayability. The rooms are double sided, there are scenarios, 2 different placement abilities for each mage type, different belltower cards, etc... There is a ton a game in that box.
5. Casting spells.  You can do some cool things with the spells, ranging from subtle to dramatic.

One play, rating is tentative. Graphic design is poor, especially the colors which are nearly indistinguishable,  rule book has errors and is hard to follow.

It was fun to play overall, but I have doubts about longevity.  There is certainly a lot of content in the box but it may always come down to 'knock the workers off, bring them back', over and over. We'll see.

2nd play: 3p reduces the endless cycling of mages on and off of the board. The bigger problem is lucking into a large percentage of your points. It's a fun game and the theme is great, but the components and the scoring need a major fix. Can't recommend it in its current state. Too kickstartery...

3rd play: this goes on the trade block. Design heavily favors breadth (tons of stuff) over depth of decision making. I tested a variant where all voters are face-up and you use marks to make yourself [i]eligible[/i] to win that category (no mark, not eligible, even if you have most of that thing). It worked well and certainly helped to fix the central flaw of the game, that you can luck into 40% of your points, or that you may learn what you should be working on way too late to start working on it. In the end the component issues and need for house-rules just tick me off. There shouldn't be so much need to do the designer/publisher's work for them. I can only explain this game's high ratings as Kickstarter + boy wizards = insta-fans.

For such a long, and at times rather slow, game the over-complication and chaotic nature of this game can be somewhat of a downer.

Hogwarts the Boardgame!  This is absolutely my jam, but I understand it's not for everyone.  It's not a calm worker placement game.  There are four different sources of variable card powers, and hidden variable objectives.  And the theme!  You are the Head of a House and your students are good at different subjects.  Goal is to get the most faculty to vote you as the best house.

Lots of stuff going on, but it was fun.  Reminded me a little of Archipelago except you had more information on what would be scored.  Only like 12 points in the game.  It's a worker placement game where the workers are used to help score you majorities.  But you don't know which majorities will be worth points.   So part of the game is simply taking actions to help find out what to go for.  A good bit of screwage "take that" in this one with all the banishing and wounding...but it seems to work ok...and not too arbitrary.  You typically know who you are in competition with for certain majorities.

In Argent you are trying to achieve majorities in a number of, initially unknown, areas of the game. Whoever has the most majorities wins. During the game you can choose to reveal secretly what majorities you are aiming for. 

The game is a worker placement game but in this version you can throw your fellow players' workers off their place by casting spells. That is it really. 

The downside is that there are so many cards to keep track of. To play well you will need to know what the potential spells and powers of all your competitors are. And each card has loads of writing on it. Alternatively you don't keep track of who can do what and you just play, hoping others' powers don't try and stop you doing whatever it is you want to do.

People whose taste I respect really like this game but it isn't my sort of game. It feels bloated and Ameritrashy with the heaps of cards, and there is just too much to keep track of. You have to like area majority games too. 


So, if you like conflict in your Euro and you enjoy masses of card information to keep track of then this is your game. If you like your Euros clean and elegant, stay clear.

RATING: 8.5
This is quite possibly the best worker placement game I have ever laid hands on, and as a disclaimer, I generally don't like 'em to begin with, but I -love- this one.

To wit, most worker placement games are just dry as bones and are generally themeless VP races.  There's only so many different ways you can collect wood, stone, food, and whatever the hell before I want to just flip the table over and call it a day.

Argent, on the other hand, is not your typical worker placement game.  In fact, it doesn't even feel like a worker placement game despite that being the core mechanism of the game.  Instead of racing around a VP track, the entire point of the game is to secure the 12 votes of the consortium (10 of which are hidden) in order to determine who will be the next Chancellor of Argent University (think of it like Hogwarts for Badasses).  The key point here is that you never quite know who is making up the consortium and you will either spend precious few turns gathering marks to take a peek at the voting criterion of one of the members, or take a gamble and beef up your holdings.

For example, one consortium member might give you their vote if you have collected the most supporters and spells from the Sorcery (red) department.  If you are one of the few (if not the only) to know that voter is on the consortium, you can comfortably collect Sorcery stuff without anyone catching wise, unless you're really blatant about it.  There are a total of 18 possible categories for consortium members, too, meaning a random 6 will always be out of play every round.  This keeps the game super fresh all the time.

Speaking of keeping things fresh, combine the variable consortium with dual-sided cards and rooms in the university that describe different powers for your workers (mages) and what they can accomplish (tasks), the random draw of items that give you a leg-up (one-time-use supporters from the student body and faculty, treasures, and variable-level spells), and the fact that everyone drafts the type of worker they're going to be playing, PLUS the ability to send other players' workers to the infirmary or inconvenient spots, and this game is just replayable out the wazoo.  In the four or five games I have played, not a single one of them felt the same.

For example, there are five types of mages/workers that you can have in your office (players represent deans of colleges within the Uni), but the powers they grant are determined by a dual-sided card.  One one side, for example, a mage may be able to wound another and send it to the infirmary, taking its place.  Flip the card over, however, and that mage now loses its ability to wound, but instead gains mana depending on the amount of other people in the same room.  Simple math tells us that's 32 different possible combinations of cards showing A or B.  Believe me, what powers the mages have greatly affects how that particular session will play.

Similarly, rooms are available in dual-sides with all sorts of different tasks, and not all of them will be used.  Even the three constant rooms are dual-sided and well, this time YOU do the math.

So, problems, then.  There aren't many.  One is the selection of colors.  Everything, while staying true to most primary and secondary colors (red, yellow, blue, green, etc), is severely unsaturated, giving every token or badge a dull look that, in low lighting, looks the same from every angle.  We found this to be a problem, especially when determining which mages belong to which player.  One suggested fix was to paint the bases or use wooden disks instead (which would require some slight modification, but would work).  The biggest thing would be some rules ambiguity - Argent has a wonderfully-crafted rulebook, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  Even the FAQ, while extensive, is missing a lot of things to the point where if you want to get into it, you can have a serious argument over the ambiguities in the way the game works.  Finally, the game can get long with more players added to the mix.

Short version - the hidden consortium members always keeps you on your toes, and the sheer amount of variability in the game board and powers means this game plays differently every time.  It will take a -long- time to make this game feel samey.  It also scales VERY well; plays well with 2p, 3p, etc.  The only hit against it are the color selection and the generic bases.

RATING: 6
I really want to rate this game higher. But as it is, the terrible layout decisions is making this a game more complex than it should.

Where iconography is supposed to help, they serve to complicate things further. Everything feels very non intuitive. Cards are used when they should have been imprinted on a board instead. The mages don't fit inside the spots designated for them. Tiles are unnecessarily huge for no reason. The font is hard to read. Spots feel like they didn't need to have so much words (Lords of Waterdeep for instance didn't feel the need to write down Gain 3 warriors whenever you went to the spot that gives 3 orange cubes). Everything just feels like there could have been better graphics design decisions behind it.

It's a shame because the game beneath all of this is really good. I feel like the complicated lay outing turns this from a 2 hour game into a 4 hour game.

The game is fantastic! It has great theme which integrates well into game play. Its basic mechanic is easy to grasp but since there are LOTS of variety in the game, it does not get stale after a couple of plays. This is a game which is easy to learn but hard to master.

Some have voiced their concern about how the game is too complicated. This can be true considering the high number of variance offered by the game. Thus, in my opinion, players should limit themselves with the most basic rooms for their first couple of play. After getting the grip on the basic mode, players can utilise the other rooms for their pleasure.

The alternate mage special powers and combination of spells, supporters, and vault items offer a nice mix of abilities that are fun to exploit. That and there's tons of variety with the initial game setup to keep this game fresh for ages. Deducing the consortium while tinkering around with all the different abilities you acquire throughout the game is such a blast!

Also, the production of this game is stellar. I don't understand how they were able to price this so low. An absolute steal!

There is a lot to like about the game (tons of components, cool art, cool characterizations), but the theme is kind of meaningless ~ just a bunch of tit-for-tat squabble between mages.

after slogging through two games, I realized that I actually dislike this game. It is torture to play. There are some great ideas going on, but the amount of things to do is overwhelming. It has a euro play style, but to play that properly, you have to have an awareness of nearly every card of the game and some basic understanding of their interaction. I think if I played this 10 times, I might start to get there, but that sounds like 8 more games of misery to me. It's too bad, because there is some neat game going on here. It suffers from a need to be edited and streamlined to make it more accessible for new players while keeping some of the deeper combination elements.

Also, there is much to be desired in ambiguity of in game rules, which is to be expected in a game where cards add rules to the game as it is played.

It is simply too much. It's difficult to remember a game of this production quality and complexity where I just wanted to think of ways to end the game faster instead of trying to find ways to win.

It feels like a euro worker placement chassis with a hint of Donald X Vaccarino massive variable setup and a touch of FFG-style layers of interesting and thematic player abilities. 

There is some directed player attacks since some workers and spells can target another player's worker, but there are many ways to mitigate this and perhaps more importantly, there is reparations built into the game for the victim in the form of resources and other subtle advantages. This latter bit helps alleviate the problem where a third uninvolved player benefits too much from not being involved in a conflict, which is usually one of the big pitfalls of multiplayer games with directed player attacks.

The scoring objectives are a nice refreshing twist. They are essentially 12 different races to have the most of a thing by the game end, 10 of which are hidden and can be discovered via in game actions or deduction. This adds a bit of population dependent strategy to the game. Often worker placement games have population dependent strategies in that you might not do well if everyone is competing for the limited supply of wood or whatever (while the player who capitalized on an underused resource shoots ahead), but the scoring is usually flat such that you don't worry about whether too many other players are using the same scoring strategy as you. This has scoring that is a little more like Terra Mystica's geographic and cult objectives, such that you often have to decide which voters you will commit to and how many you think you need to actually win the game. You might concede a category, as opposed to other point salad games where you will get your paltry sum of points no matter if someone else dominated the category. 

If you enjoy a high level of variable setup and variable player powers, as well as building up your own capabilities via an expanding tableau, and enjoy the possibility for a little more interaction and table talk in your worker placement, then this is a surefire hit.

My only negatives for the game so far are that it takes up a large amount of table space and that it can take a long time for my group in 4 player games relative to other euros we like. I don't find the downtime to be that big a deal, since the game is rich enough in strategy and tactics that my mind is buzzing the whole time analyzing, but with setup, teaching, and playtime, it doesn't always fit into the time I have to game.

RATING: 7
The best thing A:tC has going for it as it takes the worker placement mechanic and gives you soooo many options. The table is a sprawling mess, but the game manages to contain itself for the most part. With so much variety in every game you are rarely going to have the chance to find the most optimal strategy and run with it- a lingering problem with some WP games. You feel constantly in the game as you must react to others and work hard to keep up. The point system is also very intriguing, where you have to discover which items you  must collect so you can get the "votes" and win the game. At the end of the day, nothing else but those votes matters! So everybody goes after different things with the knowledge they've acquired. I also really like when worker types can give different benefits (see: Age of Empires). With all of this in mind, A:tC may still not be a game for me. Well-crafted but almost a little too sprawling for my tastes. By the last round there are so many spells, treasures, consumables, supporters and room powers out on the board that the game can feel rather swampy.  Even I, who didn't do very well in the game, by the last round had 37 different options for my first turn. It's a great game for those who want that type of brain-push, but it sort of bogs down the tempo for me. Personal preference, I very much dislike the manga-style artwork also.  Overall, a solid game but definitely has some issues that might not be issues for others.

VERY ambitious and innovative worker placement game, with a lot of take-that interaction. While I wanted to like this game, the more I played (4 games), the more it seems like an under-developed mess. Minor gripes are that it's a huge space hog, has some poor production choices, and lots and lots of text on cards to keep track of. I would forgive all that if there was an enjoyable game in there, but this has been more of a slow, chaotic, downright torturous at times, slug-fest. Combos come out that are quite swingy, plans get thrown out the window quite easily with the take-that actions of your opponents, and there are many layers of rules, actions, and card text bringing lots of messy complexity. The post-release FAQ version of the rules on BGG is a help, so I would use those if you decide to play.

In the end, the scoring mechanism is remarkably simple: area majorities on hidden cards, which may be revealed if you get certain actions, and with ties broken by a simple category called influence. This makes the game seem manageable, but the analysis paralysis, high interactivity, and inevitable slow play, combined with the incredibly chaotic, swingy, and disruptive nature of the game, make it painful.

More is not always better. The game feels under-developed and fiddly, with no elegance from counter-strategies that emerge. Rather it seems more like a bunch of stuff that happens, slowly. Based on the number of rave reviews, though, there is a constituency for this kind of game. Perhaps I've not played it with the right crowd, or hit some poor random set-ups, or not gotten the hang of it quickly enough to appreciate it. As one person said, if you spend your actions finding out how to win, by the time you have enough information to win those categories, it's entirely possible to lose to someone who accomplished more overall, and your category happened to be one of them. There's very little time for the deductive aspect to come into play.

All that said, if someone was interested in the game, I would tell them to try it simply to see all the mechanisms chaotically put together. The theme is really well done, and the interaction will appeal to some players. If your group analyzes things, maybe don't expect it to hold up as an enjoyable strategy game. Once it slows down, it can be a painful slog.

Fantastic game!  Evergreen in our house.  I think the best worker placement game I own!  Complex, confrontational worker placement that nonetheless has a very straightforward game loop.  The long rulebook is deceptive.  The complexity comes from all the contextual powers and cards on the table.  The turn to turn moves are short and simple.  The tenor of a given game, what it emphasizes, depends completely on the available tiles.  Some games will see few spells but chugging potions, crazy vault artifacts and lots of mage power use.  Alternatively, others will be all about nutty spell combos putting down mages left and right in a single turn.  And none of this addresses the way that the objectives for a given game also alter everyone's incentives.  All told, it's really quite wonderful in its diversity of play.  The game is not especially chaotic with 2-3 players and it retains its strategy---it's not like the diversity is created by elements of chance like blind card pulls (there are just a few of those; mostly players will be drafting from a known tableau) and dice rolls.

I love the endgame, I find it rare that a worker placement would end in a series of winner-take-all comparisons.  It lets you identify the pivotal moves that, in retrospect, ended with your win or loss, which is rare in worker placement.  Finally, it takes a game or two to realize how crucial the IP board is simply because it breaks ties and ties are very common.

I am beginning to suspect IP is just *too* valuable, but that could be houseruled.

There is a lot of game packed into this box, especially considering I have the Mancers expansion packed in there too! It is a highly interactive worker placement game with lots of theme which is usually not the case with the genre. The game is actually a little heavier in complexity than I expected when I first heard about it but that has turned out to be a good thing because my group loves the epic-ness of it! My group has a heavy multiplayer free-for-all Magic the Gathering background and this is the first worker placement game that my group has naturally embraced.

I am a big fan of Level 99 games and everything that they have produced so far including Battlecon and Pixel Tactics. Quality and value are two things you can always expect from them and Argent does not disappoint.

Argent: The Consortium is not a standard worker placement game.  In most of the other worker placement, when you place a worker, you block an action for everybody else.  It's true for Argent: The Consortium but you can cast Spells, use Items or the special power of your mages to wound, move or remove the other player's mage.  This make this game very interractive.

The goal of the game is to have the most votes after 5 round (or 6 if playing the Epic variant).  At the start of the game, you only know 3 of the 12 voters.  During the game you can take actions to know more but even if you know which voters are in the game, you can wins vote on things you didn't know and lose votes on things you did know.  This makes it hard to know who's gonna win and make each end of game exciting!

I really love how the Spells works in this game.  Each Spells has 3 level.  You need Intelligence to learn new Spells and Wisdom to increase the level of a Spell.
On your turn you can do a Fast Action and you must do a normal Action.  Fast Action can be placing a purple mage, casting a fast Spell or using an Item that is usable as a Fast Action.  Normal Action are placing a mage, using a Spell, Item, Supporter or taking a Bell Tower Card.
I love how the Bell Tower card works.  There's 3 card available each round (in a 3 player game) that give a different bonus when taken.  A round ends when all those card are gone.

This game have alot of variability!  You only use 8 room out of the 30 available in a 3 player game.  The Voters, Spells, Vault item and Supporters will also be different each game.  The 5 color mages also have 2 available power and you only use 1 each game!  Each game will be different!  
The main downside of the game is that it takes so much table space that you need a big table to play even with only 3 player.  Setup and clean up takes some time also.  Figuring out which rooms to include in a game and which mages to draft at the beginning his tough.  There is so many choices and you can't choose them all!

If you're looking for a worker placement with alot of interraction, very high replayability and don't mind the hidden scoring, Argent: The Consortium is the game for you!
It's certainly one of my favourite!

Just played this game for the first time. I wouldn't normally offer a comment after one play, but I was really excited for this one. I gotta say, it really is fascinating. It is far more visually appealing than the pictures let on. The way the win plays out is awesome, because I was scumming it all game, focusing on just one vote until the end when I just started grabbing as much gold and influence as I could. When the everyone else started spending all their gold (they invested a lot more time in uncovering the voters) I knew I'd messed up. Still, I cam in second thanks to influence!  The game is fiddly and perhaps a bit over-indulgent without the elegance to back it up. Its a messy shock of bits and bobs and opportunity with a theme that ties in wonderfully. My rating of an 8 is more a vote of confidence based off of my first experience. I'll be back to update this already overlong comment.

Finally got in a second play, and while I was very satisfied, I must bump the game from an 8 to a 7. In this second game, I won by a landslide with 6 of the 12 votes. The next closest contender garnered three. What this proves to me is that there is some real strategic decision making to this game and experience matters, which is what I was looking for. The fact that this emerges from an overwhelming mess of glorious components and simple mechanics is really quite beautiful, if a little inelegant. This second game was really dragged down by AP, which will always be a problem if you're playing with someone prone to it, but this game's enigmatic approach certainly exacerbates it. I enjoyed myself, enjoyed the feeling of growing more powerful and pursuing my game plan while ultimately groping in the dark. The theme is strong, but really requires players to buy into it and breath it to life. Good game, probably best reserved for the right group. Glad to have it in my collection, but it's no all star.

RATING: 7
Some good ideas including theme and voting for the victory.  However, rules consistency was print and play quality or less.  My group of friends that also playtest prototype games played this once and found numerous errors that were common issues, not obscure.  The player aids were missing important information.  The same wording had different effects on different cards.  Basically, unpolished and amateurish.  

As far as would I play it in the future?  I think everything it does well, Pret-a-Porter does better.  But I suppose I could play it again if better alternatives are not available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The parsimony of information of substance, coupled with the difficulty of pursuing objectives even when you know what they are, leads to a pretty random victory determination. The components are semi-functional at times, and there's too much weird stuff happening to track effectively. Some neat stuff, but not for me.
[EDIT] Well, a proper room setup (you need multiple ways to get marks not at the expense of supporters), it gets better. Still not worth the time and mental energy, though, at least for my tastes.

RATING: 7
Heavy game - Very cool if you enjoy options, preemptive planning, attacking other players, and variety

Couldn't stop thinking about it after playing it, but it was quite the headache first round through. Would be a fun one to get in the habit of playing often. Of the games that "have it all" it's probably the most impressive. 

That includes attacking other players, which might be my only personal complaint, though if that were something I enjoyed it would increase my rating.

How I Learned to Place Workers and Love the Euro 

Top Placement in Worker Placement 

Sugar & Spice & D-20 Dice Top Ten

If you want a thematic, Ameritrashy sticky sweet goodness to help the Euromedicine go down, worker placement game - here be yer white whale. Hidden agendas, opportunity for player to player gotcha, and so many variable options you'll be hard pressed to play the same game twice for a good while. 

Prepare to make Waterdeep look like a shanty town!

Not so much 'Analysis Paralysis' as awe - at the options you have and decisions you have to make. 

(And I know we like our zazzy buzz words but if yours is 'Analysis Paralysis' why are you playing any worker placement to begin with? It's kinda the point, ya mook! :))

Argent: The Consortium is at its secret mystic heart a worker placement game, but oh, what a game it is!

Players view to be elected new Headmaster of Argent, a school of Wizardry, by the Consortium of voters, who are mostly hidden at the start of game.

There are many commodities which voters select by, but the mandatory ones are Influence and Supporters, with Influence also being the tiebreaker.

Collecting money, mana, intelligence, and wisdom allows players to accumulate spells, treasures, and expendable items.

They do this with drafted mages, who are used to place for errands, and possibly displace other mages.

Rooms in the School also vary, as do start player powers, creating significant variability and creating different game starting conditions for added replay value.

All this can lead to AP, of course, but the game play itself is fairly straightforward.

This is a strong and interesting game which I'm sure will get to the table frequently, even without the expansions now available.

Often, I don't like Worker Placement games. Argent: The Consortium, however, is an example for an abover average WP game. But do yourself a favour and dont play this with more than 4 players!

A lot of interesting stuff going on with what mages you take, what spells you research along with the items and supporters you draft. On top of that, I love the changing win conditions and the variability with all the possible rooms and which side you use.

One play was enough for me. Argent feels like a jumbled mess of things to do and over complications for the sake of it. Not surprising since it's a Level 99 game. Keyword: "fat-trimming" This game needed it in spades. A 3 player game took more than 2 hours and I don't even want to fathom how much it would be for more. But the problem is i wasn't entertained during the meat of it and there are so many rules in this game it just doesn't gel and feels like a wrench was thrown into the gears. 

The game is not hard to understand, there are a ton of mini-steps and phases that I feel could've been done away with to cut the playing time. there's a reason it's best with 3 players, 5 would make it 3+ hours. 

I almost purchased Millenium Blades, but seeing as how I didn't like this, BattleCON: DoI & Pixel Tactics - which I ultimately sold all of them off - I doubt I will like any game Level 99 puts out. They have great artwork and components for their games, but all the games suffer from just too much added bloat and convulsion that is unnecessary.

This reminded me of Dungeon Lords--similar to that game, there are worker-placement actions with multiple options, depending on when you go there. Only, it's somehow even MORE chaotic than Dungeon Lords, despite not having the simultaneous action selection aspect.  Abilities allow workers to be removed from spaces, and manipulate things in strange ways. There are goals that players don't know about unless they spend actions to look at them. There are spells to buy that interact oddly. 

It's all a bit much. Neat idea though, and I love the theme. (1 play)

Great innovative game. Have played it 3 times so far, and while it's hard to keep up with everything that's going on, I especially enjoy the endgame scoring and how each game will be different.

There is a LOT going on in this game.  It's a blast to play, but our 1st play definitely felt overwhelming.  It's not hard to learn how to play, easy to teach, but there is just so much to choose from on each turn.  Kind of felt like I was drinking from a firehose.  The replayability might be the highest I've ever seen due to all the different spells, magic items, supporters as well as the two sided (A & B options) rooms, mages (workers) and player characters.  Can't wait to play again.

After one play, this strikes me as "Wiz-War worker placement," which in my book is a good thing -- plenty of chaos and interaction rather than solo optimization. I [i]love[/i] the scoring system in this game, whereby you have to figure out the victory conditions each game by thematically figuring out what it will take to get the vote of different members of the consortium.

Reminded me quite a bit of Dungeon Lords in that you do fun/cool stuff as the game progresses, but that might have no bearing on the points at the end of the game. Collecting all of the spells and advisors and comboing them well o make big moves is fun,but then after you do all of that there are just these twelve majority categories and whoever wins most of those wins. But there's basically one for every possible thing you could collect in the game, and you use 2/3 of them in any given game. Plus the majority of these are hidden at the start so you have to spend a certain action looking at the hidden goals one by one. It seems like you'd have to focus a lot on it to be able to see even half of them, and even then you might just win one you didn't know about by accident, which seems really bizarre. So, it's a fun ride, but it felt ultimately meaningless and arbitrary what you're rewarded for.

Finally the ameritrash euro !! This game is oozing with theme and is a total blast to play.  I really enjoy the unique mechanic where there are hidden judges that determine win conditions, the variable player powers, the variable worker powers, the variable set-up of university (i.e.worker actions), and the upgradeable spells. The "take that" element is a little bit more than I like for euros but because there are sufficient ways to mitigate this it still works and isn't overly aggressive (although I probably would prefer if this were somehow toned down a bit). At times it feels like there may be just a tad too much going on - lots and lots of options and by the end of the game a bit of AP - but once you understand everything it does make sense and the resources (which are also often win conditions) serve as limiting factors especially for spells. Overall a really ambitious design that I commend and that creates an enjoyable and rich game experience. A++!

2016-04-02 - This is a heavy, interactive worker placement game with a ton of variability (almost too much, the first several games might feel like you're learning it all over again).

Played quite a bit now.  I am very impressed.  Meaty, interesting worker placement with lots of conflict!  There is a lot going on here, so keep your eyes on what the other players are doing.  You don't want to be blindsided by an opponent's new spell.  For that reason, I do think Argent works best at 3, as with more the situational awareness you need to play a strong game gets much tougher...though we play at four quite often.

The game play is fairly interesting, but the components could definitely use some improvement from a visibility standpoint. I am usually not a fan of hidden scoring goals, and that holds true here as well. Not bad, but not great, especially given the length.

Upon reflecting upon my play, I think it is really the complexity of the rules, long playing time, and volatile nature of the game play that leaves me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I do not mind complex rules or long playing time, but I prefer them in a game without so many wild abilities and swingy actions.

first impression, base game:  at its core a worker placement game with gradually revealed victory conditions, around 10 out of 20 possible.  lots of spots to go to, lots of ways to mess up your opponents by moving their workers around, and looks like a lot of potential for replay with many variant board spaces, spells, different types of worker special abilities, etc etc, really kitchen sink approach to game design here.  perhaps ultimately not very elegant but fun if you like this type of euro game

Best game ever - smart and huge, full of options, often overwhelming in the amount of choices it offer. There is just the right amount of hidden information to make it tense until the very end, and the game's arc is great - you start slowly and escalate into full-on insanity. 

The theme is great (I love "Magic School" type settings) and the art gives the game a somewhat lighthearted feel. I've never not-enjoyed playing it.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable enough. A worker placement game with goals that are largely hidden from the players at the beginning. This is a more aggressive WP, giving you the ability with some pieces to dislodge and wound other workers. There are six different types of workers, most with a special ability. You can collect spells, items and supporters that all give you special actions, some are one-time and some are recurring and/or have a cost. So there are quite a few options and I liked slowly learning what my goals were as the game progressed - more than I thought I would, actually.

The spells were a bit of a let down, especially for a magic-themed game. Most were not terribly interesting. However, that is minor quibble that expansions can easily fix. This is a game for which you would definitely want expansions if you like it. 

The biggest disappointment in components was the quality of the cards. They are the kind that break and crease in the middle if you try to bridge shuffle them. Another bothersome tidbit was the way in which ownership of workers is designated. Workers are colored by ability, not by owner, so there is a slot in the base that you can put a flag in, but they are hard to see when playing and we were constantly picking up pieces to see who owned them. Having full bases in your own color would have been better. These are issues that should be addressed in a new edition.

Overall, this is a solid addition to the WP genre, but not one I need to own. I think the main reason I'm not terribly excited by it is because of the mundane criteria you need to meet to win votes. Get the most of these or the most of those. Basically your strategy from game to game will be pretty similar, it's just a matter of collecting or upgrading the right colors or cards. Collecting and using stuff isn't too exciting in this one. This game is close to being very very good, but falls just short in a few areas. Could be improved, though, with a better produced version and a few kick-ass expansions.

A very well designed game that has a couple of pet peeve mechanisms: negative player interaction and hidden end game scoring. The combination of the two is especially annoying since you don't know who the leader is it's difficult to preferentially target them with the negative interaction. There are mitigating factors, but these core mechanisms loom large and ugly for me.

There are also lots of thing to love about the game. There is a mountain of variability, far more than is reasonable. So if you like the game you will enjoy endless variations. The round structure is tight and players control the pace which I really like (very similar to how Luna handles this). There is a satisfying arc of obtaining powerful spells and actions and cementing your goals. 

I need to play it a few more times to see if the positives can outweigh the negatives. It's unlikely, but I'll enjoy playing nonetheless.

Update: it hasn’t aged that well and I think newer titles are better.

I love this game! Note to my geekbuddies, this game is has confrontation and is somewhat chaotic, so if you don't like those factors you won't like this game. I like the fact that so much of the game is player controlled and generated, even the end of the rounds are controlled by player actions. I like the fact that while somewhat of an engine game, a successful engine may not win you the game if you can't get the votes. I like the fact that there's a lot to do, and you can't do it it all. No, AP people shouldn't play this game :) The replayability is through the roof because so mamy of the components have a beginner side and a more advanced side, and hardly any of the components are used every game, always something different. A BIG thumbs up from me!

Very good worker placement with 2-4 players. Lots of player interaction.
Scoring mechanic is very interesting as well (even if it doesn't really work in 2p).
Biggest downside: lengthy playtime (I don't mind but others tend to) + 2p seems to have a dominant strategy (diversify for the win).

Lovely theme + components ('cept the plastic stands for the mages) + art. Some errors crept in but nothing too big. If it gets a reprint they'll probably fix the errors + clarify the rulebook in this second printing.

Continued play continues to impress. I'm enjoying exploring all this one has to offer and it does look quite different from game to game due to rooms in play, different spells and items that come out, etc. It can still take a fair bit of time to play and the first play can be overwhelming (game play is simple but the information overload is quite high). 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

This was an entertaining if deadly and nasty affair.  Quite an interesting take on worker placement as one recruits different types of mages that have different powers that fire off at different times/ways when placed.  This is not for the faint of heart as your mages(workers) will get displaced quite often from the best spots.  There are ways to get back in or defend, but not on all fronts.  This is not multiplayer solitaire in any form and people will feel attacked.  Love the artwork in the game and the colors.  One is seeking to gain the votes of the 12 members of the Consortium to win the  right to be the Chancellor - however, everyone initially only knows 2 public members and one different hidden objective which must either be discovered during the course of the game or deducted from how others are playing.  This game also will take well over 60 minutes - expect 30-45 minutes per player.

Solid worker placement game with a lot of interactions available through the text on many spell, vault, and supporter cards.  I could see this game being prone to slowdown because of AP.  The sheer amount of information per turn on the board, on the available card tableaus and on the players' card tableaus is so overwhelming that I can only glance at the options and make the best choice based on my gut.  It would be tiresome for me to play with someone who needed to calculate out each placement optimally each turn.  Although I love heavy Euro games, this might be a game with a little "too much" interaction between cards.

Argent is a game set on a fictional Earth where Harry Potter wasn't a load of faff. You're students or something at a wizarding school where everyone is still a jerk but they don't waste their time fighting a moron dark wizard. They still don't learn how to do anything useful, though, like algebra.

I digress. I'd heard good things about this but seeing pictures of the extremely busy board and such made me think this was nothing but a more in-your-face Agricola, just another one of these overcomplicated New Euros doling out infinitesimal rewards that eventually turn into victory points for doing...something, anything. It almost is. But unlike so many others, this one remembered it should also be fun too, and have some kind of personality. It should inspire more than just "darn, you took the wood I needed. I guess I'll get a pig instead." 

Argent is long and sloppy and I think some weirdo expansion stuff was included in this play that may not be needed. But we had a great time playing it, and I'm not just saying that because I won. However, the fact that I won does say something about the game, as I usually cannot muster up the intelligence or interest to excel at things like this. But here I could see how the pieces fit, could identify things to focus on and things to ignore, and actually pursue a path and stick to it. I felt like I worked with the game against the other players instead of the usual other way around.

It was long as hell, but I was engaged in it a lot more fully than in much shorter games it's less "elegant" than.

A worker plaement with lots of cobination and player interaction. Plus a insane dose of replayability.

This is the advanced version of Dungeon Lords. The tiles (rooms) are more variated, workers (mages/ imps) now have special powers on their own, with lots of supporters and artifacts (not present in Dungeon Lords without expansion) making this game longer to teach. However, once the game runs, everything fits to the theme and gameplay smoothly.
The problem with this game is that the objectives are too diverse, so that every single move would give you something and players would get lost in the middle. In Castles of Mad King Ludwig, the objectives are much more focused so players can have something to focus on.
Good game, but some flaws making it unlikely to rise higher.

Favorite worker placement game. Honestly not as complex as it seems when you start: You place a guy and when you pull him off something happens. There's a ton of moving parts, but it never feels fiddly. I love the theme, art and design. A masterpeice. Only downside is it takes a lot of table space to play.

1st impression after one 5p game.  Let me start by saying that this is a game that some of my friends, experienced gamers with lots of experience and good taste in games, absolutely rave about (they give it a 10).  I could see how much they enjoy playing it, and you might be more like them, in which case you should not pass the opportunity to try this game.  My rating is based on my desire to ever play it again or not, and that is driven by my preferences.

I do not like this game.  I will list the issues I personally have with the game:
1)  Information Overload -- Breadth over Depth and Clarity.  One of the games selling points is the variety of options.  I do not like games that have a ton of rule making/rule breaking cards/tiles/etc..  When there is too much information, it loses its significance, and trying to figure it out is more work than play.  I have no desire to have to read five new cards every time they come out to figure out what's new and how will it relate to everything else.  I have no desire to have to learn all the information in the game, including 10 different victory requirements.  Too much information/diversity makes me want to ignore all the information. 
2)  Trivial and Repetitive Actions.  At many times during the game I did not feel as though my actions mattered much.  Placing one more worker on the board for an incremental reward often felt repetitive and mostly inconsequential.
3)  Pasted on Theme.  I do like the theme, a lot, but the game mechanics do little to bring it to life or support it.  With the exception of a couple of moments in the game where the players were given creative ways to bend the rules in ways that felt "magical," the bulk of the game, the worker placement aspect, does nothing to make one feel as though one is in a school of magic.
4)  Lack of innovation.  There is little that I could see in the game that I had not seen before in other games.
5)  Length.  For a game asking with this level of repetitive actions with little consequence (the worker placement part and its incremental effect), it is too long.  Because of the nature of the game (buildup and some engine building) I don't see how it could be shorter and still accomplish what it is trying to accomplish.
6)  Components.  The miniatures of the game are mediocre in quality (weight/thickness/materials) and the graphics are average.

As a comparison and to show my bias, I will take Code of Nine, a Japanese game by the author of Tragedy Looper, published by Z-Man.  Code of Nine also uses the hidden/discoverable/partially known objectives mechanism.  The discovery mechanism is tactical and exciting.  Not knowing some objectives is very dangerous (could cost you the game).  Code of Nine is also a worker placement, one with very few, heavily contested placement options that matter a lot.  It does not have spells or many rule making/rule breaking cards, hence less to learn.  It is minimalist in its approach, giving a dearth of options every round (very few options to do what one needs to do).  It is a game I like a lot, I feel engaged all the time and am not overwhelemed by the amount of information so that I can actually play the deduction game.

Again, if you love CCG like Mtg, you probably will love Argent.  If you are an old curmudgeon like me who likes elegant deep games where every move matters (e.g., Vanuatu) you may want to look elsewhere.

good but theres just an odd level of complexity.  Nothings hard to learn or really understand or anything but there feels like a few rules are there just don't add anything worthwhile to the game.  I think the game could have been much better with ether cutting out a handful of situational rules or adding more to them and extending the game to get more out of them.
Getting points to win at the end feels like it came too quick to really do a good job working to them.  Kind of a point salad feeling.
You fight over control of getting your choices you want but its such a long chain to turn you actions into points.  
meh.....but with seemingly slight changes I feel it could be one of my top worker placement choices.

Bought from Amazon 2/11/16.

Simply amazing.  The replayability is through the roof.  Different rooms, supporters, consortium voters, vault cards, spells, and even mage powers!  Ridiculous!  And it's just... FUN!  It's extremely satisfying to manipulate the board on such a grand level - with spells, mage powers, and items.  So much interaction every turn.  Great with 2 players so far.

Love this game. Cool spin on worker placement, where the different workers have different abilities. Also refreshing that it's a wp game where victory points aren't the win condition, but rather getting the most Consortium votes, which you do by secretly looking at which each voter wants and building toward that objective. Highly recommend. 
Only negative is that is a huge table hog.

This is the best worker placement game ever in my eyes. It's the only worker placement game that not only has a strong, exciting theme, but makes perfect absolute sense in its context. The game has tons of replayability and it'll be a while before any two games will ever being alike, thanks to all the variable modular boards and variable victory conditions!

Best of all, it plays really fast. It looks intimidating and takes a while to setup, but actual gameplay is very fast unless opponents have analysis paralysis. It is also very interactive, with a lot of player interaction from jockeying for position and screwage. 

I feel it's far superior to "boring" worker placement games like Agricola where you're just milking cows and have no direct conflict. Oh how exciting!

Pleasing to the eye, and seemingly clever in style, this game has two problems for me. The first is too much take-that. Red mages and offensive spells can blast workers off their spots with extreme regularity, such that it is nearly impossible to get anything done with any reliable planning.

Secondly, while I was initially intrigued by the win condition and the pursuit of discovering all of the hidden goals, there are too many to chase realistically. Plus, because only first place is awarded in each category, you can't expect to guess the objectives by watching other players; by the time you figure out what they are going for, they are too far ahead to surpass, and there is no prize for second place.

I wanted to like this one but it's just not for me.

For my taste it's to chaotic and random for how long it takes... It was a disappointment... was very excited about this one... great production, great theme but too much screwage that you can't account for specially with the game going and players getting more and more Spells and Treasures, consumables and Supporters.

It can also be terribly lucky because you can win some of the votes without even knowing and planning to do so...

This game has a lot of bits and flavour. The theme is basically Hogwarts where you control mages who compete via WP mechanic to gain spells, books, wisdom, potions etc etc etc in order to meet the requirements for VPs (e.g. most different potions). The game is very interactive with spells and potions flying about knocking mages off places and sending them to the hospital. This is very much an experience game and achieving VPs is secondary. I bought an expensive potion during the game which allowed me to send mages already placed to the hospital at a cost of 2 gems per mage……. you can see where this is going….. and as all information is open so could my opponents as my gem stock grew steadily during the game. In the last round I had to decide between coming a probably second in the game or using the potion……… and guess what….I lost the game but wiped every single mage from the board 2 moves before the game ended. Needless to say the reaction spells fired in my direction made the final attack on Hogwarts look like amateur night! An absolute blast of a game!

Heavy, complex, but manageable and interesting. Spell play actually overshadows the worker placement to a degree. Divergent opinions on strategy and viable persuits are good signs for me.

Update: After contemplation I've decided that I do not like the hidden consortium voters in a game of this weight. Remembering them feels like a chore, and the fact that those with marks have no tangible advantage during final scoring evaluation feels like chaos; the kind that rewards randomly instead rewarding of skillful play.

Even with that issue, recommended.

This game is kind of a mess. It's a worker placement game that tries to cram powers into every little thing. The spaces you place workers, the cards you play, and the workers themselves all do different things. It's all a little too much. Between the number of different things you can do and the fact that you can sling mud at each other constantly really gives this game a lack of focus. Also, the final scoring, while thematic, can be very random.

I applaud the attempt to bring more interaction into a worker placement game and also like the idea of common hidden objectives. However, the many special skills and cards and the many different ways of scoring makes the game a bit too chaotic and turn it into a race of "collect whatever and hope for the best". The game is also a bit long for what you get.

RATING: 7
The depth in A:tC doesn't come from the action themselves; this is just another worker placement game.  No, the depth comes from a) the 5-6 different TYPES of workers that one might place, b) the obscene number of options in game setup, c) the variety of victory conditions that MAY OR MAY NOT apply in each game, and d) the number of items/spells that will never show up in each game.  Even the length of each of the 5 turns is variable.  Because of the metric fuck ton of game you get and indeed MUST play here, there is no optimal strategy -- YOU NEED EVERYTHING.  (Well, everything minus six things...)

And that's the problem -- in a world where gamers play a game once and arrogantly assume "they get it" before putting it away for good, NO one is going to log the time/effort to understand what strategies work for this game.  Mixed with the fact that if everything is important, then nothing is important, the amount of white noise that hits a 1st-time player has caused at least half of mine to tune out by Round 3.  For a game that demands exploration, it goes out of its way to discourage players from exploring it.  And if Millennium Blades and BattleCON are any sign, this is their preferred MO, so like it or lump it.

That said, even when I lose this game, I enjoy myself.  And isn't that why you play?

This is a textbook amateur-tier design for a worker placement game. An over abundance of options, a lack of focus, and just a mess of a board state to observe.

The goal of Argent is to be winning in the most of a large number categories at the end of the game; the categories are hidden but there are plenty of ways to peek.  The gameplay itself feels a little like Dungeon Lords, with worker placement spots that have varying rewards based on when you place your worker there, and resolution at the end.  However, there is a ton of take-that in the game, and the rounds have variable length, meaning you can get royally screwed and not actually get to place the majority of your workers.  There's no second place for the categories too, so it's also possible to work on something the entire game and get nothing for it.  The game has a ton of stuff in it, and it really takes a while to wrap your mind around everything (the player aid is huge), but there's so much screwage that I'm not sure it's worth it.

My favorite game from Level 99 (and actually the only one I'll play), Argent is a table-hogging worker placement game that feels sort of like a Harry Potteresque game of political intrigue. While the complex machinations of so many possibilities can burn your brain, in the end it's all about those twelve votes. That's what I like best about it. Where other other heavy euro games often have clunky end game scoring calculations, in Argent you either get the vote or you don't. I don't get it to the table very often because the set up is a bear and I typically have to kind of relearn the game every time we play because it's been so long since we've had it out.  Ironically, one of the most promising features of the game is the extreme variety built into it. Not only are there different locations to choose from when you set up the game, but each one has an A and B side to select from, as well. Additionally, each worker (which do different things from each other) also has two different possible functions in the game. All of these permutations are interchangeable making for an incredible amount of variety and replayability. I say ironic because I have a hard enough time remembering one set of rules from game to game.

This is a worker placement game, where workers all have different special powers corresponding to their colors. Players will end the game scoring for many different criteria, however all but two of those criteria are not initial public knowledge. Through player actions, you can keep at the various scoring criteria cards and through cleverly watching for what other players have seen compared to what actions they take, you can predict what they've seen. This is a very complicated game, which does have a lot of rules and lots of needing to know what's printed on your opponent's spell cards, artifact cards, ect, which can be a little overwhelming. The game also is a massive table hog. That being said, the game also offers a massive amount of replayability as so many elements will change completely game to game including the board, the worker powers, the player powers, the scoring criteria and the spell & artifact cards.

Beautiful and brilliantly conceived, Argent is a worker placement euro dripping with theme and personality.  The game creates a remarkable narrative as it plays, and is wicked and backstabby without being particularly mean spirited...somehow.  What I mean is that you WILL screw people over, but often this allows them to focus on something else.  So, not a lot of hard feelings or victim-style chest clutching.  That's a triumph of design.
It is a table hog, though, and set up can be arduous, but the end result is chewy, deep, brain wracking goodness.  Absolutely top notch effort by Level 99, whose games can sometimes run a bit towards the casual and/or gimmicky for my tastes...but this one: gold.

A rather interesting take on worker placement, with interesting available actions and various unique powers, multiple currencies, and all sorts of neat tricks. 

BUT, with full player count (and the extra baggage of the expansion, the game gets really slow.

Also, the actual win conditions may or may not actually be any good. When you need to get the plurality vote but you have to burn time and resources just to see what the vote conditions are, if you don't do that, you're just spinning your wheels and hoping to win "most wheel spinning".

RATING: 7
An aggressive worker placement game, with a good bit of interaction. You vie for reward spots, however being first on a spot may not work out for the best, since others may knock you off. Since the rounds are variable length controlled by the players wait too long and you may not be able to place your workers.

The goal has a nice twist, You are trying to collect resources in a 12 categories. There is no value to be second, so it is easy to get knocked out of final scoring. 10 of the categories are hidden, the game includes deduction/peeking to see what categories are included in the scoring for this game. However, take too long to decide what to pursue and you won't catch up. To try to to everything means you will accomplish nothing.
You do need to track what your opponents are doing so you don't over commit in some areas and know where to concede.

The idea of each worker type having a different power also works well. Many of the things you collect provide special abilities as well, which can make your turn very complex as the game progresses. It is a difficult game to wrap your head around, with all the layers of rules, actions, and card text.

I'd been interested in this game since first reading about it on BGG early in 2015 (I'd been unaware of the Kickstarter at the time, had I been I'd almost certainly have backed it), but we ended up buying it on a whim when looking for an additional game to increase our savings on an online order. I've only played it twice (once with 4 and once with 3), and while I can't say I think it's going to be a game I want to play all the time (although I don't rule that out either), it is certainly a very interesting game that I would be happy to play several more times.

All the different abilities you get, from the powers of the different mages, and most of all the cards you pick up (most notably the spells), make this rather more exciting to play than your average worker placement game - and the replayability is clearly going to be huge with all those 2-sided tiles and loads of cards, being different in every game. Yet there is, for me, a strange disconnect with the way victory is determined - there are 12 different criteria for which "votes" are awarded (2 are the same every game and 10 are chosen at random from 16 others), with only one player winning each one, and the player with the most votes is the winner. There are plenty of opportunities to find out what these criteria are, but it's hard to win everything, and you won't know many of them particularly early. This is perhaps the most interesting feature of the game, and will take plenty of plays to figure out the best way to go about it - it's quite hard, while learning the game, to keep this in mind while doing all your cool spells and so on.

All in all, this feels like a pretty fresh game idea which I'd like to explore in more depth. But I don't see it ever becoming one I feel I must play.

In theory, the game seems great.  In practice, there is a glut of unique decks and unnecessary complexity followed by an extremely random scoring round.  There is an illusion of deduction since you can spend time deducing the scoring rules, but if you do so then you haven't spent time accomplishing them, so the winner is the player who remains ignorant about goals and just grabs lots of stuff and gets a bit lucky.  Players doing deduction simply understand why they will lose.

Maybe if you doubled or tripped the number of marked gained from all sources, the deductive element would come into play, although I think I would still find the actual game play way too chaotic, fiddly, and computational.

This is all too bad, because each of the mechanics individually seems really neat, the theme is well executed, and the theoretical dynamics are fascinating.  But how those pieces came together did not work for me in the slightest.

It's a big hulking machine of a game, but it's also probably the best worker placement game I've ever played. All of its many parts interlock and click together in such a way that while it has a ton of moving parts it feels like they all belong there. It also represents what is possible with player interaction in a worker placement game. Combine it with its terrific setting, and this feels like an explosive step forward in the genre of heavy euros.

This worker placement game is made heavy by the sheer number of options and variations it brings to the table to augment the traditional worker placement experience: variable player powers, variable workers with their own corresponding powers, variable and hidden win conditions... the word "variable" will crop up a lot here, and as such there's a barrier to entry here which will drive away players who seek a lighter experience.  However, to those who are willing to put in a bit of time and effort to learn everything that is going on, I don't think the game feels bloated at all once you begin playing.

You'll feel the need to be thinking on your feet here, more so than most worker placement games.  It takes a long time to play if any player(s) want to try to figure out the objectively optimal move every turn, but I like it enough to be worth the time.  The theme is great, as are the components, mostly.

**Purged** Probably going soon.

Incredibly fiddly setup. Rulebook needs serious revision work to be easy to learn the game from.

The game seems to require a level of aggressive play and counter-play that may be uncomfortable for new players who want to understand mechanics at first. 

There may be a deeper play with groups who are not learning the game, however, the density of the rulebook and the requirement for negative player interaction is offputting.

This is an over the top worker placement game. I like that the workers have special abilities, being able to cast spells is very cool, and there is an amazing amount of variability. There are quite a few random factors, but overall the better player should win more often. I like the way the scoring works, with the voters being all that matters. It feels very different from other victory point based games, and is a nice change of pace. I just wish the game played more smoothly and quickly.

Some interaction in worker placement is ok. But getting your whole turn cancelled by other players ganging up on you is not.
This game has way too much 'take-that' effects and there are too many secret objectives to make it worthwhile to plan for anything, which is a shame for this type of game, especially of that length (our game was 2 1/2 hours with 3p).

Will not play it again if I can avoid it.

This is a great worker placement game full of player interaction, intrigue and fantastic art/components.  The theme is intriguing as your workers aren't the typical do-anything workers but are instead mages with special abilities.  This means that you must choose not only where, but who to place onto an action slot.  The game is quite asymmetric but feels rather balanced and with the variable setup and no less than 3 decks of cards involved, the game is highly replayable.

STRENGTHS:

Massive replayability, Euro/American hybrid with plenty of direct player interaction, theme woven throughout the mechanics, beautiful artwork and components.

WEAKNESSES:

New players may AP due to plethora of options, learning curve can be steep but actual gameplay is quite simple, table hog on the level of Agricola/Caverna or a big Fantasy Flight game.

I did design the game, but it was really a group effort with the wonderful folks at Level 99 plus the large  number fans that helped me playtest and provided feeback.

It's a perfect example example of a game that's too complicated for it's own good. All of the rules make the game a chore to learn and boring to play. Complicated rules can be fine if they are done for thematic reasons or for interesting game mechanics, but this game isn't strong on either. There isn't much player interaction and the game can drag on way too long. It's not a game I'd ever like to play again.

Fantastic, cutthroat, deep, and incredibly varied worker placement game with bluffing, racing, hidden knowledge, obfuscation and brinkmanship.  Discoverable win conditions, variable player/worker powers/drafting and uncertain round length add lovely complexity and strategy.  Engaging theme and gorgeous artwork.  Tippy-top notch in my book.

Update:  The more times I play this game, the more I'm in sheer awe of how brilliant and interesting it is and how wildly different each random setup makes it.  I can't rate it higher than a 10 so I'll just have to shove everything else down a bit (kind of like those pesky green mages!).  The bar has been set by this game and it is as of yet unrivaled.

Initial play - Lots going on in this game, which can contribute to those prone to AP. With 6 players it went long (I think over 5 hours for our initial game.) I imagine 3-4 players would be great. Without really focusing on "marks" I felt I was flying a little blind during the game, but I ended up in second at the end, only by one vote. A lot of time is spent reading and referencing the different placement tiles. The icons are fairly clear, but the text on the tiles is small, so this slowed the game down a little. The colors are also a slight issue, as the orange and red indicators on the tiles are not easily identifiable, and the small color indicators on the mages are difficult to easily see (colored bases for the mages would have been better). That said, I would like to play this again, and I am glad one of my geek buddies has this in his collection. The card combinations are fun to use, the spell casting offered a lot of diversity, and the different mage powers offered a lot of choices for strategies.

I wouldn't ever play with 5. It's a bit of a slog with so many choices. At the end of the day it is a semi-secret goals game with worker placement, resource management and a take-that element. I really didn't like this implementation of the take-that mechanic. In some cases, it totally made sense when you bumped workers to take over a space. But in other cases, it was arbitrary and was there just for the sake of messing with other player's plans. That sucks when you are trying to plan long term. The theme is a paste on (My friend and I were joking that you could re-skin it with a VC / Start-up Theme. IP points!) but I did really liked the character cards and the abilities of the different mages was smart. I would like to try again with 3, maybe 4.

Yuck! Not at all my kind of game. There are a lot of interesting mechanisms here:
- unique player powers
- customizable actions (according to which spells/treasures/supporters you collect)
- worker placement, where each worker has a different power (and each player drafts a unique set of workers during setup).

But there are a bunch of things I really don't like:
- having 12 different (hidden) victory conditions! Yes, you can look at them by getting makes. 
- geez, there are so MANY different powers -- too annoying having to look at what everyone can actually do (so who bothers?)! 
- the components were pretty but a few were annoying: the bases which hold your mages have a slot to indicate ownership but some of the player colors are a bit too similar! And you can only see them from one direction!
- we had a bunch of little rules questions. Fortunately they were (mostly) answered in the rules ... just makes for an annoying introduction to the game.

Not for me!

RATING: 8
In this game the players are heads of different magical schools at a magical university vying to become the next chancellor of the university.  They do this by earning votes based on different criteria from focus in the different schools of magic to most of the different resources.

The gameplay is worker placement but with a lot of nifty variations to that.  Each of the workers belongs to a different school of magic and each school grants the mage a different special ability.  Sorcery mages can blow up another player's mage and take their spot, mysticism mages can be played for free after casting a spell, natural mages are protected from sorcery mages and other wounding effects, etc.  There is a lot of variation in this game.  There are different spells, treasure cards, and supporters players can acquire each game and even the things you will get votes for varies each game.  Also, something pretty neat is that most of the 12 voters are hidden when the game starts.  There are ways to reveal them and discover what they are voting on but there will almost always be something players don't know about the voters and something you don't know that your opponents do and vice versa.

That variation is my favorite part of this game, each play is going to feel very different.  This also opens it up to allow players very different paths to victory, especially when they all discover different information about what is going to be voted on.  In my first play I focused on defensive mages and abilities while another player stocked up on offensive ones and the third player focused on a large toolbox of spells.  One thing to keep in mind is there is a lot of player interaction in this game.  Probably about half of all the item and spell effects in this game affect your opponents in some, often negative, way.  If you don't want to follow this path you can, like I did in my first play, focus on defensive effects but if you really don't like mean or combative games this one probably isn't for you.

I, for one, loved it.  Games with a lot of interaction are always a little more tense and exciting to me.  Especially due to the games that can be played outside of the game in the form of taunts, threats, and alliances.

I will say with so many different special effects and interactions there were a good number of rules contradictions we weren't sure about in our game and a couple of the cards were poorly worded or worded differently on the card and in the rulebook.  But outside of the text itself the components were pretty well done.  The mages and different tokens were mostly nice looking and solid feeling.  However a lot of the iconography and art looked very amateur, like somebody put it together in paint but this didn't effect my enjoyment of the design that much.

Lots of variety and depth, many things going on, turn tempo is important. A challenging game to play well, but not worth the effort as the design feels too amateurish.

Also, the BGG posted 60 minute play time is way off - it's more like 30-45 minutes per player.

Has the potential to be a good game, but the snafu's and gimmicky style lower the rating for me and I have no desire for playing it ever again.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun and interesting twist on the worker placement engine building game. There is an insane amount of replayability in the box... which is both very good and very bad. The games can be very imbalanced if people don't know what they are getting into, but at the same time this is probably the best game to be stuck with on a deserted island.

My main complaints is that there is a bit TOO much going on with every worker having a special power and with so many spells and things that mix up the game.

Also, there is a bit too much direct attacking for my tastes. You can mitigate it with selecting the buildings, spells, and worker abilities -- but that would take tons of time to sort through to find the best set up.

The last problem is the way end game scoring is set up. Without the right set up to get information, most of the game is simply playing the odds on what votes will come up. That kind of leads to a bad feeling if you get screwed in what voters come up. Would be much more fun if there was just VP and bonuses for having the most in each category instead of it being the deciding factor.

Overall, very good game and something I'd love to play more of -- just to see what crazy combinations are out there to mix up the game.

RATING: 10
Mean but not frustrating, this masterpiece offers one of the most intuitive designs in gaming. Any person interested in design/development should try this game, as it features a profound understanding of the logistical aspects of board games. The game play is deep and balanced, the mechanics astoundingly fluid, the iconography easy to interpret. Most importantly, it is amazingly fun. 

Nitpicks: Despite being the best first edition rulebook I have ever read, a couple rules are unclear so check out the FAQ.(Infirmary rules surprised us.)

Secondly, it requires a decent-sized table as player acquire spells and items.

Third, "discarded" cards can go to a player's discard pile or the bottom of a deck. I might have used a different term for the "subduction" of cards.

For me, this game's quality defines the "10" rating for a game.

Not nearly as complicated as it looks.  It definitely feels like the game could lose a thing or two and be better and more compact.  That said, it's a somewhat unique game, with lots of back-stabbing, an interesting scoring (winning) mechanism, an interesting round-ending mechanism.   A fun game to just experience, even if you don't necessarily feel like you can track everything that is happening.

tl;dr: it's a kickstarter game

Yes, that's my name for this kind of game. It works, it doesn't look too bad, the components are of decent quality... but also it doesn't feel refined in any way. Not the artwork, not the gameplay. I can't say this is a bad game or that I hated playing it, but I certainly didn't love it. It has a bit too many rules and different types of cards. Those cards - for the most parts - do similar stuff, but the way in which you acquire them is different.
Also: it needs a lot of table space!

After one play, I found the game a bit overwhelming and fiddly.  Argent uses an interesting scoring system where there are 12 categories and you only get a point if you have the most in a given category.  Plus, 10 of the categories are hidden and have to be uncovered throughout the game.  This was kind of cool, but it also made a lot of the game feel a bit aimless to me.

Another mechanic that didn't click with me is the action system.  Each turn you get one fast action and one regular action.  Most of the abilities are regular actions, so they are extremely precious.  However, there are a ton of cards (vault cards, supporters, spells) that require actions that just aren't very good.  So, a lot of cards I collected during the game I never even used once.  If they didn't happen to be one of the scoring categories, they were completely useless to me.

It's a cool theme and there are a lot of cool ideas like spell advancement, different schools of magic, and merit badges.  But it just didn't come together on my first play.  Maybe it'll click better on the second play.

I can see why some people would be less than thrilled by the mysterious goals and the surprise victories that can happen when not everyone is aware of all the victory conditions but in general I like this.

I need to play it more before I really lock down my opinion of it but so far it is a solid "9".

Wow.  What an intricate and interactive game this is.  A little bewildering at first, but it really doesn't take that long to start having those "a-ha!" moments.   And you will have many of those moments.  I'm impressed, and hope this is a game that isn't hard to get to the table.  (Speaking of which, MAN this game has a way bigger footprint than I thought it would.  Ridiculously big.)

I think the art style will honestly be the biggest stumbling block to getting people to play this.  Manga tends to be polarizing.

It's true what everybody says: there's a ton of stuff in this game and it takes up a huge amount of space on the table. I wanted to not like it because of this, but it's actually pretty good.

There are two elements that really make this stand out. First is the way you gain points. There are a number of face-down cards that all score differently at the end of the game (most gold, most spells of a certain color, most items, etc.). There are different actions that let you look at the face-down cards, so you have to balance taking regular actions with taking actions to just gain knowledge about the victory conditions.

The second thing is that players can essentially determine how long a round will last. You might have a ton of extra workers, but if other players start grabbing the "end the round" cards, then you won't have time to utilize them all. So on each turn you have to really consider which action to take because you never know when the round could end.

Going into the game I was concerned about the attacks, specifically being able to knock somebody out of a space. In practice it really isn't that bad. Players usually have to sacrifice something in order to attack, and you get some sort of compensation for being attacked. And the compensation isn't exactly trivial.

Fun game. I probably won't end up getting it myself because there are so many other great worker placement games, but I will definitely play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentatively rating this a 7, I need to get it out more but the problem is that the depth and complexity and time commitment to really learn and enjoy the game is so high that it is hard for me to dive in.

I appreciate the design it borders on mad scientist level of brilliance, it's like a WP game meets Mage Knight, I mean wow.  With a completely unique scoring system. 

But being able to play and know all the cards, and be prepared for people's actions and re-actions and everything else is going to require an insane amount of effort.  And just when you think you have everything down, everything can be flipped to side B and totally change the game.  I mean everything, action spaces, abilities, everything, all two sided.

If you are looking for a game to play like 50 times with the same group, a game to really be able to sink you teeth into, a game that will never get samey, I implore you to give this a shot.  It's the labor of a mad man.

But I just don't know if I have the energy.

This is a well constructed game with good mechanics. But the information that you need to track among the players is rather large (who can defend, what are the special abilities, etc). Also the victory point system is rather harsh. It would have been better if in 4-player games, the player in second place in each category was getting some points also.

Worker-placement on steroïds: The workers have abilities, there are a gazillion spots. Though it is the dozen hidden winning, hidden goals that set the game apart: No victory points but only being the best in certain (but which!) domains bring you one point at the end. The game is interactive.

After my first play with two players, I find this game difficult to rate. On one hand, it borrows almost all of its mechanics from other euro games like Troyes (voting), Agricola (worker placement), Lancaster (driving other players from the board) and others. And it is really, really long. It will most definitely be shorter the next time we play, but we are still talking 2,5 - 3 hours. Can't imagine me playing this game with more than 3 players. Oh, and there are lots of cards to read each turn. On the other hand, however, the flavour of this game is incredible - the artwork is really colourful and evocative, everything matches the theme and I really like how spells can be developed further and how you can mess with the positions of other mages on the board. Makes it very interactive. Also, I like the variability that's on offer here. Lots of value for the price. So I am looking forward to my next play, even though I realize that it will probably take up another afternoon. Because of that, I do wonder how much playtime this game will get in the end.

I'm torn... there are so many clever mechanisms here (clocktower cards, different types of "workers", the delayed worker placement, spells, etc.) and I love the gameplay... but I'm not sure how I feel about the all-or-nothing endgame scoring. 

I mean, Troyes has a similar mechanic where there are portions of endgame scoring that affect everyone but are known only by some, but it's much less extreme - maybe 10-15% of your final score, rather than 100%. The other thing is that it's winner-take all when it comes to the endgame scoring categories, and I don't care for how this affects gameplay - in Troyes, those categories will score for second and third place, so if you can figure out what your opponents are going for it can be worthwhile to go after that category - but in Argent, by the time you deduce or mark what they know, their lead in that category will most likely be insurmountable. 

Perhaps, like many of Level 99's games, this is one that improves with experience. I hope I get the chance to find out.

Rating after one initial play.

Very interesting take on Worker Placement, feels very fresh.  Lots of interaction with bumping and manipulating each others workers, so not for those who are against such tomfoolery.  I really love the hidden goals system where people can peak at them and evolve their strategies around them.  TONS of variability, which is excellent to have in a base game.  Anxious to play it some more, could very well up my rating with more plays.

The aggressive nature of this worker placement game is going to be the primary reason for strong reactions to this game, but from an objective standpoint, it's just a slightly bland heap of crap to bury your dining room table. Tracking abilities, spells and consumables makes the late game obnoxious. While being abrasive is this game's defining feature, the interaction and ability to wound workers is Argent's strongest asset. Unfortunately,  within this framework, it doesn't culminate into an elegant design. 60 to 150 minutes is a considerable spread, and at this point, there are other aggressive games in this vein that I enjoy more with iconography and game state that are much easier to discern.

I do not know where to start with this one. There is so much variability packed into this game. From the decks of cards (spells, items and supporters), the different voters, the double-sided university tiles and mage power cards, no two games will ever be the same. Some may write this off as variety for its own sake, but I disagree. Rather, I think of it as a new puzzle each time out, and the satisfying challenge comes from making optimal use of the resources and opportunities presented to you. Add in the two expansions and well, the possibilities are absolutely mind-numbing, and I LOVE it!

(July 2015 after 2 games, 5 and 6p) - WOW!   A nasty worker placement game with a ton of worker spots.   Lots of replayability with the different rooms/game end condition cards.

I like the hidden victory condition cards and that only 12 points total are up for grabs.   First play felt a little lost, but picked things up at the end and really enjoyed game # 2.   

I also like the fast action and regular action aspect of a turn.   The Bell Tower card timer mechanism is pretty neat too.  Look forward to playing with a set of experienced players.

Brilliant game. Lots of moving parts. Overwhelming at first play. Very confrontational. Fantastic art and theme. Brutally under appreciated. Just wrapped up my fourth play of this game and it get better with every play, which is normally the opposite with games for me. Truly one of my very favorite games to date and a bar for future worker placement games to meet.

This might be the epitome of worker placement games. It's the sort of game that makes you feel like the rest of your collection is completely unnecessary and redundant. There are 6 different resources, 5 different types of workers, each with their own effects when they are placed, spells that can be triggered to rearrange already placed workers and various methods to squeeze in extra workers to a spot that has already been filled!

It is completely and utterly overwhelming, especially when you realize that almost every aspect of the game is customizable. The worker spaces are all two sided and they are arranged in a random order from a random selection every game. The player powers are asymetric and double sided, as are the worker powers. there is literally no way you could ever play the same game twice. it's absolutely incredible how much variety is in this box. Even the victory conditions are different every game, so there is no possible way any strategy will ever become dominant.

The funny thing is that despite all this complexity, the game is incredibly intuitive. There are a lot of options to distract you early on and it may seem overwhelming, but once you play a single round or two the rest of the game will fall neatly into place. Seriously, go buy this now, I think it is the last worker placement game you will ever need.

Argent is an interesting and very intricate worker placement game. It has a great deal of variety which means lots of replayability thanks to the hidden scoring.

It does suffer from a lot of downtime though, and players have only limited ability to pre-plan their turns because the actions of other players can drastically change the board at a moment's notice. As such, it's simply not my style of game and I wouldn't really go out of my way to play it. I wouldn't mind playing again if there was nothing else going on but it's not something that I feel compelled to replay.

RATING: N/A
The game description says it all "A cutthroat worker placement" to gain point salad majorities of privately revealed secret objectives. Random modular setup of several Academy areas creates many new engine build puzzles to work through. Challenging strategy twists with take-that spell timing and innovative special action rules within your group of worker placement apprentices. I imagine Terry Pratchet's Color of Magic where the candidates of Unseen University use any means necessary to manipulate and outwit the others to become the new Chancellor. With more players it is chaotic trying to execute any sort of plan and it is head-to-head. No dice or lucky card draws are going to save your sorry behind.

I love the theme, the variability in setup, the worker placement mechanics and their unique abilities, just everything about this game sits perfectly for me.

The fact that the game isn't just about acquiring points and then you win, but rather about figuring out how people are going to vote and then acquiring those types of resources is just such a refreshing end game scoring mechanic. Every game has me sitting on the edge of my seat wondering who will end up winning that final vote.

The only thing that sometimes bothers people I play with is the take that mechanics the game has where workers can get hurt, but the game still gives you something no matter what for each worker which is why I think it works perfectly fine.

The theme is not to my liking. I havnt enjoyed the 2 plays so far. Because there is only 12 vp given out in the game, the games will likely be extremely close and usually decided by tiebreakers. Not the biggest fan of this mechanic. I get too little satisfaction of winning a vote then I was hoping for as well.

The 8 rating is relative.  I've never played this two players.  I've played it with 3 and with 5.  

With three players (all of whom had played before) it was a wonderful and fun game.  It rates an 8.

With five players, it was an absolute slog that would have earned it a rating of about 4 just for the downtime.  

I remain skeptical of a 4 player game, although I will eventually try one if all 4 players know the game.  I will never play it with 5 players again.

Right now, this rating is based on a 2p experience. My main gripe is the sheer size of the game, and its fiddlyness. It was hard for me to manage my cards and be able to see/access all of the components that were available. I'm willing to try it with 3p at least, but if it still doesn't click, off to the trade pile it goes.

Cute theme, gameplay wasn't as tight as I'd hoped. Again, waiting to see what the 3p experience is like.

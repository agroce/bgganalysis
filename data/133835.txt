RATING: 7
Quite a bit of game in a small box. Good fun with dramatic reveals coming from the simultaneous card play and scoring conditions. Only downside - new players find it a little fiddly get the faction/temporary support/scoring conditions straight in their heads.

RATING: 8
An intriguing and original card game.  The central mechanism could be described as an auction, in which the players bid to exceed a reserve price (the strength of the Emperor this week)...in five different currencies...with all bids in each currency separately totaled...and the possibility of bumping up the reserve price.  

Steam Noir has better fidelity to its theme of competing factions, secret allegiances and shifting alliances than that description suggests.  A clever element is that  each player tries to steer their secret faction to victory, but scores points for a different temporary faction in each of three game months. Points gained for the success of a temporary faction go towards your main faction's final total.  Nonetheless, there is a tricky balancing act between playing for the one or the other or playing to stop someone else. 

I think that with novice players or an uncommunicative group, the Emperor victory is the rather too easy option.  I have adopted the 15 point Emperor lead results in a coup house rule suggested in the forums; it seems to work well.   

Card quality is good, though you'll want to sleeve them because of their black edges.  The artwork is nicely evocative.  The rules do a decent job of explaining a fairly complex and original game.

Just read the rules... this needs another read; however, the basic concept reminds me of Divinare.  Players support one of 3 factions by playing cards.  After 3 cards are played, factions are scored and players that supported the strongest one get points.  This is repeated 4 times and then the player with the most points wins.  However, the devil is in the details.  Players can weaken factions by supporting the Emperor which does something to the points.  Players have a secret faction they support each round which gives points and players have a secret faction for the game which gives points.  Definitely needs another read, but it looks like it has potential.

Steam Noir: Revolution is an interesting game. I picked it up because it fits into the "emergent" category I enjoy - no action is intrinsically worthwhile, but rather has meaning only as consequence of other player decisions.  The game is primarily a deck of numbered cards in five suits that players use to manipulate the standings of revolutionary factions. For me, the game fell flat only because it was too hard to predict and/or control the outcome of your own actions, often resulting in a feeling of helplessness that I didn't like.

As a short overview, players are secretly assigned one of five revolutionary factions that they will be supporting. Their faction will win if it ends up with (1) more points than the emperor that they are overthrowing, (2) more points than any other revolution faction, AND (3) not too many more points than the next faction (in which case the second-place faction wins). If no faction has more points than the emperor, the last-place faction wins (since it was least rebellious).

In order for factions to get points, players choose cards secretly that are then played simultaneously either to support the rebellion or as traitors. In each of 12 weeks, players accumulate points tokens for supporting that week's strongest faction in particular ways (players' tokens ultimately score points for that player's secret faction). The factions themselves also score points for being the strongest (and stronger than the emperor) in any given week.

The idea is clever, but in my only game the difference between winning and losing was rather small, while each player's total control was relatively little. Early on, I tried to acquire points for my faction, but wasn't able to do so effectively because other players' cards or decisions (or both) weren't supporting my efforts. In the middle of the game, when Emporer looked storng, I tried to give points to the lowest-scoring faction (to ensure that I would finish last, and thus potentially first). That, too, failed, as the other players' cumulative decisions turned overrode my attempts. At the end of the game, however, I ended up winning. The Emperor stayed in power (by a mere 3 points, with a final score in the 40s) and I had the lowest-scoring faction of the active players (by a mere 2 points). So even though I felt that I had little effect in game (I certainly failed to accomplish either of my objectives), I was given the win.

To help put some of this in perspective, the strongest faction each week depends on the play of all players' cards over several card rounds. The collective strength of the factions is often rather close - in a given week, the Orange faction might have a strength of 22 to the Green faction's 19 to the Purple faction's 16. Only the one strongest faction gets any points for the week (and in some weeks, that faction gets no points at all). So a single player could theoretically go through the entire game (playing 36 cards) without ever supporting the correct faction or having any direct influence on a faction's points.

I actually enjoyed my play of the game, despite my feelings of helplessness, but I think this would work best for a very narrow group of gamers - namely, those who are willing to play games like this with negotiation, cooperation, and collusion. The best way to ensure that you have some control over the outcome is to make sure you are coordinating your play with at least one other player. I'm just not good at this (it's not at all clear to me how to make such things mutually beneficial, nor when to defect). Perhaps others are?

This game does best with 4+ players, and with table talk / deal-making / betrayal / fist-shaking. 3 players with no table talk is a terrible experience.

I like the three-level indirection towards victory. ("This instant, I am supporting Faction A so I can gain power and advance the cause of Faction B this season - which I am ultimately doing to amass even greater personal power to give Faction C the victory", where A may briefly be the same as B or C, and B may for a time be the same as C.) It gives it a Byzantine, political-machination feel - though new players find it hard to manipulate, and I have some concerns that there's insufficient player control in the short-term battles (over A).

After 2 plays:

First impression: seems difficult to assess how to influence the gameplay and the current state of the victory condition. Nevertheless an interesting gameplay. 

We want to play it more often to explore the depth and possible ways to deal with it.

There is an criticism, that the strategy to support the emperor while trying to keep your own group behind is a dominant strategy because the emperor would win most of the time. 

We are not sure, whether this is true. 

Another thing is, that gaining points during play could sometimes lead to failiure but to victory. So it feels strange not to go for victory points in order to win the game!

In this regard I wonder, whether it is possible to assess and to influence how far the distance between the leading party and the second one will be.

Interesting game but at the moment after just to plays impossible to rate.

Steam Noir is a game that comes to life entirely through player interaction. No action is good or bad by itself, and whether a certain play is a help or a hindrance depends on the circumstances. Throw a little collusion and a bit of bluffing into the mix, and things start to sound promising.

In the end, however, the implementation leaves too little control in the hands of the players. The difference between winning a scoring and going home with empty hands is often very small in spite of the huge scoring differential. Now, getting points is not necessarily good, either, but the small difference in game terms means it often feels completely arbitrary which factions and/or players receive how many points. I expect that effect to become even worse with more than the 4 players with played with.

I have a prototype copy, so my rating is preliminary (and so far only based on a single three player play). I liked this quite a bit; there is lots of thinking going on, plus a decent amount of bluffing/guessing and backstabbing. I am definitely looking forward to trying this with four players, as I imagine that would work even better. In the first one and a half "months", we were also a little busy getting the rules right, then the game got into full swing. The rules aren't very complicated, but there are many things to keep an eye on to be able to enjoy the full potential of the game. Recommended.

Tries to be many things at the same time and the amount of different card types and mini rules is surprisingly big. The rules are really convoluted and unintuitive and it takes almost one whole play to really grasp what's going on. In the end you have a mechanically interesting hidden role game in which you need to help others in order to maximize your own benefit. Unfortunately the game is way too repetitive and long for what you get. Clearly it is also meant for five players only. The card switching in the beginning seemed to be a bit useless and the game would have absolutely benefited of 5+5 extra cards with which to point your loyalty when simultaneously showing your cards. That would clear off all hesitations and other oddities. A thematic expansion right there. I like the original looks very much, but the re-themed version looks not so good.

played a prototype.  I played it with three other friends
And they would play again if I were to propose it.
We don't play a lot of games more than once, because we are allways eager to explore other games. It's a shame really.

I've given the first play a 6.8. Which is halve a point higher than my average rating.  if we didn't run into emperor question rating would have been higher.

We took 80 minutes for or first game but that should drop to under an hour. we had one rules question we ran out of emperors to fill the draw deck in the final month.  and since i had 4 copies of the rules we all read them together to solve that.

The artwork of the prototype was excellent

edit: the first edition contains an excellent rulebook. and while I was impressed with the artwork of the prototype they improved on it.

You need to negotiate and talk at the table to make it work. It is not a game that can be played quiet imo

there is a new rule that tells that the emperor should also live by the max 15 points ahead rule. this changes the flow of certain games as well.

Edit : so I Had two more games of this.
i like it. It has more tabletalk than we are used to. Most of the time we wre just quietly doing or thing.
Most tabletalk recently was from risk legacy. 
Now the more tabletalk the better this game gets.
If there is no tabletalk I won't play it.
The thing about this is that the tabletalk is part of the struggle , alliances between factions made and broken, amd it emerges you in the theme. If you are just playing your cards it is a quiet revolution.
Revolution should be loud imo.

If you like to play games quietly this is probably not for you.
If you are the opposite get it.

Beautiful artwork and a very nice idea behind the game. 

Easy to play but hard to handle. First game was chaotic and it took 2/3 of the  time to get some structure into the gameplay. The VP-system is quite tricky and not easy to explain.
Conversation seems unnecessary at first glance but it is needed to manipulate other players. In a game without talking, bluffing and manipulation the luckiest player wins. 
I hope we will get better into gameplay in the future.

Man, maybe there is a game in there but I did not find it.  Random guessing with a surge of points at the end over which you have no control.  The only thing I see you can really do is try to win for the empire and try to lose yourself, which isn't so much fun.  Negotiations never really went anywhere, and the 'three, two, one' pointing at a pile was a bit lame.  Random cards made it tough to do anything strategically.  Totally without theme as well.  No, I don't need to revisit this anytime soon.

A friend backed this on one of the German equivalents to Kickstarter and brought it along to a games night looking to give it a run. My initial impressions are very positive.

In the game each player is a faction attempting to gain political control in a steampunk world currently ruled by a despotic ‘kaiser’. The game is played over three months each of four weeks, so 12 turns in total. When you win a turn, you get to take one of the cards from the winning faction (not necessarily yours) and score it. Scored cards are also removed from the game.

However, the real joy comes at the end. If any faction beats the Emperor's score, then whichever faction has the most, wins the game (each player is given a secret faction at the beginning of the game). However, if that faction has 15 or more points over the next closest faction, then they have overthrown the emperor, but done so in such a brutal way, that they are immediately overthrown, and the 2nd player wins the game. If none of the factions have more points than the emperor, than the emperor has beaten down all of the rebellions and the player in LAST place wins (they receive the least punishment from the emperor).

My one play went very well and this innovative scoring system was a real factor in most decision making. One player tried to keep their faction point-less and help the emperor, another (me) tried to push on for a victory and push up the faction most likely to come second and another (the second faction) helped me more than I would have liked to their own detriment on the score chart.

At the end of the game my collection of VP chits pushed me just ahead of the emperor (sorry, Mr No Points), but just a bit too far ahead of the second faction. In short, I topped the despot but was far too brutal and was punished for my brutality.

Game components are of very good quality and the art is quite evocative of the genre.

I’d play this again and would even consider purchase if the price was right

Twelve almost identical rounds of simultaneous card selection influence tug-of-war with multiple secret goals. Tries to be almost too clever for its own good but luckily manages to stay, although just barely, on the working side. Not including loyalty cards for the card selection is a really strange oversight, though. 

Probably needs the full five players to unleash its potential. Excellent artwork.

This game fascinates. You can play a game and subsequentially you can discuss the 'what ifs' at least as long as the game playing time.

In secret you represent one of the five factions and there are three (!) possible winning positions: first, second (if first is at least 15 points further than the second) or last (when the Kaiser wins).
So there are a lot of parameters you have to keep an eye on!

Really nice game!

There's some interesting tension in this in predicting which faction is going to do well over a round, plus having your secret objective that you're working to go for the entire game.

RATING: 7
Interesting bluffing/deduction card game built around a headache-inducing web of incentives. Players want their secret faction (suit) to be the highest-scoring at the end of the "year", but players also score points for that faction by temporarily backing the strongest each "week" (round) and "month" (four weeks per month, three months for the game). Complicating matters further, players can play for the revolution or against it, as traitors in the service of the Emperor.

The win-condition is triple-barreled: if the Emperor wins, the "winner" is the faction with the fewest points. If a faction wins, they win -- unless they are 15+ points ahead, in which case the others tear them down (to avoid a new tyrant being installed) and the second-placed player wins. The hidden factions makes it rather difficult to tell what any given player is actually aiming to do.

Discussion/negotiation is explicitly encouraged and it is probably best as a social experience with a high degree of outright lying. Needless to say, it is unusually opaque for a card game -- and my biggest concern is that it is [i]so[/i] opaque that the winner will tend to be effectively random. Experience will tell.

Cards are black-bordered and easily damaged: sleeving is a good idea.

Rating highly tentative. It needs more experience than I have.

This rating is based on playing the Prototype 3 times.
A very clever card game with unique winning conditions. At first glance it feels strange to sometimes back other than your own faction. Once you realize, that all points garnered for "taking a trick" (it is by no means a normal trick taking game, but I couldn't find a better analogy) are in the end added to your faction, the game gets really interesting. Am I trying to support my faction directly? Or am I going with the flow of the "trick" and try to be with the leading faction, thereby gaining points?
All in all a system that wants to be discovered, but once you get your head around it, this promises to be very interesting.

Update:
Played a few more times and it is still great. Rounds with experienced players are very interesting indeed. If you feel the emperor wins to many games, play with the official variant found here:

Similar theme as Arkham Horror, but this one feels completely mechanical and has no roleplaying or adventuring feel at all. It also seems to have some translation oddities. Very strange mechanics for the theme (kill monsters with magic glasses and potions). Not fun enough to play, given how difficult it is to win (largely due to randomness).

This was my first modern boardgame and my gateway to the hobby.

Witch of Salem is an intense cooperative game and a very unforgiving one. It's has very nice components and I especially like the art on the cards and the board: really good-looking with this dark style. As far as gameplay is concerned, the mechanisms are very simple. The luck factor is present, but it's reasonably dosed and it also seems to bring the game to life. The way the event cards sometimes combine with the monsters and completely ruin your plans... It's almost like that board has its own will! You're REALLY fighting against the game! That's something I love about Witch of Salem... and it's very lovecraftian. I have to specify that I play without the absurd "do-not-tell" rule, but it doesn't affect the gameplay so much, because it's still hard as hell. 

So... Witch of Salem has been called "Arkham Horror for Eurogamers". I think it's an appropriate description and I also enjoy this one MUCH more! It's a puzzle to solve, which is what I expect from a cooperative game... unlike its "big brother", which is merely a dumb luck-fest.

This is the game Arkham Horror wanted to be. When comparing to AH lot's of unnecessary chrome is removed and rules are steamlined to "euro style". Difficulty level seems harder and that's a good thing.

23rd Board Game I bought :D Saw this for half price at The Gamer's Market Spring 2015 and bought it :P Its a pretty decent HP Lovecraft Co-Op Game; artwork is really great especially the board. The only thing I mind about is the secrecy of information (the dimension rifts); you could alter the rule by maybe having the player who knows just close the rift him/herself but can ask others for the right artifact. Nice Game :)

Very smartly designed puzzle-ish game that injects some welcome theme to create both atmosphere and tension.
Definitly more strategy a possible routes than Arkham horror but might become more repetitive in the long run.
Future sessions will prove it's replayability.
The artwork is stunning, especially the board that is rich with detail and dramatic lighting.

RATING: 3
It’s appalling to see how the typical euro sloppiness can waste and dull even such a rich theme as Cthulhu: as a matter of fact there’s nothing even remotely thematic in Witch of Salem, a flat cooperative game where you simply take actions without caring about the story or even noticing what’s happening in the game. Random creatures keep popping up but do nothing harmful even when you try and fail to defeat them: in the worst case, they rob you of an item or two and let the counter move closer to the final reckoning.

Moreover, there’s no real sense of impending danger or looming threat in the game: you can’t have any interest in what’s happening on the board, as the game itself makes you only play to optimize your moves, coordinate the effort and gather the items you need, to the point it feels like the umpteenth identical game about resource management, not the deep and unique experience a game - and even more so a thematic one - should create.

No matter how things went, in the end you feel like you wasted your time trying to solve a logistical problem rather than you struggled hard to save the day and defeat frightful creatures from another dimension.

But, again, there’s no such thing as heroes in an euro.

RATING: 7
Arkham Horror the Euro game?  This game came out and was brutally reviewed.  Most people said it was themeless and the rule about not talking about open portals is dumb.  Well you can easily play without that rule and the game has plenty of theme.  Yeah, if you consider theme plastic minis and cards with flavor text blurbs to be theme...then yeah this game is themeless.  However, the excellent artwork and abstract nature do a great job of conveying the hopelessness of a Lovecraft story.  The game forces you to fill in the blanks of your adventure, but the theme is there and it DOES work.  You will feel hopeless and think that all is lost.  Fantastic, overlooked co-op.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A nice co-op, in the vein of Pandemic or Ghost Stories, but ultimately fails in my view because of the "cant tell your partners what you know" rule. Basically, I understand it. But looking more deeply, it seems that you cannot give your partners any advice, as that advice could be skewed by your knowledge. Should the game be played in silence? The fun of co-ops, imho, is all the arguing, deciding, and banter that goes on, as to how to handle certain situations. This is removed from this game, if you play strictly by the rules.

In short, it's an over-simplified re-take on Arkham Horror.  This game has the same theme but very different gameplay.  The rules are long and moderately complex, but it's a pretty easy game once you get started.  It's interesting the first time you play (especially the witches that mess with the unstable areas), but I found it somewhat boring on the 2nd play.

DETAILS:
Player movement is simplified (versus A.H.) and involves cards (you have one card for each location and you have to visit Miskatonic to replenish).  There are only 4 types of items (plus artifacts which seal locations), but the items must be used in groups to defeat monsters.  The items also have individual powers to aid players (ex. pink potions restore sanity).  The monsters work a lot different than Arkham Horror.  In H.V.S. they mostly hinder players by stealing items and blocking locations.  Unlike A.H. players don't know which locations have open gates, you must spend blue eyeglasses tokens to determine if a location is a gate or a decoy (blank).  The incentive is that if any decoys are sealed at the end, the players LOSE THE GAME!  Also, over the course of the game, you are trying to determine who the big bad guy (Ancient One) is going to be... this is done by revealing the cards (monsters) that ARE NOT the big bad.

RATING: 4
Some say this is Arkham lite ... if you mean Arkham Hoorror with all the tension, fun and the majority of theme ripped out then I agree.

Game is way too abstract for me - and some of the mechanics don't make sense to the theme. Why can I only visit each place once until I return to the University? 

There isn't much narrative or immersion, the tension is minimal until things snowball out of control - and the rule about not conferring about portals is very contrived and probably just there to make the game more challenging. Why can't I tell my fellows that a location is safe?

No character development (other than collect stuff), no differentiation. All in all a major disappointment.

Not Arkham lite, rather arkham sanitised and abstracted into a boring puzzle, even the co-op element isn't very co-op, as you can't all plan what to do with the 'can't talk about portals rule - then add in the monsters than move them about ...'

Just a bit 'meh'. Rather play Arkham for the arkham experience, if I want a filler co-op, I'll stick with pandemic.

RATING: 3.5
Graphics hui but game pfui.
Awesome Artwork combinded with a superb theme.
But in the end an awfully bad designed coop game, with the core concept of collecting items and walk to one of the six locations. All the players have the same abilites (weak point #1) so the items they hold and the locations to which they can move and maybe health (sane) points are the only thing in which they differ. Overlong and the game breaker is that you have to look under secret tiles and you aren`t allowed to say or make a mimic what is under the tile, this information is game-decisive! C`mon what the hell should such a crap in a coop-game! This feature is against the whole game spirit. So I suppose that this game was never primary designed as a coop-game. Kosmos must it raped to a coop. Maybe they should publish a non-coop variant to banish the false coop-spirit from this game.

Fast wäre es das langersehnte Arkham Horror light, aber dafür ist es ein wenig zu europäisch. Eine Regel gebietet Stillschweigen, nämlich zu den entdeckten Portalen, was etwas künstlich wirkt. Das hätte man vielleicht anders lösen können. Trotzdem, das Spiel ist spannend und sehr gut balanciert. Das Thema ist durchaus getroffen und das Material sieht sehr schön aus.

RATING: 4
Pretty much what you expect from making a Euro out of Arkham Horror.  
 - All characters are the same.  No special powers.
 - No dice rolls for combat; just have the right items and you win.
 - No spells, special weapons, crazy/inventive items, etc.  Just four different items and a portal seal.
 - Only 12 random events which get recycled throughout the game.

The result is a game that plays faster and is easier to learn and play correctly.  It also results in a game that feels much more mechanical and has little variety.  Hexer reminds me of Ghost Stories in that respect.  

There are several other elements to Hexer that I don't care for (especially the highly random difficulty level) but this "comment" is already too long.  Maybe I'll write a review.

I'll play Hexer if someone wants to, but it's not a game I'll suggest and I won't be keeping my copy.  After four plays, with widely different event and gate distributions, I have seen most everything the game has to offer.  Because there is so little variety in the events, items and monsters, the game plays pretty much the same way each time and players have no ability to use anything but the same tactics in each game.  I would much rather play Arkham Horror even with its longer playing time.

It sounds relatively straightforward - travel round Arkham to collect the resources to beat the monsters and close all the interdimensional gates before battling the Great Old One and closing the final gate for victory.  Except, of course, it doesn't go that smoothly - the items and artifacts you need have a terrible habit of slipping through your fingers when you need them most and your tenuous grip on sanity slips too close to madness too often. 

The cthulhu theming then is well done then and the game plays well too - a bit on the chaotic side but the randomness is compensated for by the co-operative nature of the game (and this is cthulhu after all).  

On first play, the game appeared finely balanced - we were one step from losing early before revealing the Great Old One then one step from a terminal loss before closing the final gate (and that was using the 'flip a revealed gate' variant which should make things easier).  Second time round however we won easily - the addition of a fourth player does appear to make it easier.

If forced to choose one co-op game I'd probably give the edge to Pandemic but there's no doubt WoS is a more flavoursome experience.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really tried and wanted to like this one, but I think it's just not there. The problem is that the issues regarding player communication are just too severe. The "look at a gate tile but don't communicate about it" rule is completely unworkable, and it's totally not clear what the design intent was or what the rule is trying to achieve. Whatever, it seems clear that it limits player cooperation too much in the one critical area, that of closing gates. Without being able to coordinate on gate sealing, the cooperative element of the game just isn't interesting enough.

A shame, because there is almost a really good game here, and Kosmos is usually pretty good with finishing issues like this. But not on this occasion.
---
Played once. I think it's got potential; hard to say to clearly, we screwed up a couple minor but significant rules. Has the major upside of being fairly short (45-60 min), good tension, good momentum, good story vector. Variability seems pretty high though, and some bad breaks may make it impossible to win.

Pretty good as far as cooperative games go in my personal view.

However, the way in which knowledge exchange about the portals is enforced is odd: One might encode information into the free item exchange possibilities. The question is whether this would be encouraged or discouraged by the designer. Neither way would please me, because either it is contrived or bad design.

Loved the way the game handled the Lovecraftian concept of beyond the comprehension of human beings by not letting players talk about that which is incomprehensible.

Unfortunately, we eventually noticed that good plans, bad plans, it didn't matter, we won or lost based on how often Necron was drawn.

RATING: 5
I was really looking forward to a "Euroized" Arkham Horror, but the end result is a game that feels rather lifeless. The mechanics aren't bad, but don't do much to stand out either. The theme is there, but pretty weak. The flavor text and art are seriously lacking (the board is gorgeous, but the monsters and characters are not.)

I'd like to give this a shot with more players to see if it affects my rating. So far I've only done 2p.

Seems to be easier than most of the co-ops I've played and lacks the tension I've become accustomed to in this genre. The only difficulty in this game comes from luck (cards and tile draws) - between this and not having any variable scenarios or difficulty levels, there's not much reason to come back once you've beaten it.

The one thing that did stand out for me in a positive way was the Great Old Ones themselves. I liked that you could have several function as "Shadows" over the course of the game and suffer their effects unless you defeated them (an optional boss fight in a board game??), and I liked that you had to reveal the baddest of them all by a certain point but knew that it would produce a negative effect once revealed - it's interesting to gauge when the best time to reveal him is. Revealing them one at a time until you get to the final Big Bad is nice as well, as it allows you to start eliminating options early on so you can start guessing as to who it might be and what items you'll need to collect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On the plus side, this game is much more fun and easier to get into than Arkham Horror.  On the minus side, there is so much random in this one that I'm not sure there is much of a game.  There are not many ways to mitigate the heaping mounds of random the game throws at you even if the game gives you many things to do. You just have to try and complete your objectives and hope one of the many random elements of the game doesn't twist the knife too hard - so the actual game is really just about how good you are at co-operating and getting lucky. Even tactical elements that should factor into your decisions like where the Hexer is moving is completely random and out of your control.  The two things I really don't like about the game are 1) information you are not allowed to share (its a co-op, c'mon!) and 2) the ability for the game to not allow you defeat a bad guy after planning to do so because of a bad die roll.

Call of Cthulhu light. Good game mechanics still give you that co-op tension, themed well, and plays quickly with very little setup. However it gets very dry fast and plays a little long. Still faster than Arkham but not fast enough. Need to try it with just three players.

Co-op, Euro-style. A very calculated gameplay experience. Collecting and managing the right items, making sure you're exactly where you need to be, etc. And then hoping that random events and dice rolls don't screw you over! Generally very difficult but still a good time. 

Theme is okay, but it's very much Lovecraft 3 times removed. Some of the art on the cards, seems like the artist didn't do their homework and just went with the direction of "teeth and tentacles", reguardless of some of the most iconic Great Old Ones presented in the game. Overall, visually, everything is very rich, nice board.

A coop in the Cthulhu mythos. Players run around in Arkham searching for portals to demonic dimensions which need closing. Then there is a evil guy with the name of Necron helping the Old Ones along, forming a few choke points the players must manage as a side job. The game is helped along with evocative artwork from Franz Vohwinkel, so there is nothing which stands in your way of cleverly cooperating your way out of this major predicament.

Or is there? There's a few odd issues about this game. The rule which forbids the players to talk about the precise nature of a portal tile seems rather weird at first, but was introduced to make the Witches work. So it's probably understandable, although I still think it is a silly and gamey rule which should have been replaced with some other nasty effect. What irked me most about the first time I played it was that blasted die. Out of the 15 or so 'combats' I and my fellow players fought, the die made us lose a crucial object in about 8 or 9 cases [i]before[/i] we could get rid of the monster. Therefore it cannot be a member of the Dice Done Right Club™. The game deteriorated into more or less the same quagmire which plagues Ghost Stories: in order for a coop to work, players must be absolutely sure that their actions will have a certain effect. Strictly speaking that is the case in Hexer of Salem, but the necessity of mostly throwing a die before said actions are taken, thus introducing the possibility that the action cannot be taken, amounts to the same thing. It's the same with the Hexer himself: yes, he provides a boost which is sometimes very useful, but he moves about randomly and is therefore rarely of use to the players. In other words, Hexer von Salem fails for much of the same reasons that make Ghost Stories so difficult to stomach. It [i]is[/i] easier to learn, though, and has less weird gamey rules and such. In that, Hexer wins out. It might succeed as a coop, but as a [i]good and fun to play[/i] coop, it fails rather badly. I and my fellow players decided to try again in the near future, but I am fairly sure the game won't improve by much, and therefore expect the rating to stay put.

[b]Update[/b] The rate stays put. What a terrible mess of randomness, this title. How can you decide whether loss was due to good play but overwhelming randomness, or bad play but regular randomness? The answer is: you can't. And that is simply bad and lazy game design. Oh, there's bound to be masochists who will proclaim that this is what makes the game 'exciting', and that it wouldn't have you keep coming back for more otherwise. I suppose that if you think it's fun to play a game in which you have to roll Yathzee five times in a row in order to win that the idea makes sense. I prefer to have skill take a clear lead.

Very luck dependant, and luck can frustrate your plans, so a little annoying. Good theme and intense.

Edit: After more matches, game time decreases and all have more sense. Luck is not so a problem if you search only for a tense and demanding experience. More tactical than Arkham Horror.

Forget the debate about whether or not you reveal the portals to your teammates -- you barely get to see any portals if the game clobbers you first!  Every time we lost we checked the rulebook to make sure that, yes, that was the end of the game, and no, we hadn't played any rules wrong.  The game was just finished.

I don't mind hard co-ops, but I do think they need to give us some easier levels to get used to the mechanics.  It's frustrating to play the first half of the game over and over.

I appreciated the inclusion of both male and female meeples.

Players are characters moving around Salem, trying to seal portals and defeat the Great Old One.  Cooperative game played over around 20 turns.  Players introduce a creature to Salem, or trigger it's powers if it's already on the board.  Then players each take a turn - they must move, then encounter any monster at their location, then may use items to recover sanity, seal portals, etc.  Finally, they may draw an item from the location.  The game is won when all the shadows, plus the Great Old One, is revealed and sealed behind their portals.  Solid, almost generic cooperative fare.  Looks wonderful the but game play is very antiseptic ... the game makes you do a bit of evil, then you do some good stuff, and repeat.  I can think of about 6 cooperative games I'd rather play ahead of this, from the sublime Lord of the Rings, down to Shadows Over Camelot.  Close, but it just lacks a .... soul?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An elegant and thematic cooperative puzzle.  The Portal secrecy rules add a neat bit of tension to a 4 player game, but they are certainly not necessary to enjoy it.  I recommend only bothering with them when (errr... if) it gets too easy for you.  This game works great solo and would get bonus points from me for that... but it loses more points for not having variable player powers.  That's a huge oversight - especially with a game as difficult as this one is.

I don't understand how people can compare this game to Arkham Horror.  Aside from theme, they share almost nothing in common - they have TOTALLY different mechanics and gameplay.  Witch of Salem is much more like Ghost Stories than it is like Arkham Horror.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The ratings, lack of buzz, and the length of time it took to publish it in English should have been a clue as to what was waiting for me with this game. I think most people want a mini-Arkham Horror but it's not the most thematic experience but it is faster. It's almost like the Euro version of Arkham Horror except there are still die rolls to be made. When people mentioned that people who like Ghost Stories would probably like this, I got excited. This lead to disappointment. It's not a really bad game, it just lacks variety and difficulty scaling.

The rules add a rule that destroys the 'co-op' in this co-op game. You're not supposed to discuss if you find a portal or not at a location after you use one of your items to investigate. People have ignored this rule and still get destroyed because this game is merciless. I feel that in this game, that you're much more subject to the randomness of the game than other co-ops. Ignoring the rule mentioned above I've won 2/5 games and I don't feel there was much skill involved at all. I did learn a few things within my first two games, but then have plateaued and have only won through more good events than bad events, and lucky rolls of the Loss die. I'm willing to play this again but there are other co-ops I would rather play.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

What the rules lack are ways to decrease the difficulty. Here are my game groups opinion on ways to do that. Enjoy!

1) Character special abilities as follows:

Green: His focus is the Book chits. When he uses the book he reveals two GOO's instead of one. Alternate or Extra ability: If a shadow is to appear at Miskatonic University, Green chooses which GOO will be the shadow of the revealed GOO's excluding the GOO at Ryleh.

Blue: Her focus is the Glasses chits. When she uses the glasses she can look at any portal regardless of her current location. Alternate or Extra ability: She may tell other players if a portal is at the location.

Yellow: Her focus is the Potion chits. When she uses a potion the amount of Sanity gained is increased by one. Alternate or Extra ability: When she uses the potion she may have it affect any character.

Orange: His focus is the Dagger chits. The Witch of Salem does not need to be in an area for Orange to use the dagger. Alternate or Extra ability: He never losses items if there is an item result on the Loss Die, but Necron and Sanity results have the normal effects.

2) Ignore the rule that says you can't talk about the Portals unless playing with the above character variant that allows portal discussion with the blue character.

3) Play with a set number of portals, easiest mode would be starting with 2, easy would be with 3, normal would be with 4 and then completely random portals as the rulebook conveniently provides has variable difficulty. The benefit of playing with fixed portals is that you may not have to check all 6 locations for portals once you find the number you're playing with, it all depends on how lucky you are when you investigate. Less portals is also less resources and time you'll need to devote before you can start trying to end the game.

4) The Necron marker will start the game at Demon Space. Once the marker reaches the Dimensional Rift, the Necron marker is then moved to the Necron marker starting space and the rules are the same from there on out. This variant just gives you a bit of extra time to try and get everything done.

I like that it has a quick playing time but still has a  strong theme and a good sense of urgency/challenge throughout the game. Never played Arkham Horror but it does strike me as a more playable version.

My biggest peeve is the rule preventing players from communicating about where the gates are. It just forces players to be creative in stretching the rule and they will, because closing gates is highly critical in the game! Maybe the rule is intended to prevent communication between players at different locations, but I don't see why players at the same location, since they can exchange items, can't communicate with each other as well.

[2 plays] Incredibly derivative of Arkham Horror, but much shorter and simpler, which I guess was the point.  This was reasonably fun, but I don't like the table-talk rules.  Not being able to say where the portals are not only makes the game more difficult, it seems out of harmony with the theme.

Really enjoyed this co-op game.  The Cthulhu theme is really just a backdrop but the game engine works well.  The game has enough randomness to make it replayable and the tension is felt keenly in that you can't simply hoard items and go for a big push; time moves forward in many different ways and the pressure is on the players to do everything at the same time with limited options.  I liked it on the first spin and the next one won't be too far off.

Felt like a mix between Arkham Horror & Ghost Stories. In Ghost Stories you're both collecting tokens as well as throwing dice and using locations. Here you're traveling between locations, collecting tokens to deal with the menacing creatures, while sometimes using the help of a witch in order to lower your misfortune. While in Ghost Stories you can plan ahead a bit further, in Hexer von Salem the luck of the draw and the die roll before attacking a monster is just a bit higher. Therefor I rate it lower. But it comes pretty close, to be honest.

Gorgeously produced.  I love the theme.  Some cool gameplay stuff going on here.  It's a Euro version of Arkham Horror, more or less.  Artwork is fantastic.

I'll warn you, though--it is probably THE hardest co-op game I've ever played (Ghost Stories is a close second, though.)  And the rule about "no talking about portals" is IDIOTIC.  I've just seen a portal to the outer realms, and I can't tell these other people I'm working with about it?  Even though that's our goal, to close these portals?  WHAT?

We blatantly and cheerfully ignore that rule, and the game is still plenty damned hard.  But I'm dinging it a point for even having that rule in there in the first place.  It's stupid.

The game is gorgeous for one thing. It might be the slickest depiction of Arkham in a game that I've seen. The game is hard, but that's what you want in this style of game. In the past I've played games where the designer tried to "Eurofy" a long thematic game and it ended up being anemic and themeless. Here we have a streamlined Arkham Horror, but somehow it works and means less set-up, less table space and less rules. I think that's a pretty impressive accomplishment. 

We had too many monsters out and when Necron popped up, we were done for. I think not communicating about the gates is fine, you just have to plan for it, or look for tells. It's not a dealbreaker the way people make it out to be, and if it's bothersome it's an easy rule to ignore.

Update: Played solo with two characters and won by the skin of my teeth. I was one turn away from losing the game. Nice tension throughout! Shame this didn't do better and is out of print, since there's room to expand with new creatures and events.

Played once and lost.  For some reason, I found the rules extremely confusing and I had to consult a few articles and videos here on the geek to sort things out.  I feel like our first play was largely wasted on constantly consulting the rulebook (which isn't even that lengthy) and now that we have finished the game, I can understand the gameplay much more than when actually playing. I'm really hoping to give this another try because I absolutely love the game board and feel that this game has a lot of potential for fun.

This game is now up for trade. I doubt I can convince my usual group to give it another try.

The German "Arkham Horror".

Basically a "pick-up-and-deliver" coop (mostly played solo), that works well and quite smoothly.

I just don't like the rule that forbids a player to tell the others if the tile is a portal or not: it seems an artificial way to increase the difficulty, and takes some of the cooperative aspect away.
Otherwise, it's fine.
Nice art and atmosphere.

RATING: 7
While not as detailed as Arkham Horror, the game still has considerable atmosphere and a persistent sense of dread at the approaching horror.  Defeat always seems to be imminent, but the system provides just enough opportunities to keep the flame of hope burning.  It is the sort of tense atmosphere of impending doom that makes Lovecraft's novels so engaging, and helps make Witch of Salem an entertaining romp.

A pleasant cooperative game on the Euro side of the spectrum, relatively fast, simple and straightforward. It may suffer from an excess of randomness, with strikes of bad luck, but that seems to be a feature of cooperative games. I really like the theme, and I find its implementation just satisfactory, with some unthematic gameplay elements that put it right in the middle of the road between thematic and abstract. The art is very good, particularly on the cards of the Great Old Ones, although someone has commented on the lack of fidelity to Lovecraft's descriptions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 'secrecy' rule just seems to go counter to a cooperative play game.  Plus, there is no way to mitigate or figure out to do when someone unintentionally gives away something due to the lack of a poker face.  Then couple that with, how exactly are you suppose to strategize if you can't tell them you need to 'close a gate'.  Are you really suppose to go against the plans of the group after they want you do do something and you can't tell them you have better things to do?  Just a wonky rule that prevents the game from getting a much higher rating.

This is an excellent game with a strong thematic element.  There are many moving parts in this game to keep players occupied.  It creates a great sense of tension between adrressing the individual monsters, player sanity, and the overarching threat of the old ones.  It takes some time to get gameplay down because there is so much that occurs within the game.  I am surprised that this game is out of print, it has suitable depth to be compelling and suspenseful but not so deep that you have to feel continuously connected to the instruction book.  Great game!

If people think this is arkham horror light, they totally don't understand what arkham is about, because the only thing this game has in common with arkham is a cthulhu theme.  

In this shorter abstract version of arkham, there is no character development or narrative to speak of and numerous rules exist which don't have any thematic explanation.  The tension of arkham is gone until things go to hell in der hexer.  

I don't think it is bad as a luck driven item collection coop game.  I just don't think calling it arkham horror light makes much sense.

The board is beautiful, and the object is about thwarting the monsters and ancient ones with rituals rather than overwhelm them with guns, which is nice.
However, the game felt too easy, so I had to re-read the rules and go through play sessions to be sure I got it right; I had the rules right, but the luck of the die rolls and event cards can make it very easy or very difficult.
The rule about not revealing where the portal is feels like a real hindrance and, in some instances, hard to follow.
edit: ditch that rule and you have a fast flowing, highly thematic gem of a game.

Somewhat mechanistic Euro with a Lovecraftian-thematic veneer.

For sure, the weird aspect of play is that whole "you can't tell the other players what you know about the portals" dealie which seems, well, artificial at best. However, we found a great workaround -- talk about the portals before you know anything! That is, assign portals to different players and let them carry out their "mission". Works great!

This game tries to be an Euro version of Arkham Horror, but fails at many key points.

The artistic quality of the game is good, but doesn't fit a Lovecraftian game. Pawns are pastel-colored, illustrations are hiperrealistic and colorful... it doesn't feel dark enough.

The rule that forbids players to share information about identified portals is simply stupid. How can you cooperate with the rest of the players without telling them? 

Have you ever played roleplaying games in which you had a powerful NPC on your side that basically made all your work and received all your glory? (a.k.a "nursemaid NPC") This game has one: every card reminds you that Robert Craven is cool, and you're not. I hate that. I want to be the protagonist of the games I play. I hate that "the winner is the guy who most impresses the King" Euro bullshit.

Also, this game has few diversity. Only four different items, just a few different monsters... It will burn quickly, as all games tend to look the same.

Wanted to like this cause I like coops and I like Arham. But... it's not as challenging or enjoyable as Ghost Stories and not as thematic as AH. Has the same "puzzle" feel as GS (and about as complicated, as opposed to easier Pandemic); but there is no soul here.  Big problem for me: Key decisions are mostly about who should get what when, not _how_ to defeat anything.  Not sure if the theme would be more immersive if I wasn't a fan of AH-- doesn't quite work. The portals don't do anything other than sit there waiting to be sealed. The monsters don't directly attack you, just steal your items. Come on!

RATING: 6
Quick and streamlined alternative to Arkham Horror with gorgeous graphic design. I don't need all the additional chrome of AH to create atmosphere. This appears to be harder to win than AH and some constellations just can't be won. Contrary to most others, not being allowed talking about the discovered portals didn't bother me although it's a slim line between following the rules and cheating a bit. I'm worrying more about repetitiveness and annoying dice rolls and especially about the big role of the appearance of the Necron card. To win you need to be lucky that it is repeatedly in the last half of the stack. More plays will prove me right or wrong.

RATING: 4
For people who love the theme, it's probably an okay game, but I don't enjoy the mechanics -- it feels like few (any?) real decisions are being made, and I'm not a fan of the theme, so no redeeming points on theme.

RATING: 5
This an be a tough game to win, but it isn't for lack of trying. All the careful planning and team work matters naught in this game. Tile placement and die rolls foil you at every turn. The amount of luck in this game is so heavy that tactics go out the window. It's a lot easier to grasp than Arkham Horror, but the heavy reliance and luck just doesn't appeal to me at all.

An interesting game, I will have to revisit my rating since we played a couple key rules wrong.  But I like the speed of play as well as the challenging difficulty of winning.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the whole Cthulu thing, but I would probably prefer this over Arkham Horror (though they are completely different games, despite their thematic similarities) mainly because of the much shorter game time.

Quick Lovecraftian cooperative romp.

Excellent production - pretty AND everything works.

We do play with one variation - when a ward is placed to close a rift, we flip it immediately and end the game if things have gone wrong.

We also object to the "don't talk about which rifts you see" rule. Seems daft and we can't see what it adds to the game.

RATING: 5
Its a bit hard for me to explain why I don't like this game. The game is just not that much interesting and exciting.

First, I like cooperative games, and I think one of the problem with this game is that it is hard to coordinate the players actions since there are many information to analyze which are on the player's sheet/hands and not on the board.

There are a few interesting mechanics, for example, the location visit mechanism is interesting. The only problem is that all the cards look alike and it is hard to know where other players have gone. I would have used instead tokens of the player's color to mark the location visited as the player moves.

Most of the game consist in collecting and managing objects which is in itself pretty boring. The penalty for picking an object also makes no sense, "take this item, lose 2 sanity" . Some object are only effective if the witch is there, but since it moves randomly, It is hard to gain the benefits.

The gate system is acceptable, it's just that a variable number of gates to close could lead to a different game balance in every game. So the number of gates should always be the same. I also don't like the fact that players cannot exchange gate location information even if they share the same space.

It happened in our game that each player were doing the same thing: I was aiming for killing monsters, another one was using books, another one was seeking the gates, etc. So unconsciously, everybody gave themselves a job and only did that for at least the first half of the game.

And by the way, the game is really hard. Personally, I think should be finishable at easy with newbie players and more experienced player should increase the difficulty. But when the easy mode is unfinishable, that is not a good thing.

So I think it was a great idea to make a simplified version of Arkham Horror, but there is still a lot of work to do to make the game interesting and exciting.

Had a lot of fun with this. Light and easy to play. The silence rule is ridiculous and totally non-thematic; clearly it was an arbitrary choice in order to increase difficulty. So we don't use it.

Artwork is gorgeous.

For my group this is the game that Arkham Horror should have been. It moves fast, has just the right amount of tension, and the artwork is very evocative of the game and setting.

Arkham Horror Lite @ 60 min play time.
TV says it's AH for euro-gamers, but doesn't speak highly of it primarily because  of the not sharing open portal information between players (who ARE cooperating). Others have suggested a variant where this information is shared and still maintain that the game remains challenging.

Decent cooperative game (but nowadays there are better alternatives available, whatever you're looking for: engaging narrative, challenging mechanics, simple rules,...).
Despite being loosely based on a rich theme (Lovercraft's Mythos), it is quite dry and simple and also fails to narrate much of a story.
There's a lot of randomness involved as well (improves replay value, devalues the importance of your decisions during the game).
Nice artwork on the gameboard, but the Ancient Ones (except Cthulhu) do not resemble at all their Lovercraftian descriptions (another mismatch between the theme and what the game turns out to be).

Awesome game if you like: 

1. A solid coop with great art

If Go is a 1 on the theme scale and War of the Ring is a 10 (with Settlers being a 2), then this game is a 6. 

Also, it has a solid production and a helpful (though not perfect) insert. 

By the way, it's also not that tough. My wife and I won on our first play, while only sharing information in a single location.

Initial impressions are reasonable. The game doesn't have much in the way of cards or items but the relatively simple mechanics mesh together to create a surprising variety in the challenges on offer. There's a lot of chaos in the game which keeps you on your toes but it feels as though you can take actions to control it, whether this is true or not. There are various things at work to mitigate the "Alpha-dog co-op problem" - most notably keeping portal information hidden - which are semi-successful. The biggest problem with the game is simply "meh" factor - it's fun enough but there's simply nothing particulalry new, clever or exciting about it for it to elbow its way to the table past other games.

Played at Great Lakes Games 2009

Ted Cheatham taught three of us the game and we had a blast playing. Coops aren't my favorite style of game but this was one of the funnest times I've played a game. We got down to one move on the "red disk" to die, and we'd closed all the portals and we were in position to kill the last Old One but we had to fight that one last monster at the university.  The monster rolled an eye which removed the last shred of sanity the player had and for that they died...killing our chances to win.  A huge roar of ARGGGGGGG rang throughout the hall!  Very fun!

Prett okay cooperative game with a Cthulu theme.  Difficult to win it appears, but also not impossible.

In this way, perhaps solo would be better.

This demands comparison with Pandemic, and comes up shot of the mark.  Abstracting away the combat was a mistake, as is the fiddly mechanism for closing the Portals - as a result, this is much less immersive than Pandemic, and you don't feel the same tension.  

Fix for the portals, by the way:
When you look at a portal, place a marker on it.  To seal a portal, you need to have the right artifact AND have a marker there.  Now you can discuss the portals, and it's no longer a memory game.

This game's artwork is gorgeous and, being a fan of Arkham Horror and HP Lovecraft, the theme is a winner for me. The game sucks, unfortunately. The characters are all generic, the information sharing restrictions are run counter to the theme, and the "I need 2 pair of glasses and 1 dagger to defeat this monster" is just a little too abstract for my taste. Wasted potential.

Thought it would Arkham Horror in  < 90min. However, where Arkham's sole purpose seems to be an effort to construct a narrative, Salem was simply... a boardgame. A cooperative one, that combined mechanics like Mission Red Planet location selection, Lord of the Rings resource juggling and expenditure, and a pasted on Lovecraft theme. It didn't feel terrible to lose it, or to win it. It just felt "shrug."

Wonderful light-ish co-op game with an Arkham Horror theme.  The game is fairly quick and fairly difficult.  At first blush there doesn't seem to be too many decisions, but the opportunity to coordinate turns is there and indeed crucial to survival.  Lots of randomness (dice, event cards, chit draws) but I found it all adds to the theme of dealing with forces beyond your control.  Strong recommendation to co-op lovers!

I'm not saying it's a bad game or anything but that it gets at least +1 in it's rating because of theme. It's a good cooperative game with simple rules.

Addictive and Intense! My wife is the spooky themed nut in our house...but I was surprised to find that I really like this game! The board, components, and artwork are really awesome! This a great medium weight and cooperative family game. It is also a very well balanced game that's tough to beat! The mechanics are outstanding! Each game turn runs quickly and smoothly! It reminds me most of the game Ghost Stories in that you are trying to kill the monsters cooperatively, using only the tools you have available to you...but WoS is still very different! It plays differently every game! Kudos to Michael Rieneck for making a game that is accessible to families or as a gateway game! Again, this IS a tough game to beat...but in a good way! Just when you think you are winning...the game tries to take you down!

After reading peoples views on this game I was concerned that I had made a poor purchase. A lot of people called this another Arkham Horror light type game. Maybe...but it is a great game in its own right!  AH is a game that my wife and I are great fans of and WoS has a feel that's totally different. One of the things that makes Arkham Horror...Arkham...is the Encounter and Other World decks. Going to locations and reading the encounter cards and OW cards creates unique stories for your character! The epic feel of AH I think is not supposed to be in this game! Wos is meant to be a medium weight game that can be played in under an hour...a great weeknight game with great intensity...perhaps even a gateway to AH! Therefore, I know I don't mind owning and playing both games!

This one has more than a slice of luck about it re losing essential items when trying to kill a creature, and the order that the event cards come out when things get re-set and the portals re-shuffled, but it's a fun ride trying to overcome the setbacks. And the rules and environment is relatively clean compared to other Arkham game-a-lithic  stuff. Move, suffer creature hit if there's one there, kill it if you can, use an item to advance, gain an item from the spot - gotta get those items, they're your key to the game. The game is about moving as risklessly as much as possible to get stuff, and choosing when to risk (move to a creature's spot) to get something that's urgently required. Each round a creature or two enters and potentially does bad stuff, each round an event card goes off which could be good or bad. Play for the ride and it can be fun even while it's all going horribly wrong, and satisfying when you get it done.

A Cthulu co-op on the same level as Pandemic, much much lighter than Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
"Great light Lovecraftian co-op. Best without the 'portal secrecy' rule. Better story arc and less randomness than Elder Sign."

What I like:
- The pretty map and narrative arc make it more thematic than Elder Sign
- The hand-of-cards mechanic works well
- When played without portal secrecy, the difficulty level is just about right

What I don't like:
- The portal secrecy rule reduces the social aspect AND makes the game too hard
- Losing items to creatures repeatedly can get frustrating
- If Necron shows up 3 times in the creature deck, you will lose
- Can't be played with one pawn; in 2p, a single death ends the game

This is a solid Cthulhu co-op. I'll put the weight at 2.4 instead of the BGG 2.5. Games tend to run 50-80 minutes, which is a really nice length.

There is a bit of cooperation (trading items; killing a creature so someone else doesn't have to face it; sharing bonus sanity points). Most of the cooperation comes in the form of discussing strategy each round.

This one has good ratings, but not much buzz. My wife has asked to play the game several times now, and it is probably her 2nd favorite game (after Vanished Planet). We both like WoS much better than Elder Sign.

Arrived on 26th JAN 2012! Oh Joy! The game turned out an instant hit! My group enjoyed it so much we played it several times within two days. Initially playing with a wrong rule, things turned out as feared: we are unworthy! The game is brutal! Will provide long lasting challenge and maybe we implement a "scoring system" of wins per every 10 games! After an initial impression of 8 I'll raise it to 8.5 and it might hit the 9 depending on the lasting appeal of it, but for now, another hit for Michael Rieneck!

The game looks fabulous, beautiful board, great cards, charming wooden pieces. Game mechanic is waaaaaaaaayyy better than Arkham Horror and any downfall in terms of theme when compared to AH is easily overlooked by the high level of interaction. Players avidly discuss the course of action which is something I didn't feel about AH because of the very high randomness of... everything! Salem easily rules over "Arkham-Horror-dice-game-in-disguise" in my book!

When people say that this game is Arkham Horror light, it means that it's less complex, but by no means easier, on the contrary, quite tougher actually.

- The rule book is just a bit confusing. It's not the wording, just the way it's structured makes it a bit more difficult to understand than necessary. But once you sort that out, it's really easy, surprisingly few rules, easy to explain, hard to play! Great Game!

This game fails where "Ghost Stories" succeed. It is to much luck dependant. In Ghost Stories there are enough possibilites to mitigate bad dice rolls. But here we got utterly crushed because we EACH time rolled the wrong dice! Maybe its me or maybe I'm going insane and Chtulhu has me! ;-) I will surely play this again bevore deciding on the final rating. It looks gorgeous, but the theme still feels a little bit pasted on.
Update: (10.02.13) played this game again after some time. It is still rather abstract, but I found it some fun. So I raised my rating

A nice light co-op game with an Arkham feel. Plays fast and mostly controllable, but the fact that the portal information is hidden is a little odd for a co-op game. Still, fun to play and plays quickly. Worth a try.

This game should never be compared to Arkham Horror - they're chalk and cheese.

As a standalone game it's fine - simple to teach and plays in under an hour. Great art, nice board and thick wooden pieces.

I'm not sure who it's aimed at. Art is a little too horrific for children & the current expanded version of Elder Sign is just as fast paced for those wanting something simpler than the Arkham-Eldritch Horror series.

Not sure I can recommend it - certainly fun to play but I wouldn't actively search out a copy.

Also if you do play it...
Ignore that rule...you know the one

One of our favorite co-op games.  It has probably the best board in existence.  Its normal difficulty is very challenging and probably the most difficult co-op.  There are a lot of tense decisions to make and a lot of coordination with your allies.

The comments about not communicating your portal observations are way overblown.  It shouldn't be an issue with experienced players.

Arkham Horror extra, extra light. I much prefer Arkham. (I would have liked it better themed non-Arkham probably, since I wouldn't be constantly comparing it to a heavier, meatier game that way.) In this game, you're collecting items to close portals, battle monsters and defeat the GOO.... (sound familiar?)  Really random... you can play a perfect game and lose due to draws. I find it more frustrating than fun.

Hard as heck, a real challenge. The agreement is that the silly rule of not sharing information is pretty stupid, and I think the best balance option for this is to allow sharing only when everyone meets at the University location, or for a simpler game (which guarantees no win!) just turn the symbol up as you find it and keep going.

Excellent game with a very strong theme.  The artwork is fantastic and really evokes an evil image in the players mind.  As others have pointed out, this game is VERY difficult.  The designer has done a great job at causing increasing tension throughout the game.  If you are celever enough to win, you really feel victorious because the victory did not happen for free.

Another good 'true' co-operative game. It remembers me Ghost Stories under many aspects. Artwork and components are really good; I appreciated the little booklet with the background story wich - although very short and simple - 'starts' the game adding flavor to it. The only problem is the game longevity in my opinion, because it ends to be a little too repetitive after some games.

Quite a difficult game for our group. We haven't gotten the hang of it yet, but it doesn't hit the board too often. It's too complex for times when we want a short game like Dominion, but it doesn't have the variety of larger games like Arkham Horror. It's fun, it just seems to typically get passed by in favour of other games.

Weird euro with mechanics that somehow dont feel that exciting but I have only played it solo (and beat it) so I might be wrong. Feels like a puzzle with some monster themed knockbacks. and it isn't that hard most of the event cards are good - that doesn't get mentioned. I can see why the portal ties are kept secret though I can see that would make things interesting. In any case it looks fantastic, that board is stunning. Had this game delivered on what it promised it would have been amazing. Still a keeper.

This game is so much fun, and it is tense in the way that the best games are tense. The odds are against the players, but I like that in a coop. It makes the wins more memorable and more exciting. Playing to a foregone conclusion of a win would make playing the game entirely futile. We play this game to play our best, feel the fates aligning against us, fight the good fight, and see what happens...and that's thrilling!

I'm not a fan of cooperative games. Witch of Salem proved to be an exception for me. The HP Lovecraft theme works well and the game itself moves forward very nicely. Easy to play already in the first game and there's so many things going on that you don't easily get the feeling that somebody is playing the game for you. You quickly get to a spot where you really plan the moves together and figure out the next move.

This game is not Arkham Horror. Actually, it reminds me of a cross between Arkham Horror and Pandemic. It has the "puzzle-solving" feel of Pandemic but the same theme and elements as Arkham.

I came into this game wanting to like it, seeing as I like the theme, and that's about all I like about this game, the rest isn't really worth it.

The Mechanic of keeping the information of what is on the locations to themselves and moving around the board at random in one direction is just not fun when all that information can be completely ruined by someone else, and if you give out said information, the game just becomes too easy. It's like the game was made too easy and they tried to salvage this by adding the "don't tell anyone" mechanic to fix the problem. Then the rest is not really worth mentioning it all seems like mechanics trying to salvage the gameplay in some manner and then failing the game, like the Sauron like mechanic from Lord of the Rings.

Worst piece of crap game i have ever played... nothing here salvaging the game.

Cooperative, Adventure. This feels like a streamlined, lighter Arkham Horror -- which works well for it. The cooperative part is a little unclear since you can't communicate about the most critical information in the game, so I'd like to see another play or two with how it works out.

First, I have to mention that this game took hours to figure out the poorly translated rules with three restarted games. I am trying not to let that influence my opinion, but I feel that I should mention it.  Still, we gave it our all to make sure that we played this correctly, and we finally got everything correct.

Those that are die-hard Cthulhu fans will be stoked about this, sadly you will also be let down pretty hard.  Unlike the great story that is told by playing Arkham Horror, this is just a set collection game with tons of friction added to slow down anything productive getting done and a lot of luck.  It takes AH, bleaches it, Euroizes it, and leaves it cold, shallow, and boring.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
A co-operative game set in an HP Lovecraft theme, combining aspects of 'Arkham Horror' - early 20th Century investigators in Arkham seeking to strave off the rising of a Great Old One from R'lyeh by closing portals/gates with magical artifacts, battling cultists and monsters and loss of sanity while a doom track counts down - with more abstract Euro elements - bland generic characters, with random movement of the helpful 'Witch' character and matching of symbols and die-rolling substituting for combat and adverse events.  So, not really AH-lite, as it lacks the depth and RPG feel.  Still good fun though - and scales well from 2-4 players.  

Beautifully produced artwork and components that assist the theme to hang on during a game, which is very much shorter than Arkham Horror, takes up less space, and is easier to teach.  We ignore the controversial 'can't communicate about the portals rule', but it's still hard to win.  There are many ways to lose, but only one way to victory (which requires the survival of at least 2 players).

A good game in itself, but I also think it's quite a good gaming intro to the Cthulhu Mythos - if people 'get' the HPL theme this way, AH should not be such a big step up.

I've only played once. 

It's a cooperative game, and I generally don't like those as much as the more usual competitive game. But even for a coop:
- it was too easy (we won, even though most of us were new to the game). Sure, we may have just been lucky, but I'd hope the first game would be more challenging.
- the theme isn't all that interesting to me
- the mechanics are OK, I guess -- it's meant to be a quick game -- but I'd hoped for something more interesting, more involved (rather than just moving around collecting a specific combination of stuff to scare off a monster)

It's probably worth another play, I suppose, but we have too many games to bother playing stuff that isn't very good.

A shame this game is not getting better ratings, which I suspect, is partly due to some people not giving him a fair chance. The game is *not* too hard. It is hard, that's all, which is perfect, since one quickly loses interest in easy coop games: You succeed early and learn that it's not necessary to master it to win, or you learn how to win and then succeed systematically. Both cases mean the game will quickly lose its appeal. Not here. Also, for anyone who likes Lovecraft lore, it is perfectly logical for the players to feel that odds are desperately stacked against them. I strongly believe anyone saying the game is too hard and giving this game a 3 never played enough to discover its depth.

Still, We have won a few times already and each victory felt like a real accomplishment. The game highly rewards strategic and tactical play, as well as organisation among players. While a series of bad luck (2 consecutive witches, for example) can take you down without much chance to react, some events also might happen to miraculously save you from a seemingly unavoidable failure. The game is beautiful, atmospheric, highly replayable. With Ghost Stories, it's the best real coop game around for players looking for something really challenging.

Certainly not a bad game, but it feels like many other games in which you're simply darting from place to place plugging holes while holes appear everywhere else (a la Pandemic or Shadows Over Camelot or Defenders of the Realm), and you're collecting X/disposing of Y in an attempt to balance everything perfectly. Seems like a basic abstract Euro rules set with the theme pasted on. For example, you'll find yourself trying to collect two of one object and one of another in order to defeat a certain monster, or three of a kind to defeat a different sort--not because those objects have the slightest thing to do with the monsters, but simply because the math of the game dictates it. The rules are blessedly short but the Lovecraftian vibe doesn't connect with the rather dry mechanics too well. If you have a powerful imagination and enjoy trolling through Arkham, you'll have a good time.

Initial impressions are reasonable. The game doesn't have much in the way of cards or items but the relatively simple mechanics mesh together to create a surprising variety in the challenges on offer. There's a lot of chaos in the game which keeps you on your toes but it feels as though you can take actions to control it, whether this is true or not. There are various things at work to mitigate the "Alpha-dog co-op problem" - most notably keeping portal information hidden - which are semi-successful. The biggest problem with the game is simply "meh" factor - it's fun enough but there's simply nothing particularly new, clever or exciting about it for it to elbow its way to the table past other games."

I'm a fan of cooperative games in general, and this one is no exception.  I like the insanity-inducing Cthulhu mythos, and this game works well at building the tension that a big baddie is on its way.  Players have to work together to close all the gates in time.  It's important to time out visiting the various locations since you can't revisit a place without going somewhere else first, and recharging your hand.

Contrary to the majority of reports on this game, we won our first, two-player game easily. Perhaps two-player is easier than three or four. There was, in fact, little tension (yes, we were playing correctly). The game lacked the many options and ability to get really creative that is prominent in Ghost Stories, and lacked the rich theme and psychological elements that shine in Battlestar Galactica. On the plus side, Witch of Salem plays much more quickly than Ghost Stories or Galactica (my top two cooperative games right now), but I don't think that'll be enough to keep it on my shelf.

Played once 3 player with my kids. The game seemed very easy at first, but we quickly ran into trouble. Very easy to kill the monsters, but then making progress revealing the shadows of the Great One is difficult. Definitely some room for strategy and might be a good one for the family.

The "don't ask, don't tell" portal rule is annoying in a co-op, but is supposedly easy to house-rule away.  With beautiful artwork but also some repetitive components, Witch of Salem offers 30% of the Arkham Horror experience in under half the time.  I'd rather play this.

This one was a pleasant surprise! The flow of the game is straightforward: the investigators move around Arkham, facing monsters while they gather items to use that are used to fight the said monsters or the shadows of the Ancient One, to reveal portals and also the shadows of the Ancient One and to heal sanity. All of this happens while events are drawn, some are good, some bad.

The goal of the investigators is to seal all the real portals (at the beginning they don't know which ones are real and which are false) and to cast away the Ancient One, by going into the Other World and using the proper items on it - this must happen in the same turn as other investigator seals the portal at the Miskatonic University. The players lose if Necron, the leader of the cultists, reach the end of his ritual (or a little sooner, if the player didn't manage to reveal the shadows of the Ancient One), or if the investigators sealed a false portal.

The gameplay is agile, really demands cooperation and, at least in our first attempts, is brutal. We lost 4 games in a row, two of them weren't even close ones - none of the games lasted for more than one hour (most clocked around 45 minutes). I played again, the next day, and also lose. No wins so far!

The theme isn't really thick - [b]Witch of Salem[/b] is more closely related with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65244/forbidden-island]Forbidden Island[/url] and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic]Pandemic[/url] than with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror]Arkham Horror[/url] or [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83330/mansions-of-madness]Mansions of Madness[/url]. But I liked it more than both the first ones - [b]Witch of Salem[/b] is an excellent option of a co-op game that plays fast and is challenging.

Step back to early 20th Century New England. Here, the horrible "Great Old Ones" mysterious inhabitants of a dark, unfathomable void-seek entry into our world. One of their imprisoned overlords gathers them, just as his worldly servants open portals throughout Arkham for the coming onslaught. Only Salem's master witch, Robert Craven, holds the key to safeguarding mankind. He plans to gather a team of intrepid scholars to find the hidden portals and close them with powerful magic seals. The noble witch's elite team must battle the threat of madness, duel the dark servants, tackle mystical challenges, and face their ultimate nemesis: an unidentified Great Old One with an unknown and incalculable strength.
In "Witch of Salem," you step into the terrifying world of renowned storyteller Wolfgang Hohlbein, a mythos inspired by the tales of H. P. Lovecraft. You play one of the witch's scholarly allies. Working cooperatively with your cohorts, uncover the secrets of the Necronomicon, combat creeping insanity, defeat the coming Evil, and bar the Great Old Ones from exiting the inter-dimensional abyss.

We were very excited to get this game and we could not have been more disappointed.  The board and components are really nice.  The gameplay was incredibly disappointing.  In a 4 player game each player is forced to draw 2 creature cards a turn.  This makes it impossible to clear the board out since you can only kill one creature on your turn.  So the game forces you to draw 2 cards a turn and if any of them match a card on the board something bad happens to you.  The game disincentivizes killing off half the creatures now because once their power is triggered they're dead on the board.  So you don't want to kill anything because something worse will just come out.  So the game devolves to moving to a location, rolling the dice of loss, and taking an item.  Then the necron card will pop up and you'll progress 8 more spaces on the lose the game track.  The good guy card that I assumed was to balance this out does not really help and often hurts you.  He resets everybody's list of locations they can visit by dragging everyone to the starting location.  This will foil your plans.  This game is not fun.

This game is very good ! My rating directly refers to the BGG rating chart. I will like to play is sporadically, if in the right mood.
It's not realy my sort of game (like Arkham Horror) but the game is realy well made with a beautiful artwork.

Arkham Horror Light. It feels strange that players cannot talk about the portals in a fully coop game. Still fun, nice artwork and rather short playing time (under 60 minutes).

RATING: 6
This is just too hard and the thing that makes it hard is the random elements, so there is no why to improve your play. You have always maximize your efficiency and HOPE that you never get any bad luck. In order to win, you must have both.

This could be forgiven if the gameplay was fun (like in Ghost Stories), but it isn't simply because it is too Euroish (i.e., no special different special powers, board location power, etc.). Dry, dry, dry and boring. 

However, it is very easy to house rule the game to make it a 7 or 8. That is what I have done (see Variants in the forum). One adds variable powers for players and board much like Ghost Stories. The other only adds some rules to make the game easier by limiting the power of the randomness and adding bonuses for doing good things, but still challenging. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not as good as Arkham (but I'm not sure what it would take for a game to reach such heights), but so far it seems like the best "lighter version of Arkham", and one of, if not the best shorter co-op.  Better than A Touch of Evil, and Ghost Stories. 
Very brutal game, Ghost Stories like in it's brutality.

RATING: 9
A Euro style Arkham Horror lite.  Though the game play may feel a little abstract the overall foreboding and feelings of impending doom (even when you are doing well) make this feel very much like AH.  Unlike AH you can play this game on a weeknight.  I love the theme. 

After my awesome wife got me this game for my birthday and we played it I thought it is very underrated.  It seemed way more immersive than reviews I have read previously lead me to believe (I have to disagree with you this time Tom Vasal).  Also, the non shared information people seemed to hate never became an issue.  We started the game with a plan that I would check gates 1 to 3 and she would check gates 4 to 6.  It was easy to realize which gates were open from how my partner reacted after looking at a gate.  I think you could play the game with open information, but I think that rule added to the theme rather than detracted from it by adding to the unease (after all some things are too horrible to talk about).  Also, by not having open information the game avoids a problem that many coop games suffer from - that the most dominant or experienced player ends up controlling all of the action.  Can't happen if there is hidden info.

At first I felt this game might be too easy, but the difficulty ramps up towards the end and we actually lost the first game (edit: 5 plays now 0 wins - still love it).  I know we will play this again soon! 

edit: after 10 plays we have won 3 times.  We are starting to get better at this.

new edit: after 22 plays we only have 4 wins total.  I guess we're not getting better, but I think we're getting close to figuring it out.

One play, Spiel 08.  Co-operative game with a rule that prevents co-operation: you can ignore it (we did) and it makes the game too easy.  The players must find out in which locations are the portals, but are told not to share that information, forcing them to follow individual goals through most of the game that they cannot discuss with their fellow players.  The board is pretty, and the production is nice; there is quite a lot of German text.

This one is interesting and I think needs to be seen in two lights.

First, vs. the other big co-op Lovecraft games, Arkaham Horror. I think it soundly beats Arkaham Horror in that the play time is far more reasonable, the game is cheaper, and not much is lost in the reduced cost and game time.

Second, vs. other co-ops of about the same time, namely Ghost Stories. I think it is about tied with Ghost Stories. Witch of Salem wins on execution of theme, but Ghost Stories is a little more streamlined and feels quicker (though I would guess the actual gametime is about the same).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Tough tough game, with stunning, stunning artwork. Move around the board collecting various bits to fight the monsters, reveal the Great Old Ones, and seal the gates. Still trying to find the right balance of moves to make, game seems to hose us every time no matter what tack we take.

If you are looking for a light Cthulhu Mythos related co-op  game that can be played in an overall evening of gaming, this fits the bill. I had fun playing this game.

This is not a meaty game, and it feels over produced for the content, but because I love the Cthulhu Mythos, the great production values are a great thing for me. 

It really feels like this game needs expansions to provide game elements that are lacking such as diversity of resources, and special character powers. 

Witch of Salem suffers from the most common co-op failure: communications prohibitions. This could be fixed.

Un juego entretenido y cooperativo. Perfecta primera toma de contacto, antes de meterse de lleno con Arkham Horror. Aunque en la caja pone de 2 a 4 jugadores, se puede perfectamente jugar en solitario. Eso si, si queremos tener la más mínima posibilidad de éxito, es recomendable jugar, llevar a 2 ó 3 investigadores a la vez.

Very difficult and tight co-op, that is themed like an Arkham Horror, but doesn't have quite the thematic depth of choice that AH excels at.  It is however pretty engaging, though it's difficulty is so tremendous that I'm not sure how long this thrill will last.  I like to win my co-ops at least 50% of the time with smart play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Firstly, I must point out that I like both Euro and Ameritrash games.  With that being said...

I really wanted to try this game as I enjoy Arkham Horror, but sometimes find that game too fiddly, hogging too much time in both set-up and game play and unnecessarily too complex to remember all of the rules.  It doesn't hit the table as often as I would like, to say the very least.

Initially, I wasn't sure how this game would hold up, but this is a perfect substitute... at least for me.    Witch of Salem offers a very intense game play that is semi-reminiscent of AH.  Not only is it extremely fun, but it is also very rewarding if you win as it is very difficult to do so.

The components are very nice and high-quality.  I especially like the artwork and find it to be attractive, thematic and very detailed.  My only gripe is in regards to the playing cards - they looked as though they were heavily played fresh out of the box!  I do not know if this is a finish issue or if the quality is much lower than the rest of the components that it is more apparent.

RATING: 7
Very, very hard, and you won't win every time even if you play perfectly.  But as long as the decks aren't stacked against you, it's not unbeatable, provided the players consider all consequences of every action.

RATING: 6
Disclosure: I completely ignore the "you can't tell everyone else what you see under the gate tokens" rule in the rulebook.  It's still harder than every co-op I've played except Ghost Stories and certain games of Arkham Horror with a really nasty GOO.

If you want your Lovecraft fix in 45 minutes instead of 3 hours, play this instead of Arkham Horror.

Arkham Horror ultra-light. Stupid german rip-off lovecraft theme. Invest the extra time into Arkham Horror and you find the better game in every way.
Oh and really the story... what a waste of time: The evil character "Necron" helping the old ones and while you're at it, while not collect 10 Necronomicons (Necronomici?) to fight 'em with.

An excellent cooperative game that seems to not have gotten as much attention as deserved. True, that one rule about not revealing portals is a bit detrimental to the experience, and the game has taken plenty of flak for it. Yet it is so easy to ignore, and the gameplay is so solid, that I can't help but consider this one the best co-op games out there (along with Pandemic and Ghost Stories).

RATING: 6
As the game is, I like it, it's fun, but very simplistic.  If you add a little flavor (our very own 'debug variant') it gets incredibly smart with lots of take-that moments.  Has the potential to be very, very cool.

RATING: 7.5
The principle is simple: get your number (either 1 or 0) as the clear majority in as many lines as you can before the game ends. It's just you against your opponent - head to head. The cards are elegant, using the metaphor of programming in the most straight forward way. I for one found this marvelous - each card made thematic sense. It finishes quickly - in literally just a handful of minutes - and like all great games begs to be played immediately again. Love it and highly recommend it as a two-player strategy filler.

I am not a fan of short games....I am not a fan of card games...I am not a fan of low production values. Why am I playing this you may ask, well because despite it being everything I should dislike I cannot deny that this game is fun, I should hate it however it as a charm to it and it is great fun to play. I mean the game is played in like 10 minutes I like long games but the game feels very filled in that 10 minutes. The games is just cards with 1's and 0's on them, not exactly amazing visuals is it yet it works somehow it manages to work. Trust someone who should hate this game give it a try and you will find a fun little game

A nice 2p filler. Has nice tactical decisions and an enjoyable theme (the theme fits its abstract nature). More thinky than many fillers, but short and fun.  I suspect will get a lot of play in my house and at my school games club.

Deceptively simple, we've only payed it once or twice, and I could see how it could get more complicated if you played with all the cards, instead of just the recommended starter cards.

RATING: 5
It's just a take-that abstract game. The theme is a funny idea but is almost transparent during the game.

I played it twice and I feel like it's a race for the #50 line - whoever controls the last line is the winner. The same goes for PRINT cards - they are much more useful than others especially in lines #40 and #50.

The game is also very random. You feel very limited with only 3 cards in hand.

[28 Mar 2016] - 6.5
Dropped a 1/4 of a rating. Can't say for sure why but the base game feels a little scripted. It can suffer from a stalemate gaming early on if neither player wants to open up further rows in the program. This might be part of the overall strategy of waiting for the perfect opening but it does drag the game on. I also write code all day long so the idea of a game about programming isn't 100% interesting to me.

[9 May 2017] - 5.75 (16 plays)
Dropping this rating after playing Ergo. If Ergo is Age of Steam, then One Zero One is TTR. It's still fun with non-hardcore programmers and gamers but feels like it's pretty easy to get down once you go through a couple more plays.

Fun, but the theme scares some people away. Some cards are obviously stronger than others, and poor drawing can ensure defeat. The cards allow the chances for very fun chain combinations, which kind of adds to the previous issue, but again, the chains are very fun.

Its a micro-game that plays like a micro game and appeals thematically in way to those who recall programming in BASIC.  Its ok and a little different, not a feeling of having many degrees of freedom, but you expect that with a micro game.  Ultimately, its ok (Rating 6.638, Nov 16).

Neat area control with a programming theme. It's not a game that I think will have legs but it's a nice thematic niche and it's very well put together. As usual, area control is just not my thing and the game ends way quicker than I would have expected. It's really a race to get to the bottom two lines. It does what it intends to do well.

I really love what the designer did with this game. It's such a perfect little game that actually (surprisingly) captures the very abstract theme of "binary". Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but for some reason, everything in this game feels very "1-0"-y. Weird, right? Anyway, this is a great 2-player game that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and has a finite play length, so it's guaranteed to not be too long (unless of course 1 or both of the players takes forever to play their cards, but what game can stop that?). I'd really recommend this game to anyone, not just computer nerds. No computer knowledge is required, although the game is extra charming if that is your field of study/work.

A quickish game of playing your cards out to rows, aiming to control a row (and earn points) by having the most cards in it. Each successive row is worth more points, but you can only start a new row if every line above it has a minimum of 3 cards in it. Which promotes delaying / avoidance moves unfortunately. 10 of your 16 cards will have various commands on it - play again, flip a neighbouring card, etc - and these elevate the game to something interesting enough to get some replay, especially as the players jointly decide which command cards to include each game, providing some inter-game variety and allowing you to shape the game to taste. The fact that the decks are identical means the game should typically go to the player who draws the most useful commands at the right time - for example, you really don't want to draw a "play again" card early, you'd prefer to get it when you can use it on a higher scoring row. I'm from an IT background so I enjoyed the thematic linking of the commands to the game mechanics, and we've enjoyed exploring it for what it is, but the game is probably too abstract for casual enjoyment, and there's a surprising number of unanswered rules questions that arise from the various commands as well that dampen the experience.

It's not often that one gets to beat the wife several times in one night and she keeps wanting more. Especially when the theme is 1970s BASIC programming, with binary symbology. But once the game proved simple, fast and fun, it was a blast for her.
 PROS:
Fast (10 mins per game, so easy to play best of 5 in under an hour); fun; some interesting decision making without being overloaded with possibilities; good quality cards, command summary card for quick reference; nice small box, so very portable; easy to each and pick up; playable by ages 10 and up ( possibly as young as 8 if bright).
CONS:
Box is still twice the size it needs to be (half full of air); card commands are printed in too small a font; the luck of the draw can lead to some quite powerful card combos (a south-facing 'print' on line 40 printing a north-facing 'enter' on line 50 which brings the original 'print' down to line 50 also, is near impossible to beat); rules are surprisingly ambiguous and ungrammatical for such a simple game (the use of the singular 'the player' with the plural 'they/their' rather than 'he/his' is bad enough, but in the same sentence as a plural object 'cards' makes for parsing nightmares. Presumably the copy editor was trying to be 'gender inclusive' but in a game themed on computer logic, having the rules deliberately defy the rules of grammar is frustrating for ESL players as well as native anglophones). 
SUMMARY
Quick, fun and true to its theme but not so geeky as to deter non-computing girls. Highly recommended.

--Aug2015-- Son #2 was enthusiastic - which adds to my rating somewhat.  I found it fluffy and light, but still quite entertaining.  There's too much randomness inherent in the small hand size for it to be a Serious Strategy Game - but that's not the intent: and it's a pretty nice filler as is.

Played several games and the best thing is it's quick.  Really at 10-15 minute game.  Simple majority control of rows of cards with some cards having special abilities.

Biggest downside is that the game ends immediately when someone runs out of cards to fill hand.  This can give the 1st player an extra play.  I guess the designer thought this might offset the small disadvantage of going first, but I disagree.

Two player area majority card game as programmers writing lines of computer code.  Each player has identical decks of binary cards with basic programming commands that are played to gain control of the most line values of code.  It plays like a puzzle to move each others cards.  The card abilities are directional depending on how you face the card which I like a lot.  The font size of the commands could be larger.

Had a cool real-time cooperative feel to it, but it just disappeared due to component quality and lack of support. The second edition came out too quickly after the first.

Wife and friends like this game more than I. They tend to choose easy game settings. 

I find it either incredibly easy or else very reliant on luck. I think it would be helpful if there was a more frequent means of drawing cards. When things are hard, you are racing against the clock, against errors, and against very limit resources. 

Overall, in about 8 games, I found the outcome predetermined and the choices minimal. But everyone else in my group was having a good time. I'll let them rate it high. 

If you can handle the theme, I recommend 5-Minute Dungein instead. At their best, the two games are quite similar, but at their worst, Iâ€™d prefer 5MD hands down.

High Octane, real time co-op experience. I love this game! You are a team working together to match Rockets with corresponding Energy to destroy all the Meteors in 5 minutes. There is no time to waste, there are no turns. Each player plays a card into any players launch site at any time....good luck!

Tense, quick co-op filler. Nice combination of "try to do what you can on your own" and "try to work with others despite limited communication", with the latter yielding better results when you pull it off. The time-pressure and limited communication mean the Usual Co-op Problem (of the best player telling others what to do) simply [i]does not[/i] manifest; even if the Communications Satellite is out there's no time for that sort of nonsense.

Sadly, explaining the rules takes about twice as long as actually playing the game - and being a realtime game, you can't just jump in and teach it as you go - so I often find myself reluctant to suggest it when there are new players at the table.

I am a big fan of real-time cooperatives.  They are silly and fun.  We tested this game for several days to see if we wanted to publish it.  We ended up passing, but we still had a lot of fun with it.

A fun cooperative game that has that "one more play" quality, especially as the game plays out in less than 10 minutes. We played 11 times in our first session! There's some poor wording in the rules, but nothing that you can't work out.

Written after 4 plays. It is a nice little real-time coop filler game. I think it is a bit overpriced for what is in the box. It has very easy rules but it is hard to win. However, I would much rather play XCOM if I was in a mood for a real real-time coop game or Sushi Go / Tales and Games: Hare and Tortoise / Straw if in the mood for fillers.

A zillion plays was a nice way to spend an hour once. I bet a disparity in player experience levels would just make it agonizing, and I wonder what fraction of games are winnable.

Real-time stupid silent fun.  Lots of chances to play within a short time.  The one minus is probably that the learning curve is a bit high for a game that only lasts 5 minutes.  However, the replayability is good because of the various powers, limitations, and "boss" meteors.

Not bad. I expected nothing, and that probably helped.. What this game has going for it is its quickness + the party game character.. because you're not allowed to talk but make gestures and sounds, this in itself can be pretty funny.
Not a co-op fan, but this is so quick & goofy that i could play this from time to time.

The lucky nature of shooting the meteors too, helps me to just enjoy the 5 minutes everyone is mumbling, hmhn hm.. hmm..!

I love teaching this game with the basic rules just to get people use to it.  Then the looks on peoples faces are priceless when you tell them you cant talk in the game until you build the communication satellite.  I should take a picture every time just to see peoples reactions.

Great for when you're waiting for folks to show up.  5 minutes to teach, 6-7 minutes per "game" (including setup).  Reasonable amount of depth for the rules weight; soloing was surprisingly not lifeless...

I like this better than Hanabi for cooperative set-building.

* Kickstarted *

A simultaneous cooperative game in which players drop cards in five, one minute-timed rounds in hopes of blowing up the eight meteors approaching the planet. The catch? First and foremost, you are not allowed to talk beyond the three key words unless you build the communications satellite. Second, you only replenish one more card at the end of each round, so you need to be careful of what you drop when. It's a fast paced game that requires involvement from all players... and the basic game is challenging enough to warrant making the advanced game worth trying later.

PLUS: constant awareness & interaction, five minutes only per game, challenge
MINUS: the manual is not very well written

RATING: 6.2
Meteor is a hectic and fast-moving game with just a little bit too much going on for my liking.  I'm the kind of person who likes to take a moment or two to consider strategy.  With Meteor, a lot of the time you feel like you're just throwing out cards and hoping for the best situation to occur.  I can see the joy that people would have from this game, but this definitely is not my type of game.

Wow, what a great game.  Of course I love it, I love it so much that I actively went out and got the license to it and produced it! Yes in the interest of full disclosure WE are the publisher, but is it wrong of me to love the game?  

I've played 30+ games of Meteor and haven't gotten tired of it yet.  Really top notch or we would not have licensed it from Mike.  Thanks again Mike for the great game!

This is a rather unique game. Players are racing against time (five one-minute sand timers) in order to launch rockets to deflect the meteors heading towards Earth. Problem is, they can't tell each other what they need to finish and launch each rocket; players have to infer each other's aims from the way they play. Get things wrong and time can be forfeited (as you might expect from any movie featuring a countdown timer). This makes the game a rather frenetic Hanabi-type experience.

Got to play this quick filler at my local meetup.

People try to "blindly" shoot down meteors before they destroys earth. Lots of luck and lots of co-op. If that is your thing give it a spin.

RATING: 6
5 plays, solo.

The basic solo game seems all about churning through the deck as quickly as possible, building a hand until you can knock off the meteors. It is much MUCH easier if you find the Spy Satellite so that you don't have to waste time and cards trying to figure out what the meteors are (and don't accidentally overkill them!). I'm not much of a solo gamer -- those plays were just to learn the game -- so I'll have to try this with 2+ players, too. Of course, I don't really like co-ops either ....

One production issue: why the heck aren't the card costs (for launching rockets, building techs) in the upper left corner of the card?! Most people fan their cards, and you can't see the necessary information that way! If you do hold cards in a long column, you can't see other relevant information (i.e., the bottom doesn't have all the info either)! Boo!

A great filler/way to lead people to one of my favorite games: Space Alert.  Quicker to set up, less complex, and quicker to play.  I still much prefer Space Alert, but this scratches the itch and will hopefully lead more friends to Space Alert.

Meteor is stupid. But it's also surprisingly fun. There's a lot of chaos and the differing levels of difficulty offer both a decent amount of replayability and varying challenges. Hilariously, we're much better when not allowed to speak to each other...

Didn't actually expect much from this, but it's actually really really fun!

Definitely an "actually cooperative" co-op game and the timer can make for some crazy intense moments! I love that you aren't allowed to speak until you build the communication center!

If I had some complaints it would be that the game is really swingy. Some games you win without blinking, others you barely even get started before you're stuck and it's over. Also the iconography is TERRIBLE. Really, it's bad. 

It really doesn't deserve a rating this high with the bad icons and the sometimes unwinnable deals, but when it all comes together it really is just a lot of fun.

Not sure if I'll be holding onto my copy as it can be such a pain to teach people due to the icons and only 1 reference sheet. Would probably always be down to play with a group that knows what they're doing though :)

-- Sold: 10/5/17 - Great fun and definitely willing to play if there's a group of 3 (4 w/ me) that want to give it go, but it just wasn't keeping around for two.

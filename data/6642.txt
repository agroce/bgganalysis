Interesting! We seem to have plunged into the tactical strategy game genre!

Though this is my first foray into pushing little scraps of cardboard around to represent units, this is not my first time playing a tactical wargame. The rules are very similar to warhammer. Lots of little nuances - when to check morale, when to check seperatioin, how to fire, etc. But largely it's the same game.

That's a good thing. I love Warhammer, and this seems a bit more accessible to my wife.

A truly great game and system.  Morale checks, cool separated markers, command radius, rolling 3 dice at a time, what more could a gamer want?  Because of the formation cards, plays well in a PBEM format.  Just a shame that this series came too late in the heyday of board wargaming to get the credit it truly deserves.

IMO, the zenith of the Tank Leader system, which eclipsed the Panzerblitz/Panzer Leader series in the 80's. Card-driven move counter-move mechanics still feel fresh. Itself eclipsed by the Panzer Grenadier series, I think this game still has life adapted as a miniatures game.

Along with Eastern Front Tank Leader and Desert Steel, this my favorite platoon level WWII game system.

It uses a mechanic that rates units, grouped into realistic formations which are nicely represented on cards (as opposed to dense charts or handmade spreadsheets), for the "intangibles" that made one side better than another instead of focusing on hardware and specifications, or inflating the unit values.  The command control rules, through these formations and how the players use them, are the heart of the game, which highlight the differences between the armies in both time and place.  They are simple yet satisfyingly sophisticated, depending upon decisions the players make each and every turn, and manage to do this without 'leader' counters.  They work well for "normal" situations and yet are able to portray some of the more unusual engagements of the war in a realistic manner.

The combat mechanics, while involving a number of steps, are well thought out and easily integrate the "intangibles" of unit capabilities with the physical aspects of terrain and hardware, taking into account a range of factors from spotting over distance to unit stacking.  What could be a mess is presented in a modest set of charts on a single player aid card that are easy to read.

The big problem with these games are the scenarios, many of which are poorly designed.  Some of the unit ratings are suspect.  Also,  infantry don't have much ability to stand up to enemy fire, though this is toned down in Desert Steel.  Finally, "off board" artillery and air support are simulated simply but realistically (with built in probabilities of delay and national differences), but the actual combat strength of the "strike" cards seem terribly overpowered - "poof, you're dead".

With Eastern Front, the use of a single map in a multi-battle tactical level game system means the scenarios tend to have a "sameness" feel to them.  The the variable terrain system doesn't really solve this problem.  Things are slightly better in Western Front, which includes two maps.  Sharing the three between the two games would help with scenario design.  Actually, the maps from "Blood & Thunder" work as well, as the terrain graphics are almost the same.

Eastern Front Tank Leader plays much better if you use the Western Front rule set (which are fully backwards compatible), with a few tweaks from Desert Steel (particularly the changes to not allow combining fire against soft targets, and the +3 modifier for Indirect fire units spotting their own target, instead of doubling).

The formation cards are an excellent design feature and the heart of the game.  But they do come with the drawback that they limit the range of formations represented, and occasionally the counter mix is not as wide as it could be (unit types for the British in Western Front are particularly lacking).  Both are a result of budget and space issues, but there is a huge need for expansion of available formations and unit types, as well as extra maps, that was never satisfied.

(
Of particular annoyance is that, in Western Front, the US counter mix has only a single tank battalion that, for all of "1944" is rated as "Green", yet his formation is used to represent the US 4th Armored during its battles around Nancy in September of 1944, which makes me want to scream.  I should also note that the  Sherman 76mm gun version, which is restricted to 1945 on the formation card, should NOT represent the same vehicle in 1944 - the anti-tank rating represents the availability of APCR ammo for that gun, which was in very short supply until 1945.  Until then, its anti-tank rating should be 9, or maybe 10.  While the counter isn't used for any 1944 scenarios, the problem is that the the 76mm gun versions were an important (if not quite adequate) addition to US forces from July onwards and fairly common by late 1944, so its absence in 1944 scenarios is disappointing.

And, why are there are more JadPanther TD in the counter mix that Panther tanks?

This is the only panzer-pusher I've played at the company level, and it's probably the one I'll stick with. 
 
The units has the standard factors for this genre: armor thickness, weapon range, etc. But the genius is the central importance of the 'soft factors': communication and training. Combat experience is all-important to the initiative system. Morale is a slippery slope and getting our units to keep moving under fire is key. Tactical doctrine is factored in too. This makes for a game of maneuver and strategy, not a game of min-maxing stacks and consulting charts. Also, each scenrio has variable road networks, weather, and countour which makes even the same scenario very replayable... a real gem of a game that has elegent treatment of a moldy genre!

Nice system. I really like the cardplay mechanic. This series of games is underrated and was years ahead of its time. The graphics are a bit bland but functional and still pleasing to the eye in their own minimalist way.

RATING: 6
Time and tactical game design have passed this title by, but it's still a good game.  Only problem is that the cards tend to script the sequence of moves to a high degree, given the command and control ratings, a common issue with the TANK LEADER series.

Preliminary rating after one game of the introductory scenario.

Still adapting to the scale and the mechanics, but the C3i system is really pretty good. My only caveat so far is op fire might be a little bit unrealistic for the time scale of the game.

UPDATE: I really like the system but most scenarios seem poorly tested and some of the advanced tactics such as air/artillery strikes seem rather overpowered.

RATING: 8
From the designer of Squad Leader comes this tactical infantry/armor series that includes card-driven play and trumping (earlier than some have been led to believe?).  Basic rules are simple (armor only) but include the excellent C3 rules.  The basic game can begin play within an hour after opening the box, and after a few turns it's possible to play by just using the handy summary cards included with the game.  The maps initially look to be difficult in terms of remembering which symbols represent what (terrain features are highly variable in most of the scenarios) but we were surprised to find that we absorbed those alterations quickly and were able to focus on decisions.   Advanced rules take this way up to a simulation level comparable to some of Hill's Squad Leader gamettes, but  far cleaner.  Adv scenarios can take a very long evening to play (or an entire day if you're the type to just jump into the whole thing when learning), and it is therefore advisable to first play the basic game to understand the C3 rules before proceeding.  Basic rules complexity: 4/10.  Advanced rules complexity: 7/10.  Suggestion: in the medium- to larger-sized scenarios, make a small spreadsheet to record the formations, the experience levels, the morale value and morale DRM, and a check-off box for formation units lost, and you'll save yourself a lot of trouble flipping through the cards every time someone fires/is fired upon/makes a morale check.  Quam added a few things to Hill's EFTL game, all of which are clearly marked in the rules and backwards compatible.  Skip the first scenario, it's very poor.

Western Front Tank Leader was released in 1987 by West End Games and was designed by Leonard C Quam, it built on Eastern Front Tank Leader designed by John Hill and Guy Hail.  The mechanics for movement and combat are all very standard for a hex and counter wargame, what sets this game series apart though is how it models command, control and communication or C3.

C3 is the centre of this game, and it is handled by playing cards which depict the formations under the player’s control.  Each player has combat formation cards, parent formation cards, and command formation cards which represent different things.  Each combat formation cards represent a company, squadron, troop or battalion.  Parent formation cards, only used by the Americans, represent battalions and the command formation cards represent combat commands, battalions or a Kampfgruppe.  Each of these cards have a C3 rating which effects the way they can be played.

At the start of the turn players look at their cards and play the one with the lowest C3 rating – ‘A’ being high and so on down.  If there is a tie the Allied player must play their card and the German player keeps theirs.  Once a card has been played it can be interrupted by another card with a higher C3 value.  This can keep going until players choose to stop interrupting or are unable to interrupt.  The top card on the pile then activates and so on until all the cards in the pile have been activated and the turn continues with the card with the lowest C3 that hasn’t been activated yet being played and repeating the above process.  Players can also interrupt their own card if they want to move a different formation.

When activated the different types of cards allow the players to do different things.  An activated combat formation card allows the player to move the units listed on it.  When a parent formation card is activated it allows the player to activate one of the units on it regardless of its C3 rating.  Activating a command formation card allows the Allied player to choose from two options.  Option one is to move a combat formation listed on the card regardless of its C3 rating and also the HQ combat formation.  Option two is to try and recover morale for any of the listed combat formations.  If a German command formation card is activated it allows the player to activate any or all of the combat formations listed on it with a C3 rating better than ‘D’.

As you may gather there is a lot to think about when playing the cards.  This really is the heart of the game and poor C3 values can find you reacting to your opponent’s moves rather than taking the initiative.  Generally the German forces have a better C3 rating as well as being slightly more powerful, so the Allied player has to use their cards carefully as well as their greater numbers to get an advantage.  Also the command formation cards are quite powerful and usually have the best C3 rating.  Working out when to play them is an important part of winning and can go a long way to controlling the tempo and initiative.

Another consideration is tactical doctrine.  All combat units must stay within a certain number of hexes or else units are marked as separated which makes it harder to pass morale checks and also harder to hit targets.  Also Allied command formations must stay within a certain number of hexes as well.  The German command formations don’t have this restriction which increases their flexibility no end, and helps to handicap the Allies with their larger forces.

There are advanced rules which add infantry, artillery, smoke, minefields and strike cards to represent air strikes and off board artillery, but again these rules are quite standard wargaming concepts that are easy to pick up.  As mentioned before, this game is about C3 and how to apply it to the battlefield as modelled by the card play.

So is it a CDG?  Not in the way CDGs are played today.  There are no Ops points to activate units or events to influence what happens.  But the cards do directly activate units.  Also the scale is different, a lot of CDGs are strategic in scope while this game is more tactical.  So while it doesn’t look like the modern versions of CDGs I think this is very much a prototype CDG.  Anyway whatever you think of this question there is no denying that this is a great game.  Easy to learn but still provides plenty of depth and challenge.  A good addition to any collection.

I like the basic game system, the C3 aspects and the combat -- the system knows what it wants and goes right for it with little fluff or distraction.  I especially like the roll-your-terrain variations that keep the scenarios and two maps fresh.  The only drag on the game is the number of infrequently-used modifiers that must be checked again and again to both spot and shoot at enemy units.  Also, and this may just be a sample size issue, it seemed like most fire was either totally ineffective or overkill.  Minor quibbles with what is essentially a clean and innovative tactical game.  I should mention that I found the counters to not only be substandard quality, but poorly designed for use as well.  The rest of the game was very nicely appointed, so the coutners are a bit of a letdown.

A basic game scenario about battle of bulge ('St.Vith',Snow:visibility is only 4 hexes) is not bad(is good to learn how to use the card).
In my advanced game scenario('Assault on Salines') play,While 75mm Pak hit the short-barrel Sharmans,I could rush my improved type Sharmans into one of the VP town hex.
But,PanzerJäger(Tankhunter) unit(An infantry armed and trained with  Panzerschreck(Raketenpanzerbüchse)) moved and counterattacked from adjacent town hex!

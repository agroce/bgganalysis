RATING: N/A
Much like the Fellowship DBG, except this one has a wall you don't want breached (Battle of Helm's Deep, anyone?).  If it breaches, bad things happen.  So there's a cooperative element in addition to the competition, in that no one wants the wall breached.

Adds 'the wall' that makes the game different (and I think better) from the original.

This is a stand alone expansion/companion to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck Building Game. Sadly it's just not as fun. The characters are less interesting (and less powerful). There is more ambushing, and less combos. The game is designed to be played on it's own and not mixed with the first game. If you do mix it, you have to follow a bunch of rules that make the set up a pain; taking away one of the biggest strengths of the game. You can ignore the rules and just mix all the cards together, but that becomes a real chaotic hit or miss. The first game is fun, this one you should be wary of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
An improvement over the Fellowship game due to the Wall Deck, which adds more difficulty if taken down by the enemies serving Saruman. Otherwise it plays just as smoothly and you definitely feel like you're forging your way further into the cinematic trilogy.

Normal deckbuilder with a huge IP slapped on it. Nothing really particular in the genre and since I am not the biggest fun of the theme..not worth investing into for me, although I see the appeal of it especially compaired to Ascension for exemple (same complexity, no theme whatsoever)..

RATING: 7.75
The Lord of the Rings Deck-Building games are simple, fun, and can be combined together, which adds value to the series overall. Don't expect a story to develop, as these games are strictly competitive, mechanical point-grabbers. The movie stills are generally gorgeous, however, and it's a great way to engage Middle-Earth in a casual, lightweight way; I reach for these games often. [b]The Two Towers[/b] is the best of the three, mechanically speaking -- the addition of The One Ring and the Wall Deck add complexity to the gameplay -- but it is also the weakest visually, as the images are a bit gloomy (as per the film) and seem ever-so-slightly beneath the standard of quality exhibited in the first installment of this series of games.

Even better than FOTR DBG with the Wall Deck and the fight for the One Ring.

Deckbuilding Card Game on The Lord Of The Rings - The Two Tower movie theme. It's a cool mechanic, adapted to cooperative from other deckbuilding Criptozoic card games. It's not my favorite and the art is pretty ugly, the cards are pics from the movie, but it's funny to play.

We played once and said we liked it and wanted to get all of them to play together. After further review, it's another deck-builder with a pasted on theme. There are other deck-builders I prefer and other LoTR themed games I would prefer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The Two Towers LOTR deck builder is very similar to the original FOTR game. The new thing here is the Wall Deck. Essentially, there are certain cards that will force the active player to draw a Wall Card. These do several nasty things to the current player. There is a way to lose the game outright if the Wall Deck runs out. But there are also ways to get cards back into the deck. The cards in the game seem a little more wild than in the first game with some real near broken powerful cards (Shadowfax, wow!). Still, fun to play for theme alone.

Cerberus deck builder. Cards/abilities are very thematic. Own too many in this genre.

RATING: 6
Pleasant enough, but not compelling.  The wall cards are brutal which makes defense cards more useful than in the first game (Fellowship) but also makes the game more random / "swingy".  I'm happy to play it but I don't need to own it.  There are other deck-builders that I enjoy more (Thunderstone, Shadowrift).

Played this in combination with the Two Towers, Return of the King, and the Hobbit sets.  I like deck builders and would probably like each of these individually, but all together the game just became unwieldy.

Haven't had a chance to play this with my group yet, but adds tons of new cards which you can mix with Fellowship, and new wall mechanic which seems like could be very annoying, but will see.

Has made my oldest daughter's top 10 favorite games. This was her first deck-builder. The theme was what interested her - huge Lord of the Rings fan.
I got this series of games for a great price (less than 1/4 the price), but never thought I would get to play it - competitive with no good solo rules.
Has a poor reputation, but I actually enjoy playing it. We have created / are creating some cooperative rules so we can play as a team. Any LotR game where you play as the Fellowship needs to be cooperative - just feels wrong to be competing against other players.
Each game has a enough of a different game play to make them feel different.

This is perhaps my favorite of the three.  Though for reasons mentioned in my comments on the Fellowship, I haven't quite settled.  I liked the increased complexity in the cards and card combos in this one.  They weren't quite as obvious as in the first one, and many of the cards were a better value from turn to turn in comparison to many cards in the first game.  I feel that it's balanced enough.  There are a few crazy strong combos, but once you've got powerful cards in your deck, the randomness of the draws is going to produce a gambit of options.

Despite its simplicity, I'm quite a fan of the DC Superheroes Deckbuilding Game (though not the name).  When I was told that the LotR's Deckbuilding game used the same system, and that you could in fact mix cards from both games, I got very excited.  Well, we tried, and the best system we could find to make it happen was to take certain types of cards from each game and do that.  Didn't seem very satisfying.  I wanted Frodo to be mixing it up with Green Lantern.  So we gave up on that idea and just played this straight.  There were a few changes, but it was indeed pretty much the same game.  On the one hand, I like the other game so I can't fault LotR's entry for play.  It was fun.  But I do fault it for originality.  If you're not going to make it so the games can mix, what the hell is the point of slapping a different theme on the game?

My least favourite of the 4.  If i had to rank in , it would probably be : Fellowship, The Hobbit, Return and then Two towers.

Don't like the wall mechanic.  It feels fiddily and not thematic.  The breach can be absolutely painful if you get it early which makes a person looking to the end of the game before it even starts.

Valójában szinte ugyanaz, mint az első rész, amiről itt írtam bővebben: https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/44702/gyuruk-ura-deckbuilding-confrontation

Új elem a FAL, ami szerintem még több szerencsét visz a játékba, talán érdemes az elején védekezős lapokkal feltankolni, már amennyiben van lehetőségünk erre. Amúgy most azt érzem, hogy mind a két LOTR deck-building nagy előnye a hangulat. Szerintem az remek, egyszerűen tetszik, ahogy előbukkannak az ellenségek, helyszínek, a szövetségesek, ahogyan legyőzzük a főgonoszokat, stb. Viszont nagyon sok az olvasgatnivaló, emiatt elhúzodik egy parti, nyilván némi rutinnal ez felgyorsul.

The second in the Lord of the Rings deck-builders. This features some new mechanics with the wall of helm's deep. The wall cards are hit or miss, but add in some nice interplay with the potential for both players losing. Still just another mediocre deck-builder though.

This is probably the worst of the Lord of the Rings Cerburus deck builders. It's almost identical to the Fellowship edition in most, but with the addition of the Walls of Helms Deep mechanic... which doesn't really offer much beyond over complication.

Me mandaron este juego por equivocacion cuando pedi el LoTR LCG (despues me mandaron este ultimo sin costo, asi que sali ganando) y me lo imaginaba peor, desde que vi las cartas con imagenes de los personajes de la pelicula, no me gusto mucho, me gusta mas el tipo de arte de las del LCG, pero me puse a jugarlo y la verdad es que no esta nada mal, de hecho me gusto bastante, funciona bastante bien, aun asi no le pongo una mejor calificacion porque el tema no va muy bien en el juego, ya que compites contra los que deberian de ser tus aliados, y ademas los puedes atacar con algunas cartas. Pero bueno, al final eso es lo que le da mas interaccion al juego, aunque no se sienta muy bien el tema.

La verdad antes de que me mandaran este juego pensaba comprarme el Dominion pero creo que ya que tengo este otro y me gusta bastante por lo pronto a corto plazo no me lo comprare, de hecho en algunos aspectos me gusta mas este que el dominion.

Not as good as the first game. This set does have interesting cards, but I'm not sure I like the Wall, and the archenemies are boring.

Indifferent.

This game tries to capture the feel of the battle at Helm's Deep, and it certainly feels tense in that way. The game itself is merely okay, as I think if it wasn't for the wall mechanic, I wouldn't enjoy this one as much. I'm just not a fan of the deck running out before the villains are all defeated, which is almost a certainty in 4 and 5-player games.

We got this because we loved the original.  I was worried about imbalance as the reviews suggested, and I can see the concern.  The concept of "The wall" was unnecessary I think.  Thematic maybe but for me it distracts from the core of the game, being a light deck builder.

This is a great, easy DBG.  An easy way to introduce people to DBGs, especially if they already like LoR.  The theme isn't as strong as it could be. If you can play the DC game, you can play this - all the Cryptozoic DBGs play very similar. It can be combined with the other Cryptozoic LoR DBGs. (JW)

Without the theming, I might hate this game. The basic engine is fine, a bit simplistic perhaps, but fine. For not too much more complexity, Ascension blows it away. Where Two Towers runs into trouble is the Wall Cards and also the heavy luck of the draw. One player may randomly suffer many heavy penalties, while another skates through. One player may score a choice center row with a hand full of power cards, while another misses out. I'm no stranger to luck, but it was all a bit too much for me in this deck-builder. I quickly realized the weight of the game, and played it with a beer while enjoying the Lord of the Rings theme. On that level, it had just enough strategy, but I have no desire to play again unless in a casual mood.

Being a (former? haven't watched/read in a while) LOTR game, this is amazing.  It's designed just like the DC deck building game, but I like this theme better, given my interests.  The breached wall kind of sucks (I've been the player to get it all three times I've played so far), but it doesn't necessarily preclude you from winning.  I've played with both 2 and 3 players, and it goes well either way.

The new wall deck doesn't exactly set the world afire, but it does give the series a new way to spit anvils at players' faces.

But the system still holds up, and some of the new cards are fun.

[i]Update:[/i]

Impossible Mode in [i]The Two Towers[/i] is merely tougher, rather than silly and broken (like the original).  Too bad, as the loss of a funny bone is a genuine tragedy.

I'm still looking forward to the next installment.

Maintaining the Deeping Wall to ensure everything doesn't go to hell is great fun!  But some of these cards are just bonkers and make for some unbalanced games if they are drawn early - Entdraught, Brego, Shadowfax, etc. come to mind.

Better than Klondike but not amazing. The scoring is a nifty idea but I can't even score as high as I used to in actual bowling back when I played which is kind of pathetic and breaks the theme a bit for me.

Very nice solitaire game.  Really different from other kind of solitaries where you really depend on luck.  Since it is based on scoring, it is not as frustrating as a get it or not solitaire.  Here you can always try to get your best. Trying to get used to the scoring...

Single player solitaire.

Ironically enough there was a bowling score sheet in my 3M copy of Acquire purchased 2nd hand.

Since I don't know how to score the strikes or spares I type my scores in here: http://public.csusm.edu/public_html/veres/

Part of [gameid=200430] (EGG series #11), along with Elevenses For One.

This is a terrific solitaire game! (playable with regular playing cards) See some strategy tips [thread=62668]here[/thread] and [thread=374675]here[/thread].

This is a great solitare game, easy to learn, a little puzzle, and goes quick.

Perfect for a rainy day.

One downside is that depending on the card draw, it may not be possible to bowl a strike or spare in each frame, although this is really more of a 'try and beat your personal best' style game.

A great 20 card solitaire game.  I use a bowling calculator on my phone to reduce size for traveling.  No need to take scorecard or pencil.

Wife approved game! :star:

One of the Gamut of Games, Bowling Solitaire is an interesting little thematic solitaire, which unlike Golf, actually bears resemblance to the sport.

Two sets of 10 cards, A-10 make up the deck, and 10 cards become pins in the standard set, while the other 10 cards become balls.

Players use visible balls to collect pins, and score them as per 10 Pin Bowling.

The random fall of cards, along with the open knowledge of Pins and Balls used make this an interesting mix of open and closed solitaire play.

A nice solitaire / patience varient which throws some new decisions into the mix and with the bowling scoring system builds into the game a way of rating unsuccesful rounds.

RATING: 5
This took me a few practice rounds for me to wrap my head around, but I now see it is a very clever game. The different setup each time means there is a different puzzle to figure out so things don't feel too samey, with considerations not only for the current ball but for future ones, for the spatial aspect (e.g. if I take that row out I'll make the remaining pins have a very narrow shape, making it hard for me to take that one), the numerical aspect (want to have a lot of different options of how the pins can add up), and the pseudo hand management aspect (in terms of both card counting, and a little bit in you would prefer to use balls of the stack you have the most cards). It is also great that you can play this with a standard deck of cards. I always hated that the scoring method of bowling awarded streakiness however.

EDIT: Ugh while the core game is still fairly solid, the scoring method is really starting to bother me, especially since on one of my first few plays I got a good streak that I have been unable to replicate further and thus have not been able to beat. It feels really arbitrary that if I get strike-strike-7/0-8/0 I would get 59 points, whereas if I got the exact same thing in a different order, strike-7/0-strike-8/0 I would get 50 points.

An ingenious design by Sid Sackson: amazing what you can do with just 20 cards! The set up, scoring, and first ball-second ball turns capture the spirit of bowling very nicely. The online version is a godsend, saving a lot of shuffling and set up time. It's difficult to achieve scores that would be decent in real bowling (175+), and to score consistently–sometimes it's just not in the cards. I consider scoring 420-460 in a three-game series to be doing pretty well, and 460-500 very well. Best game: /  X /  /  X X X X X – = 223! (my only game over 200 to date; see my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/62668]session report[/url] for the happy details) [91 plays: three-game series = one play]

Was lucky enough to come across this game in the 'Games Only You Have Played' Geeklist.

Essentially this is a take on regular solitaire but it is given a bowling theme as you try to knock down as many of the 10 pins as possible by taking cards from the 3 ball decks and using them to remove 1-3 adjacent cards (pins) that add up to a numerical value that ends in the last digit of the card taken from a ball deck (eg if a 9 is used then a total of 9, 19 or 29 can be made).

The back row cannot be used upon the first play of a frame.

The game makes use of 2 suits with the values Ace to 10, so 20 cards are used for each game. 10 cards are placed at random to form the pin formation and then a total of 5, 3 and 2 cards are placed to form the ball piles. The top card of each ball pile is turned up to offer the player 3 options with each turn, although this will diminish as cards are taken. 

As soon as a player has no viable play using the face-up ball cards, they must score as if it was their first ball based on how many pins were knocked down. The cards from the top of each ball deck are discarded and the new top cards revealed. This simulates taking their second ball. When they cannot make a play for the second time the frame is over.  

If a player can manage to remove (knock down) all 10 cards/pins before they cannot make a play, then they score a strike. If a player manages to knock down all the pins after taking their new ball then they earn a spare.

Scoring is then calculated as per normal 10-Pin Bowling rules.

This is a really great design and just underlines the genius that is/was Sid Sackson.

A surprisingly thematic use of twenty cards from a standard deck.  While I doubt I would ever play two games of this in a row, it is a great way to pass some time, to the extent that I now always travel with a pack of cards, just in case...

Very creative use of 20 cards to emulate a bowling match. The simulation is fairly realistic for this little amount of material involved, the scores are well implemented and each play brings up interesting puzzles.

Interesting little time-killer.  And extremely hard (at least for me).  My first (and so far only) game netted a whopping score of 88, with only one measly spare to show for it.  There's some rule I don't exactly understand about not leaving pins isolated, yet the on-line version of the game allows that.

It's very light, it's short, you play it with a standard deck of cards and you can play it everywhere. And the scoring is with a standard bowling score sheet. It's just 15 min of light fun. For sure the scores I get here are higher than real life bowling :D

For some reason this sports based solitaire appeals more than the original 'Patience' game. I'm guess it's the scoring and a measure of that "highest score" that I aim to beat the each time I play. Highest so far in 110

After 20+ Plays (Solitaire): There are better solo games out there, but none that use a standard deck of cards, so this has a place as a decent time-waster when you are bored but away from your games.

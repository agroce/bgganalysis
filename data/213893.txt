Yamatai is beautiful and certainly elegant when it comes to rules. It's fairly easy to learn. I think I would love this game, if I had not played Five Tribes first. I enjoy this one, but it just feels less deep to me than its older sibling.

Sólo una partida a 4. El juego es muy vistoso, en todo su colorido, componentes, etc. El juego como tal esta bastante pensado y es bueno, pero a veces peca de tener mucho AP y sobretodo que la interacción es meramente indirecta, y cada uno va a hacer lo que puede en su turno en función de cómo quedo el tablero, con lo que que tampoco puedes planificar demasiado, y es más táctico que estratégico.

Simply amazing game.  I can honestly say that this has me wanting to play more.  Its gameplay is simple.  Its turns are fast.  The decisions you have to make can make you second guess yourself a lot.  If you like Five Tribes, you'll probably like this.  It has some elements that are similar, but it's definitely its own unique game.

FAVOURITE GAME - one of the most beautiful boardgames I have ever seen: the design is awesome. The gameplay also lives up to the expectations. The rules are quite simple, you have to colonize islands, by encircling them with coloured ships and gain their bonuses, make chains and also block the opponents plans. The rules are simple enough but devising the winning strategy is quite hard as it requires a lot of planning. Luck is also present but does not hinder the strategy of the colonization process.

This game sure have different mechanics than Five Tribes, but incredibly it has the same feeling, and could occupy the same spot on the shelf.

But Five Tribes is a much better games in a lot of aspects.

Yamatai is not a bad game, in fact it is a great game, with interesting pattern recognition mechanics and different player powers. The Assistants plays the same role as the Djins in Five Tribes, with a difference that in all games almost all the Assistants will appear, and in Five Tribes the Djins appear a little bit less, what brings a better control in Yamatai than in Five Tribes.

But the game is simpler and lack a lot of good and rich choices that we have in Five Tribes. It is not a bad thing at all, it can be a streamlined and even easier to explain game.

The art of this game is amazing, good job from Days of Wonder, as usual. But there is an iconography inconsistency problem that bothers me.

The theme is interesting, but at the same level of Five Tribes, not very important.

Overall Yamatai is a great game, a good refreshing for those that are a little bit seasick of playing Five Tribes, like me.

In a 2 or 3 players game, it is a little bit strategic, in 4 players the downtime is huge because of the AP and the game is less strategic and more tactic. So the preferred number of players is three.

Let me start off with a warning for those who are colorblind.  This game is VERY unfriendly to colorblind people and even well sighted people playing in low light.  The colors of the boats are way too similar, and the colors on the buildings does NOT match well the actual colors on the boats.  We had to get markers and mark every single boat and building tile with pips 1-5 for bamboo - gold.  Once that was done, they game is easy for all to play.  I do think this should have been solved at the publisher though.

I really like this one.  My wife LOVES it.  This is a good thing because it itches the same place that Five Tribes does for me, but where she does NOT like five tribes (does not like the theme, the bidding and the appearances of the tiles), she loves this.

Having the action selection set the turn order for the next turn is GREAT fun.

The two player game is in my opinion head and shoulders above Five Tribes.  Although there are times you will be taking 2-4 turns in a row in the two player game, I find that multiple turns in a row make the turns EASIER to plan, not harder.  The hard turn to plan for is the turn that you give control over to the opponents.

I have not played this 3, but I like it so far at 2 and 4. Our one four player game ended surprisingly fast as one player found the number of moving parts a little daunting so instead focused single mindedly on building.  She ignored the culture and the specialists.  She won the game because the rest of the players were newer and/or expected to have more time to place more buildings.  I was happy to see that this focused strategy was viable.  I don't think it is overpowered, as second place was only 1 point behind.

I wanted to like it, and the production quality is what you would expect from Days of Wonder, but the colors they chose to use for ships make this a very difficult game if you are colorblind.  

Although there are multiple ways to get points, it is not really a point salad kind of game, and the primary mechanism for gaining points is based off of surrounding islands with the correct color ships.  I think if they had used different shaped ships or something so that there was an alternate way to distinguish them I would enjoy the game much more.

Beautiful game, which makes the disconnect between mechanism and theme (hah, what theme) so apparent. Why can I hire a specialist with two purples? Why does this building only get built if there are three certain color ships nearby? With the thematic disconnect, you get a bonus helping of Analysis Paralysis! This is the sort of game that would appeal to Stonemaier fans - beautiful components, interesting gameplay, and zero connection between those two things.

Played it 3 times as 2P so far and LOVING it! As of now, it is probably my fav of 2017 and definitely in this weight category! It reminds a bit of FIVE TRIBES (also a favorite) but I think that is because of the same designer /publisher combo and their production aesthetics. In terms of gameplay, they are nothing alike with only perhaps pattern-recognition being the only significant overlapping ingredient.

Absolutely gorgeous game. The rules are deceptively simple, leading one to think the game is much easier than it really is.

Wonderful offering from Days of Wonder.

Very similar to Five Tribes: the game is trying to see the best move in the mess on the board. In five tribes you have loads of options and you end up with less, in this one is a bit the opposite. Very high quality production as all days of wonder games

The Bruna Cathala-Days of Wonder follow up to the fantastic Five Tribes, Yamatai is a spiritual sequel of sorts as you can clearly see mechanics and concepts from that game in here, but the overall feel of the game feels fairly different. While Five Tribes is about trying to sift through a ton of optional into find the most efficient combinations and approach, Yamatai is more puzzley in that scoring does not come as easily and trying to do that while not letting your opponents swoop in is even bigger. There's a bit of a learning curve to understand how to use all the powers effectively, but that will give the game a fair bit of legs. Won't challenge Five Tribes as my favorite, but another fine addition to my Days of Wonder collection.

Does have that days of wonder elegance to it, but the decisions just don't feel as interesting as something like 5 tribes.  The downtime also is just about as 5 tribes, so not sure this one will last over the long haul, as I think most people will just gravitate back to 5 tribes.  The game does look really nice on the table (Not really a surprise?), but the game does have some serious color issues in low(ish) lighting.  Going to try at some other player counts, but at this point, this doesn't seem like a long term keeper.

Update after 2p game:
-----------------------------------
Works much better with 2 players, as you can setup much more interesting combos.  The AP is still there, but isn't as bad since there are less players.  Still not sure if this is a long term keeper, but enjoying it at the moment, and do expect to get more plays.  Played with much better lighting also, and the colors were much easier to see.

I enjoyed Five Tribes and had no problem with the "AP inducing" gameplay. This looks to be in the same vein so I am interested. I think playing off each other's boats and the action selection mechanisms look interesting. However, I am concerned about replayability and how much this would actually hit the table. It looks like a nice production and a fun game, but not something I'm racing out to get (especially at the current asking price).

Juego con un corte muy similar a Five tribes pero lo suficientemente distinto como para tener su propia personalidad.

Juego de days of wonder, y como suele ser habitual con esta editorial, el estilo de juego es más bien familiar, y con una estética muy cuidada y componentes de calidad.
El juego consite en ir construyendo casas en un tablero, que representa un archipiélago de islas. PAra llegar a las islas hace falta llegar en barcos, que pueden ser de cuatro colores. Los barcos no pertenecen a ningún jugador... para construir en una isla, es necesario que adyacentes haya barcos en determinada combinacióin de colores.
Las acciones se eligen al principio con un rol, que determinará qué puedes hacer, qué barcos ganas y el turno en que jugarás en la ronda siguiente.

Además, al principio cada isla está "ocupada" con una ficha de cultura, que hay que recoger antes de poder construir nada. Esas fichas te permiten obtener unos personajes que te van a dar puntos o capacidades especiales durante la partida.

Es un juego sencillo de reglas, pero con bastante enjundia. Recomendable. Apto para no jugones.

* I DO NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS AS A 4 PLAYER GAME*

An abstract game at heart. A tactical game, where there is not a lot of long term planning. You have to optimize your fleet selection with either culture or building. 
Then abuse certain specialist combos.
Based on one play, it was fun for what it was.

I do not see or feel any similarities to Five Tribes. Totally different gameplay. 

Not unexpected good component quality from Days of Wonder. The insert fits the components just right.
I hate when companies then CHEAP out by providing insufficient components for you to choose which colour to play when at a 2 or 3 player count.

I have played the game as a 3p and as a 4p and while it is very good at three, it was lacklustre at four. 

* I DO NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS AS A 4 PLAYER GAME*

Based on a 3-player game:

A very interesting game, effectively forcing you to help the other players before you can help yourself. Love the way the fleet tiles work, combining what you can do this turn with player order next turn "if I take this now, I can go first with this more powerful tile next time..." Curious to see how it works with 4 players.

Knew I'd buy it for the art, but enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

While a lot of folks are comparing this to Five Tribes, I really didn't see much connection here, other than it being a Cathala Days of Wonder game. With different art from a different publisher, I wouldn't have really even thought to compare the two.

Unfortunately, I also didn't see much similarity in the level of fun I had playing it. Yamatai feels very slow and plodding, and I just didn't feel very engaged with the game, or feel like I was progressing toward anything really exciting. it just seemed like players crawled along, scoring a handful of points each turn, without any pivotal moments that felt momentous. It just felt like the game progressed without building toward any sort of climactic moment.

Overall, a fine, functional, working game, but not one that managed to feel fun or exciting to me.

Eh, point salad with extreme balance. I played terribly, almost completely cluelessly, choosing gods that rewarded me for certain actions and then never even taking advantage of those rewards. Final score? 22, 22, 20, 19. The game is far too complicated if it's not going to reward superior play.

Had a great time playing with 2 players. Aside from great colorful artwork that guarantees great table presence, Yamatai shines to me with an interesting form of player interaction, meaning how much it had me watching my girlfriend's moves and choices and making sure my own choices helped me but without handing over opportunities to her!

Highly recommended as a 2 player game!

RATING: 7
(Score may be inflated because of designers name but is standard Euro fair). I like Five Tribes a lot but its a game (for me anyway) that wasn't great out of the box. I feel the subsequent expansions gave it the  "WOW", must own factor. Playing Yamatai left me with the feeling of OK why didn't they just include all the tiles (esp. Fleet tiles) . I know this game, like five Tribes, will benefit from future expansions because it has an excellent designer and a solid publisher and the obvious room for growth. So here it is:

Choose a tile (should be more of a selection) - Place Boats - Collect Culture or Build (Should be more of a variety on building tiles) - Harbor remaining boats - Choose Specialist (Good selection but I'm sure there could be more). 

The games kinda dragged at the end since all players were delaying the end game condition while trying to gain more prestige. The game is good as is and worth owning but with the slew of games out there today might be passed over by many gamers looking for newer, more interesting mechanics. As far as price the $50 - $60  is steep but the game is well produced and maybe deserving of being in that range.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game seems to be sorely lacking a fun factor. Fulfill color requirements for buildings and build. Special powers grafted on ala Five Tribes. The theme is boring, the decisions were not particularly interesting, and it the production value is not even up to the usual Days of Wonder standard. I guess the turn order selection is kind of interesting. Otherwise pass.

Its okay. Initial play was a 4 player game, stay away from a 4 player game of Yamatai, and it was random with lots of AP. Great looking components and art but the gameplay fell a little flat. There are some interesting decisions and ways to get points.  I think this is best with 2, and it's good, with more players downtime and randomness increases to a point where it's just not fun.

Probably not as good as Five Tribes, but still a very good game and another Bruno Cathala game that I enjoy playing. Take one of the action tiles, do what it says, and then place your boats forming a sequence starting from an already placed boat of the same color. From there the decision about whether to take culture, which can get you a special power or you can build a building. I am not sure why but this game felt unique to me in terms of how it played out. It does have a lot of tactical thinking which I know some won't like but I enjoy. Besides that maybe a bit of a lengthy setup, but the gameplay is smooth and definitely did not outstay it's welcome for us.

Won from the BGG contest page! 
Initial impressions from solo 2-handed "learning the rules" playthrough: Fun game! This is a beautiful game, too, if you like colorful games. Once you've got some temples and arches on the board and the initial specialists are bought, the game seems to tighten into a very strategic 2p game. I doubt my wife will like the length of the game, but I might be able to get it to the table due to the Asian theme. I enjoyed the many choices (beware if you are AP prone) you have on your turn as well as the mechanism that determines turn order based on your choices. This is a game that you will need to play a few times to get a grasp on possible strategies and combos/synergies. In 2p, there are going to be decent chances to block your opponent without overt attacks, so it is competitive without being confrontational.

Many interesting tempo considerations, both during play and in ending the game. Pretty, and you get to play with special powers. The initiative system is lovely. And my first (3p) game of it took waaaay too long. But that may have been my fault for missing the first time I should have ended it; I'm more than happy to give it the benefit of the doubt and try again sometime.

RATING: 7
Components: Gorgeous board and specialists art. Chunky wooden pieces. Clear iconography. The typical outstanding Days of Wonder production quality.

Experience: Too long; our game came in at 3+ hours. At first, we cruised along collecting culture tokens; then we switched gears and cruised along placing boats. But then the true complexity of the game began to assert itself, where it became clear that the boat placement rules are very restrictive. On any given turn a person has to consider 3-5 possible fleet tiles to take, a variety of placement options and special powers, the tough choice of placing a building vs. collecting culture tokens, and finally which specialist to enlist, if any. The game state changes so much between turns I found I could walk away from the table for long stretches of time, and come back only just in time for my own turn.

That said, it was definitely fun. The specialists, like the djinns in Five Tribes, successfully distinguish the players, making our respective turns more and more distinctive as the game progresses. The fleet tiles and boat placement rules were a fun puzzle to solve each turn, trying to maximize my points.

I'd play it again. I might rate it higher if it could deliver the same experience in half the time.

Yamataï is elegant, gorgeous, smart. Yamataï wears a short skirt and a loooooooong jacket. Yamataï is a smooth liquidator. Yamataï knows what's best.

Every turn of Yamataï is an interesting and complex puzzle in which you must balance what you can do, what you would like to do throughout the stretch of the game, what your opponents will likely do between now and your next turn, and how many beautiful components you can justify touching with your hands and/or mouth. You get a feeling similar to Five Tribes when you play it ("It's my turn--what is the best move I can make based on what my opponents have done since I last made a plan?") but, unlike Five Tribes, the game begins in its simplest state and increases in complexity rather than doing the opposite. This makes it more friendly to new players and also more social, since early turns are not defined by the profound silence that an overwhelming number of options produces. 

I really only have one complaint. This is the least color-blind friendly game I have ever played in my whole life. Even friends who have no issues with colors have issues with these colors. The colors of boats on the building tiles, especially, are absolutely impenetrable. Look, as a color-blind person, I don't need every game to bend over backward to accommodate my particular affliction. But failing to put even a modicum of thought into how colors like the ones they've chosen might make gameplay more difficult, even for those with perfect vision, is just bad design. That no one in the development process commented on this is bewildering and inexcusable. But I guess, given the whole Five Tribes slaves fiasco, I shouldn't be surprised.

The new DoW, designed by Bruno Cathala. Looks gorgeous as always and has little rules, so very suited for casual gaming. Played this twice, once with 4 players and once with 2, which was quite entertaining. Despite what some people have claimed, I do not consider this a Five Tribes "light" at all, as the game has a very different look and feel.

RATING: 8
Finely crafted mechanisms that support the theme of exploring and building the archipelago.  The core element are:
• #1 selecting a fleet tile for the turn that gives you 3 different things in one single pacakage(resources boats, special power and initiative for the next round), 
• #2 tweaks it with a small trade action, either sell or buy one boat
• #3 and finally optimize execution on the board in action #3

 Rules are fairly simple but there are a lot of choices and things to combine (which makes the first game last longer).  In the vein of Five Tribes but play differently, it requires more planning  ahead. Playing first in a round seems more important as in Five Tribes where you often can find a good move early in the game even if yo play last.

- Our first 4 players game lasted 9 turns and score where around 30 pts. It felt as a very tight and tense close game where every points count. 
- With 3 players we have more buildings per players and the same number of resources in the bank so the game might last a couple of more turns. Moreover you have a choice of 5 buildings, 5 specialists and 5 fleet tiles at the start of each round whatever the number of players is. so with 3 you have some more flexibility and the score could average over a few more turns.
- The 2 players game use the same twist as Five Tribes where each players have 2 turn tokens, and hence can play twice per round, which allow for interesting combos.

After more plays I really like it, different elements take different significance depending on the players count. I like it with 3 or 2 players, the longer turns number offer wider strategic choices and more options to combines the special powers.

Yamataï is about builders coming from the left side of the archipelago kingdom and progressively sailings further among the islands to first clear the primeval islands and sway the local tribes, then bring resources by boats to construct the best buildings on the most promising spots. So you have that kind of settlers feeling.

I was not expecting this kind of game when I opened up the box. Yamatai relies on players pushing the tempo of the game and can stall out if players aren't pushing towards buying all the boats or getting rid of the building tiles. We ended up starting too late at night and about half way through started to make less aggressive decisions. That caused the game to last much longer. Money also seemed very plentiful and never in short supply. That made my money hoarding early on seem foolish. I want to give this a few more plays now that I know what to expect.

[30 Aug 2017] - 6.5 (2 plays)
Played a second game at a Monday night meetup with a brand new boardgamer and someone with multiple plays of Yamatai. Came in second place. On second play the game does have some good puzzles to solve on your turn. This slows the game down a bit but not too bad in my limited experience. In this game I was unable to get a money engine going but did have the specialist that allowed me to build on sacred land. Near the end game I had to convince the new player that, while he was having fun, he should end the game on his turn and deny me one more turn to score some points. Having the game end triggered on player actions seems to be a difficult concept for new players to grasp.

Again, prob in the minority here, but this game is way better that Five Tribes and that is exactly because it is FT in reverse. In FT you clear pieces from the board and in Yamatai you put pieces on the board. I was sure I was going to hate it (like I hated FT) but it surprised me... I love it.
FT gives me a sense of destruction, while Yamatai gives me a sense of construction, so Yamatai just feels way more satisfying. FT starts crazy busy from step 1 while Yamatai slowly brings you into the game and makes you acquainted to the busy board. In FT most of the board is always available for moves during all game, so turns are long and AP is always a problem, while in Yamatai you build the board from left to right so just a portion of the board is available for moves at a given time, which makes the games much less AP inducing. 
Yeah, sometimes you miss an obvious better move, but it feels less shaming than in FT and hence it creates a nice comic tension on the table. 
The only con is, again like in FT, the exaggerated iconography on the tiles. You do get used quite quickly with the fleet tiles, but you do need to check the rules book for the special power tiles.... but it is still better than FT, since many times you are just getting those tiles for the points and not necessarily for the special power it gives you.

Another medium weight game by [b]Bruno Cathala[/b] to fill the 1 hour format while giving intricate decision and mild brain burn. It's route building/network building, set collection, area control game where players are placing boats around islands and build buildings. There are many ways of collecting points and multiple viable winning strategies, mainly due to the selection of powerful special persons with unique abilities. The state of the board constantly changes and it's pretty AP prone.
[b]Update:[/b] Lowered to 7.55 from 7.71 due to low replay value.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Special persons which, like Genies in Five Tribes, give unique powerful abilities which alter the game rules and directs the player's strategy.

The general consensus about this game is that it's "no Five Tribes." It's not, but it's also not a bad alternative. For me it fits in the same "brain space" as Five Tribes - the game is much more tactical than strategic, and it does have a few things to recommend it over Five Tribes - it's easier to teach, (probably) a bit faster to play, and I think it's less prone to AP, as the board does not completely change after every turn. For those who like Five Tribes, I think it's worth trying Yamatai at least once.

Yamataï is like reversed Five Tribes - instead of making meeples disappear, you make ships appear but the 2 games scratch the very same itch. Plus, it has better theme. We really liked it and have already played 3 2-player games. Waiting to play with more people As with Five Tribes, the game has just a few rules but the strategy, well, I guess it is better to say, tactical decissions, are really deep in this game.

RATING: 6.5
Fantastic looking game (of course, since it's Days of Wonder). If you should compare it with Five Tribes, it misses the woah moments that 5T gives you (when you see an opportunity no one else have seen and score tons of points). In this game, you can also see some "unseen" opportunities, but they are more obvious and not that satisfying (since maximum points for a building is 5). But a solid game with quite a lot of interaction and interesting choices. Also, there are some different strategies to go for (even money).

Beautiful game components, but.... why the thin player mat that doesn't seem to fit the game. It would have been nice if you could actually have placed the boat on the number one spot (and a greyed out one for the two player) and why the itty bitty harbour spot with the even smaller spot for unused boats. And why oh why the forced colour - player. The game costs a pretty penny anyway and I like it when I have a choice in the colour I play.

Having said the above. I liked the game. I love the fact that with the randomness of which specialist show up first and which buildings will be laid out, you won't have to deal with overstrategized games, and even the boats bring in their own choices, although there we had some favourites quite soon.

I have really mulled over what to say about this one. I did enjoy the play of it and the b/f especially was eager for it to hit the table again soon... but it hasn't.
And honestly, its good and fun but I don't have a very high desire to play it again and I am really not sure why.
Its days of wonder so the components and art are good, game play is simple and engaging and there are depths of strategy here which I would be happy to explore on more play throughs. Its family friendly and plays in around an hour which is ideal. It ticks all the boxes of a good game... i just ... shrug....I dont know... sorry Yamatai

Two resemblance to Five Tribes:
The Heroes/Djinns - very 5 tribish. The turn order switcheroing - I see the 5 tribe in it. 
Otherwise? Not so much 5 tribes.

This game has a hard weighing of 'getting points' vs. 'build opportunity to get points'. 
I felt there was a bit to easy to get screwed out of your move-setups that it was really hard to control.
I went mainly to get 'djinns' and I won in the end.
I really like the mechanic of 'choose of only available actions and lowest goes first next round' but otherwise the game fell flat for me and I can't really explain why. 
I think this will feel more repetitive than 5 tribes and where 5 Tribes goes LESS AP-prone over time, this one instead builds it up with presenting more choices.

Initial rating = 5

Despite it's family friendly appearance this is a surprisingly deep game. I am not AP prone but just like with Five Tribes I have to take my time to take my turn sometimes.

But that is one of the things I love about my games. There are multiple paths to victory and yet your choices are limited each turn. On top of that this is easily the most beautiful game I own.

Ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu mais il ressemble beaucoup à Five Tribes de par sa chate graphique, équilibrage, choix des couleurs ...
Il a aussi n défaut en commun c'est d'être un jeu par coup ou on attend pas mal et ou il n'y a pas vraiment de coté épique mais plus de grinding.
Je préfère Five Tribes à titre personnel (qui est intrinsèquement moins bon je pense) car je n'aime pas les jeux à gestion spatiale et comme d'habitude je ne vois / anticipe / comprend rien ici.

After one solo play my brain hurts.  Simple premise. Choose from available ship actions. Match colour of ships already placed to place ships and collect prestige tokens on adjacent islands. Match variety of ships around an island to the conditions on building cards to build on that island (provided it doesn't have a prestige token, is already built on, or is protected from being built upon). Spend prestige tokens to buy specialists that let you do special extra stuff. I kept wanting to play ships and then realising they don't match the ship colour where I want to play them, or build buildings and realise the spot I want to build on still has a prestige token so can't be built on.  I'm sure a second play will hurt less!

Egyszerű szabályok és nagyon odafigyelés, gondolkodós játékmenet. Már-már talán túlságosan is. Ilyen szintű lefárasztás ilyen nehézségű játéktól még nem tapasztaltam. Ez talán gond is lehet, mert így kicsit inkább meló, semmint kikapcsolódás, illetve többen eléggé AP veszélyes lehet. Ketten is az volt, de még tolerálható. Négyen lehet, hogy kellemetlen a várakozás, tekintve, hogy nem nagyon tud senki előre tervezni. Tipikusan intuitíve játszandó játék: ha meglátsz valami jó opciót vidd el, és ne keress még jobbat, mert megölöd a játékot. Szívesen játszom még vele mindenképpen.

Excellent Mid-weight euro. I hate to compare this to Five Tribes, because in all honesty its not THAT similar. But yet, I feel compelled to at least compare it a little bit. You are trying to make patterns, puzzle it out. The advisors are very similar to the Jins, only you dont have to pay for them time and time again. But, this feels lighter, breezier, more approachable...Which I like.  I still prefer the richness of Five Tribes, but this is different enough that I wouldnt think anyone would mind owning both. Gorgeous artwork and components. Although, it is a major loss that this game didnt come with a score pad. I know it seems silly...but I seriously miss the score pad!!

Similar feel to 5 tribes and there are some aspects of this game I like. I like the way turn order is done with the stronger actions going later next round and also that there is a limited choice. The specialist also seem easier to get than Djinns. I find there is less AP in this one because your choices are more limited (unless your first in turn of a round)

But overall I have to rate this much lower than other days of wonder games because it's just not that interesting. I feel that the point spread is very close for most things and it never feels like you do/setup really turns. Maybe in 2p where you get 2 actions a turn but in 4p, everything just seemed like a difference of 1-2 points for too much setup. In 5 tribes you could get some explosive turns and it was a race to claim certain things. Bidding for turn order could be tense because of this and it was tough to give up points. In this one, I found I was having a good build every other turn because it's not worth it to open up islands for other people to jump in and build on. So usually I had to set myself up with a late turn and then an early one next round.. for minimal point difference

It's simply not anything special. It's not exciting to play, there are no interesting choices, there's very little interaction, the puzzle is too easy and it has bad pacing. It's a fine game, it seems balanced and the better player will probably win, it's also gorgeous. I like how the turn order works, I like having to match boat colours and I like getting specialists. However, the specialists are easy to get and they don't impact much, the best ones simply give you extra points. It's also too easy to match boat colours, since you can buy almost any colour, it would be interesting to see if this game gets better if it's harder to buy boats. So of the 3 best ideas in the game, 2 are poorly executed. 

In Five Tribes I could feel smart for figuring out a big explosive turn that let me do a bunch of cool stuff, in Yamataï a great turn simply yields 3 more points than an ok turn. Sure most euros are about optimising points, but this game does a poor job of obscuring it. I think what's most damning is that you can have the exact same turn turn 2 and turn 20; you just build a 3 point building, maybe you got 3 extra coins turn 20 due to an adjacensy bonus, but that's not exciting. It's not rewarding to build up your engine, because the specialists do very little and the building adjacency bonus isn't impactful either.

My first impression is that this is okay, it's interesting, but it feels like it's missing a spark to be great. I think it's that the specialists are kind of boring, and the game actions are kind of boring too. It looks gorgeous (as expected). I hope this is just a first impressions kind of thing and that it gets better the more you play.

* I liked this better with two players as I was able to plan more, setting up moves and cashing in on them. Three players was also better than four. I'm still not super excited to play it and will likely pass it on to a new, more loving household.

I enjoyed this play, more than I thought I would going in, but this is still a flawed game. At first I was very high on this one, but the early word out of Europe was super lukewarm, so I soured on this a bit. I'm glad I gave it a chance, but I don't see myself ever purchasing this one.

People say this is a Five Tribes clone, but the similarities are very superficial. First, the specialists are not nearly as overpowered as the genies in Five Tribes. Second, the art style is very similar, but the game play is more different than alike. I still prefer Five Tribes for one reason. In Five Tribes, you can make a move and leave a very optimal move for your opponent simply by how you lay your meeples. However, you usually have something very good to show for it. Here, you can clear a huge path for other opponents to subsequently build over what you have cleared without you having a chance to do anything about that. The only thing you can do when this happens is buy a specialist and some of them simply aren't that good. They aren't worth a lot of victory points and if they don't synergize with what you are doing, that almost feels like a lost turn. And there are some turns when you have to clear tokens because there are no empty islands to build on. That's frustrating. Building seems to have a far greater benefit than buying specialists. I have to play it more to see if this is true, but in the end, our scores were tight and I only lost the game by three points, so going with a specialist-heavy strategy didn't seem to hurt me too badly, so maybe I shouldn't be so quick to judge. Solid game.

Being the second big box game from Bruno Cathala published by Days of Wonders in a relatively short period of time, the comparison is inevitable. It has a similar production, with good artwork, chunky wooden pieces in almost the same player colors, and even the annoying feature of forcing specific colors depending on the number of players. It's also equally abstract and induces a similar level of analysis paralysis, but the gameplay really doesn't have much in common, except for the two-player rules (each player has two turns per round).

Each round, you select a tile that gives you resource boats and a unique ability. They also serve to determine turn order for the next round, with weaker tiles going earlier and better ones later (reminding me a bit of Kramer's "Maharaja"). Then, you may sell a boat or buy another, place boats around islands, and either take tokens from those islands (which can be exchanged in sets for characters with special powers) or build on an empty island for victory points. Overall, it's a good and pretty game, but not good and pretty enough to make me pay Asmodée's artificially inflated prices.

After my first play this game felt like a miss to me. It didn't feel like my decisions mattered that much. Every round has a lot of good moves that almost everyone get to capitalize on. There are no "great moves" so everyone will be scoring roughly the same points in a round. Everyone compares this to Five Tribes, which is a game that wow-ed me the first time I played. This one just felt like a drudge. The only saving grace for this game is the gorgeous production and artwork which is nice to look at.

RATING: 7
It's fine, but frankly I wasn't that excited by it. Maybe it's partially my own fault, I like Five Tribes because I've accepted that it's very tactical and I can enjoy it for what it is. I think I was trying to approach this game from a more strategic perspective and that doesn't really work. But I also do just think that it has a similar enough feel to Five Tribes but it feels like the decisions are a bit easier. Since you can only either build or take tokens every turn feels lacking in tough decisions. It's a bit more obvious how to set yourself up if you have back to back moves, but it's also more limited since to get back to back moves you need specific numbers which means you're more limited in terms of boats and powers. Overall I think it's a lighter and less interesting game that feels similar enough to Five Tribes for me to skip it, but probably different enough if you're a fan of Bruno Cathala and/or lighter euros.

Queen Himiko has a bit of a thing for boats, and in your efforts to make her smile you decide that filling up a series of islands with boats is the way to go.

The theme doesn't really come through as much in the game but it does have some really amazing art and production quality.

Aside from that the game is quite good. Every move you make will somehow help someone else so you really have to think about your moves and when you will go next round. Can be a little AP heavy for some people but I found it quite enjoyable.

Unfortunately, between the ever changing board state, and the different powers you can choose as your action each turn, there is no way to plan ahead in this game, and the down time is just too much (at least at 4). I would play this again at a lower player count, but I actually doubt it would improve the experience enough for this to move up in my esteem.

RATING: 6
Has some similarities with 5 tribes, with color matching.  Played a 4 player game.  With all the different options available makes this game susceptible.  If you are not the active player, there is nothing for you to do during another players turn than to contemplate your own move. The problem with trying to plan out your move is that the board and cards available between turns changes so much.  So in reality, you are just hoping someone doesn't take your move and waiting for it to be your turn. At four players there is too much dead time.  My guess is that Yamatai plays best at two and Rhado doesn't like the turn structure at two.  

Boring turns with AP producing option makes for a game that meh or maybe a touch below.

Two things - 1. There is a very strong taste of Via Nebula when I demo'ed this game - I'm not sure it brings more to the table for me because of that but if I didn't own Nebula this would be a sure buy.

2. I know a lot of people are raving about the components - but THE PLAYER MATS ARE BARELY MORE THAN SHEETS OF PAPER! I have Portal of Heroes which I love and yes the mats are just paper - but that's an $18 game from Mayfair. But for $60 they should at least have the consistency of the fleet tiles.

I guess the game is good looking, maybe. The production quality is typical Days of Wonder, though there are certain inconsistencies in the iconography that are surprising.

The game itself is just kind of boring, I'm not sure what the target audience is for this. It's too complicated for casual play, but lacks challenge and excitement to be something I'd want to play again and again.

RATING: 6
I love all the mechanisms: the specialists, the boats, the "use what others leave you", and especially the turn order tiles. However, this falls flat because of one thing: every turn, there seems to be 8 good moves, none of which are better than the others, which means that you never pull off an amazing move: you only have pretty good ones. This leads to an even, unexciting hour and a half.

Beautiful components and artwork like any DOW production, but when everything is out on the board it's a really busy looking spread.  The game was a decent experience and not as AP as I expected but part of that was because I went into it with the mindset that I wasn't going to think through every possibility in order to keep things moving.  I like the game ok and would play it if someone asks me to but I don't plan on getting a copy because I'd probably choose a different game in that same weight that I'd want to play more.

RATING: 2.5
After a single tedious 2-player game spent with heads constantly in the rulebook, I conclude that this is a dull but complicated mess.  It’s far too complicated to play casually, and it is far too dull to want to play it repeatedly – or ever again, for that matter. 

Many reviewers say that the game is “gorgeous”. It isn’t. It’s a cutesy Disneyfied pastiche of some imaginary far-Eastern world with some seriously awful icons. A messy mix of subtly clashing pastels and loud primary colours isn’t gorgeous. It’s kitsch, people.

The game is a themeless abstract with too many moving parts: fleets, boats, tracks around islands, multiple states for each island, cost and worth of buildings, non-commensurate special abilities, fleet characteristics confounded with subsequent turn order…  If “stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage”, then “wheels within wheels do not an entertainment make, nor lots of bits a game”.

The theme is pasted on; the machinery is arbitrary. Thus for example the number and colour of boats required to buy a building is has nothing to do with anything. This random Heath Robinson wiring-together of the parts does not create a complex ecosystem, but a complicated fairground in which the coconut shy is roped onto one of the bumper cars, which whirl around jerkily as they plunge down the helter skelter.

Random and unnecessary complexity makes the game difficult to grasp, makes it easy to forget to garner points or use special abilities, and leads to players poring over the board for ages to conclude that they can’t do much of interest. Usually, decisions have little consequence, and whatever consequences they have usually weren’t really intended. Since the design creates systemic inability to predict the state of board at successive turns, every move is opportunistic, and there can be no planning. Since nothing is ever much more advantageous than anything else, there is no challenge. 

The game offers a limited opportunity to control player order, which you might want to do for 3 reasons: to play last so that you can then play first, giving you the opportunity to plan a tiny bit (but the way play order is determined makes that almost impossible to engineer); or to sacrifice random choices this move to have an earlier and slightly wider choice of some random stuff; or to have the pick of buildings near the end of the game. But if you are first to play in a given turn you can always ensure that you are first to play in the next one, so even that potentially mildly interesting struggle isn’t a struggle at all.

As the tedious evening progressed it became clear that the game does not evolve. There is no sense of building to a climactic moment. There is no story here. To mix metaphors, the players wander about and collect points with the same growing excitement as cows experience in a meadow as they wander about collecting mouthfuls of grass. 

This all combines to make a nicely egalitarian game. And that, I suppose, might account for some of its popular appeal. But not entirely, since petty decisions should not demand endless dithering. We found ourselves trying to help each other to find something interesting to do. For me, dull decisions squeezed out of long study add up to a sluggish, laboured slog. Even in a 2-player game, there is significant downtime. Playing with more than 2 must be more effective than Nitrazepam. 

This game has not earned shelf space in my collection. Yamataï, I disown you.

Gorgeous game. It's quite a bit more tactical than strategic but that's fine. Most groups thrive better on that anyway since strategy requires multiple plays whereas tactical plays can be done from game1 and forward.
The game itself feels quite... ok. While playing it. However, it leaves a really great lingering taste. It kinda gets stuck in your head.

This game is just beautiful to look at. The production quality of Days of Wonder is obvious and they keep making hit games that look gorgeous. The gameplay is fun and you can create some really great combos but the game just creates so much ap on people that playing with 4 might be a nightmare. My other issue is that 2 player game drags on for so long because there is still as many ships, specialists, buildings and more buildings so there is more to do. You also take 2 turns so you think more because the earlier turn might set something up for the later turn. So if there was something to speed up the game for end that would make the game so much better. I like Five Tribes more than this but I still like the game quite much. Sold after my girlfriend found it too ap inducing. Also, I like five tribes more.

Vastly better with more than 2. I find two increases the AP in this game even more - the game being almost entirely tactical in nature is already very prone to it. The 2P game is ultimately a very zero sum affair - this gets better as more players are added as you effectively "play off" your opponents for the entire game.

2017-04-14 - 7 - I played once. It didn't impress me as much as Five Tribes after the first play. Maybe I'm wrong but it seems to give less possibilities to the players than 5T. Although it seems to be a good game with nice looks and I will gladly play it again.

2018-02-05 - 7->6.5 -  Yamatai did not show me something new or interesting in my second play. It's a fine game, I would play anytime if someone suggested it, but I won't miss it and I would always choose Five Tribes over it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is actually a fair bit of similarity with Five Tribes although this one might be perhaps a bit less prone to AP due to less clutter on the board at the start. I found it entertaining but not one I need to own - I'd prefer to play Five Tribes. In this one the board fills up instead of being reduced as you remove pawns but the djinn and house placement is the same along with a couple other similarities. I think my biggest concern with the game is that the first player can maintain hold of the first player as long as s/he wishes if s/he is willing to take the lowest power boat. Towards the end of the game, that can be nasty so that timing likely needs to come into focus earlier than later.

RATING: 6.5
Usual amazing Days of Wonder production. Great components and artwork. Interesting mechanics and player choices. If other player aren't familiar with the special powers (rectangular tiles called "specialists" in this game), it's easy to get combos that allow you to be a run-away leader.

This game is often compared to Five Tribes even though the two games are actually very different and share only the same designer and some of the typical traits of his game designs.  Yamatai is perfectly fine as a game, and looks very nice, like all DoW games.  It lacks some of the things I like in Five Tribes, and even though it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges if I want to scratch the Cathala abstract itch I will always choose Five Tribes over Yamatai, hence the 5 rating (unlikely I would request it and would have no reason to play it when given better alternatives).

Pros:

- Nice puzzles of how to place boats and use powers and turn order to build the best buildings.

- Different strategies with different specialists.

- Pretty artwork.


Cons:

- It's all about how to get 4 points instead of 3 each turn - it's all tactical, with no broad scope.

- Definite advantage to the first player to start the game.

- Colorblind unfriendly.

I liked my play well enough, but ultimately found it unpleasant (yet breezy, if that makes sense.  Like floating the river except you're always swatting mosquitoes).  On the lighter side of midweight euro.  I don't like this game's hieroglyphics but they're serviceable I guess.  The icon on the specialist that lets you take half of the money allotted to unwanted specialists might be the worst icon I've ever seen in my life.

It's still just a little more involved than I really want to commit to if I'm going to play a euro though; the problem here is that there is a lot of cognition needed for figuring out what is even possible on the board and not enough needed for figuring out what the best play is; after five minutes studying the map you might have two or one viable choices.  You can't really plan ahead in this game either, and the resultant downtime seems excessive; I suspect this game is probably best with two.

RATING: 6
Extremely tactical game (especially in the early going) in which it is impossible to avoid setting up other players to score. As the game progresses, the helpers (kind of like the Djinns in 5 Tribes) shape your strategy to some degree. These helpers form some interesting combos and are much more central to gameplay than in 5T.

I thought the non-standard buildings would be distinctly better at first given that they can be worth 6 VP. However, the helpers combined with the standard building bonuses can make even the 1 VP trading post better. Imagine you have the 1 VP per 3 coins helper and the extra 1 VP per fan helper. If you build on a mountain next to two red buildings and make a chain of 6 standard buildings you would get a total of 11 points (1 pt for building, 3 fan chits at 2 pts each, $12 worth 4 pts). This fun little combo happened in my first game.

I liked my first play of this one. Fun mechanism of coloured boats entering play in to take tokens from the island and acquire advantageous tiles for you or build another type of tile that provide points. In order to build the right combination of coloured boats need to be present in the water surrounding the island. Fun mechanism, it works well. I wouldn't mind to play this again.

A fantastic follow-up to Five Tribes, the aestetics of the game is in a similar style, but the mechanisms are really different. Instead of the bidding mechanism for turn order you are instead choosing a boat tile that both determines what resources you get, what potential bonus ability you have for the round and the number helps determine player order for the next round.

You build ships and either grab tokens or build a house on a neighbouring island, if you have tokens to spend you may grab a specialist. The goal of the game is to earn the most points and there are a plethora of paths to take. Love this game, and look forward to play it again.

In most respects this is an abstract game dressed up with a fancy cartoon-like theme. It has some interesting and unique features—a joint path of multi-colored boats, the action selection mechanism for the selection and placement of boats, and the combinations of sets (building groups, proximity to mountains and buildings, specialist powers) that provide multiple approaches to scoring. Yamatai has many of the features that I enjoy. However, I found there is actually too much going on. I could get used to that. But the spoiler for me is the incredible amount of downtime (even in a two player game), especially mid to end game when your opponent is contemplating the kaleidoscope of possibilities. That's fine, but there is really nothing for you to do while waiting as the game state will change significantly after a two-fold move. The game just packs too much into what is ultimately a bewildering decision space, and there is not enough strategic thinking to make the tactical options worthwhile.

Only played once so far but initial play shows a nifty "think-y" game.
Can be easy to get AP'd whilst paying this, but there are a lot of options and combinations to be discovered using the Specialists to break the rules of the game and maximise your building score.
You're also trying to make sure you're not making it easier for your opponents to build their buildings too.
Lovely board and components (it is DoW after all!)

Shared resource type game where what you place will end up assisting other players. Tough decisions, as you can clearly see the opportunities you leave behind, and maneuvering yourself to take advantage of other player's 'leftovers' is tricky but doable. Special powers spice things up, and aside from buying specialists, there isn't much room for snowballing, making this mostly a tactical back and forth race to build your six buildings. Suffers in comparison to Five Tribes, but a solid game in its own right.

Does have a similar "best move puzzle optimization" feeling as Five Tribes.  But make no mistake, this is its own game.  After 1 play, to me this feels like it requires more thought to play well, analysis paralysis is a factor (but that doesn't bother me). It feels more interactive / cutthroat than Five Tribes.  Looking forward to more plays once I get my copy.

I can hear you thinking "Yeah, it's a Days of Wonder game. How involved can it be?"

Very.

There are many aspects to victory. You have to pay attention to everyone else's actions and placements. You have to hire specialists to enhance your turns. You have to build on islands -- after you accept the honor from the land. Make sure you don't have many boats left over! Remember there are extra points for building adjacent to your own buildings! If this sounds complicated, it's not really. Subsequent plays will be better, because they always are, but there's plenty here to please euro fans with low luck, art fans with a vibrantly-hued game, and those well beyond gateway games with smooth play, excellent iconography, and well-written rules.

Five Tribes crossed with Splendor and Mission: Red Planet. It has a lot more depth than catches the eye at first glance. There is a lot of reactionary play here. Collecting too many culture tokens can clear up spaces for another player to capitalise as building space. Abstract but beautiful fun -- if anything, this is a bit more cerebral and brainy than Five Tribes to play well... yet with less rules to teach. The core mechanism of the game is not quite as elegant as Five Tribes though... but since the two games are very different in feel, this does not matter. It does feel fresh and original.

Played a demo of this at a con after not being overly interested.  The game plays as it was described to me there, as a heavier Ticket to Ride.

There's a lot that I really like about this one, but it hasn't won be over yet. There's so much going on that it almost feels pointless to plan ahead or worry about what others are doing.  There are still some good tactical decisions, though, and the rating would probably go up if I'm playing with experienced players who can keep the game to an hour or less.

Probably better at 2p than Five Tribes. Focusing largely on building and focusing largely on collecting special powers both seem like reasonable paths to victory. 

The graphic design is a pretty, but bit busy... to the point where it slightly gets in the way of gameplay. Much of my "AP" time playing this was simply trying to take in the color patterns on the board...  Heaven forbid someone bumps the board!

Odd that the VP icons on the building tiles are inconsistent with the rest of the VP icons throughout the game...

Another solid game from Bruno Cathlala! My first play was a two player game and it ended very close at 50/47. Like every other game from the designer, this one is very unique and hard to compare to anything else.  Is basically a set collection, where you place boats of different colors adjacent to islands in other to meet the requirements to build in that island. The twist is that you all share the boats. There is also a restriction to placing the boats: the first boat must be of the same color of at least one boat adjacent to it, and the rest of the boats you place must connect to the first one you placed. This makes things more interesting. I would recommend this if you like Five Tribes, but I think this one is a bit lighter. Excellent game!

Nice game. Compared to Five Tribes and I can see the similarities.

You are forced to either clear an island or build on an empty island. This means that you have to pay careful attention to what is presented to you each turn and adjust your strategy accordingly.

The game can be quite slow as you can only make a move when you know the game state, which is usually just before your turn.

Very good looking game (like almost all of Days of wonder games). 
I'd say that the game is very close to Five Tribes - not with mechanics itself, but with the heaviness and the number of choices to be made.

I'd say that its very good for several games, but after that it can become a little bit boring.

I'd recommend it for more casual players than those that like rather heavy games.

First player on first turn too powerful without penalty. Too few overpowered powers. Rules are unclear for some powers. You can choose to go first every round and force a person to go last every round with no way of breaking out of the cycle. OK otherwise.

Interessante gioco tattico e strategico con una grafica bella colorata e viva. Il gioco non è per nulla banale e anzi si presta a fini strategie. In sostanza si acquistano e recuperano delle navi da piazzare per poter raccogliere dei gettoni bonus o edificare degli edifici che restituiscono soldi o punti. Il tutto viene condito con tesse bonus che sono degli autentici bonus che possono andare in combo e garantire molti punti vittoria. Un gioco ben realizzato che mi ha colpito.

As published, the game is unplayable by anyone who is colourblind. It would be trivial to produce the game with a universally usable colour set but apparently DoW have not even thought about the issue. They are simply stupid, lazy and incompetent. It is ridiculous to expect people to modify a game in order to play it, especially given the price tag. 
There are so many other games available - buy one of them instead.

I think I really like this game. If I ponder it, I want to play it again. Love the production quality, as always - Days of Wonder.

Peeved about the iconographic inconsistencies. That, and the fact that they force you to play certain colors by scaling the number of components with different player counts. Hate when publishers do that crap.

Based on the first play.
Ignore the people comparing it to 5 tribed. This game has absolutely nothing to do with five tribes (except the parallels from the djins to the specialists). Otherwise I prefer this game over five tribes.
Yamatai is much less tactical and more strategic than five tribes (especially playing with 3 or 2 players). A game with four people can be a bit exhausting if everyone is new to the game (long downtime, mostly just tactics).
However, great artwork, awesome mechanics, very easy rules, great playermat with turn overview. For people like me who consider their favourite games to be thinky, strategic and highly interactive this one is a no-brainer!

This game can be considered a "sister" to Five Tribes, an equally beautiful and exotic game that rewards pattern recognition and careful planning of turns. But while Five Tribes has some minor stalls with AP an auctions, Yamatai is an improvement over Five Tribes in gameplay, ease of learning and design. For one, there are less fiddly rules about scoring and there isn't an auction at the end of every round to determine player order (bidding with your own victory points solely for initiative makes people squeamish). Yamatai contains many meaningful decisions in every turn and every choice feels immediate and purposeful, but turns are almost impossible to not help set up your opponents for their turn as well. For me, the best part of the game is the turn order mechanic and special actions associated with each "fleet card." The most powerful actions of the game are lower in turn order while the less are reserved for the swiftest in turn order; it's a careful balance which leads to a victory, helped along with a careful selection of specialists and buildings. Yamatai is definitely a game that is easy to learn, hard to master, as the mysteries of the game are unraveled AFTER the turn you thought you were going to win. Everyone walks away from the game delighted by its design, elated by its length (it's a mercifully short Euro) and charmed by its originality. Plus, it's pretty.

Only 1 play so far,  but there will be more and I can see liking this as much as Five Tribes.   There are definitely similarities with the color matching of the boats and the specialists.  Of course there are significant differences as well, but the comparisons are justified.  I do believe there is room for meaningful long term strategy  amidst all the tactics.  A player can focus on one of the end game triggers and there are also fleet tiles that encourage building and there are tiles that encourage acquiring specialists.  Which specialists you get also grant you long term planning options. Yes, the game is very tactical, but there is more room for strategy than many claim. And due to the fact there are abilities that allow you to remove or shift boats on the board, I don't feel players are quite as affected by the changes in board state as they are in Five Tribes.  

Overall, a very solid game and it is one that has cemented my opinion that Cathala is the best current euro designer.  His work won't reach Knizia's prime, but that is too much to ask of anyone.

Yamataï was billed as the follow-up to Five Tribes, and while the components and mechanisms are mostly different, it does maintain the same feel. Players are adding boats of different colors around islands on the map; once played, these boats don't belong to a specific player. These boats can either be used to claim culture tokens on the islands or used to meet criteria to create a building card from the display. The culture tokens can be turned in to claim god tiles that grant points and special powers. Like in Five Tribes, you have to be incredibly careful not to set up the next player for a really strong move; this was amplified by the fact that clearing culture tokens seems less good but enable the higher-point buildings to be placed. I was pretty lukewarm on Five Tribes because of the player order binding and the analysis paralysis potential, and I feel pretty similarly about this.

Very interesting (and nice looking) game, with different possible strategies and a lot of tactical options. I especially like the turn-order mechanism, and the fact that you have to anticipate your opponents next move(s). The latter makes it quite prone to analysis paralysis though, and it could get quite a drag. I like the game idea, but it's too heavy with too many tactical options in my opinion.

I can see the similarities to Five Tribes that many others have mentioned, but the game is sufficiently different that I'm happy to own both.

Possibly not at its best with 4 players - everyone's usually going for the same building spots so it's very difficult to plan ahead, and there's only a little strategic variance based on which specialists you manage to pick up, but still this is an attractive and enjoyable spatial optimisation puzzle-style game.

Good, but not as good as Five Tribes for me personally. Maybe because it feels a bit similar as Five Tribes: the experts remind me a lot of the Djinns for instance. What it also shares with Five Tribes is the AP-level. This is an opportunistic game: you wait until it's your turn and simply do what gives the most points with the possibilities left. So 3 is probably the best player count for this game imho.

You can definitely feel Bruno Cathala in this game, you know it is his design. Beautiful game and well produced, as expected. Game play was fine, it honestly didn't wow me. I enjoyed the plays okay but I think I might have expected more. The downtime between turns can't be helped. You can not plan for your turn if you don't know what you will be able to get. Interesting turn order mechanism. I kinda feel there is no upward progression in the game and I am not really working to accomplish anything. Happy to play again, probably won't own it.

​Overly colourful straight Euro-with-a-pasted-on-theme, but one which flows very smoothly. The initial comprehension of what you're supposed to be doing can be quite difficult, but a round or two of play sees most of the mechanics ​in action and it all becomes clear, letting you concentrate on both strategy and tactics. Buildings are the main way to score, but coins, bonus points and specialists all add up. Plays pretty quick for a four-player 'thinky' Euro. Ya, matey.

RATING: 3
Yamatai could be good with 2 or 3 maybe. With 4 it's just setting up good moves for your opponents as all the recipes get taken by the time your turn comes around again so you just sort of hope that someone sets you up. The compensation for setting people up is getting seal tokens, which get spent to take character tiles. These tiles generally did not seem very useful. In our game many ended up unpurchased.
Also there are some awkward iconography issues. Two different vp icons, two seal tiles that look almost the same but are different, and two types of red communal buildings but they are functionally the same.
The core gameplay is also uncompelling where you get a turn order tile that comes with 1-3 boats. You can't save more than 1 of those boats for a later move. You put the boats down on spots so that the first placement is adjacent to a boat of the same color, then the other boats can be whatever color you want. It's a puzzle of sorts but not really? It boils down to a success restriction you have little control over. Especially since the turn order tiles have abilities that can remove or remove boats so the board state could change a lot between your turns. I don't mind tactical games, but I like to be able to plan at least one turn ahead.

I think a lot of people went into Yamatai expecting it to supercede Five Tribes, which I feel is unfair.

It simply needs the right audience.

I was really concerned at the start of my first game of this. However, once we all got the hang of it, it really did play well. There's a lot of planning and AP players will slow things down a lot trying to plan more in advance. Although, that is worse with 2-player games where you go twice per round. Tough decisions and balancing act with everything being available to everyone at all times and the boats not being controlled by players. There is a tile to reserve a building card. The powers and player order action selection is fantastic! Colorful, beautiful game.

Been playing daily a few times for a couple weeks, so this has good replayability. A little lighter than 5 Tribes, but with a nice depth of play. It has a very different feel while still retaining a degree of familiarity mechanically. Production is top notch and visually appealing.

Like 5 Tribes, the theme won't be apparent until you've played it a few times, but once you"get it", it makes sense. Unlike 5 Tribes, it isn't as thematically quite as immersive; While 5 Tribes thrusts me into a role of a shrewd Middle East trader, Yamatai doesn't quite get me past planning trade routes on a map. Still, I find the theme to be satisfying and clever.

I love the ship placement mechanism. Each player trying to lay down their best path to victory while not giving their opponents better options is really tense and very thought provoking. All the Specialists feel good. There are multiple paths to victory. And, despite what the BGG forums suggest, I haven't seen a dominant strategy arise.

WARNING: "Yamatai" is the least color-blind friendly game I have played in a long time. I've played about a dozen or so games at this point and each and every one I had to constantly ask other players which ships were which colors, what the colors on the turn and building tokens were, etc. 

So, despite how much I like "Yamatai," I can't actually play it.

Solid game. Beautiful components, as you would expect out of Days of Wonder. There are a few things going on here, such as where to place your boats and which ones to take, and how that can impact turn order, and whether or not to get the chits for the specialists or to try to build instead. For whatever reason, though, I don't seem to fully get a good strategy in this one, and so I find it a little frustrating. Maybe it's that it's hard to find the right balance in timing my turn order and which islands to open up.

RATING: 8
This is mostly an abstract game with a lot of asynchronous powers and interesting systems.  In this game each player starts by choosing a turn order tile that also dictates the color ships they receive for the round and a special power.  Then by placing the ships on the board they either get to build buildings granting them points or collect tokens which can be traded in for more special power tiles.

The game has a lot of depth of strategy to it and can be played many different ways thanks to all the systems at work and unique powers available.  It is also a gorgeous game, typical of Days of Wonder, with a very useful box insert as well (which is all too often understated).

I am starting with an 8 out of 10 but my rating could easily go up: quite enjoy this unusual game. It shares ground with "Five Tribes" but does enough own things to make both games valuable and fun for me.
The building mechanism take a little bit to getting used to but half way through I started to get really into it. I think the specialists (more so than the Djinns in FT) really drive your strategy. More games to come, I expect this to be more challenging with 3 and 4.

Had fun, but a little concerned that there's not enough lasting impact to your choices, so that long term planning isn't really necessary or available.

Played it twice. All the four players didn't feel much excitement. You just do your turn, get some coins or build a building, but it doesn't really effect the other players that much. The artwork is alright but the options in a turn are very limited. Turn order mechanism is very original though

Great game, so many options to consider on your turn, and multiple layers of planning ahead too. And it looks amazing.

tl;dr: another one of those fine but unexceptional games

This feels mostly like a classic Euro to me. Nice, straight forward placement rules, a moving row of building projects that score in different ways, and a more modern twist with unique characters that change things up a bit.
All of this comes with very nice components and artwork, as you might expect from a Days of Wonder title. One weird thing is that a different icon is used for points on the buildings than on anything else. Unneseceraly confusing. I'm not sure how that happened, but it shouldn't have.
This is a typical medium weight, more or less family friendly strategy game that works well and is pleasant, but also unexceptional. It does what it sets out to do, but nothing more, and that's a bit of a shame. But I suppose most people will enjoy this and find it worth playing.
I wouldn't refuse playing it again, but I don't expect to request this to hit the table any time soon.

Initial rating: 7/10

Vin d'jeu: french review & video of Yamatai http://www.vindjeu.eu/2017/05/09/yamatai/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
looks very interesting but seems to have flaws

+ theme
+ interesting mechanics (fleet tiles, experts, ...)
+ good materials, especially the little wooden ship meeples and the big gates ("Toriis"), although not sure about the thin cardboard
- could have a bit more to it (Unfinished game design? Maybe needs an expansion?)
- artworks look a bit too cutesy
- expensive

It leaves you wondering: Why only 10 fleet tiles? Why no asymmetric player powers although there are player boards? Why ships only from the left? ...

A little too long for what it is at two player. Need more plays to determine if this improves.

EDIT.....do NOT play this with AP-prone players.

Point salad. Feels more plodding than it ends up being.

You run chains of boats through islands, claiming special powers and building for points and often money. Drafted variable player powers and variable turn order.

My favourite 2017 game so far.

The game feels incredibly polished, everything feels so balanced, every move gives your opponents opportunities to piggy back.

Play time is spot on as well, never seams to drag on or end too soon, also AP is not as high as in 5Tribes.

This is best with 2 players, 3 is ok, but really not recommended with 4.

Tamatai, like all Days of Wonder titles, is beautiful. I like the idea of bidding for your action, which then becomes your turn order. Paying for ships, but ultimately laying them on the board for anyone else to capitalize on is also a very novel mechanic.

It feels like it plays very well at two players, as well. I could see me rating of this one rising after repeated plays.

Really enjoyable and much more difficult than we expected. There unfortunately isn’t much strategizing—it’s purely tactical because you can’t plan too far ahead because you’re opponent will probably mess it up.

The production quality & illustrations are amazing! The insert isn’t as nice as Quadropolis but works okay.

RATING: 8
Very solid game and balanced overall. Had much fun playing it. Some tips while playing it the first time:

1. When starting at a start position u can place 2 boats of diffrent color, then u must put one of the same and so on.

2. Very easy to miss putting coins on specialists that wherent recruited during the turn.

3. Follow the playerboard closely. Had alot of issues with this in my group. Selling ships as a afterthought is not allowed. 

4. U only get Culture tokens equal to the amount of shipps u play out on board. Puching ships and relocating them does not count.

Very nice game and rate it high. They say there is some AP problems with higher player counts but dident notice it.

[thing=213893][/thing] is a neat game: is pretty, has a nice set of decisions, indirect interaction, is somewhat easy to teach and play. It could be a big winner. But it wasn't. That is mainly due to time - the amount of it that I expend [i]not[/i] playing.

I'm rarely bothered by downtime in games. I like to play, I enjoy the environment they create and often is interesting to see what the others are doing. Still, on [thing=213893][/thing] I just couldn't ignore the downtime. Not only the turns tend to be long - yes, yes, maybe you and your beautiful and smart friends play fast, but I don't play with them or you -, as the game has all the informations of the round open at the start of it - there won't be a random draw of cards, of events, no dice roll. This leads to more control, and normally a min-max situation: players keep taking long turns in order to calculate many possibilities, trying to find the one that will give just one more point. "Four is good. Hummmmm...." (1 minute of ponderation) "But this will give me 5 if I buy this boat, move this to there and place these there. Nice! So I will do th-- no, no. Wait a minute. Can I get that other building? Let me see... If I took that tile"...

And there is basically nothing to do in the other players turn. There aren't off-turn plays. No response necessary. No direct interaction that goes more than give or take a few coins from one person to the other.

What is more - since the board state can change a lot, with the addition of boats, some possible movements and openings, and the taking of an assistent tile or a building - there is not even a good reason to actually start planning before your turn is up. Something you couldn't do just one turn before, now you can - and something you could, you can't, or simply isn't the best maximum point gathering you can make now.

One person truly wouldn't miss anything objectively important if, after playing her turn, she would leave the table to do something else, and just return when called. Your presence wouldn't be required for anything (if you trust the people you are playing with, of course), and your planning wouldn't be faster if you were there.

To add insult to injury, is possible, and happens quite often, a person can be the first to play this round, and be the last to play in the next round. Meaning, in a 4 player's game, to wait 6 turns to happen before playing again.

[thing=213893][/thing] doesn't have other major flaws: it offers multiple paths to victory, interactions between strategies and the assistents, a good amount of room for timely actions and opportunity play. [i]When][/i] you are playing, the game is good - the problem is that, when you aren't, [thing=213893][/thing] is mind numbing. The playing time tells the whole story: it should last 40 minutes, but it takes 80 (or more).

[thing=213893][/thing] will be a great candidate for game platforms of asynchronous play, specially turn-based. Yet, sadly, I play it live. If you are going to do the same, try to play with gut-players, or else, with the min-max crowd, you are in for a treat.

I think this is a great Euro style game. Five tribes in reverse. Instead of starting with a million options and ending with very few, you start with very few options and just keep building til you have an almost overwhelming number of choices. Love it. Just watch the amount of AP this game will generate. Especially playing with an obsessive number  cruncher. You're gonna be waiting awhile for your turn in the last few rounds.

Not what I was expecting. I read the comparisons to 5 Tribes and figured I would love this game but it fell pretty flat for me. I certainly see the similarities but highly prefer 5 Tribes. The rules are pretty easy to get down after a round or two. The game feels like nothing really fits together. Building off a certain color ship only to follow with what ever ship you want seems silly. The leaders aren't nearly as powerful as buildings. In 5T there were numerous ways to score lots of points, Yamatai feels different. The theme for me was even a miss. I do like the components and art as DoW stays solid on that front. I'm certainly glad I played it before buying it.

The game seemed poorly balanced for 2 players with respect to the money resource. There was a lot of down time (made worse by not being able to effectively plan ahead) that would only get worse with more players. This game doubles down on the (shallow, but computational intensive) complexity of the game by giving each resource type 5 colors to keep track of. So the "game" decisions are simple but require tons of time and thought to sort out the "puzzle" aspect to see if you can actually take the lines of play you want to. Needless complexity to make a game seem more interesting and thinky than the boring and simple core mechanics actually are is the most significant pitfall Euros make, and Yamatai makes that misstep into a gleeful stride.

Area control of the ancient land of isles.  Network cargo ship routes puzzle to supply the right combination of resources to build structures and expand on the islands.  Be first to explore island cultures to gain workers. Good strategy and thinky when considering how to develop the ship network, when and where to build and expand, which helper special abilities to build combos, while anticipating and racing against opponents for the obvious spots. I also like the side strategy from varied strength cargo ship selection paired with next round initiative.

Yamataï is a gorgeous game that simply does not stand out gameplay-wise. Placing boats, grabbing specialists, taking tiles... We've all seen it before. Add to that the AP-proneness (is that a word?), and it's another euro that is overshadowed by many games before it.

Looks lovely but it's mostly pretty boring and an AP player turned this into a gaping yawn fest during my only play, which I admit is not neccessarily a fault of the game but the experience has not left me wanting to give this another chance anytime soon. One of my most pyrrhic victories in a game.

Colourful game, but I found it hard to plan actions as the state of the board can change a lot.   I found a similar game "Oracle of Delphi" to be better, its easier to understand (pick up and deliver) and easier to plan out moves and chain actions together.

Yamatai is a nice looking game, but sadly its not for me.

Egy kicsit emésztenem kell. Ami nagyon tetszett, az a látványvilág, elképesztően színes és gyönyörű az egész, de pont ez a vizualitás az, amitől egy óra után megfájdulhat a fejed... emellett egy kicsit AP veszélyes is az egész, nagyon sok a lehetőség, nehéz végiggondolni a dolgokat. A pár oldalas szabályból így agysistergős euro lesz, de ennek ellenére egyáltalán nem bántam a játékot (sőt), hiába számítottam vmi sokkal könnyedebbre.

Not a bad game. Nice filler to play with people who usually don't play. What is fun is that it is a simulaneous play. At the start, you don't really know what to do but you soon feel how to play the game. Still, there is some strategy involved and the game sets you in the same position as other players so you don't feel like luck got in the way. It's really the same kind of game as 6 Nimmt or "l'ascenseur" in french. Not especially my cup of tea but enjoyable in its kind.

A really clever and fun, heavy-side of light card game with quite a few interesting mechanics.  Quick to play and with very cute artwork, too.  

Lots of game for the price.  Nice.

And if you're a Hearts player, you'll recognise a few of the mechnics and strategies here - passing cards, knowing when to play high and low, when to risk winning a play etc.

Wow, what a great little game! Deceptively pitched as a kids' game. The auction/push your luck combination creates a lot of tension, and there's plenty of tactical maneuvering to hold on to the lowest tide card. However, two plays so far have taken far too long for what the game gives.

Zum Kuckuck!  I really enjoy this game!  It has a strong predictive angle and a good amount of strategy.  I like how the hands get passed around once so that everyone plays each one.  Very balanced like that.

Light filler reminds me of some aspects of 6 nimmt. I thought that the whole pass your hand and flotation devices to the next player aspect of the game was interesting. It certainly was neat to get a hand of cards that you have seen all the other players in the game play out and see how you can do with it compared to everyone else. I'd never seen anything like that in a game before.

RATING: 7
A decent party/group game with an admirable "oh yeah, try playing my hand" mechanic of rotating the same hands until everyone has played each of the hands.

A bit random in its feeling at times.  Pick a number between 1 and 60 that is in your hand; now play it, and let's see the ordering of the numbers played.  In theory, I guess, some players will memorize the hands as they are passed around. To such memorizing players, I say: hats off to you...you deserve to win.

Fair amount of chaos here - choosing a 23 might be disastrous,  while choosing 21 or 25 might be fantastic.  There is no way enough info to permit accurate judgement,  and even if there were,  it would require opponents to play "locically".  Fairly quick,  else much lower rating.

RATING: 10
[b]Luck:[/b] While there is luck in the hand you are dealt the fact that everyone has to play each hand mostly mitigates this. Still, it can be said that playing the bad hand last has some advantage as you will have better knowledge as to what everyone else has in hand.

[b]Strategy/Tactics:[/b] This game is mostly tactical in nature with the players reacting to the new tide cards each turn. The tactics involve attempting to predict how each other player will play (High, low or middle) and then playing accordingly.

[b]Weight:[/b] It can be played simply and taught easily but offers a lot of  meaningful and important decisions. 

[b]Fun:[/b] If you enjoy games involving a high degree of psychology in predicting how the other players will play then this game is a lot of fun. Otherwise you might be left lacking.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] One of my all time favorite games. It plays differently depending on who you are playing with and involves a high degree of direct player interaction when trying to predict your opponents next go. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys player analysis in their games.

One play with 3 players was okay, but I think it would be better with 4 or 5 players.  Interesting game... I'm just not sure how fun it can be.  I suppose with 4 or 5 you could have some Category 5 moments.  Also, I like the idea of everybody playing each hand once.

Definitely better with 4 players and that is probably the best number for this game.  Making the right choice is quite subtle, but I do find it interesting.  With 3 players, the decisions are not as interesting.  With 5 players, I could see how the game might be too long for what it is.

Donated.

A smashing little filler. Actually requires some thought and clever play. Reminded me of Nomination Whist a lot.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A light hand management game, where you try to pick your battles at the right time, and hope you can decipher what everyone else is doing.  The game is basically the 2nd part of for sale.  It is neat how you play each hand one time.  Doesn't surpass For Sale by any means, but this one was definitely interesting.

RATING: 6
Good game, but not a stand out in an already crowded niche of 20 to 30 minute card games. Uses a "contact bridge" style of balancing play which I don't see in too many games but overall loses out to games like For Sale, No Thanks, or 6 Nimmt.

Played a lot of this with the family. Usually not a fan of repeated secret/simul reveals, but the balancing factors of number of perservers and playing all the hands makes this interesting to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat little game, but I don't like that you exchange hands with everyone and play again.  It just seems like a strange solution to the problem of one person having a better hand than another.  Just trade hands and play again!  Five players, five games.  It's like those 2-player games that are unbalanced, where the rules say, play 2 games, switching sides!  I'd rather play one balanced game than two unbalanced ones...

Having said all that, I'd play Turn The Tide again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cool trick taking/blind bid game.  What drew me to getting the game was that hands are dealt out and after each round, you pass that hand to the next person.  That sounded cool, and you know what, It was!  As the game went on we all chatted on what was good and what was bad.  There wasn't any "I got screwed by my hand".  I'm glad we finally played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a cute cards game. The sheeps are lovely. The system reminds me to Kramer's Category 5 but here the consequences are different. It's great that your cards in the next round will be other player's cards, well thinked to kill the luck of having better/badder cards than your opponents. 

Ordered a copy after playing with Chari and Suffo.

After some play, it can turn a little boring. I need to take a breath with this.

*update*

Purchased for the second time after got rid of it two years ago... I supose this is a good sign, it's a good filler.

Another decent filler, liek a for Sale variant, as you use cards to bid for other cards, some of which you may want to take, some you certainly do not. 2 cards in the middle each round, highest bidder takes one, second highest takes the other. Cards are placed in front of you, on top of any you had before, so each player shows 1. The highest card after every roudn costs the owner one of their 4 lives. Easy!

Fun little filler. Goes nice and quick.

Players rotating hands after each round is really, really interesting. It's sort of worth a play just to see such a  unique mechanic in action alone. The tide cards add the necessary amount of luck for a card game, though I will say maybe the whole system obfuscates the entire question of whether luck or strategy was the deciding factor somewhat. And frankly, I don't mind. I just find it fascinating.

It's nice that this game just strips everything else away and it's purely about trying to figure out what other players are likely to play, so you can make the correct play now and save your "good" cards for later. If that's your kind of thing, it's really at its best here.

I guess it's not a terrible game, but I actively disliked it during play. Something just seems wrong with it. Poor cards + get behind early and you can sink pretty fast.

This is sort of a trick-taking game, but it takes a while to get the feel for it.  The twist to this game is that each hand gets played by all the players; after each round, all hands pass to the left.  This game is part intuition (getting a feel for what other players are doing in order to play cards accordingly) and part memory.

This game is supposedly for 3-5 players, but I feel it's best with 5 and really terrible with 3.  With 3 players, life preservers get lost *very* quickly since only one person can duck both cards each trick, and when players hit -1 for the round, it gets a little pointless.

This game also has very, very cute sheep.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly fun game of blind bidding, double think, and hand management. Despite being very unlike a trick-taking game, it still has that sequence-management vibe of trick-taking games. Everyone plays each hand once. Each has a maximum point value. Each trick, two cards ranked 1-12 are turned up, and everyone simultaneously plays a card from their hand. The high card played gets the low card of the two. The second lowest gets the high card. These cover any previous ones taken. Whichever payer has the high card facing loses a point. When the hand is over, pass your hand and do it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A delightfully clever trick taking game.  Properly should be played with the variant that the players display their initial hands to the others.  Otherwise the results of the first hand will be effectively random compared to subsequent hand rotations.

Wicked little blind bidding game with a scoring twist. A cross between 6nimmt and for sale. Best played with the 6nimmt variable of removing from the game the highest cards, not random ones. Love the hand passing mechanism, I am surprised it hasn't been copied often.. Keeper.

This just didn't catch me for some reason, I felt that most of the plays were fairly arbitrary and the decisions obvious.  Plus getting the crap hand first and then waiting for the power hand to come around was more irritating than fun.  Blah.

A grafika szép, a minőség a szokásos Piatnik-Amigo kártya, úgyhogy teljesen rendben van a dolog! :)
A szerencse szinte egyáltalán nem befolyásoló tényező, mivel mindenki megkapja később más kártyáját, nem fogható erre a vereség!

Update: egyre jobban tetszik!!
Hátránya csak annyi, hogy ketten nem játszható, valamint az első körben nagyobb a szerencse szerepe, mert még nem ismerjük egymás lapjait. De ez is elkerülhető, ha előtte mindenki megmutatja a többieknek! :)

Super FUN filler-type game that is a bit similar to Slide 5 or 6 Nimmt, but with slightly more complex/subtle card-play to avoid the bad scoring cards.  Not really filler length though, as you play the number of rounds as players.  Each subsequent round you collect your discard pile and pass that played hand to the left.  Then you play your right-hand neighbor's cards from the previous round, until you've played all dealt hands.  Who played each hand best??  That's awesome!  First play with 5p.

Fun, interesting game of simultaneous card plays where you are trying to not play the *second* highest card.  There's more to think about than in (the similar) 6 Nimmt!  But the mechanic that "makes" the game is that the hands of cards are passed between rounds, so everyone ends up playing all the hands.  To make this truly meaningful, I'd like to try having the tide cards come out exactly the same each round (though that will require more bookkeeping...).

June 2007.  Good game at predicting what other people will play.  Very similar to For Sale without the bidding.  I like the element that you get to play everyone's hand.  Without that feature, this would seem just like all the other blind bidding card games.  But if you have a good enough memory to figure out what other people have, it becomes a fun game of thinking about what other people HAVE to play.

Production: The Amigo edition cards look great, despite their simplicity; Oliver Freudenreich’s art is always soft on the eyes.  I would like to try the new Gamewright edition, just to see of I prefer token life preservers to cards.  Play: Each player playing each hand is very novel; I enjoy how the different hands become familiar as time goes on.  The blind bidding is also interesting, as players, based on their current water level, will make different sorts of choices.  I think this plays best with 3.  (3+1+3) (5 plays)

Great trick-taking cards game. It looks like a filler (or a game for kids), but there is more depth to it especially with experienced players. Moreover the game is fun to play. Still a favorite after 20 years of play.

-Hand management + risk taking 
- There are 12 tricks per round and you'll have to play each of your 12 cards in hand. This leads to many agonizing choices on how to play your weak cards or strong cards.
- Then each player will play a round with each hands, which add an extra layer of strategy as players around the table get more and more familiar with each hands as the game progress, so they can make more "informed" choices.

The Zum Kuckuck 1997 variant, had better and funnier artworks.

Rotating each set of the 12 cards dealt per player so everyone has to play it once per round definitely goes a long way towards eliminating complaints about getting a bad draw, but there's a sense of dread nonetheless when it's your turn to play that bad draw.

Fairly unique game that card enthusiasts will probably enjoy.

RATING: 6
With mixed success, Turn the Tide tries to build a deeper game around the Take 6 'simultaneous disclosure' mechanism. A player probably will get better results if he keeps track of the information he learns about the hands as they move from player to player, but the effort of doing so diminishes the fun, in my view.

The game that introduced me to German games via a mutual gaming friend during New Years 2004.  I'm also somewhat horrid at this game (hmmm, both this and 6 Nimmt are simultaneous mechanics...hmmm).  But it has a soft spot for me since it was 'the first' and because it is so unique.

Ratings history: 888|7...|8|7

AUG 2004: Quite chaotic, but the mechanisms are so much fun that it adds a lot to the ever-unquantifiable fun factor. I love trading hands as the rounds progress. The strategic "weight" of the game reminds me a -lot- of Frank's Zoo. Some tactical play, but kind of a gut feeling to the process. Unlike 6 Nimmt! there is nothing to base your bid on, so players have a bit less info that way, but they have an idea of how good a player's hand is by how many life preservers they have (plus, they will be playing with your hand in the next round or two...=)

I do wonder how often this will hit the table though. It's simply not the kind of game you want to play every night (unlike a game like Bohnanza).

AUG 2013: Still a winner with anyone I introduce it too - even Ameritrash gamers.

AUG/14 - Still a hit with everyone I teach it to.

This is a clever little game.  Graphics are pleasing.  Small, takes up little shelf space.

Player's hands are passed to the left for subsequent rounds--every one has a chance to play the same hands.

What I don't like is that players have a better chance of winning if they can remember what was in their previous hands!! ugh! Another memory game! Still, I like it.

Fun, fast and everyone gets a crack at every hand.  Interesting hand management, you need to jump on those low water levels when they come out.  The random aspect of the two contested cards every round ensures a new twist every turn.  Somehow, we always end up laughing and having a great time with this game.  Few who have tried this game will turn it down.  Always a good sign.

Update:  That's it.  I finally caved in and gave the game a 9.  The response I get from the new gamers I show this game to is unanimous.  I always like playing and visions of drowning sheep always cause much merriment and joy.

This is a game of clever blind bidding somewhat reminiscent of Dorra's classic For Sale.

Took me two hands to get it, and then it was a giggling blast from then on.  Try to keep your pigs from going blub and then glub.  Learned to play it from Joseph in Sedro-Woolley, WA, and played it with him and Britta.  Loads of fun.  Trying to find the pig version of this game, but no such luck ... yet.  Played another game of it in December 2010 with Joseph, Britta and Noelle, and I think it's even more fun with four players than with three.  Got the German (pigs) version in the mail today (2-3-2011) and will keep the English (sheep) version so that I have the English rules handy.  Can't wait to play the pigs version with friends on the East Coast.  Today (7-2-2011) I played my first three-person game with Mr. Billington and Gayle.  We all had fun.  I won for the first time (out of 3 games so far), 6 (me), 4 (Gayle) and 2 (Mr. B.).  Definitely want to play it again with them, if possible, before going back to WA State in mid-August.  Played two 3-player games today (7-16-2011) with Mr. Billington and Gayle.  Mr. B won the first game and I won the second.  So glad that Joseph introduced me to this game.  Played another game today (7-30-2011) with Mr. Billington and Gayle and this time Gayle won.  Definitely bringing this game with me (plus other equally small games) to WA State next month.  Played this at Gaming in the Woods in WA State and had a blast with both a four-player game (which was both haywire and lots of fun) and a five-player game.  Played another game of it the next day at Gaming in the Woods.  Played another game of this today (9-3-2011) with the Billingtons and Gayle won 8 (her) to 5 (me) to 0 (Mr. B).  Two more games today (12-2-2011) with the Billingtons and Gayle won both games.  I miss the everything-goes-haywire kind of games, but still lots of fun regardless.  Played another game of this today (12-9-2011) with Gayle and her dad, and Gayle won again.  Finally got to play this again today (5-5-2012), two games with Gayle and her dad.  First game was 2-2-1, with Gayle and me tied for first, and her dad in second.  Second game was 4-3-3, with her dad winning, and Gayle and me tied for second.  Not haywire, totally unpredictable games, true, but really fun anyway.  Played this at Dragonflight Con and just as fun as ever with a 5-player game (and I won, which was a bonus to a great game).  I taught the other 4 players how to play it and they liked it too.

great little card game where you try to keep hold of your life preservers.  very good mechanic that everyone played a round with each hand, so onone can claim that they got dealt a bad set as an excuse for doing poorly.  also, second highest player in each trick gets the duff card, so you can also try to stay under the radar.  prettly much the opposite of the bottle imp, where you want to come second, under the radar..

Turn the Tide is very similar in style to Category 5. If you like one, you'll probably also like the other. Turn the Tide is the more balanced game of the two because bad hands don't hurt as much: each hand is played once by every player, and bad hands can score higher to start with.

I didn't like Turn the Tide the first few times that I played it. However, as I got in some games with more than 3 players I started liking it more and more. With more players there are more chances to "hide in the middle" which adds some tactical flair.

Acquired 6-16-2007. 

[Original comment] This is a cool game. I like the idea of everyone having a chance to play the same card hands, once each. We play it with 6 or 7 players, and it plays reasonably quickly. It's interesting to compare how different players succeed or fail with the same hands, although the difference can sometimes be laid to the random order of the cards on which everyone must bid.

May 2009 -- We are still enjoying this game and bring it out several times a year.

October 2011 -- This game is challenging every time we play. Although we compare how each person plays each hand, the different order of cards being bid upon can make quite a difference in how successful each hand can be. We play the game very quickly, so it is good when there is not time for a longer one.

Cute artwork, fun, light game.  I like the little life preservers in the Gamewright edition, but if space is an issue, go for Land Unter.  This game has been a little hit and miss with groups that I have introduced it to, but I personally like it.

For a card game, this is quite ingenious.  Turn the Tide has lots of replayability.  Every round is different and you have to think on your toes, despite the fact that after the first round you know where some of the crucial cards are.  The drawback is the same hand and the same level of skill do not guarantee you the same result, so who wins can be rather random, depending on how other people play each round.  It's sort of a rock, paper, scissors game on each round with unpredictable results.  However, with such a fun game, who cares who wins?  Just enjoy it and try your best with what you've got.  You can base your strategy on how each player played their previous rounds and you get more information as the game progresses.  Recommended for both enjoyment and skill, recognise that even the best skill in this game can get you nuked.  I still like it though.

I have played a lot of simultanious action games but this might be the best one.

I love how you at least have an idea what the other player's hands are like by the nuber of life preservers they have and eventually everyone will player everyone else's hand.

It is so all about how you play the hand, not what the hand is.

RATING: 6.5
Similar to simultaneous-reveal Drahtseilakt but less elegant. However, it has the interesting twist that the dealt hands are passed around the table, thus mitigating the luck of the draw.

This game is great! I love the rotating hands concept, and the "hand weight" scoring mechanism of the life preservers. Plus, there is the tension of playing the "highest vs. second highest card" when there are particularly nasty numbers on the board. On the longer side of "fillers", but well worth it.

A nifty little card game that's sort of a mix between 6 Nimmt! and David & Goliath. One must manage the play of cards pretty well. The best part, however, is that every new round the hand of cards is rotated, so everyone gets a chance of playing with everyone else's starting hand.

RATING: 7
Really fun little filler card game.  Has a few neat things going on.  First, it plays like high-low poker - guessing whether other players are going high or low is important.  Second, since you pass the hands and everyone gets to play them, the highly luck-based nature of the game is reined in somewhat.  The whole "I played your hand better than you" is a lot of fun.  Third, like many hand management games, this one is more about when to play your crappy cards than it is about when to drop your good cards.  Finally, where many blind bid-type card games screw up is the total lack of information involved.  This game gives you some information through the number of life preservers and more limited information through the passing of the hands.  It injects a little bit of memory into the game, which I dislike, but also makes the blind cardplaying a lot more interesting.  You don't know everything your opponent has, but you may remember he has the biggest card, or several very low cards, or whatever.  This is a real gem!

Better than the average filler, but probably best with 4 or 5 players. With three, one person was usually eliminated, and then the last two players just play their hight cards.

RATING: 7
Luck driven? Somewhat. Dorra clearly worked hard to make it as fair as possible though. Because of the way the tide cards come up randomly, even when you play the same hand as before, you will have to play it differently. And the debate of course still rages on about whether blind bidding is chance or strategy. I like it as a trick-taking game, even though I did not win my first game until I had played about 10 times. And those games were with equally inexperienced players. My ego wants to say that was just luck, but I think that there is more strategy there than people want to give it credit for. Hand passing mechanic is the biggest plus, very unique. The "wanting to be second highest" also does a lot for it. But I have to mention that I think the theme is very tacked-on. It's cute and whimsical, but the scoring doesn't really work for me. You get a set number of preservers. The less you use, the more points you get. I thought the goal was to SAVE your sheep/pigs by giving them preservers. But you LOSE points when you lose a preserver. A minor complaint, but the game doesn't feel like I am saving sheep at all. It feels like I am trying to get the lowest number. Still fun, in the same way a trick-taking game with a deck of cards is fun.

Sheep in inner tubes. I found myself actually concerned that my sheep was going to drown. Must choose correct card, must not let sheep drown! What do I pick, high? low? Trying to out-guess the other players can get very tense. (No sheep were harmed in the playing of this game. This time.)

Land Unter/Turn the Tide is a quick playing take on a similar theme to Kramer's 6 Nimmt/Category 5/Slide 5 or Dorra's own For Sale.

Players want to play number cards from 1-60 in such a way that they either low ball a trick, or at least win the trick in order not to take higher rising Water Level cards.

But the twist here is that taking a Water Level card is fine, as long as it isn't the highest current Water Level card- and in this case what you might want to get rid of are the middling non-winner/non-loser cards.

Like For Sale, how you play the cards you are dealt is key to how well one does- a well timed middle card means very little, a poorly timed one can eliminate you from a hand.

If a player has the highest Water Level card exposed, they lose a life preserver- and keeping life preservers is how players score points, so avoiding the highest Water level is important on more than one score.

Once a player has no more life preservers, one more turn at or tied for the highest Water Level eliminates them from the hand.

The last twist that Dorra put in this clever card game is that players maintain their discards and their life preservers at the end of each hand, and then pass them around the table so that each player gets a chance to play each hand of cards, which evens out some of the chance aspects of the deal.

I am starting this game at a 7. The innocent cartoon sheep disguise a seriously good card game here, one which is not too heavy for the family, nor too light for the gamer's table.

This tickles largely the same spots as 6 nimmt (Category 5), but it is a bit more interesting - while 6 nimmt is largely a defensive game, Land unter forces you to attack at times. With 5 players it might be a tad too long for what it offers. But it is a great simple game.

Excellent card game that has a simple mechanic to it that actually turns out to be quite a bit of fun.

It's interesting to see how players bid their cards to either get the lower lighthouse or to avoid the highest. It's a hard choice to make what card to bid as you don't want to bid too high but don't want to waste your low cards or you want to bid high but not too high and waste that high card but not too low and get stuck with the worse lighthouse.

Fun times for the family.

Another quick-playing filler card game. Each round, the player with the highest scoring card loses one marker card. Remaining marker cards after playing all cards count for victory points. Cards are played simultaneously and you either want to play the highest card to choose first from the scoring cards or the lowest not to take one of them. There's enough potential to play badly but even good play can't avoid getting hosed by unlucky card plays. The nice twist is that each hand is played by every player once. A plesant inoffensive alternative to For Sale, No Thanks, 6 nimmt etc.

Quite fun - I like the simultaneous action selection, it feels similar to 6 nimmt!  There is much more control than it seems in the game since you can evaluate what each card is worth to most people, and as the game progresses, you become more and more aware of the cards that other players are holding in their hands.  This is a very good game to introduce to nongamers, and just a good bit of fun all around for everyone.  With further play this could definitely be an 8.

A fine light blind-bidding card game which I look forward to playing some more. Because of the blind bidding there's some arbitrariness in the outcome, but also strategy in deciding when to get rid of which cards and paying attention to the incentives of the other players. Each player plays each hand from the initial deal once, so in theory you'd also know what cards are in each hand after the first round, assuming you have all the card counting skills. Since each player can only earn a fixed number of points in a round it's quite possible to know before the last round who will win.

Playing with 4 is much preferable to 3.

Bastante entretenido. Te hace tirarte de los pelos porque todas las cartas de tiempo que tienes te parecen una mala eleccion para cada turno. Mientras te quejas el de tu izquierda te anima diciendo: 2pues en la siguiente ronda cuando juegues con mis cartas vas a flipar de lo malas que son" ;) Recomendable para 3. Para 4 o 5 se hace demasiado largo para la chicha que tiene. Entretenido pero para jugarlo muy de vez en cuando.

RATING: 2
Another stupid euro card game which is so confusing. There are multiples of series of number and it happens that in some series you want to have low cards, and other times you want to have high cards. But since it's confusing, you end up bidding a low or high card when you realised that this is not what you wanted. You just screwed yourself up. The fact that you also switch the same hand between each play including the fact that each player start with a different amount of buoy is really stupid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting twist to a simple card game in that each person gets a chance to play everyone else's hand in a later round and see if they can do a better job managing the hand.  Players earn points for each remaining life-saver and lose one point if they run out life-savers.  As well, then the 1 bonus point is added for the lowest CUMULATIVE tide score of the round instead of whoever had the "1"s.  Probably the best Gamewright game out there...:-)

RATING: 6
This is an interesting trick-taking game with some neat parts to it. It plays like a sort of speed 6 Nimmt! (not exactly, but for some reason that's what it reminds me of) where you have to weigh whether you want to go high or low and try to figure out what others are going to do. It's tough to wrap your head around at first, but once you start playing it becomes more clear. Another neat thing is that after each round you rotate hands, so that everyone gets a shot at every hand that was initially dealt, balancing out particularly good or bad hands. (The score pile is different each time, so you're not playing exactly the same game over and over.) In our game there was a particularly dismal hand going around and it was fun to see who could last the longest with it.

I liked this, though I tend to go for trick-taking games in general.

Great filler game. Each player plays each hand (12 cards) in turn so one cannot quibble about bad dealing...the weather cards randomize each round of play. With the high numbered card taking the highest ranked weather card and the next the second; gettign the high number weather card in front of you costs you one of your life preservers - so you can get knocked out of a round. One has to make shrewd quesses as to which card to play. This is made more difficult by needing to hold high # cards to take weather cards you want and low number ones to avoid getting stuck - while thryign to unload the middle (and risky portion of your hand.

Strangely enough, I traded 42 empty Altoid tins for it. Go figure.

Great closer or game for light gaming with non-gamers.  Easy to teach but fun to watch others (and yourself!) get stuck with the highest tide card in situations you didn't anticipate.

The more people I introduce this to, the more I've come to realize just how good this little game is. Being able to try your hand (pun intended) at all the hands is brilliant.  I've only met one person who didn't like it out of the dozen or so I've introduced it to.

Hand management/simultaneous action selection in the same vein as twenty other games of the same weight (For sale, especially, comes to mind).

Fun enough, even though my rating goes down with every play. I don't like games in which you can count the cards (since I don't have the brain for it). Actually, counting cards is the only "strategic" thing you can do in this game. Everything else is tactical decisions based on that & luck of how the cards are divided. So either you count the cards and hope for the best, or you don't count the cards, just wing it & hope for the best.

I really like this game and enjoy the balancing mechanism of passing the hands around after each round is played. The cards are a nice quality and the theme is quirky enough that it works well.

The game plays quickly yet there is a surprising amount of clever play in the game. Most of the time the craftiest players will win which is a good sign that luck in this game is not as high a factor as most card games.

A solid 9 in my opinion.

From a deck numbered 1 to 60, each player gets 12 cards. From this seeding of cards, you are assigned a number of life preservers based on the cards you have. The worse your hand is, generally you will get more preservers.

Each trick, there are 2 sheep cards that the players are trying to get or avoid. one Play card at a time out of your hand; highest card played gets the lowest value of two available sheep, while the lowest card does not get a sheep . The person with the highest sheep (sheep you earn cover up the previous sheep) after each play loses a life preserver. 

Switch hands after each round to see how well you do with your opponent's hand. 

This is a fun game, the switching hands aspect is what makes it feel like better play should prevail. However, the timing of the low (or high) sheep cards does have an effect on how the hands are played, as well as which opponents have seen which hands.

For some reason I really like what I call "psychological" games. Games like Pecking Order and Dracula where a big part of the game involves outguessing your opponent(s). Turn the Tide really hit the spot for me. I love the "play everybody's hand" mechanic. What this means is after every round you pass the hand you just played that round with to the player on your left and play the round again. You do this until everyone has had a chance to play every hand. It keeps people from complaining about luck of the cards. In fact it's a great mechanic to take luck out of a card game.

I'm tempted to call it chaotic, but that's not the right word.  Better to just say it's a bit less dependent on tactical thinking than I'd like.  But, at least it's quick.  Having each player get stuck with each hand is a good mechanism for balancing out the luck.

RATING: 7.5
Great card game for folks who like guessing over/under, or card-counting. The rules require each player to rotate through each hand over a series of rounds, so its more about you playing each hand better than your opponents (who will eventually play the same hand)

RATING: 7.3
By all rights this should be as popular as Dorra's For Sale. It feels like a cross between trick-taking and blind-bidding auction game, with the unique twist that each player will get to play each other player's hand before the game's end. Probably better than the similar 6 Nimmt!, but it admittedly requires more thought.

Own "Zum Kuckuck".
I play the variant only, where card play is clockwise not simultaneously. I also play a variant that was introduced for the finals of the German boardgame tournament back in 1997: All cards are sorted into 5 rows, each player picks one row, remaining cards are off the game, each player plays each hand once.

Difficult trick taking mechanic to get a grasp of. It's usually best to be lowest, but you can't always be lowest. It's good to be highest, but worst to be second highest. You need to be able to judge when to guarantee a trick, but you don't want to come in second.

RATING: 6.5
It’s a game much in the vein of [thing=432]Take 6![/thing]. It’s just a set of cards and a few tokens and you play one card every round trying to outguess your rivals and avoid losing. Like Take 6!, it has a few twists that make it much more interesting.

Contrary to what a reading of the rules might suggest, players have less control than in Take 6! That’s because it’s more difficult to outguess your rivals. Also, memory plays a much bigger role here. Those are the aspects I did not like.

Simultaneos card playing adds some chaos, but here it fits game/theme well. Everyone play with all starting cards so some card luck is reduced.

Really enjoyable quick game. I love the mechanism where each player has to use each hand of cards in turn. At first I thought this would make a dull game, but turning a losing hand into a winning hand is very satisfying, and negates the luck of the draw. I prefer the version with sheep - the humanised pigs are too bizarre. (8.5)

RATING: 8
Clever, very nicely crafted blind-bidding game that doesn't use much more than Raj or 6 nimmt! (pretty much the reference games for the genre) but does indeed have the right touches to trade some bluff and strategy for tactics. Round after round bids are not made for one single card but for two: the best bid gets the lowest card and the second best gets the highest card, both of which will be then displayed in front of each player. The player that displays the highest card after a round must forfeit one point ("a life saving ring") that would otherwise have been scored after all players had exhausted their hands.

Beside the fact that players might indeed find convenient to bid for one of those two penalty cards and not just dodge them as often as possible, the luck of the deal is compensated by the amount of points available for each player: life saving rings (i.e. a highest possible score) come at the cost of a weaker hand. After each score each player passes their hand on to the next player: this means there will be as many scoring rounds as players on the table. After passing on their first hands, players will have some available information about how the other cards are distributed.

Land unter might be unforgiving and a bit long (especially when played by five) but it flows well and the rules sink in really easily - there are no exceptions or complicated scores here.

Simple, one-mode trick taking game, bloated with a theme. Couldn't get my head around the basic idea of the game, for some reason.

Pretty simple mechanics to the game. Yet still seems to cause a lot of angst and complaints about balance issues. Not sure, sometimes you get 5 lifesavers and that's not enough to save you. It seems like a resource management game where the most valuable resources are the high and low cards and the ones in the middle stink. Its the timing that you have to master.

It's a neat concept and can be fun for the occasional play, but simultaneous revelation doesn't hold attention or provide enough "good play" reward for repeat play. And the scoring here is very tight - it only takes a few plays where you're on the accidental wrong side of a revelation (eg played a 35 to someone's 36, when there are 60 values to choose between) and you can be knocked out of the running pretty effectively. I don't regret letting this one go.

Based on one play: The whole deck is dealt out, with numbers 1 to 60 and then you bid for the cards on the table, however you don't actually want the cards being auctioned since the player with the highest visible card won loses a life preserver which represents points. So you want to either not win any auctions or simply ensure that if you win you don't have the highest card visible. On top of that, you are actually bidding for two cards simultaneously, with the higher card going to the second highest bidder. So it is tough to fully manage, but still fun, just don't try to be too much in control.

Really need to play with 5 so all cards are in play, hence perfect info from the start. But playing 5 rounds of hand passing makes the game overstay it's welcome. Similar game play to 6 nimmt, but LU rewards the more skilful in memorising numbers. I like the fact that players self inflict the "take that" so you still have the fun, but no potential hard feelings which can occur sometimes in 6 Nimmt.

A somewhat entertaining card game. It is very tricky and has a large dose of randomness to it, but some clever and tactical plays are possible, which barely save the game from being completely based on luck and randomness. It is one of those games that when you first play it, you get the impression that it is a deeper game, only you haven't figured out the depth, so you want to play it again to clear the fog. But after a few plays you realize it is mostly random.

Turn the Tide has a similar feel to 6 Nimmt, with the simultaneous bidding and double-think. Pretty hard to wrap your head round the highest-gets-lowest, second-highest-gets-highest, everyone else gets nothing setup at first.

Upgrade from 5.5 to 7.5 after playing this game with gamers. Reminiscent of Take 6 and Relationship Tightrope/Yin Yang:

Game play itself is not as exciting as Take 6 and Yin Yang:

* In Take 6 players are playing to four tricks simultaneously, which offers a lot of hand management possibilities
* Yin Yang is simply easier to explain and less fiddly.

However, the fact that everyone gets a chance to play every other player's hand makes this exciting in its own unique way (which non-gamers tend not to appreciate). Players enthusiastically complain about the really bad hand that they will eventually have to play.

Found a water-damaged box of this at local GW, unpriced.
Got them to find a pricer, who proceeded to put the indelible red marker to it.  :(
But shit it was just $.99!  ;)

Gameplay combines some great aspects of Take 6, Hearts, and For Sale. Lots of decisions per gaming minute, which is a huge criteria in my opinion.

updated:
This game continues to confound me.
I have learned the rules, then forgotten, then re-learned, then forgotten, then re-learned them, and now update my initial comments:
There is more strategy going on that I can intuit, because no matter what I do, there are multiple hands where I get screwed with a 9 or so stuck in front of me, and then multiple tricks where low Tide cards are revealed, and I simply lack the cards to gain one.

I haven't yet figured out a way to determine when you are in danger in this game, or how to get out of it when you lack high cards.

Despite its appearance, this is a game for card sharks.  Yes, it is a blind bidding game, but you have plenty of info to base your bids on.  A clever twist of the game is that you pass your hand of cards each round, so everyone gets to play every hand of cards.  Also, the number of points you start out with is directly tied to the quality of your cards.  So there is a real feeling of outwitting your fellow players when you play their hand of cards better than they did.

Based on one play.  You could say I came for the sheep and stayed for the gameplay.  I found it much more strategic than 6 Nimmt! -- there are some tricks you must win, some you must duck, and some you can afford to lose.  However, the game gives me the same feeling of agony as 6 Nimmt! does when the bids are revealed and I think, "That was NOT AT ALL what I had in mind!"  I really like the two balancing mechanics of (1) variable number of life preservers based on hand strength and (2) rotating hands of cards.  Some have complained about game length with five players, so here's a thought:  Since there are two balancing mechanics, is hand-passing necessary?  I'd like to try playing the game with a new deal for each hand so you can play only as many hands as you want to.

As a fan of Spades and Bid Whist, I naturally love Turn the Tide.   Essentially a trick taking game where you usually don't want the 'tricks'  add in the occasional absolute need to take the 'trick' and you end up with a very immersive game..   play low to avoid the flood cards all together or play high to screw the guys that really need a lower flood card.

Nice little card game in which the best play is to try and avoid coming second in each turn. If you play the highest card in a turn, you have to take a rising water card, which could be bad or could be good, depending on your circumstances - but crucially you get first choice. If you play the second place card, you're stuck with whichever rising water card the winner didn't take, which will usually be a bad thing. 

The upshot is that at different times during the game you'll be playing to lose or two win, but always trying to avoid coming second. It's a novel idea, and works well.

This is a very clever duplicate blind bidding card game filled with plenty of tough decisions.  Should I play my boss low card now or save it?  Should I suck it up and play a middle card?  What really makes the game interesting is that you get to pass your cards at the end of the round.  If you can remember who has what, you can use that to your advantage.  I like it with 3 or 4.  More than that, I'll usually opt for Nicht die Bohne.

I love how everyone body switches hands.  Beautiful way to balance the game.  However, I don't like counting cards, and without doing so, it seems that this game has too little information to allow for strategic game play.  To me, it seemed like too much guessing.  I'll hold my rating until I play it again.(1 play)

RATING: 5
This one completely supersedes For Sale for me, as it makes a tight, tense game out of blind-bidding, as opposed to the latter, which throws in a superfluous "setup phase" to take up one half of the game before the blind-bidding begins. I’m not even a fan of blind-bidding, but this one is a great exercise to hone those skills, since it’s over so quickly, and the incentives to shade higher or lower are often loud and clear. 

Giving your hand to the next player is a brilliant way to one-up each other, and gives players who are out of the running an incentive to keep playing and try to better what other players did with their hand. And I do appreciate any slightly thoughtful attempt to theme a card game (drowning in High Tide? Hah...hah...).

RATING: 7
Turn the Tide -- Played four-player once and three-player once.

The passing of hands adds a level of strategy to an otherwise light filler.  As John Broky (frienetic) commented, the final round is particularly enjoyable, since you know what cards are in play, and you can recall (at least) some key cards in each player's hand.  This can lead to some second thoughts about which cards to play.  (I need to play a high card, but he has a higher one.  But he knows that, so he may not play it...)

RATING: 4.5
Easy to pick up cardgame with the kind of mechanisms I like (bluff) and some that are just so-smart (and they work too). Illustrations on my version (rescuing sheep) help the mechanics come across nicely as well. The clever idea of rotating hands is also good for realising each hand must be played in different way, helping you learn the nuances of the game. 

Fast, tense and easy to pick up. Great stuff. 

EDIT: with more players too bloody long for what it is, not good with less players. Still a fine game, but. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game looks light but in fact it is a really strategical game. The game has a really delicate balance of "doing well" and "not losing too much." A player is constantly faced with a choice of "should I try to score high" or "should I try to barely survive." Occasionally you are stuck in a situation that no matter how well you play you will drown, but thats ok since your hand transfers to the next player in the next game.

RATING: 7
During our first game, we  thought that this game was really random. Then by the final round of that same game, we all went "Oh, I get it..." and the later games became more competitive. 

The gameplay for Turn the Tide seem rather counterintuitive, and most players won't get the strategy by merely reading the rules. The key to this game is to read the situation of each player's current tides and knowing when to grab tide cards or to avoid them, as well as when to dump middling numbers. Nice filler fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A very 6 Nimmt! like game, though after a first play I think it might have even less strategy due to the simultaneous-play-second-guessing element. Still, probably worth adding to your set of filler card games.

First game (4 players) and Jean ran away with the score. By the end of round 3 she had a lead that could not be matched. We played the last round to see who would come in second. Not a bad little game, once you got into the swing of it. Similar to "For Sale" in the sense that you are bidding cards, trying to guess how high or low to play to just beat your opponents.

I have always found trick-taking games a bit disappointing and this one is no exception. The rules are simple enough, there is some tension in the game and the graphics look good. However I am not sure I like the theme of drowning sheep, the need to keep score and since I dislike trick-taking games in general, this one will have to go.

RATING: 7
Good filler game.  Perfect for when you are waiting for that last person to show up for a monster.  While not really allowing for much attachment it plays up to 5 and can be put down and away with no qualms (although some for good reason will be insistent on finishing the hands to make even).  Still for what little investment you put into it, there are some good laughs and groans. 

It's a clever little system, but while I believe that a good player has a greater chance to win, getting lucky is awfully important here.

I prefer the Zum Kuckuck version thematically.

UPDATE: Don't bother with three players.

If you have four or five players available and only a half of hour to spare, it's great choice. The game requires some intuition, bluff, some planning and tactical skills and (also!) good memory. Because all the players plays other players hands of cards, there is no something as bad luck -- it is fairly just and everyone can do the best (especially if you can remember what other players got from you). Play count not up-to-date -- I played it at last 5 times more, than the counter marks. So simple, yet one of my favorites.

RATING: 5
[Berliner Spielkarten 'Land Unter' 2001 edition] {Filler, survival; simultaneous action, hand-passing, player-elimination; optimal 5p} A trick-taking game with unique features - each hand will be played once by each player and largest 2 take cards. TTT is not very outstanding and it's quite boring - the same process goes for 48 hands (4-5p) and a typical game runs more than 20 minutes.

TTT favors conservative players. Aggressive players lose more readily in TTT because of the scoring system, in which a player won't get bonus if he makes other player lose life preservers.

Control is not strong in TTT because of the simultaneous action; esp. when a player holds the middle-value cards (30-45). Dorra tried to balance this by offering more life preservers for those cards; therefore, one will have more life-preservers when he holds more middle-valued cards. However, it only works well in 5p game, when all cards are used. I don't think the cards are well-turned for 2-4, though, again, Dorra tried to balance this by having each hand played by each player once.

One will say luck is not important in this game because the hand will be played once by each player. However, I don't think this mechanic is effective because the first round becomes critical for serious play and the draw of weather cards each subsequent round affects how the hand is played even with same hand distribution. In the first round, all players have no information about the hands; therefore this round is luck-driven. If a player lags behind because he played badly due to series of wrong guessing, it becomes difficult to come through because other players have more (complete) information about the hands afterwards. Therefore, players shall play defensively in first round.  Besides, even with same hands, each round is different due to the draw of weather cards. Therefore, I am doubtful if the hand-passing mechanic can really reduce the luck as other said.

Nice light simultaneous play card game.  The hook is that the hands are dealt once at the beginning of the game and after that the hands rotate from player to player so each player gets a crack at each hand.

Delighful filler. A little trickier that [gameid=368]: 2 values are awarded, the lower to the highest card played, the other to the second highest card played.

I have the Land Unter version.  Nice art. Good strategy to wrap your head around and I love the hand passing.  Very fun.

Update:  Raised my rating to a 9. I just always have fun when I play this.  Second highest weather card gets highest tide card and highest card still showing no matter who "won" the tide cards are so funky they can mess with your head a little bit.  In a good way.

I also think it is equally fun with 3, 4, or 5.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 5

RATING: 8
Whereas S.O.S. now stands for Save Our Sheep.

This is blind bidding at its finest with a clever balancing system where each player has the opportunity to play each hand.  This is done by each player passing their just played hand clockwise after it's completion.  In theory,   this works well mostly,  although the way the paired tide cards come out can influence it some.

There is a handicap built into each hand.  Hands that are weak contain the most life preservers,  since the likelihood of failure is more prevalent - another thoughtful decision in the game's design.

The only downside is that points are at a premium and falling too far behind may present you with a daunting task in trying to recover.  In addition, it can last a little longer than you might like for a game of this type.   

Despite the above,  I recommend you try Turn The Tide,  and take a shot at trying to keep your head above water.

Turn the Tide is a trick taking game where the object of the game is not to have the highest scoring card showing. There's a sixty card deck, numbered 1 - 60, and each player gets 12 cards. Some cards have life preservers... you take a life preserver token for each of those cards (which are used for scoring later on). 

On a turn, two scoring cards are revealed, which range from 1 - 12. Every player picks a card from their hand and simultaneously reveals their card. The highest number picks a scoring card (the lower one) and then the second highest number picks the other scoring card. Scoring cards are put in front of you and cover any previous scoring cards you may have had. At the end of the hand, whoever has the highest scoring card showing loses a life preserver. 

If you have to lose one and you can't, you're out of the round. The round is over when all the cards have been played, or if only two players are left. At the end of a round, you score how many life preservers you have left. Then you pass the hands clockwise so that everyone has a chance to play every hand.

The game is all about anticipating what other players will do, and managing how you allocate the cards in your hand. Sometimes you want to play high to win a trick and take a low number scoring card, especially if you already have a high one. Other times you want to play low so that you don't take a card at all. But much of the time everyone has the same objectives, so it's a bit tricky to figure out how to play. 

Some hands are flat out harder to play, but as everyone has to give it a go, there's some balance there... but of course, the scoring cards always come out in a random order, so two players might have completely different experiences with a hand, one who gets set up just so and another who is stuck in a bad spot too many times.

This game fits squarely in the light filler category. There's some thought required, and skill is rewarded, although luck certainly has a place here. If you like trick taking games, then you'll probably enjoy this one.

About [thing=1403][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=1403][/thing] is a card game of hand management and simultaneous action. It is quick, smart and more balanced than I could imagine for a game with random distribution of cards and random reveal of Water Level cards. It has some memory aspect, in card counting - but is not truly mandatory in order to do well, still, it will help a lot, specially after the first round, when most, if not all, the cards in each hand are revealed.

This happens because of the main twist of the game: once a round is completed, my hand of cards is passed to the player to my left, and I receive the hand of cards of the player to my right. And the game proceeds until everyone has played with all the hand of cards. This is a stroke of genius, as it makes the whole "You did better because you had a better hand" still true, but you will have the chance to try for yourself that hand and see if you will be able to do better or worst.

[thing=1403][/thing] has a strong [thing=432][/thing] feel, due to the simultaneous selection and reveal of cards and because the numbers on them are compared. However, [thing=1403][/thing] has a more immediated resolution, as the cards used don't form rows, but they still can have some lasting effects, as the Water Level cards remain with the players until covered by another the player takes, which means a Water Level with high number can be bad for several rounds in a row (or a low numbered can be good for several rounds).

Overall, [thing=1403][/thing] is a tatical card game, with a lively pacing and fast resolution, good level of interaction (without targeting players), and it allows for constant decisions, even if not hard ones, to be made.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player starts with a hand of 12 cards and they count the number of lifesavers in their hand - this shows to the others the strength of the hand of each one: the more lifesavers, the weaker is the hand, but higher the possibility of scoring, if the hand is well played.

Then, two Water Level cards are revealed - these cards range from 1 to 12. Next, all players, at the same time, will pick one of their cards, put in the table and reveal simultaneously. The player with the highest card will take the lowest Water Level, and the player with the second highest card will take the highest Water Level. The other revealed cards are discarded without effect.

Players will, now, compare the Water Level cards they have showing (as Water Level cards taken in earlier rounds are covered when another one is taken by the same player), and the person with the highest Water Level loses one lifesaver, in order to rescue the sheep in most dire neeed.

The round goes on like this until either all the 12 cards have been used, or until there is only two players still with lifesavers - as players without lifesavers are out of the round -, whichever happens first. Each player will gain points equal to the amount of lifesavers they still have by the end of the round.

Before a new round begins, every person passes their hand of cards and lifesavers to the player to the left of them. 

The game will end at the end of the round once everyone has played with all hands of cards. Then the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Only one: which card to use.

It is, as one can imagine, not a very hard one to be made. This is correct, but it isn't without ponderation also. Because the decision of which card to use must take into consideration a few things:
a) Which cards have already been used;
b) Which Water Level cards are open;
c) Which Water Level cards were already taken and which are open in the players area;
d) Which cards you have in hand.

Usually these considerations are done quickly, but this doesn't mean they don't carry importance.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Small and portable;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Basically no downtime and with fast resolution once the cards are revealed;
- Decisions, while not hard, matter;
- Good amount of interaction.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Though the game have simultaneous action, it will increase in playing time the more players you have, as more players add more rounds of play;
- It has players elimination from the round (not from the whole play). However, the game is made in a way that this will usually happens when the round is near its end anyway, as the less lifesavers a player starts with, the stronger is her hand, therefore, less likely she is to lose those few liversavers.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Very weird. I want to save the sheep (my edition have sheep) - but I must restrain myself and let others do the job. Ok. I can understand this. What bothers me is that, once the game is over, the "winner" will be the person that least helped the sheep!

Look at them, judging you for leaving their kin to drown:

[imageid=3205852medium]


No, no. This can't be right. The winner should be the person that helped the most these poor unfortunated sheep, which all lived in peace and harmony, in the island, near the lighthouse, until climate change made the level of oceans rise and, now, you will let them die and be proud of it?

This all means that, in spite of the game being a very good option for those looking for a quick and smart game, one with a short amount of rules, but carrying a twist that makes it stand out and allow for a more balanced game than most card games out there, in the end [thing=1403][/thing] toys with your feelings.

Maybe if I just toss a wood for that sheep...

RATING: 6
Better with more players but then it also takes longer to play as you have to play all hands once. This of course eliminates all complaining about bad hands. I think playing fewer rounds wouldn't harm the game so you stop when it's still fun. And fun it is! But 6 Nimmt is better...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Many games with random hands can stick someone in bad shape with a bad hand - in this everyone will have to use the hands, so it balances out, as well as the number of preservers relating to the "goodness" of the hand. Cool light little game.

RATING: 7.25
This game has a great original mechanic. Every player gets to play every other player's hand once. It all comes down to what you decide to lay down for your bid on the tide level cards. Easy to learn and play.

I'm trying to trade it now because it just doesn't get played at home since it only works for 3-5.

Almost. A bit too much upkeep patter keeping the game going. I far prefer Biblios, trick takers, etc for this sort of thing. The passing of the same deck around in contract bridge fashion does make for an interesting sequence, as the game winds up you get a sense of tracking the decks vs player-skill as a form of trash talk. But even that feels strained.

102812: was initially intrigued by ratings and rule set, but when played, the game was rather bland and not quite as exciting as I had imagined. The turns were repetitive and tough to gauge and strategize. It's true that one can develop an individual approach and strategy to playing cards but still at the mercy of other players. Tough to predict individual responses and playing approach. As a result, each round seems somewhat random in scoring. A good hand though, can still help you if played correctly. A lousy hand will kill you if you get caught in a vicious loop with no way of winning each round due to mediocre mid-value cards. However, playing multiple rounds does get kind of tedious. Sure, if you have a good memory and willing to wade through the cards for each hand, you may have an advantage. Just too tedious an exercise. A meh feeling after playing the game.

This is a nasty little game.  It reminds me of 6 Nimmt! (just like almost every other game with numbers and simultaneous card selection)  It has a touch more complexity, but brings some interesting elements to the table.  The whole passing your hand to the left thing is pretty cool, even if I am unlikely to remember then well enough to take advantage of it.

Played just once (Turn the Tide, US version), and I got completely thrashed, but nonetheless I think this is an excellent design, if not especially to my personal taste. Simple, very tight, elegant, and the inverse relationship between hand strength and tokens means that weaker hands have more staying power and a higher potential payoff. Duplicate play reduces the luck factor.

Flood the opponents' sheep while keeping yours as dry as possible by controlling the weather better than your adversaries. Simultaneous card play reminiscent of the second phase of For Sale or 6 Nimmt! The interesting concept is that a complete game involves playing all of the hands in successive rounds, mitigating the effects of unbalanced deals - just play a bad hand better than your opponents while making sure to score big when the good hands come your way.

Fun, outguessing, bidding game a la 6 Nimmt! But significantly different. Interesting auction mechanism where the winner gets the "good" card and the runner up gets the "bad" card and others get nothing. Quite a bit of variety simply from some card combos being both good, both bad, or one good and one bad.

I would buy this but it seems like I never get the chance to actually play these lightweight multiplayer card games since whenever I am with a group of willing game players we are looking to play something more satisfying. That being said, this strikes me as a very interesting lightweight card game and if you're into that sort of thing I recommend it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar in nature to Drahtseilakt, with different goals and mechanics.  That everyone rotates hands each turn eliminates a lot of the luck inherent in these sorts of games, as everyone has the same chance to play the "good" hand, as well as the "bad" hand.

A really fun filler. I like that the system allows everyone to play each hand, the "bidding" system is interesting, and it moves along fairly quickly. It's really easy to get cards mixed up, however, and difficult to fix that problem once it happens. A worthwhile addition.

Yet, another small box that gives you a very good game. The object of this one is to be able to save your sheep from sinking. To avoid anykind of luck, the game have a special play rule that everyone will try the hand of the others during the game so you compare your points to define the winner at the end.

Quick card game where everyone plays each hand once to make things fair. A bit like 6 Nimmt, this has an initially confusing rule: the highest Weather card played takes the lowest Lighthouse card available, the second highest Weather card takes the highest Lighthouse card, all others get nothing. It sometimes feels random, but I think there's actually some skill involved, although I usually do very badly at the game so I'm not sure what the best tactics are. Lots of fun despite this.

Nice looking filler game that feels a lot like Relationship Tightrope or Money.  The handicapping system used is very cool.  Instead of relying on multiple rounds of play to even out the luck of the draw, it's taken care of automatically here (at least, theoretically).  The hands that consist of the middle cards and supply you with extra life preservers seem superior after a few plays, but I'm sure after repeated plays this would change.  Great with 4-players.

Could it be possible?  A blind bidding game that I actually enjoy?  Turn the Tide is definitely a step up for me from For Sale, Dorra's other more well received filler.  The most unique thing about this is the progression from having absolutely no idea what cards others have to an almost perfect information environment, and this is achieved by passing your hand to the player on your left after every round.  Therefore, by the end you should have a good idea as to what everyone is holding even if you don't necessarily recall the exact values.  It's very interesting to see how much better or worse others fare with the same set of cards you just played with.

It is really a surprise how much strategy there is to this little game, with the help of a couple of neat mechanics.  I would imagine with a full complement of 5 people Turn the Tide may be a bit more chaotic and unpredictable, which may not necessarily be a bad thing.

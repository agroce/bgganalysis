This game was developed and produced while I was in the service. A friend then tried to teach it and...frankly, time was a precious commodity then and this game needed too much of it.

Thirty years later another friend reintroduced it and...now that I have time to burn (on weekends) I can see what marvelous and ingenious game it was for it's time. Command and control have importance and the Soviets are compelled to have something of a plan as they go in. NATO units are strong—but few—and a poor setup will spell disaster.

I loved it and the other games of this series which we played  extensively. The command system was at the same time simple and very clever. The idea was units to move and/or fire and other tasks have to spend command points distributed by their respective HQ. Those were generating a limited amount each turn, such that you couldn't activate more than a few units of their own formation. However, HQs could save these command points from one turn to a next one even for many turns. In this way players could plan for coordinated actions involving many units by spending the accumulated command points.
It is pity this system wasn't used for a WWII platoon level game, I'm sure it would have been a hit.

RATING: 4
Its roots as a miniatures game system are clearly visible.  As a result, there is to much detail and record keeping to make this really fun to play.  I shouldn't have to keep track of six or seven different types of ammo for each unit.  You're supposed to be the battle group commander, not platoon quartermaster.

Got this when serving in the US Army Reserves - it was quite topical then. I liked and could identify with the tactical operations center (TOC) mechanic to allot action points. Have never played a complete scenario however, and don't know when I will. From a game standpoint, it had a bit too much fiddliness to it.

I bought this when it first came out when I was in the army. Boots and Saddles never seemed to turn up at the army base game shop, though. I sold it in the mid 90s but reaquired the whole series (minus Reinforcements) a few years back. I'm a sucker for Cold War hyypotheticals. I played it a few times solo and enjoyed it despite the lack of Fog of War.

And now it joins the previously owned again.

While not for everyone, this was one of the most innovative tactical "hypothetical" modern ground games ever made.  It was also difficult to play well and took a long time to get through a session, which undoubtedly turned off a number of players.  But no other system provided so much variety--because of hidden OOB, hidden victory conditions for each side, plus hidden varying competencies of headquarters from game to game, no scenario played the same way twice. Limited intelligence and dummies meant that reconnaissance units had real tasks to perform.  Best of all, the command system used by both players forced the Soviet player to run his attacks in line with Soviet tactics as was then understood, without any "doctrine" or "idiocy" rules required.  Soviet players typical prefer to stay in column for ease of control for as long as possible; once forces deploy into battle formations, it's very hard to regain control of them.  "Battle drill" parade-ground tactics for companies and even battalions are possible, but usually are mounted at the last possible moment before contact.  Usually there isn't much left to recover at that point; but for the Soviet, that's why there's another tactical echelon right behind to press through the gap that was hopefully made!

Modern firepower was very well modeled--an M1 tank platoon in cover with plentiful ammo on hand is able to defeat a Soviet T80 tank battalion moving in the open in a single turn. If the American player is allowed to set in a  continuous defense, it's very difficult for the Soviet to unhinge it.  In a running fight where numerical superiority can make a difference, the Soviet has much more of an advantage--and it's these kinds of fights the Soviet player must create and maintain.

Wanted to really get into this game as a sort of Modern replacement for Panzer Blitz. But the lack of any decent pre-built scenarios and its solo unfriendly nature meant it never got played as much as it should have.

I recently sold my collection of this series at a game auction, but I actually liked the system, though it was a little intense to play and had a lot of leadership rules that made it tough to play well.  Unfortunately, the need to use hidden units made solitaire play impossible. Finding opponents was tough also. Some US units possibly over-rated.

A good game covering platoon level tactical combat circa 1985.  The rules are not too complicated, and flow pretty well.  They have a nice combination of hardware, command/control, and morale.  The double blind nature of the scenario force levels gives this a lot of replay value.  The components are very nice, particularly the counters and maps.

Played the whole ssault series as a young private while stationed in Germany. My friends and I were impressed by how close they got it to real life. There were a couple of things that weren't precise but when taking real life high tech warfare and shrinking it down into a playable game there has to be somethings that can't fit into a game. Would love to find copies of these again.

Owned the whole series. Best of the tactical modern wargames, IMHO. Seemed complex at the time, but not too bad compared to subsequent wargames - Grognards should be able to pick-up quickly. Great force mix. C3I models the army doctrines to entertaining effect, and not too fiddly. Small to large scenario engagements. Map colors are inconsistent, which is troubling given the various terrain levels, ("Is that level 3 green or level 4 green?"). Hidden counters make solitaire play less than ftf, but still a good exercise in force capabilities. A worthy effort with many forces added in later expansions. A must have for modern-loving Grognards.

A good simulation of the operational-tactical combat in Cold War Europe.  The drop in the interest in this thearte of war is a puzzle to me as the threat of the Soviet invasion was removed by the topple of the Moscow regime.  Does NATO now see Russia s friend rather than foe?  This GDW's series games are one of the best produced by the company. Largely, the subject was covered by LnL's World at War series.

Before World at War:  Eisenbach Gap, there was this game.  US vs WP at the platoon scale, 250m hexes, 5 minute turns.  That said, I'd still play this game today if I could find an (ftf) opponent.

Detailed miniature like combat resolution system that factored in armor thickness (front and flank), armor type (standard, composite/laminate, chobham) shot penetration, rate of fire and accuracy/range.  Optional rules to track ammo expenditure by ammo type.  

Detailed command control rules using command points.  US had much greater flexibility, WP units, with much fewer command points, could move in large formations (battle drill) with much less flexibility.  For the gamer without real world military experience, seemed like an effective way to model WP military doctrine at the time.  Decent artillery rules including advanced laser guided munitions.  No gunships (added in Boots and Saddles),  no air power (planned, but never added to the system).

Good system, felt "realistic", but could be slow to play due to the game system (command system, LOS system and so on).

A favorite of the Cold War era gamer.  Platoon-sized units with a fair amount of Fog of War and Command & Control restrictions make this a great teacher of how things can go wrong in a hurry. :D  One of the fun aspects of the game is the way early scenarios were constructed - you never knew if your opponent was a pipsqueak or an 800 pound gorilla until you started spotting units - if more dummies came up than real units (or vice versa) you began to understand what you were facing - none of that "I know everything about my opponent from the start" fantasy in most games.

RATING: 5
I hate rating this a five because it was such a great game back in the 80's. The variable oob meant that you never knew what you were up against until the battle was joined. The way movement and combat were integrated was also novel at the time.

However, thirty years have passed and much of what was new and novel back then seems procedural now. Add to that the inability to play this solitaire and you can see why this game has not aged well. 

If you have the time, space and fellow gamers who would enjoy this, it might still have play value. However, since I have none of the three, it will be a good memory while I'm playing more recent designs.

Have played this on a regular basis since it came out along with all it's expansions. Have done additonal maps and forces (most notably the French and Belgians, along with a number of historical maps such as Fulda and Frankfurt).

The manuever, combat and command of eighties type forces is modelled with minimum of rules and easy resolution. A favourite with our group.

RATING: 4
This is a seriously flawed attempt at platoon-level combat on the Central Front. It suffers from a 'bean counting' hardware-focussed miniature-style approach to weapon engagements. Everything is super-powerful and echelons wipe each other out lickety-split. The attempts to put a brake on combat through sighting and C3I are risible. Put next to Firefight as an example of how not to do this stuff. Spawned many sequels which are equally flawed.

A Frank Chadwick minatures game with mapboard and counters.  Chadwick led the 80's with his "super-tactical" games that got away from individual tanks and squads and focused more on the command and control or leadership aspects.  Assault is simple to play yet enjoyable, and lets you explore what it would be like to be BATTALION or BRIGADE commander and not just a platoon leader!

Looking into the "future" of Cold War potential battles - future being 1985 at the time. These are platoon-level battles, and offered some interesting game mechanics that did not go forward beyond the series. A big part of this system was the fog of war aspect of flipping the counters until combat or contact. It made this much less of a chess game and more of a true conflict of troops, trying to decide do I try this, or is he bluffing?

I really enjoyed this game when I had a chance to play it. I didn't get to play it as often as I would have liked. After the end of the cold war, finding opponents became impossible. If anyone out there is interested in a game, then contact me.

Solo play - 6.5

Contested play - 7.5 (due to variable/hidden OOB and hidden units)

The game had lots of clever mechanics - variable order of Battle (you don't know what you are facing), coupled with a multiplication factor to balance.  So you can get companies facing multiple regiments - but then have a multiply by as much 4x.  So even in case of the mouse vs. the lion you can have a competitive game.

The differences between combat and movement attitude - combat movement is almost 1/8 as fast - and the decision to move over is a critical one the attacker (usually the Soviet) needs to make.

I played either this, or one of the expansions years ago, Wasn't impressed, maybe expected to much and wanting to like it. But esp. when more rules are added, it seemed like too much bookkeeping (noting how many AT-grenades each tank still has. That's for the tankcmdr, not the general.). I think I prefer a larger scale.

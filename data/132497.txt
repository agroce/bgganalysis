Amazing dexterity game!  Unicorn mode or bust!

So many laughs...

BTW - Don't play with any of the rules.  Just play 1v1 or 2v2 and see who can build it first.

I was surprised of how fun this game actually is. The idea of human cranes functions very well and especially insane it is when one has to use head to lift the blocks (and I don't mean thinking but the actual fysical lifting). And same in pairs? Huh.

There's also variety in ways players are competing like somebody telling another player how to build and builder then trying to construct what has been said within the time limit.

I think it's a keeper.

Wonderfully ridiculous. There's an interesting thing here where you're manipulating physics in an incredibly intuitive way, yet it's always demanding something that's incredibly tricky to pull off. Ordered it immediately after trying at PAX; did not regret.

Only real complaint i have is the headbands are a bit small for my colossal head so it can be a pain to actually play.

Terrible. Just too difficult.

I like the concept but hate the execution.

I managed to do a card, taking me about 150s rather than the 40s time limit.

RATING: 6
A stacking dexterity game that might otherwise be mundane if it weren't for the crane strapped to your head.  That kicks it up a few notches.   The actual game rules aren't that great - it attempts to provide some variety, but the real fun is in building the structures.   Plenty of opportunity for house rules if you need/want them.   My favorite mode is the 1v1 duel without the timer.

a fun time to make your friends lift things with cranes on their foreheads, but that's it. The game and 'strategy is not very good, so it's just about crane races of the head..

RATING: 6
The concept was fantastic - a dexterity stacking game with a funny mechanic. But something about the game just didn't illicit the response I hoped it would. I was hoping the game would be silly and embarrassing but the challenges put forth were difficult, at times frustrating, and for our group of players meant that failure was damning. Even the "easiest" challenges - those with only two pieces - proved to be frustrating instead of enjoyable. 

The length of the game was a bit longer than a filler, but shorter than a full game, which left us feeling a bit unfulfilled. The duel gates were a great catch-up mechanism for players who were falling behind but the luck of the draw meant that some players were stuck with difficult 40-second challenges that scored a maximum of 2 points, while others had comparatively-easy 120-second challenges composed on 7 or 8 pieces, with high point possibilities. Also, challenges that took 80-120 seconds required one player to be watching the 40-second sand timer, waiting for the moment to flip it over. This meant at least one player was distracted from the game's action and felt more like a chore than it should have.

The game shows an image of two players playing with the cranes attached to their heads, but this is only mandated on special spots or chosen by players who prefer this method over using the crane in-hand.

Overall, it's a decent game with a gimmick mechanic that looks more fun in the advertising than it is to play in-person. This might go over well with a happy-go-lucky game group, but certainly doesn't scratch the itch of serious board gamers. This is in direct contract with games like Tok Tok Woodman, Rampage, and Cube Quest - all dexterity games with enough logic and strategy to keep my group engaged.

Will totally get other people's attention if you play it at game night. They will think you're having fun and they'll be MOSTLY right. One huge caveat: Trying to focus on the crane hook when it's attached to your head can cause painful eyestrain.

Also, more of a toy than a game, but it's a fun toy that you play with competitively, so uh, never mind, use the word 'game', that's totally fine.

Lift it! is a great dexterity/party game that's way harder than it looks.  Plus, what other game can you say, "I built a structure using a hook hanging off my forehead."?  Not too many!  Aside from that, it flows really quick and, even when you're not building, you still feel in the game as you root for your opponents to succeed or fail.  Duels also add a great little twist allowing players to play even when it's not their turn.  There's a lot to like here in this box.

If you want to look stupid, but have fun playing... Have I got the game for you.  Competitive adults picking up blocks with cranes on their head.  A total photo opportunity for sure.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Seemed like it would be an oddball but fun game...and it was for the first 10 minutes and then it got old. I'd recommend using the timer on the duels or the game might never end if certain challenging cards were drawn. It can provide some hilarious moments, but there is a fair bit of down time too.

Lift it is a dexterity game where you're assembling objects in a way described by a card (like La Boca) but you're manipulating those objects with a hook attached to a crane, and preferably attached to your forehead. Yes. Forehead.

Supposedly there was scoring and real rules, but we just built objects and did a couple of showdowns and had a great time.

I saw a group the following morning trying to play the same game, but they were following the rules very strictly and they didn't seem to be having a very good time.

One of the more demanding dexterity games, as all building and stacking in this title is done against a timer of some sort. I enjoyed it, buy your mileage may vary depending on just how silly your playmates are willing to look with a crane on their heads. I would recommend separating the cards into mini decks based on difficulty/time length and letting players choose a deck to draw from.

Family game di destrezza molto originale. Bisogna costruire un edificio seguendo i dettami di una carta (come La Boca) ma qui non si coopera, uno contro l'altro nel minor tempo possibile. Alcune carte risultano particolarmente difficili. Gioco molto carino e divertente.

Hilarious game. Scoreing hardly matters, it is all about the challenges and how fast you can build the picture. I loved this game. Definitely not for everyone but I fit the category. I would play this anytime. Hilarious to wear a crane on your head!! I have to own this game.

RATING: 7
Quite clever, actually, and devilishly hard at times.  I think the move/duel thing can create a runaway leader with a particularly skilled "stacker", but this is mitigated somewhat by the luck of the card draws.  Likely a little too hard for very young children, but 8 and up would probably have a ball.  Quite a bit of downtime, but it is kind of fun to watch your friends try to build their structures.  If you don't like watching other people have a good time, though...probably not for you.

I was so bad at it that after the initial laughs i stopped enjoying it because of how poorly i was playing. It was a team game.

At first glance, I liked separating loyalties from abilities. However, I think you need to have more abilities than players (like in ONUW). We had it figured out each round and then it was just a simple guess as to who was lying.

I've discovered that I'm not a big fan of the social deduction genre of games, so keep that in mind when reading this. This game is quick and fairly straightforward, but I find the potential chaos of game-play to be a little bothersome. The fact that by the end of the game a player might not even know what faction he/she is supposed to be working for makes winning the game almost meaningless. There are even scenarios where is isn't possible to win because when people are messing around with the factions you can end up with all of the rebels being safe in the base. In other words, the conclusion of a game is less than satisfying for everyone.

RATING: 7
Great twist on The Resistance! Best played with MORE rather than fewer players, but adds some great complexity while at the same time keeping game play moving a bit faster as there is a time line for declaring who the good guys and bad guys are. Fans of the other One Night games I think would take to this one very well. I like how it eliminates the need for a soundtrack or non-playing moderator by allowing players to declare "Task Complete" as they go around the table completing their objectives.

I was quite disappointed by this one.   Note that I love One Night/Daybreak and Resistance.   Unfortunately, this one takes a step back in requiring look up sheets to work out what it is your action is supposed to be.  It entirely breaks the pacing of the game and turns it into something quite tedious.

At this point, the bar is pretty high due to those other games, and this fails to deliver.

Reading the rules to this game, I had a lot of worries. I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like it. I'm happy to say that, having now played several games, I [i]do[/i] like it... but I'm not sure I love it in the same way I love ONUW.

My first concern: I was really really turned off by the idea of being forced to make a claim as to your identity in turn order - one of my favorite parts about ONUW (and indeed, bluffing games in general) is delaying saying anything at all, but it actually works alright in this game. I miss the more open freestylings of its predecessor, but this gives folks who aren't as skilled in these sorts of games a bit of direction.

The other thing I was worried about was performing night actions in turn order, rather than a designed order ala ONUW. Here, I feel my worries were more founded. What you get in a little more variety you lose in the fact that it's much easier with this game to luck into dull, solved games. For example, if an investigator goes last and happens to flip up an Informant there's not really much you can do.

In ONUW this is a lot less common, and tends to only happen at lower player counts (5 or less, which is where ONUW is at its worst anyway). Here, it felt like every other game  saw someone lucking into some certain knowledge. 

All in all, this is a game I would happily play if offered. I just can't see myself rushing out to replace ONUW with.  Curious to try it at lower player counts though, as it seems like this would probably work better than ONUW for that.

Woah this game is bad. I LOVE One Night Ultimate Werewolf, it's my go-to social deduction game, so I had high hopes for this game, but it fell flat. It just doesn't work. It's not even remotely interesting, and I can't fathom why some people prefer this over ONUW! 
The fact that you do your roles in order; well, sure, it helps the "sound issue" where you might hear when somebody is doing a role in ONUW, but it also makes it less interesting. The deduction tends to be much easier as well due to the nature of the roles. A BIG pass from me, and I probably won't ever play it again!

I've never been a huge fan of the One Night craze. One Night Werewolf matches were flops as often as they were adequate, and very rarely resulted in the exciting reveal that Werewolf so often provides.

Of the genre, Revolution is closest to a functional game. Giving players unique abilities, independent of their affiliation, helps make rounds more interesting for all players. While I still don't think the system works, I'd taken Revolution over any other one.

This is a game more like ONUW than Resistance, but adds a new twist - roles are separated from loyalties, and go clockwise rather than same order: varied timing gives new info to work with.  So far we enjoy this even more than ONUW!

This is NOT just a reskin of One Night Ultimate Werewolf. When we first started playing this game we weren't even sure how to begin the deduction process. It definitely makes you think (and lie) in different ways than its predecessors. Also, it is great that everybody makes noise at night so you don't need to worry about being super quiet. The experience playing this for the first two times felt very similar to the first few times playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf. It takes a few games to wrap your head around why this is fun, and then you're hooked. I'm very happy I took a chance and Kickstarted this!

I'm surprised the rating for this game is so low here. I find it very similar to one night werewolves but with a more serious tone. There's more strategy involved and the game is usually better when the informants work together to trick the rebels (because the informants know who each other are so they should use that to their advantage). But there's always the surprise element like in werewolves due to the specialist actions. I enjoy both games but rank werewolves a bit higher because it's more funny hence is the preferred one to bring out to play at a party.

One Night Revolution takes the base concept of The Resistance (team of rebels with enemy informants that need to be detected) and applies the quick ten-minute round with special abilities from One Night Ultimate Werewolf to it. I'm not a huge fan of either source game, as I find the lack of public information in both to make the discussions difficult to form or believe. One Night Revolution does carry the more tolerable shorter run-time of One Night Ultimate Werewolf while providing a bit more depth in terms of analyzing the actions, but not every round is a fun experience. Some players get more information than others and get to be more involved in the discussions while other players have to simple guess based on the the cases made. I do prefer this over The Resistance, but I'm not sure if it surpasses One Night Ultimate Werewolf and its lighter feel for me.

Additional plays might move this up for me. Right now I just don't see what the strategy would be for informants, due to the difficulty of claiming a role you don't have convincingly.

After additional plays: it's not bad, but random chance can leave you with a very obvious outcome, like having three informants in a five player game. I'd probably always rather play Resistance if there's time.

[floatleft][ImageID=2513302][/floatleft]The game is very similar to [thing=147949]One Night Ultimate Werewolf[/thing] and I think fans of that game should definitely check this one out. Much to my chagrin, I am such a person. I am notoriously opposed to 'fun' games, but my love of deduction and quick thinking have undone my usual curmudgeonly ways. This game is interesting in that it has no moderator, players wake up consecutively perform their action then say task complete which signals the next player to start their turn. It's also interesting that the group affiliation (good or evil) is separated from the task you are allowed to do. Everyone is dealt two things the ID which tells them they are good or evil and a specialist card which tells them the task they are allowed to perform. The task can depend on your good/evil status, which is an interesting bit to deal with during the discussion/deduction.

[center][ImageID=2710243 medium][/center]

Games like this live or die on their ability to withstand extreme replay. The real game cannot even begin until you've played about 20 games and have become familiar with the roles to the point that you no longer need the reference sheet. Clearly I am not at the point. At first blush I am intrigued but skeptical, so I gave it an initial rating of a 6. It could easily rocket up (like a rocket) or rocket down (like a rock, sans the et). Time will tell, but I think it's worth investigating.

If you've never played One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or the Resistance, this game might not be that bad. If you've played either of those games, keep playing them. Ignore this one. It's a turd, and is worse than both its parents in every way. Every game feels entirely dependent on the role draw. Many of the roles themselves only matter if they come later/earlier in the game. 

With Bezier games and Ted Alspach designing some of my favorite games (Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Suburbia, ONUW) I would expect better. Pass on this one. Save yourself.

A solid one night deduction game that solves the problem of "I heard/felt that person move when our eyes were closed." Some roles are definitely better than others, but the logic chain can still easily be followed, resulting in "he said/she said" situations. Not sure why people disliked this one so much more compare to others in the series. I still feel like One Night Ultimate Werewolf could be melded with this in a different way and become a better game.

Interesting to know how the actions are performed while people have their eyes closed. Can sometimes be confusing for the ability deductions..

Still both game I played, we ended up in a situation where it was obvious who was the rebel/traitor. I would suggest maybe adding and extra unused role so that the players has more opportunity to bluff on the role they picked. Right now, if you bluff on that, somebody know for sure you are a traitor.

Do not bother.  The game is mediocre and doesn't feel like it was tested very well.  After One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Daybreak, it feels like the designer lost his way.

Pretty good bluffing game.  It is much shorter and less exhausting than Resistance, but still creates a fun experience.  I can see that the specialists declarations help to kick start the table talk and bluffing even among people who are otherwise hesitant to lie (not our group).  Also, everything that happens makes people feel like they have more information upon which to base their accusations.  But it has a bigger learning curve and more going on - so this is definitely a gamer's version.

RATING: N/A
I hate One Night Ultimate Werewolf as it fails as an interrogation/bluffing game if you have acute hearing. You can make as much noise on the table to mask it, but I'll still end up sensing where the movement came from. The idea of this game is that it's not prone to that problem as every takes their turn in a circle and are encouraged to reach for all bits on the table (but only manipulate what your role allows). I just haven't got round to playing it, so if someone else fancies it, then great.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
8-10 players (the number of players in the games I've played) is perhaps too much for this one, since more often than not you'll just sit there and listen other people talk. Many of the roles don't really give you any viable info. 

As in all bluffing/deduction games of this type, there's also the (potentially huge) problem of alpha-players, who just talk your ears off & deduce every possible move. In my experience, the bluffing factor goes away completely, if there are players who are intelligent enough to deduce everything just based on the mechanics. The bluffing is, of course, the thing I would be more interested in, since deduction in this case is just logic of a closed system.

After only a few plays of games of this kind under my belt I have basically zero chance to fool veterans or offer anything viable to them (I have a REALLY bad brain for this kind of deduction stuff). I can only say what I did (role) and then watch as they churn on. If I'm a bad guy, I'm probably doomed, unless I remain somewhat silent & if my role isn't that important. So I'd like more chances for bluffing. So, if there is even one deduction-machine in the group, the only one who can bluff in this game is the one, who also knows every possible permutation of the mechanics by heart.

Having said all that, I actually enjoyed this one, maybe even more than The Resistance: Avalon (probably not a particularly popular opinion), because in this one the logic-driven grind didn't seem to be so prominent. Or maybe there were just enough players to hide among... because i DID win 4 of the five games we played, even though my input was pretty non-existent.

A bit of a disappointment for a onuw fan like myself. I didnt like the player aids and thought it shouldve been enough singular sheets for all the players with a way to block out whats not in the game. There are so many roles and roles do different things based on your id that it got difficult to track. I preferred the streamlined simplicity of onuw, even if there was more chaos (and in party games, chaos is fun). Onr by comparison felt a bit bloated.  Also the night phase felt much longer since everyone did something and there was no app to speed things along, and the night phase is the worst part about onuw.

I'm a big fan of The Resistance having played it with many of my gaming groups who all enjoy it, but this game is definitely not at the same level. It simplifies the game too much, turning it into an almost meaningless discussion and we found that with some of the combinations it really does not work as one of the teams is left alone and has no say in the outcome, which makes it very bring for them. At the end it is either predetermined or random, so not really any fun.

Personally, I thought this was a very large improvement over ONUW. I felt I had more information and had less to worry about in terms of figuring out who moved what during the "night" phase.

I still don't fully enjoy the series due to it often feeling very chaotic. I'm not even sure how to lie in this game because your role may have just been switched and who the hell knows what happened.

RATING: 7
A great take on ONUW. Easy night phase, suspicion and chaos.

After playing with different groups, I really understand that this is not for everyone. I feel like it's a niche game. Everyone has to understand the game to be able to bend the truth. Having the roles being detached from the teams seem to cause the most confusion, which in turn leads people to say it's just random. I'll just play it with a very select group of people.

This one is slightly more complex than ONUW, but it doesn't require an app which is possibly more of a con, than a pro.  I like all of the different abilities that can happen and I like the fact that different characters will interact in different ways depending on what faction they are aligned with.  I'm still waiting for a Sci-Fi themed social deduction game that really has some meat to it, but isn't as long as Battlestar.

Thought this was just bad. Just play the Resistance. The powers just didn't seem to work or play off of each other well, seemed limited ways to effectively bluff, and seemed that some of the powers required you to try and reach around looking at other players cards, so you had to try to be stealthy and return them to the correct spot....just all around bad mechanics and implantation that didn't seem to work. No desire to ever play again.

Not sure what to make of this game yet. I've had both good and horrible gaming experiences with it.  Problem is, after 3 or 4 plays, I still don't grok it.  I'm not sure when I should lie and when I should tell the truth...and I'm not sure it even matters.  It fell incredibly flat with my primary game group, they just didn't feel like anything they did (lying, telling the truth) actually mattered.

I like the quickness of it, and I like the idea of having different specialties. For replayability, though, there's no advice in the rules on how to choose the specialties for your game beyond the list of recommended roles.  So, if I want to shake things up a bit, I don't have any guidance on how to do that...should I just shuffle and randomly select the roles? Are there some roles that shouldn't be used more than once? Are there some combos that shouldn't be used?  I just don't have the patience (or the people willing to play) to be able to figure this out by trial and error.  This is a serious flaw in game design in my opinion.

RATING: 4
ONR attempts to merge the logic and rhetoric of The Resistance with the silly fast fun of One Night Werewolf, both of which I adore.  Unfortunately it only manages to merge the weaknesses of both. 

Set up requires a lot of explanation of mechanics for such a short and light game, and the number of special roles and conditional situations can be daunting to new players.  Often the way many roles play out will preclude players from having any meaningful impact on the game anyway. 

Games are short and can either foster an exciting and hilarious debate, or can snap shut in minutes because after everyone's said their piece it becomes exceedingly obvious what happened and who's lying. 

Still, It's fast and doesn't lead to the same sort of burnout that The Resistance can trigger.

Very quick hidden role/social deduction game.  Players get a role, their roles (maybe) get switched, and they debate who they should kill the following night.  This game is similar in premise to One Night Ultimate Werewolf, but is interesting in that the players' affiliation is decoupled from the players' role.  The result is a more confusing, but ultimately very fun game of social deduction.  It also solves the ONUW problem of being possibly able to glean information from sounds and movement during the night phase.

I just don't get the intrigue behind these games.  I'm not inherently against hidden role games, even lighter party-style ones.   There are quite a few I very much enjoy but they actually have some gameplay to them.  I really dislike games like Werewolf and The Resistance though because the gameplay elements are so light that the whole game just ends up boiling down to blind accusation and guessing.

One of the worst I've played was One Night Ultimate Werewolf.  That game is just silly chaos,  there's barely any gameplay there.  This is a version of that with slightly altered mechanics and The Resistance theme.  In this game each player is randomly given a role and 3 others are hidden in the center of the table, then each player is given a specialist role which dictates which action they can take.  Then the standard Werewolf-style gameplay takes place.  All the Infiltrators identify each other then each player one at a time takes their action in secret.  Then players discuss and point fingers at someone to eliminate, majority rules.  If an infiltrator is eliminated the rebels win, if not the infiltrators win, the end.

First of all, one of the roles, the poorly named "Observer", gets no action.  They barely get to play the game.  Sure they can talk and accuse but they have no information other than what they're told.  How is this fun?  How is this gameplay?  They sit in their chairs, close their eyes, and point a finger based on a bunch of people telling them what happened while their eyes were closed.  And this is only slightly worse than the people who get to do stuff.  Half of the actions give you some information, such as looking at someone's identity.  And the other half just serve to cause chaos by mixing the identity cards around.  Whether you should tell the truth about what you did is almost random in your eyes because you have no idea if you are giving the right or wrong information to your team or the other.

I will say, there are some moments of entertainment when wacky stuff happens but they are so fleeting and every time you enjoy one of these moments there's someone else at the table who didn't...like the Observer.  This is just terrible game design and it baffles me how these games are so highly rated among the gamer community.

[Kickstarter 2015 edition] {Agents; social deduction; optimal 6p} This game is not good enough.  I am so disappointed.

This game is too fiddly - we have to wait for actions from may roles, and some of them repeat.  Then, the information flow between players is very limited.  I think it's a bad thing to force each player to select a role.

And, this game is not that fun - we are quite confused about what role to pick or what should we do in a round.  As a result, this game is too chaotic to have good deduction.

PnP version

A significant step up in complexity from ONUW as the distinct ID and Specialist cards serve to make things ambiguous at best. This is somewhat mitigated by the forced action claims but it also means that it's very difficult to get to the truth at any particular point (which is a good thing).
Our games were pretty conservative as we were all new to it and had some people new to/unexperience in One Night. With experienced players I suspect this will be a blast. I would be more cautious with non-gamers as the difficulty in and importance of those initial claims is critical.
I felt like game is probably going to be best at 7/8 (we played with 5/6) but need more plays to confirm. 

Score wise this will probably end up being an 9/10 with the right size/experience group and a 5/10 without.

And we finally have a fixed version of One Night Ultimate Werewolf! ONUW could create some fun moments, but it kind of broke down as a social deduction game because there was no incentive to give up any information.

This game addresses that flaw directly, and adds a few other improvements. The biggest improvement is the phase where you essentially claim your role. Each player has to select a role that they claim to be, whether they actually have that role or not. This gets a dialogue started right away.

Another improvement is that during the night phase, every person carries out a role in clockwise order. This means that almost no script is needed so the game is a lot easier to manage without using any sort of app or memorizing a lot of information.

So far I'm really impressed with this game and it completely replaces ONUW.

Great party game! Quick, lots of bluffing and super cutthroat - everything I enjoy.
Takes a few plays to learn and figure out strategies, but relatively easy to understand concepts. Teaching to new players is sometimes a pain.

5-10 players.

Takes the one night werewolf twist to Resistance.

Slightly less flavorsome than werewolf, but unique in that the abilities players receive are completely separate to the team their on, AND to the actual turn order.

Players perform their action in clockwise order one after another, and depending on whether they are good or bad, their role may differ slightly!

Same feel as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, but with a Resistance theme. This game is a bit more tricky than ONUW, as role and loyalty aren't attached to each other.

This 'game' sux! That's right: you get a '1' for claiming this game works for 3-4 players, Mr. Publisher. Try to guess how annoyed I am. I want my 18 bucks back!

RATING: 6
It's a decent filler game, most who play with me tend to agree that it' odd that you start as one team and could mysteriously switched at the end of the game to your demise. So you may be working against yourself without knowing it. Which for some might sound intriguing, but to other it defeats the whole setup of there being two teams. It's really everyone individually playing as part of two random sects.

Hidden identity game, not my cup of tea. This one has only one night and each one makes action during that. Then the discussion starts. Both of the plays took 30 minutes, which I a bit too much for my taste.

Sorry for the long comment, I can't commit to writing a review but just wanted to get my two cents out there.

Art: 10/10
Complexity: 2/5
Enjoyment: 10/10 with a good, laid-back group
Replayability: 10/10
Build quality: 10/10 (The ID cards are SUPER thick)

Great game for groups of 7-10
Haven't tried with 5 or less people

I prefer light-moderate games, so this is good because it's simple to setup, play & explain, but also challenging due to the arguing and discussion.

When I invite my friends (high school â Uni aged), we have a lot of fun. Shouting, accusing, acting, lying, and trying to figure out the truth of who the 'bad guys' are (there are normally 1â3 bad guys, with the extremely slim â but not impossible â chance of there being none).

As with many games, it takes about two (often fast & boring) rounds for newbies to learn. But that's not a problem since games are pretty short. After they learn the basics, it's uphill from there, as they now understand that they need to be mysterious and manipulative. It's easy to adjust the game to be easier/harder depending on who's playing, so that's something I like!

The first part of the game, which had actual 'action' is quiet and for some, boring. But it is extremely short compared to the second part, which is the discussion. The discussion is really fun, but if you're with a group who does not like talking/discussing/thinking a lot/lying, or aren't in the mood for discussion, then this might not be a good game in such a situation. I tried once, it was very bland, mostly because they did not find it interesting in the first round and felt discouraged from then on) :(

In summary: My group of 6â10 light gamers aged 12-20 like this discussion/accusation/lying game! Recommend if you have similar characteristics to us.

Early rating, could go up if it has legs. Love love love the Resistance and thought One Night Ultimate Werewolf was super clever. This is very similar to One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

The logistical aspects of both One Night games are a bit annoying compared to classic Resistance and Werewolf: you must be able to reach everyone else's cards and manipulate them without people hearing you, which requires a smallish table and some background noise for cover.

Really impressive, however, how much intrigue they pack into such a constrained format.

I liked the concept of this one, merging stuff like Werewolf and The Resistance. Sadly, I felt there were too many roles and too much to take in initially. We had a very new player, who struggled to keep track of the permutations, and I myself (a bit more experienced) never felt like I found the ideal way to lie.

As others have said, the logic chain was often so obvious that you couldn't really fake the funk. It was confusing to know how to proceed as the villains, as too much of the puzzle was available to the good guys.

Wasn't a fan.

I prefer the flavour of One Night Werewolf over the flavour of One Night Revolution but the mechanics of Revolution seem slicker and potentially more interesting.  It also solves the problem of being able to hear people moving the cards (because everyone will be moving cards and making noises).

Played 3 games: 1 with 9 players, 2 with 5. My first impressions are lukewarm. My ONUW games are a zealous frenzy of accusations and madness, but ONR needs a little more time to get into. Not sure if separating the specializations from the ID's was such a good idea: in both 5 player games an informant got the reassignor role while there were already 2 informants in play, thus causing the informants to automatically win since they were in the majority. Luck seems to play a big role in that regard, and it's also reflected in turn order: the role that allows you to look at your own ID is absolutely useless if you're the commander, but fantastic if you're last in the round, so I'm not too keen on that. Will need some more plays to form a final opinion. For now, ONUW still has the overhand.

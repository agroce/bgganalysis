1st play: Very unique theme that fits well with the actions of the game.  A shopping phase similar to Francis Drake followed by some Uwe inspired resource conversion and a harvest phase for feeding people.  Very tight, though we played the first half with incorrect selling/woodcutting rules.  I'm not sure how much variation there is between games, but it was a pleasant game with lots of tough choices to figure out.

No 2nd play: 3 months later I don't remember much about this game except the theme, which was cool.

Learning the rules in order to teach took some effort but the game structure is quite linear so can be achieved. First impressions form the rules was that this might be a bit dry, however its not. It is however quite evil if the players are that way inclined. The advanced rules make the qame much deeper so I'd advise against the basic game even as a first outing. I am in awe of the advanced planning cards and the way this works. Sublime doesn't really do justice to it.

So aspects of the game could be streamlined imho. The fodder for the wagon seems unnecessarily clunky especially with the 3-2 goods transport. 

Overall a very good game and I think ratings will improve with more plays.

This has been a surprise hit at our house. Really fun AP-inducing planning for the whole family! It is a very nice puzzle to try to plan things, and then see your dreams crushed as you realize that you won't be able to get the supplies you need on the path this turn. Planning for winter, trying to fulfill task cards, keeping enough cash around to actually stay afloat are all great challenges. 

Update: After several plays I am upping this from an 8 to a 9. The design is just so ingenious. The way that things are arranged on the path is devious and the huge variability in decision making that is created by the placement of the action markers at the start of a round is fascinating. It is always tight, tense, and awesome. Everytime I play it I remember what an awesome game it is. Very highly recommended if you like planning and tension filled games.

Two major parts in the game: choosing your tools/people for the season and then using it. Skipping things can be meaningul here (in contrast to what often happens in like Glen More and Tokaido). Planning is important though, not much room for (several) mistakes.

(Ratting up from 7.8 to 9 after acquiring 2nd edition with Joinery/Buildings)

I love this game and it seems to get better with each play. Yes, the game has a bit of a fiddly set-up/maintenance throughout, but is so worth the little nuance. The rondel iteration plays so strong to the games theme it is really an incredible experience before it is a classical game. Couple this with a well built in advanced planning phase and a requirement of paying close attention to what your opponent is trying to do makes for good tension and forward thinking. Unfortunately, because of the setup it may be hard to get to the table for some. Also, the rules, even in the second edition could be improved upon. I strongly recommend getting some condiment cups to save on the set-up/break down issue.

This is a great game if you're looking for a logging theme. The english translation is fairly good, although you can tell it was written in German and then translated later. The components are sub par, especially the money and I really don't like the tokens for random resources on the trail. The mechanics of this game are very enjoyable though, and are good for someone who wants to think a lot and plot out their future turns.

WOW, this game is good. I love the way you get to select resources, food and tools, the race to be first at the lumbering areas, the psychology behind the blind bidding and all the careful planning that has to be done. Visually the game is a little bit brown, but it doesn't distract the gameplay in anyway.

Lignum has a great mechanic in the forest trail. Imagine a cross between classic Worker Placement and the sort of Glen Moore/Kraftwagon style of option selection. It works well as you walk along the forest, jumping ahead to grab the best options but in doing so allowing your opponents to pick up a mass of other stuff on their way. Once you have completed the forest trail the rest is all about resource and economy optimisation, and very puzzley it is too. The lumberjack theme works reasonably well too.

It does what it does well, no overly complex systems, everything works smoothly and fairly intuitively.

All in all if you like fairly mid-heavy Euros (this is the weight of something like Goa or Hansa Teutonica) and you like Worker Placement and challenging optimisation puzzles then you are going to enjoy this game big time.

2017-009-06: This is on the upper scale of how heavy I like things. A bit too heavy actually. It has a few interesting mechanics with bidding and timing. The bad part (for me) is that the timing is to much hassle to think about.
Also, incredibly tight. . . 
I ended up with just a 3:rd of the winners points.
Did not like. Glad I passed at Essen 2015. :D
Initial rating: 4 (mostly due too heaviness and length. Personal opinion)

Very good game with tough decisions to make. After one play (3 players) it seems to be very unforgiving. In autumn of year 1 I made a huge mistake when spending my last 2 bucks on buying 2 food instead of at least 1 saw. In winter I then had to take 2 loans and sell all of my wood uncut. I managed to make some good money the second year but in the end I never really recovered from falling behind that much. I ended up dead last with 30 points behind the winner. I'm hoping for a much better score next time though.

Fun to "tokaido" around the forest and get what you need for the logging season.  A little fiddly with rules/bits but quite simple once you play a round or so.  Fun to achieve points/money with your wood when you get it back to your board.  Requires some planning so there can be downtime for those that take long to do so.  Seems like a better design would be to remove the orange pieces from the game and have all the other spaces printed on the board since they come out every time.  Their location doesn't really matter and it would speed rounds and planning up quite a bit.  Instead of the bonus orange bits I would prefer the feeding/heating be taken out of the game.  This would also streamline it and make it more "fun".  Also, the way you collect food and wood is too fiddly and can be spiteful.  We just played that the order you finish is the turn order you choose your grove(reversed for next go round) and only one player per grove.  Much simpler and has almost the same effect.  

I like this theme and hope this game is reprinted and further developed.

RATING: 7.5
Components: ok components, cards too thin but they are not used a lot
Complex: not so easy to understand but it is not difficult
Weight: medium
Players: 3 or 4
Length: around 90 mins
Mechanics: set collection, resources management
Decisions: a lot, really a lot, what to do with the wood, how much to advance, who to hire....
Opinion: well the them is not an appealing one, at least to me, you have a factory and do your work, and your work is about cutting wood, processing it and selling wood. You can see that there is not much happening in this game with this indeed, but this is the game...get wood, process, sell
And no, I don't hate the game. I liked it. Looking only into the theme is not much happening, but you have lot of things to do and too many decisions to take.
The game is played over 2 years, with each seasons, being the winter one where you can't do much.
During each season (except winter) you move your Big Lumberjack trying to acquire equipment and some stuff for your factory, this is a race choosing if you need everything or you move faster to be first cutting.
Then the cut, you have selected one of the areas with wood (and you have 3 different kinds), now is time to cut if you have the appropriate workers. And then the seasons phases (transport wood, process wood, sell, complete some tasks.... all of this if you have the appropriate equipment).
And then winter, you have to supply your people with food and hot, so better keep some of the wood for you.
As already said, having a small goal you have many ways to reach it. Decide what equipment you need, plan, plan, plan.... you can and have to plan 1 and 2 turns ahead, because not everything is automatic (for instance, transporting wood through the river is slow and take you 2 turns to arrive home).
The best is that it is not straightforward, you can go for tasks, for selling, for white wood, for black one...
I really liked it, the them is, well, the theme it has, but all the planning and decisions you make during the game makes it a quite hard one to master

Reminds me on some way of "Egizia" which is a great, streamlined game that came out a few years ago. Since this one doesn't offer anything new, but is more complicated and fiddly, it just loses in all aspects.

That doesn't mean it's a bad game, but I've seen all this before and most probably in overall better games.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Euro dur de gestió de recursos (extreure llenya del bosc, transportarla, i ferla servir per serrarla o envellirla i vendrela). Guanya el jugador amb més diners al final del joc.

El joc es tracta de "moure coses" d'un lloc per un altre del taulell principal i del taulell personal de cada jugador. El mecanisme més interesant és un track tipus Egizia, la resta del joc és molt poc original. A més, crec que hi ha una excessiva complicació en com es fan les accions (només el fet de "moure" la llenya té un munt de variants...).

Prescindible, no em negaria a probarlo però no el compraré segur.

This game is mostly excellent. The way it forces you to plan so far ahead and be so careful and efficient is amazing. Incidentally I'd say if you're going to play this game then play with the special power cards you have to book multiple turns in advance and the big point goal cards that require specific wood at specific ages, without these I could see the game losing a lot of the feeling of needing really precision planning.

But my one reservation is how you determine which zone you have access to for collecting wood. It's this simultaneous choice doublethink thing, and that's just something I always hate. It's one thing to need to evaluate how much each of your opponents wants a specific thing, but that extra level of 'will he go for his first choice, or try to play it safe and go for the slightly less good thing in hopes of getting it alone?' to me feels too close to a random choice in a serious strategy game like this. I still like the game a lot but this keeps me from loving it.

Rating after one play:

I love the Francis Drake-like "worker placement rondel." There's a lot to think about, but it's super easy to teach. The board looks really busy at first, but I really like the way it looks once you orient yourself. 

I've only played with two players so far. That was tight itself, but it should be even tighter and better with more players.

the game is incredibly stressful, as you have to usually plan to the last dollar what you are going to do each round in order to be efficient and know what opportunities you can take.  I am really not a fan of the blind selection of areas.

RATING: 7
While there are a lot of steps and actions to take in Lignum, the structure of the game, which has players followinging a path, choosing equipment and actions ahead of other players, gives the game a processional structure that makes it rather easy to play mechanically. Even the many steps of the woodcutting and selling phase is clearly mapped out from one step to the next. That's not to say decisions are easy. You need to line everything up in one phase in order to execute in the next phase and if you only partially get what you need you will be hosed. Many critical items have a cost, so you need to be selling wood constantly throughout the game to fund your future turns, or you will be hosed. You also need to collect food and firewood for the two winter phases to be prepared when they come, or you will be hosed. Finding ways to not get hosed is a big part of the game. :-) The end of the game comes fast and seemingly out of nowhere, so it is hard to recover in this game, should a hosing occur.

If you like to carefully (and competitavely) plan and prepare your execution phases in a game then you'll like this one. Food feels a bit tacked-on. It is required for the winter phase (very much like Agricola), but is not well integrated with the rest of the game. Firewood, also required, is much better integrated since you need to choose between selling or burning. I played 2-player and it felt a bit loose. I would have welcomed more competition for the cutting areas and the workers, and the winter requirements were too easy to meet. I'll probably only play this with 4 players. There is a rumor that a reprrint is on Capstone's 2017 production schedule. I'll keep my copy - the art is a bit crude, but the production is fine - but I'm sure Capstone will make a few component improvements.

I've only played with the tactics cards, not the planning cards.

The game uses the same 'move down the river' mechanism as [thing=58421][/thing]. It works well here and leads to tension early in the round as you try to gauge when to jump ahead to that lovely resource you want. Near the end of the track, however, things get a bit odd. The order you arrive at the last space is the reverse of turn order for the next round, so if you have no incentive to arrive early (which may or may not be the case) then you want to arrive as late as possible. It made for a very different experience from Egizia.

The other bit of the game is about chopping and drying wood to sell and fulfill contracts. You also need to worry about winter which demands you spend some chopped firewood and food.

The game requires you to plan ahead. It's all about planning. You need to puzzle out which raw resources you need, how much time you need to dry the wood, and the various helper meeples and tokens you will need to get the job done. There are only 6 rounds in the game and two winter phases so time is precious.

I enjoyed the puzzle, but I'm not sold on the game. Mostly due to the way you choose wood in a very odd blind bidding procedure. I think there are some variants for that, and maybe one of them would work for me. As it was, that part of the game, which was filled with chaos (and in one round negotiation, *shudder*) worsened the experience for me.

I currently rate it 7. Depending on the variants and the other deck of cards we didn't use this could change.

---------

I've been informed that there is a variant for claiming the spaces which sounds delightful to me. I'm looking forward to playing again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really liked this one. The more advanced game options make for a more interesting and more challenging game. One must plan ahead and there is a bit of a push your luck element in choosing your actions along the road - what do you think your opponents will leave versus what you want/need and they might choose. Mistakes are deadly and you won't usually come back from a miscue assuming at least one other player doesn't make one. Goal cards are invaluable as long as their completed.

cool game. not as heavy as people make it out to be. you just need to AP a little near the end to figure out exactly how much to spend on every worker.

This has dropped from the radar when noticing that it is run by Spieleschmiede crowdfunding. I have one game from them which was a disappointment (Express 01) and I have noticed several others that now have rather low rating. I'm also not sure how I feel about an online shop running this.

We played the Expert game with Planned Work and Tasks and also used the alternative way to select the Wood Cutting Areas and I have to say that it looks like that's the way to play. All these 3 things can be left out of the game or include one and let the others out, so you can tailor it to the experience level of the players you'll be playing.
I'm not talking about experience level with this game, just in gaming in general, if you are somewhat experience gamers you can go to the deep end of the pool in the first game just like we did and I don't think you'll be overwhelmed.

I really liked the game, it flows very well and I like that you can dictate your own pace in the Supply Path, will you try to gather more things in your way to the Cutting Area or will you go faster than the others so you can choose first next round?

You also have to plan each season very well, specially if you play with the Planned Work module, and you should... this module allows players to plan work for a specific season in the future so that they can use the seasons prior to that season to gather and prepare that Season and get the most out of the Planned Work.

The game is very thematic, at least to me it seems to be, you really feel that you are assembling a work force and prepare each season to do the best you can with harsh competition in the Lumber business.

Was initially attracted by the theme. 

After reading the rules, annoyed by its implementation. Come on. Deep integration of logging and wood working in the 19th century? And your workers get their food from where - from the forest?!? Did they run around collecting mushrooms or what? Anyway, why actually integrate this senseless unthematic feeding mechanism at all? Just because it's got to be in your Euro since Agricola?

Typical heavy Euro with all its bad sides, it seems. :(

I can't rate this game yet after one play. We just played the basic game with 2 players which I can already tell is far from optimal. I liked it quite a bit and money is EXTREMELY tight the first year. By the end of the second, you have a lot more flowing cash although you have to remember that money is points and it's tough to spend unless you can recoup it. We also kept forgetting about our mill worker which would have saved us a few bucks here and there since we didn't need to buy as many workers.

The game had a similiarish feel to Glen More or Tokaido where you follow along a path and can't go backwards. The big difference here is that turn order still applies regardless of how far forward you jump.

The rest of the game was fairly procedural akin to Key Market or La Granja. I don't mind it, but it's a little more to keep track of than I want to in a game. Each phase is quick, but there are a lot of phases and some have subphases. 

The rulebook left a lot to be desired. It's potentially all there, but it's scattered over 3 rulebooks and some of the rules are in strange places. I'm working on creating a condensed rulebook that has everything in a coherent fashion and condensed down so that you don't have to flip through a handful of books.

While I haven't played with the Advanced or Expert rules, I feel like you could put a heavy gamer into the Expert game without much trouble. They could easily just ignore the additional spots as neither require that much more explanation. It kind of reminds me of the Dark Alley expansion to Trickerion.

Not sharp enough for me. Game balance seems to be at the expense of being able to do anything particularly interesting, so it's mostly a case of turning 3 coins into 4 coins and repeating.

(Caveat: for two player game only). There was less tension in the action selection track than I was expecting. The game felt a bit wash, rinse, repeat, as there wasn't much progression across seasons (more money, wood, etc., but more of the same). I expect it plays better with a higher player count and my rating could go up with more plays. I am not champing at the bit for more plays though. Not a bad game, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me.

This is a brain burney game about being a lumberjack who needs to plan ahead effectively to make the most money, and also have enough food and wood side aside in the winter to be able to eat and heat. Each non-winter round players walk their meeple once around the path on the outside of the board collecting workers and tokens. This requires spending money in many cases, and money is the same thing as points in this game, so overbuying is a big mistake to make. Once all players finish their circuit, you do a resolve phase where players execute the actions their collected things allow them to do, and then you have the option of selling your wood for more dollars, which is what will let you have a useful next round. Everything is incredibly tight in this game, and there's a fantastic tension of trying to make sure you get all the tokens and workers you need to fulfill your plans.

On top of all that there's this interesting system where if you plan your actions for future rounds, you can get benefits from special cards, and there's a secret simultaneous area selection phase which determines where you are allowed to farm wood from the map. This is a delightfully brutal efficiency game with players elbowing each other constantly.

Good game, very thematic and interesting action-system. The quality of the material is VERY BAD though!!!
And I hate multilingual boards/cards... 
We upgraded the bad material with custom ones. If you are interested, you can see them in the game's gallery.

--Jan2017-- It's a cool optimization puzzle.  And one I did quite poorly at the first time out:  I'd love another chance.  Though whether I liked it enough to buy a copy is still in question.

Plan ahead. Mechanisms are simple to get but the planning can be brain burner. With money (VP's) if your opponents destroy your plans, there are still chances of completing your goals.
I think its better format should be with 4 players.

"Planning, the Game," as one player put it. This is really a great logistics puzzle. Most of the mechanics are simple and easy to explain. But it probably takes a game for new players to really grasp what they're trying to do. It's pretty easy to figure out what you want to do. It's harder to manage it when other players are picking up the supplies you need for carrying out those plans. It can often be difficult to decide if you should skip several good opportunities in order to secure what you need, or if you should gamble on your opponents giving you one more round to get to that coveted item.

The second edition adds a couple more features I'd never play without: buildings with special powers; and a scarce supply of new workers who can add to your income both during and at the end of the game, but at the cost of a little more food. Both are great additions to the base game, giving just a touch more to think about each trip around the board.

Planning well for the winter season is a must and board game explainers should do their best to make this part clear. The movement, processing, drying, and sale of lumber should also be carefully gone over as this is the heart of the game and it can be a little bit confusing to new players.

I've enjoyed this at all player counts. It's a little bit of a longer game, but I find that I'm actively involved in deciding my next move and reacting to my opponent's moves at pretty much all times.

Highly recommended for the heavy gamer, but maybe look elsewhere if you're looking for something light and relaxing.

Our copies arrived (from Germany) *incomplete* - missing all the player boards. A promo mini-deck of cards was also not included. Very disappointing quality control (replacements did arrive in a few weeks).

3P is more friendly than with 4P, which can be brutal at times depending how the Supply Path works out. I really like that players may need to be flexible in their strategies, depending on what your opponents do.

This is a smooth and excellent design that is quite thematic - our group likes it a lot!

Way too tight of a game to be as enjoyable as I'd like. If you make one or two mistakes early on, or someone decides to screw one player over another, it can be a brutal catch up.

Feels like they should start you with more stuff to make it easier to get an engine going and fulfill orders and more. Like by the end of the first year is where you start to feel a little comfortable, and which is how I'd like to start the actual game at.

Will have to try some of the expansion stuff, but as it stands it is way too dry and tight to be fun for me.

Very good logistics game that starts out super tight, and then flowers as you start making money. Actions are pretty straightforward. Move and select the action. The game comes in the timing of everything. Lots of minutia to explore. It seems odd that you have to find or buy a saw every time you want to cut wood. There are lots of little ways to improve you efficiency. It was very engaging with the full complement of 4 players. It seems like it would be too open with less players.

I love the theme and the gameplay is great too. It's certainly on the heavier side of the spectrum, but I really enjoy playing such games once in a while.

Long-term planning is greatly rewarded, but you must be prepared to quickly change your plans if somebody else gets is your way.

This game has no engine-building, yet, because you constantly re-invest the money you got, it still has a bit of a snowball effect. It's essentially drafting, but on a board similar to Tokaido, but the problem is if someone picks up what you needed you really don't have any alternate strategy to go on. There are million details in the rules, and the rulebook is split in parts making it a nightmare to read. There are some interesting stuff, and I like the Tokaido-like board, but it's way too long for what it is, and the way scoring works and the lack of player powers and improvement in the game just make it boring.

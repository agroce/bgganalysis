RATING: 6
A good overview of the battlefield gives a different feel to the WH universe. Each 'lord' becomes a pawn of a larger struggle. The ever powerful lords are now a rally point for the rest of the units.

The clash of frontline units is not so evident in this scale. The shooters and artillery units seem to rein.

Only played one test-run, but it seems much more rewarding than its older cousin Warhammer. More space to maneuvre, tactical decisions actually influence the outcome, more focus on cunning than dice-rolling... A tentative thumbs up!

Some rules were a bit unbalanced and some of the units were way overpowered for their cost, but otherwise I feel that Warmaster was a really innovative game for the time. The later Warmaster Ancients is the improved/balanced version of the game.

Excellent fantasy set that doesn't become broken with the addition of "fantasy elements".  Some coplexity, but the mechanics are very simplistic just explained poorly.  Add the wide array of varient rules and you've got a great set for all your large battle needs.

RATING: 7
A 7 because if my army was not stolen, and I had an opponent, I think I would play this one a lot more.  Also, if I had an ancients army, and an opponent, I would LOVE to play the ancients version.  The OG rules were clean, only a few ambiguities that usually were taken care of with a die roll or common sense, relatively quick games, and lots of fun.  Good looking units made it feel like large armies were fighting large battles, and there was no Munchkin factor, because the magic items were slim to none, and they had very little effect on the game, as were character models and magic.  All had a small effect on the game, but mostly the armies decided the fate of the battle, not the uberpowered rules expansions from White Dwarf or the latest Codex.  I would encourage all to buy and play this game.

RATING: 8
Quite simply the best miniature wargame GW has ever produced.  Which means they will be dropping it sometime in the near future I'm sure.  This game is what Warhammer Fantasy should be.  Battle of BIG armies.  It plays very well and is very reminiscent of many historical 15mm games and strangely enough makes a decent historical rule set.  I've seen some Ancient Conversions and even some American Civil War conversion that I played and it works!!!!!!!   Surpisingly, armies are affordable, enough so that I own three, Undead, High Elves and Empire.  Gameplay is fluid, quick and exciting.  Really gives the feel of a massive battle.  Highly recommended!  I don't get to play as much as I would like.

RATING: 8
Easily the best tabletop wargame GW have ever produced, myself and my friend have been playing this for 3 years now. 

However, it's not perfect. It doesn't run as smoothly as i'd like, and can become bogged down. We also had to house-rule the command phase, we've had games where multiple brigades haven't been able to move because the player was unlucky with dice rolls. The game works best with around 2,000 point armies, which is a shame because i like to have epic size games

At the moment we're very tempted to convert the whole game to command and colors, and use big hex terrain features.

RATING: 7
A good little fantasy Epic system that if you didn't know any better, would never have believed it was a GW product. This is probably why it was spun off in short order. I guess there were not enough "rape the kids until they hand over all their milk money" atrocities in the marketing machina to keep it under the GW umbrella. For a 1.0 mini game, it was pretty solid. The game enjoyed only a limit period of play within our group. It did however serve as a lunching point for some unlikely miniatures players.  I would bust it out again. Although, I don't think I have the motivation to start painting them again.

RATING: 6
If you want a fantasy mini game, play this instead of Fantasy Battle.  Much more interesting.  Love the command system.  Not only for how it represents the scale, but because of how the successive order mechanic enables great desperate plays.  Other games it is just impossible to run around a flank and charge in one turn.  Needing a 9, then 8, then 6 is why dice games evoke cheering.

Update 8-6: The successive order mechanic gets old when you play this a lot.  No matter what you do, a unit of Chaos Knights may get 4 moves and ten attacks down your line.  Field of Glory and DBA have better rules for this genre (they just need magic).

Not a bad little game, but the command mechanics make the game too dependent on luck.  Failed command tests force other commanders to take over or else the rest of your army doesn't move or attack that turn.  Other than that a great 10mm mass combat fantasy game.

For my tastes the command system is a bit too random (although it's been adopted by many other well respected minis rules) and the different units too generic. However, if you're looking for a light, large scale fantasy miniatures game you won't go far wrong with this.

Excellent miniature battle game - far more tactical than Warhammer and the scale of the minis means that you don't need such a large playing area, and if you do have the space, the armies can LARGE. It basically makes WHFB look like the skirmish game that it really is! Collecting armies is cheap too - £60 should easily get you going with a 1000pt/1500pt army.

One of GW's best games. Don't be fooled by the apparent similarity to Warhammer Fantasy.  Warmaster uses completely different mechanics.  Because of this it is faster, more interesting, and less prone to cheesy uber-army building.  The command rules are sublimely elegant.  The combat system is ok, very much a 'buckets o' dice' affair, but it gets the job done, and quickly too.  Most combats end in decisive victory for one side or the other.

Pretty interesting game. I had Empire, Ork, and Undead Armies before I let it all go during my great gaming purge. I wasn't crazy about the unpredictability in issuing orders, although I admit its probably more realistic than many other games GW puts out.

To me the greatest part of the game were the minis. At 15mm, they werent too big, or too small, and the variations in the units were really impressive. My favorites were the characters, and how differently they were portrayed. The empire general sitting on a chair with his feet up on the desk was quite classic to me, and something I didnt expect to see during a battle obviously, but it showed me that minis themselves could be miniature dioramas, something that I didnt bother with until then. So now, even with Epic, I take more care to personalize miniatures so they not only look awesome on a gaming table, but also on their own on display.

Also want to add here that I think this is Rick Priestley's last game at GW as a designer. He really is responsible for some of my favorite games. While I am not crazy about Warmaster myself, it was still original and something I don't see GW being able to produce without him today.

A very tactical wargame (especially from Games Workshop).  Some of the armies are not the most balanced match-up, but oh well.  Shooting is definitely important (despite what the rulebook says) and any army lacking that (Vampire Counts) seems to have trouble.  Terrain is definitely a must though to take full advantage of the ruleset.

2-player table top wargame. When this was launched circa 1999 it was billed as GW's 'third core game' It was intended to join 40k and WFB as a core product. Sales were flat and the game was relegated to Specialist game. 
This is a nice 5mm-10mm warmgame. The turn system is interesting - you can keep activating units as long as you keep passing leadership checks. 
Armies are small, easy to paint and fun to field.

Good little game.  Plays well and supports big battles. 

The command and control system is a lot more refined than one might suspect on initial play and is at the core of a under-appreciated system.

Quite silly as well which is a plus in my estimation.

Like all Specialist Games, not as well supported by GW as it could be.

One the up side, the miniatures from the more common sets (undead, orcs, high elves, empire & chaos) are usually not too hard to find on eBay.

I'll keep it simple - this is one of the best rulesets ever for medieval miniature maneuver, combat and C&C (imho).

Taking some ideas from Epic 40k and adding pieces cohesion and positioning, it has all the trademarks of GW excellent designs: [b]simple[/b], fast, dice-chucker humongous fantasy clash. And above everything: [i]fun[/i].

Will they ever reprint it in a comprehensive box... let's hope.

RATING: 9.5
Might be my "lifestyle" game. no other game has commanded as much of my attention since i discovered this a few years back. 

while a little fiddly, the rules make sense and the entertaining theme-drenched rulebook puts them into perspective. 

in contrast, other medium/lite miniatures rules i've tried are too abstract and flavorless. for my collection, Warmaster tops the ease of its closest competitor, Battleground: Fantasy Warfare, which is lite-fare awesomeness but suffers from just a tad too much abstraction, requires a too-large playing area, and (to me) has poor art design.

Warmaster's context-driven rules-writing and overall art direction (love the illustrations, photography and painted minis in the books) make-up for its shortcomings: a lack of a more-thorough reference section and the resulting constant scanning through the paragraphs of text. someone else made the point that the core rules can all be summarized on a single page of paper; maybe a second page for special abilities. i also find this to be true.    

although it is possible to play this game w/ paper cutouts as proxy for miniatures, playing with miniatures helps complete the mental image that the rulebook inspires. while this review focuses on the rulebook and play, i must add that Warmaster's sculpts are the best 10mm around (if pricey and increasingly rare). in all, no other game in my collection delivers Warmaster's spectacle of epic-scale battle.

(Note: re. "epic-scale" i play with a mix of 6mm minis and Warmaster's own 10mm line. 6mm allows 3 strips per stand, which creates a more massed-army look.)  

While the Ancients and Battle of Five Armies versions of this game have their own merits (clearer-written and better-formatted rules, full-color books; but, alas, still no thorough reference section!), this one does a better job of helping realize how much fun, dynamic, and fantastical the game could be.

I used to have several (5 in fact) 4000 to 5000 point armies for this. Down to one now in mini but 7 on paper. Probably the best game Games Workshop ever produced for gamers, but unfortunately they chose not to support the game and lost Rick Priestly as a designer. Their loss as he opened his own company and is designing again. Back to Warmaster though, one of the best command mechanics in any game I've played. Simple but effective. Great maneuver warfare. You can easily get armies on paper if you want. Plays just fine. This one is a truly great game. Fast and simple yet elegant design and complex strategy. Students of military history, this is good with lots of fan rulesets to get away from fantasy in into simulations. A must for any serious gamer if just for the mechanics.

A very surprising product from GW. I bought the book and gave it a try with homemade cardboard counters. A good game that is worth trying.

This game never took off in our gaming community the way Epic did, but I still enjoy slowly adding to my armies.  I'm a sucker for any game Micro Machine-sized.

I'm not sure if I like this better than BFG.  This game makes you feal like a general in a fantasy setting.  Love it, but hate to paint the small figs.

Beautiful minias and nice rules. I saw this little gem for first time  at Ludex 2000 Bologna but then (in Italy) almost disappeared and this is a pity.
It deserves more support.

This game uses a lot diffent game mechanics than a typical GW wargame.  Makes for a fun alternative, but I still perfer the larger miniatures when it comes to painting.

My favorite miniatures game, hands down.
The 10mm scale allows for detailed painting, but mass combat.
The attrition system is far, far superior to, say: DBA
(as is the the Command & Control system!).

My one complaint:
not everyone likes fistfulls of dice.

Suffers a bit in the fantasy version with no real limitations on all-powerful cavalry.  The historical version may have better results where infantry just might matter.  Lack of turn limit can make this problematic for analysis paralysis types.

Quite enjoyable game of large fantasy battles. This screams to be combined with Mighty Empires.

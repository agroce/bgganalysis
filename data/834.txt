This is only an okay trivia game.  Anyone with a decent recollection of high school history will not have a problem playing this game.  My group and I found that the suggested game length of placing five historical events in chronological order was far too easy, so we doubled that number, which makes it a bit more of a challenge.

As trivia games go, this one is fairly forgiving and plenty of fun. Has a seating problem, where being seated to the left of a poor player is a significant advantage, but I don't think it breaks the game in any way.

I like the game play but not the set of events -- too many obscure 19th C inventions, not enough pre-18th C events.  I'm building a homebrew set by having friends add a few cards every time we play -- I like that one a lot better.

Great filler game, and gateway games since the events are interesting and you don't actually have to know the date of the events just whether it is bore of after the other events in your tabled time line. 1st to 10 cards in a time line wins!

20th anniversary edition.

Solid enough party game, definitely better than the "Apples to Apples" copies.  A bit random, as you could potentially have hundred year gaps between most of your cards while an opponent gets nothing but 2-3 years each time, but if you're playing it in its intended setting, doesn't really matter.

An interesting history based filler.  Best played with more people.  You try to guess the year that a significant event took place.  Balancing effect that as you get closer to the goal of 10 cards on the table, the closer the gaps, and the harder the guesses.

Downgraded rating in Dec 2015, haven't played it haven't missed it.

This is a really nice light-trivia game.  Although occasionally it's been too easy, with multiple players never giving a wrong answer -- perhaps a more compact time period or more obscure events would take care of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Neat game.  You don't have to know exact dates of history, just general ideas of "about" when things happened.  There is a very small amount of luck involved, and it can appear to be frustrating if your opponent is getting events spanning from "The Garden of Eden" to "Landing on the Moon", and your events range from the "Invasion of Poland by Germany" and the "Defeat of Berlin" as you try to cram 10 events into 5 years.

I suggest that you not play this game with anyone that has no knowledge of history whatsoever.  My friends like this game, as do I, but my wife would never, ever play it.

I think this has been reimplemented or replaced with the Timeline series, because they kind of play the same way.

RATING: 4
I usually don't get much pleasure from playing trivia games. I assume it is because I'm lousy at them but more importantly I don't find it involving at all. This game is a little more forgiving to people who lack trivia knowledge because you actually don't have to know the exact year of a certain event to be able to successfully answer. It gets harder by the end though as more cards are added to your timeline.

RATING: 4
A very good "party" game.  Deals with a different skill set than most party games, so if your guests aren't the "guess a word" type, but have a passing knowledge of history, they should do well.

The cards in the game deal mainly with history that you must deduce, not just know.  You have to gauge things like the year the zipper was patented, or the  x-ray machine was invented.  There are a few of the "school facts" type cards, but not at all so many that you have to be a history buff to enjoy this game.

2/16 - Lowered rating because of Timeline.

Beats the tar out of Trivial Pursuit.  Game play is more interesting, with the questions getting intrinsically harder with each prior correct answer (because you are placing the &#039;event&#039; on your own time stream -- harder with more events already placed on your time stream).  One rules goof -- the game is the best of four games and there now ARE repeating years -- what happens when the card your guessing is the same year as another in your stream?  Rules do not specify.

As a liberal arts major, one of my main goals has been to have an over-arching understanding of the progression of civilization in order to understand what direction human culture is heading, and ultimately, to have a better understanding of who I am.  Heavy, I know.  But I guess this is probably why I really enjoy playing this game; it helps me place things in history.  The only problem is the game can go on too long but that can be easily fixed by playing to a less number of points.

A surprisingly good game. Each round doesn't last long, so more people would make this a longer game but we found it interesting & a fun way to pass an hour or so (& yes, we're geeks, so the history was interesting). Even my 13 year old managed to win a round or two, so age isn't necessarily a handicap (although it obviously does help a wee bit to know a bit about history & the like).

There are very few trivia games that I like and this is one that I really do (even if I prefer playing other games). The best thing is that you can guess on the right answer. It will still help those who know about stuff.

There is a clear push your luck element to this game and you have to wager if you want another question or play it safe. This adds excitement to the game.

I have played the new version, which I found to be harder than the old one. The reason behind this is that the game is more focused on the 20th century events. Otherwise, the rules are the same.

Good bit of trivia fun that doesn't require you to KNOW the answer outright. You have options to make an educated guess. Idea is to build a string of 10 events in the best chronological order. The element i like best is the push your luck factor of drawing another event and risk being wrong thus losing what you gained on that turn vs banking and letting an opponent win. May have been eclipsed by Timeline for some.

This is another very fun trivia/party game.  It is much quicker and more fun than Trivial Pursuit. "The best of" version (also listed here on the Geek)adds categories and an optional "press you luck rule" where you may continue drawing cards on your turn as long as you are correct but at the expense of losing all cards you have "won" that turn.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit.

There appear to be a couple of different versions of this floating around.  Before playing this one, I played one that involved rolling a special die in order to select the category.

Timeline completely ripped off this game, but the one change they made improved it substantially.

Trevligt frågespel med mekaniker som push-your-luck samt möjlighet att gissa/placera frågor i svarsintervall. Det finns också ett element av ökad svårighetsgrad i takt med att spelare närmar sig segern (i.o.m. minskad granularitet i gissningsintervallen då man samlar på sig kort). 

Överlag det bästa frågespelet jag spelat -- kul att bli introducerad till det av någon annan. Tack brorsan. 

Kudos även till Kärnan som givit ut spelet -- är det någon som vet om funnits en tidigare utgåva från 2001 i enlighet med uppgifterna på bgg, eller är nuvarande utgåva (2008) den enda?

Good trivia game. Basically a which came first question game. Like the game that has you determining what's heavier/faster etc. (Sort it Out).

Younger kids may not be too good with this. Therefore use at convention may be limited. 

HOWEVER, a nice educational game that seems fun to play.

Get the "Best of Chronology" Version of the game.

Fundex (gibsons) version: Comment from amazon.com: I got this latest version on Chronology in 2009. I like the previous versions better. For one thing, this version comes with only 200 cards. The previous versions had about twice that number, if not more. Another fault with this version is when you have one space left in your rack. Let's say your empty space is between 1910 and 1955. A card comes up saying Ulysses S. Grant was elected U. S. President in this year. Clearly that was in the 1800's, but because your empty space is from 1910 - 1955, you can't get the card to win. The other versions had a timeline where you could stick the card to accomodate what you had in your deck.

Timelines seems to be a revamping of this.

Buffalo games also has a version of this game that uses 429 card covering 858 events. So, that seems to be a good deal.

Simple family style game that's actually quite enjoyable.  I always prefer these games (such as Wits and Wagers) where players are rewarded for making the best educated guess rather than needing to actually know the subject (Trivial Pursuit). It's the push-your-luck element that really lets this game shine.

Makes for a good party game.  More humorous than expected.  For example, some card placements are so ridiculously easy (which came first? the Great Pyramids of Egypt or the invention of silly putty) that you can't help but smile.  And you come away feeling that you might have learned a thing or two.

If you like history, you'll love this. WARNING - IF everyone playing isn't of a similar knowledge level, the game is very unbalanced as the person who goes after the 'less knowledgeable' person will likely win by picking up their misses.

RATING: 7
I always end up enjoying this a lot more than I expected to, which is a good plus-mark for any game, mainstream or otherwise. A little reliant on draw of the card, and there's some very unbalanced outcomes to be had, but it's good accessible entertainment nevertheless.

RATING: 7
It's a simple and enjoyable mechanic. Draw a card for your opponent and read out its event, but keep the year it happened secret. Your opponent must correctly place it in the right place (from earliest to latest) amidst their previously acquired event cards. First to get 10 correct wins. The events are mostly pleasantly obscure but roughly guessable, even for those who don't study history. But it's admittedly particularly engaging for history and trivia buffs. It comes in at the right length, and I find it an enjoyable way to pass the time with friends.

RATING: 9
A great game. Quick, Educational, Fun, Easy to learn, good random factor. Although it can be frustrating when you get 3 cards in a row that are all within 4 years of each other and someone else gets the Moon Landing, followed by the Discovery of America, followed by the Building of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, this is a big part of what makes the game so good; because of this just knowing a lot about history does not guarantee that you will win.

This is excellent, probably one of the best adult 'filler' games for a light-weight crowd with broad interests.  Play time is short and intense, setup is non-existant, material is accessible even to those without a degree in history, and everything in the game can be hand-held.  Elegant party game (and who thought you'd ever see those two phrases together on the 'Geek?).

I like trivia, and this game is basically putting date-based trivia in the correct year range.  Unfortunately, the various ranges are easier or harder to choose based on luck, but the game still has a few tough decisions and informative moments.  A good filler for the trivia-inclined.

RATING: 8
Sometimes games with an extremely simple concept are the best - and Chronology is a prime example of that.

If you enjoy trivia, but also don't commit every date to memory - you can still have fun with this game! I was honestly a bit put off by the concept at first (dates... history... ugh!), but I'm so glad I gave it a shot!

Pros:
-You can literally learn the rules in less than a minute. The rules are extremely straightforward, with no real grey area to them (yay for no "my answer kinda-sorta fit that category!" debates...).
-Playing length is not too long (usually 20 minutes or so), so it ends up being a game that we often decide to play "just one more time...," since it is so fun and quick. 
-When it comes to games that are trivia-ish in nature, I appreciate when games skew towards favoring the strongest players, but also make it so that they don't *always* win (e.g. some elements of luck or strategy). This game definitely falls into that bucket, in that our family's resident history buffs tend to win most often (which I suppose is only fair...), but sometimes they get stuck with a tougher board (e.g. not as many wide open date ranges) or trickier questions, allowing for a chance for other players to occasionally shine and sneak out a win. We also really like that the game starts out easier when your timeline is small at first, and then it gets to be somewhat challenging by the time the last 2-3 questions roll around and your timeline is more built out.

Cons:
-While the number of cards given is decent (and they are all two-sided), this game plays quickly enough that I would have maybe liked to see a few more thrown in, to reduce the chances of future repeats. 
-Some of the questions are a bit random (e.g. the date of some random invention), which can be frustrating - but honestly, these tend to be few and far between (maybe a couple per game), and most questions are such that you can at least take an educated guess. And I suppose some of the more random questions do prevent the history buffs from running away with an immediate victory every time (much to their frustration... ;) ).

If you like trivia (even just as a casual fan), I'd absolutely recommend this game as a simple crowd-pleaser.

It doesn't quite deserve to be, because luck of the draw is everything, but this is a very enjoyable filler, a great way to end a gaming night (so ender rather than filler I suppose) and I imagine like Wits and Wagers in that it allows know it alls a chance to show off (something I consider very important) whilst not actually guaranteeing them a win.

I'm terrible at this game because I'm not a history buff. I don't care what year things happened in. And as for relative timeframe, I invariably get a number of relatively short timeframe splits on my 'board', and I often have no way to know where exactly my next card fits. I'm often taking a 50-50 guess. And of course, it feels even worse when other people get  things that are much more obvious, or occurred nowhere near the cards they already have. Maybe if you are into history and trivia, then this game is for you.

A trivia game that works. It's quick, it's interesting and everyone seems to like it. Most trivia games I've played require at least one correct answer in each category. If you don't like sports, or geography, this game won't punish you unduly for that. In addition, this game opens for more reasoning, as opposed to there being just the one right answer to a question. I like it.

This game is an absolute classic and I wish more people talked about it. It's one of my top choices for a filler almost any time we look for one. Tons of educated guessing, learning, and table engagement. Your group builds a narrative of saying, "Wasn't that thing invented way later than we thought? Or was it way earlier..." And then always guessing in the wring direction. It feeds a trivia itch without having to have an encyclopedic brain!

I can see why it gets a low rating. It is a very family type game. But for all that, it's a simple fun concept, and actually you don't have to have an enclopaedic knowledge of history - just common sense and a smattering of timeline.
And it's good fun, really it is. Doesn't drag (30 min game) with a few highs and lows in there.

Creating your own timeline makes this different from many Q&A trivia games, and has the added bonus of making later slots more difficult to fill, since there are more options for where to put your card and generally narrower time gaps in which to fill them. This also helps the game from having a runaway leader problem. We often play to 15 cards, rather than 10, to add more challenge and give more opportunity to catch up.

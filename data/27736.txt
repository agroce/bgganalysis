I have everything printed out and some of the tokens cut out, just need to glue the board parts to a sturdier base than the cardstock I printed them out on.  [update] Played Nate's copy at Phantom of the Attic, and it was as good a game as I'd hoped it would be.  He self-laminated the map and the items, which I'm going to do as well.  Definitely need to finish making my version now--glad I had a chance to play it!  We played with 6, and it was tense--I can't believe how hard this game is.  Two of us died and then the remaining four holed up in the cellar...which was fine, until the lights went out and they burst through the barricade.  After Jen's hammer got grabbed, it was just a matter of time until we all succumbed to the horde that poured down the steps with no end in sight!  

Awesome, awesome, awesome game--why is it not available commercially?  I would buy this in a heartbeat, and I know others would as well.  I guess its up to everyone else to make their own copies and proselytize to their friends!

Maybe we were not playing this right, but we were quite underwhelmed. Maybe I just expected too much, but it feels like a game that is almost there. There is a lot of chrome and some good ideas. The conga lines of zombies became a bit much. Move all those damn zombies annoyed everyone at the table. Still there were laughs to be had.I enjoyed seeing a propane tank and can of gas blow up in the middle of the house killing dozens of the bastards and ignite a conflagration in the middle of the house.

The BEST Zombie themed game hands down! Excellent design of the pieces , simple enough to grasp within a few minutes and yet deep enough feel as though you are in amongst the living dead fighting for your life.  My zombiephile buddy and I played with our bored-to-tears-of-zombie-talk wives who LOVED the game and the co-operative aspect to it.

Can't wait to play again!

I did enjoy printing/making this game, but I find that it just took way too long.  Too much zombie moving.  This game while not really a broken game has way too much rule deciphering.  It hurt my head.  I will try again to break it out and house rule/ simplify.  there is just too much to keep track of.  It does have something going for it.  It came out attractive enough, especially for being a print and play.

RATING: 7
DIY version. Fun game. Almost TOO many zombies come at you, but that is what makes it challenging. Every game I have played has been a co-op style game. The rules need a little fleshing out, as the 'sandbox' style of play leaves a lot of grey areas for the players to make rulings on during play.

House rule: When you find a gun, you get 1d6 ammo with it... for rounds left in the chamber.

Favorite DoN Moment: My sister turned into a zed, so my wife shot her in the head... and apologized profusely.

Only real complaint is the rules, yes they are cute and funny, but when it comes down to finding something I find it terrible. I have gone through and retyped them into a usable formate. GeekMail me if you want a copy.

This is the game you should play if you want to recreate the survivor horror depicted in classic zombie (eg Romero) films. 

You must deal with real constraints: you can't walk through walls, your weapons break, you can carry or hold only so many things, it is dangerous to fight zombies hand to hand, injuries slow you down, it sometimes can take a while to find certain things (eg fuel) that are necessary to escape the undead.

The zombies are 'realistic' too, in that they replicate the movement of natural plagues. Zombies move like hunger, like moths to light; they do not anticipate or react, they do not hunt or trap. They simply gravitate towards living human flesh. Like infections and plagues, zombies grow steadily in numbers until there is no escaping them. In a game of DoN I often step back and wonder how the hell are we going to escape so many zombies. 

The game captures another element of survivor horror: how survivors deal with each other in a situation where safety is a scarce commodity. There are 5 of us, and only 4 can fit in this car. We can't survive without each other, but in the end I need to look out for myself. There is less dead weight slowing me down, and fewer mouths to feed, if I can escape in the car alone (once you help me get to the car and start it). To paraphrase a friend, the strategic dimension of the game is in knowing when to help and hinder other players so that you win the most victory points without exposing yourself to unmanageable risk.

Everything in Dead of Night works together to give the game little or no "gamey" elements. The rules do not get in the way of the game experience, or create an artificial situation in which someone would do something to win even though it doesn't make sense thematically or realistically. This is facilitated by the game's main rule which originally was the *only* rule: if it can happen in real life (or in a classic Romero film...no ninja zombies here!) it can happen in the game. By putting the film genre in the foreground of the design, Simon Spearing gave players a great way to resolve any rule ambiguities on the spot without stepping out of the headspace of the game. Dead of Night has an RPG feel. 

[b]Plays best with 3-4 players. Game length is 2.5 - 3 hours per game so far.[/b] 
 [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3016422#3016422]Here is a description of how I made a nice version of the game[/url]. See the images section of the DoN page and my gallery for pictures.

I made a CD for this using music from City of the Dead, various 1970s Italian horror films, and some tracks from Phantasm.

I now play with the following rules changes :

1. Items may only be picked up at the cost of 1 of your Movement Points.
2. When zombies are to enter play, roll for each of the Skull Icons. A zombie won't enter on a 1-2.
3. No more than 2 zombies or players per square.
4. You need fuel to start a fire. The fuel canister or a molotov will do.
5. All fires spread. Fires do not go out unless you use a fire extinguisher. Fire spreads one square per turn in a direction determined by a die roll.
6. The Fire Axe gets a +3 against people, but +4 against inanimate objects like walls.

I flip back and forth between this and Zombie Plague as my favorite zombie-themed game. DoN is more of a simulation, while ZP is more gamey.

Initial Rating: 9.5 (October 2011)

I love zombie games so I was sure I was going to like Dead of Night but when I played the game I was pleasantly surprised. The game is awesome, it can rival Last Night on Earth as best zombie game ever..... It is perhaps the hardest zombie game I have played, the atmosphere is so gloom you already feel lost. The only down for me is that as it can have so many zombies at the same time (this is definitively a plus) the zombie movement phase can be a hassle, imagine to move 100+ zombies every turn…… :S  other than that the game is pure gold.

I love that the game is semi cooperative, you need your mates to survive but you can win alone. :D  Also your items can broke down and you can carry only a limited amount of Items, melee against zombies is way too dangerous as it should be (but this is the only zombie game I have played that emulate this effect); in short this is the more realistic (or as realistic as a zombie game can get) zombie game I have played.

I have to make a better copy of this great great game, if you are a fan of the Zombie genre look no further, you have found one (if not THE ONE) of the best the genre can offer.

Have to play again soon :D

It’s been a long time since I last played Dead of Night. I was a different person then so I’m thinking I won’t like the game as much today. Playing again the game is kind of difficult as the friend who had it moved away from town and I’m not the kind of person to do Print N plays.

All things considered, I have fond memories of the game, however I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

If I play the game again, I will re comment on it

All time best zombie game around.  The only game that really captures the atmosphere of a last stand against zombies.  All seems hopeless, but everyone fights on none the less no matter how hopeless the situation seems.  Desperate heroics abound as well as crazed acts of desperation.  Nothing worse than having someone crash your vehicle in a desperate act to kill a handfull of zombies.  Also holding the zombies at bay with your trusty lawnmower only to have a sudden power failure.  This is one of those games that just doesn't get old.  It's random elements add uncertainty to the game without making you feel as if your not in control.  No zombie game deserves a 10 more than this gem.

Very cool game. My only problem with it is the number of zombies (in the hundreds) that must be moved later in the game. Very accurately creates the dark, suspenseful atmosphere of the best zombie movies, where the humans are outnumbered and experience a nightlong series of such ups and downs of finding ammo, breaking a weapon, barricading the last window of a room just in time, searching the cellar and finding a zombie or two already there, power suddenly coming on shedding a little helpful light, zombies breaking through a barricade, finding that medical kit, the power going out... GOOD NEWS! A police patrol has just arrived with guns and they are shooting zombies like crazy! We're saved!! BAD NEWS! The police patrol was just overwhelmed after taking out 10 zombies... but that is only 10 out of about 230 zombies surrounding the house and still intent on eating our brains... "I don't think we can make it 'til dawn."

Print and Play--was pretty disappointed with the first play, seems to lack a lot of tension and it's not really fun to just get stuck surrounded by zombies with no way to fight back effectively, although the combat rules are ingenious, if you can find a weapon.  I need to give this one another chance with fewer players and a different scenario.  We played with 6 the first time and it was too slow between turns.

It's a fun game.  My only complaint was that it seems like it's WAY too hard to kill zombies out in the open.  The game we played, we only survived by boarding ourselves up in the shed.  I mean in the movies, people run around gathering supplies while fighting off zombies right?  It should be hard to fight multiple zombies in the open, not suicidal.

This game is well worth the time to make a nice copy. Sometimes there are so many zombies on the board they are a pain to move, but at least it provides a true feeling of being overwhelmed.

It is fun solo as well as with others.
Scales great from 1-6.

One of my longest lasting gaming memories comes from this game. I was bit by a zombie just as we found the keys to the van in the garage. One doesn't become a zombie immediately, but eventually it happens. despite my impending "change" my wife couldn't leave me and let me in the car. We drove to safety (and a win), but what happened later? It was funny and also genuinely touching. We still bring it up from time to time. Too fun.

Update:  Rating holds, but I find myself intentionally bypassing it when it comes time to pick a game.  I fear it will fall in the future. It is because my homemade copy is not up to par components-wise.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Being as I've fully printed, laminated and cut out the entire game I feel I can put this as an "owned" game now.  :)  

Dead of Night is pretty cool no doubt about it. It's more of a gamer's zombie game though, I wouldn't suggest trying to introduce this to non-gamers especially if you intend on using the fire rules. The rulebook as written is atrocious to try and find information in. It's all there sure enough but finding it when you need it...well that's another thing altogether. Still fun game.

The game designer did a great job here.  The health, storage and combat/surround mechanics are all brilliant while also being intuitive (i.e. the relationship of current health to what die roll is required for all sorts of actions).  The game is infinitely configurable and won't get too repetitive.  Only negative is the sheer number of zombie figurines (i.e. moving them is a chore) but what else would you expect in a zombie apocalypse?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun to play, but the rules are a bit unpolished and in some parts not too clear. Moving all the zombies can also take a while towards the end of a scenario, but still: it's good.

I really wanted to love this game and rate it a 10, especially after all the time and money I spent on it. In the end I would say the fact that the rules are somewhat unclear and confusing takes away from the game. Might be a bit too openended for me. What is also frustrating is accessing all the components needed (trouble with webpage). Game is fun though and I love the sense of impending doom that is present throughout.

Update 1/9/10: Got v4 of the rules and all scenarios. Have now played the game 4-5 times and feel like I have a much better grasp. Main con now is the tedious movement of the zombies in later rounds.

Possibly the best Zombie game in existence.

True Survival horror, where you must co-operate with other players and work as a team if you are to survive the hoard of living dead that this game literally throws at you.

A lot of thought, time & effort has gone into this one man effort, which is leaps and bounds ahead of any of the commercially available zombie themed games out there. It's a crying shame no publisher has picked this up.

[u]IMHO it needs the following slight tweaks:

[b]1.[/b] Items may only be picked up at the cost of 1 of your Movement Points.

[b]2.[/b]  When zombies are to enter play, roll for each of the Skull Icons. A zombie enters on the roll of 3-6 only.[/u]

RATING: 7
Interesting merger of auctions (via route building) and area control. I think having the pieces be of different length, but quasi-hidden works in this context; I have enough information to make informed decisions, but not so much that it falls apart. The game excels when it's viewed as an auction first and area control second (though no less important, just in that order). The two incentive cards are ok (and just ok), I find some of them (the 3 in a row for example) to be much easier to complete and worthwhile to setup capture traps compared to others (the fountain one in particular I thought was tough and generally not worth effort). The district/color card is more interesting and I think is an example where you start to have real player differentiation in space valuation. As other's have said, the board is attractive enough to enjoy and annoying enough that I want to redo it (but am apathetic toward due to the former). I've only played with four so I don't know how my rating would change with less.

One of the few games where immediate repetition is valuable and improves the game, without it, you don't seem to develop enough of a meta surrounding how to trap people and what they value (which slowly changes over time in response to others). One of the most delightful spaces in terms of trying to put people into unpleasant situations and watch them squirm balanced against straight point efficiency.

Interesting take on a placement game, with hidden objectives and multiple ways to score.

The gameplay starts with each player being secretly dealt two different objectives: 1) a unique colour region, where a player scores 2 points for each region they "own" (they have a building placed on that region at the end of the game), and 2) a unique placement condition where the points awarded vary depending on the particular condition but awarded each time the condition is met (again by having your own buildings placed in a particular way at the end of the game).  

Once the game begins, a player's turn consists of placing one of their own buildings on one of the areas in a particular district.  Each player in turn can either pass or place a higher value building, and this continues until each player finally passes, with the last player leaving their largest value building on the board.  All previously placed buildings are removed and the winning player chooses a new spot on which to place another building.  In addition to the hidden goal placement objectives, several of the spaces on the board are seeded (randomly at the beginning of the game) with different point chits- there are 1 pt subway tokens which award the valuable 3pt subway card, there are -1 pt tokens which also give the "hot potato" -2 pt card, and there are the valued 3 pt chits.  If you win a placement on a region with the chit, you obtain the chit.

The game ends when one player has placed all of their buildings.  There is one other scoring goal and that is to have the largest building in a neighborhood (similar to Manhattan) which is worth 5 pts.  The game scales very well from 2-4 players, and quick to play.  It allows for clever play, and offers and interesting bidding/placement mechanic which looks similar to Manhattan but plays quite differently. The board art is garish and difficult to look at which is probably my biggest complaint with the game.  Seems to get a bit better with more plays.

Own the [boardgame=150634]Extension Cards[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=47156]Ystari Box[/boardgame], and the PnP Characters expansions.

Mildly interesting bidding game. You bid by sticking buildings of varying values on different spaces; whoever sticks down the best building keeps it there, while everyone else takes back their buildings and then you start another bidding round. Meh.

A beautiful abstract chain placement game. My friend is right, this feels like a Rudiger Dorn title. My one complaint is that the first part of the game felt really slow. I feel like there were so many potential places to play that we would spend too long analyzing. I think the first half of the game should be played quickly, focusing on getting your specific color of property. Once it starts to fill up, the game gets more exciting, and a little more time spent figuring out your move is warranted. All in all, I really enjoy this. Until I get better at it I will probably prefer two or three players as opposed to four, just to make the game go a little faster.

LIKE: In my first play, I really enjoyed this. Very unique spacial auction that offered some interesting choices.

DISLIKE: It was difficult to see the obvious moves of taking something because it was blocked off. This is where first player advantage helped.

OVERALL: Impressed, similar to Knizia-style games. I'd love to see this reprinted and expanded with more end scoring cards. The game needs one more layer in the gameplay to keep it fresh and replayable.

This is a bidding game at heart - with hidden scoring. It reminds me in some ways of Golden City, but is more stream lined and clear in its intent. It looks nice - although the board is questionable in clarity and design. I like the pacing and the smart conflict in bidding for zones. Also, there's a good deal of thinking in which tile to plop down and where that will push your opponents. Fun little abstract.

Wild looks combined with smooth gameplay. After Caylus and Mykerinos I expected this game to be another wooden cube frenzy from Ystari. But I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of some "in your face" action, Metropolys is a very relaxing bidding experience. And yes, you don't have to collect resources and turn 'em into VPs.

It's ok, but I'm used to a lot more from Ystari.  I have enjoyed all of their previous efforts a lot more than this.  Quite simply, many of the ideas in here have been done better elsewhere (hidden tasks, area control, bidding etc).

I like the theme and I like the wooden pieces, but the board is confusing.

It does play well, and I would certainly play it again, but imo, there are mnay games that fill a 40 minute slot better.

A fun area control, goal-oriented auction game.  Interesting mechanics that work well together.  Only complaints are with regard to balancing.  (And the board is a bit dark.)  If the balance among the area objectives were addressed, this would probably be a 9.  Even so, it's a good game.

Lowered from an 8 to a 7 (9/24/08).  I've become more and more reluctant to pull this one out.  The balancing is a big issue.  It's hard to get excited about this game, despite my attraction to it, [i]because[/i] it is so unbalanced in a few ways (the different scoring & values therefor, the suggested start arrangement of tokens).  Plus, gameplay can drag at times, particularly with the AP.

I wish the balancing were addressed because I feel like this could have been a really good game.  I know I like it, it's just that it's not sucking me in like it should.

This was almost a blind buy because my girlfriend picked the box up and said it looked interesting. The cheapskate in me won out and I went home to research Metropolys. It turns out that the game looked decent, so I couldn't pass up the chance to buy a game that might be initiated by my girlfriend.

After our first play of it I came away thinking "That was cool". After our second play I thought "Wow, this game has more decisions than I originally thought".

Five games in and I am hooked. I think this game is so fun. It's good for gamers and non-gamers alike. I enjoy watching the board fill up, deducing everyone's goals, and "combo"ing out by vomiting the rest of my buildings onto the board. The rules are clever, the scoring is clever, the game is top notch. Definitely will be playing this for years to come.

2-4(4)

You know, I don't think I was expecting a whole lot, but this is a pretty good game.

There's not a whole lot there: five district-type goals and five "advanced" goals (really, the "Two Games in One" bullshit is kind of silly because I can't imagine really having to resort to it, but whatever. Also, there's just a pretty simple random setup of reward tokens. Again, not a whole lot there.

Still, it's a really nice implementation of an auction with a meaningful spatial element, in that the districts up for auction get directed in certain ways. There's a certain bluffing / push-your-luck element in bidding on certain districts (even if you don't want them, etc.). And a certain amount of gamesmanship in the bidding as well.

Only issues are that the hidden objectives will often pretty quickly not be so hidden, which removes a lot of the bluffing and gamesmanship. It's much less tense if you know an opponent is bidding honestly or defensively. This doesn't necessarily ruin the bidding because you'll still be trying to bid on your own behalf, but does flatten an interesting element. Another issue is that, especially late, there can be a cascading element to the game. Actually, it's really reminiscent of Big Two or Tichu or whatever. If you have a lot of buildings valued higher than others you can grab a bunch of districts and with dead ends that have been created you can even ditch some of your lower valued buildings. This is sometimes anticlimactic, but it's also a pretty key element of strategy.

RATING: 8
The spatial element to the bidding is cleverly done.  It's important to recognise dead end areas and put yourself in a position to gain them cheaply.  Tension mounts during the game as players run short of buildings to bid with and placement options diminish. The hidden agendas bring a good degree of variability.  Metropolys offers surprising bang for the buck of a low complexity game.

Metropolys would be a hackneyed city building game if the theme was any more than the lightest dusting.  I find the board artwork ugly and some people I've played with have had difficulties recognising the smallest areas.

RATING: 6.5
Auction game with a very interesting bidding system. Players are building houses in various locations on the board. Each player has from the start of the game 2 hidden goal cards that will give him points if he builds in the correct locations. The game is highly interactive and there is room for smart plays. I dont like the colours on the board. Sometimes it is difficult to tell lakes form river. 

Good game I would gladly play it again.

This is a great game.  The rules are so simple that there really seems to be no noticeable learning curve, and yet the game offers surprising depth.  Each choice in the game feels extremely important, and the game plays in about 30 minutes.  Plus, there seems to be some unique things going on in the game that you really can't find anywhere else.  Definitely worth the purchase!  Oh, and I don't mind the board so much.  I don't necessarily like it, but I don't dislike it.

UPDATE (05/10/2014): While I don't discount anything I said earlier, I do think it's worth mentioning that this game seemed a little overpriced for what you get in the box.  Don't get me wrong--the game is awesome.  It's just that, by comparison with my other game purchases over the years, I believe I overpaid in terms of the components that came inside the box.

RATING: 7
This game takes the basic notion of bidding and couples it with physical space to create a game experience that is unique and challenging.  Add to this the hidden objectives that drive players to take the bidding to specific locations and heights (literally) and you have a really good game.  Game play feels much like Ys in level of thinking and planning.  The graphics in the game are appealing and fit the style, but can be difficult to discern in some situations.  While the basic game is presented for families, there is really no reason for it.  Any family that would pick up the title in the first place is well prepared to handle the 'advanced' game.

Lovely swift playing game, which can place you for some agonizing decisions. Hard for new players to know how to value certain areas, but easy to start to recognize this while playing.

RATING: 9
This is a very unique Auction game with a spatial/area-control element, which create some very interesting and tense decisions. It's also a game with hidden goals but one that provides enough concrete information that players are often able to deduce what the goals are mid-way through the game.  And despite having an "expert" version, the game is fairly simple and provides a fluid/quick experience. 

That being said, the game isn't without criticism. First, setting up the board randomly can create some wonky situation, which may prove to be an advantage/disadvantage to certain players. But the biggest issue is with the game-board, which has a dated/muted look and makes it slightly difficult to read the board. 

But if you like auction games you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It's such a unique/interesting experience that I hope another publisher re-prints it and gives it a facelift. Excellent design.

Very nice interpretation of the Goa auction phase to develop a whole game.  Only played in the basic way, I have found it to be a very interesting, enjoyable and original game.  Secret objectives can be kept secret, this works fine.  Tokens are really nice, and the board needs some time to get used to it, but I like it.  Box cover is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.
UPDATE: After three games in basic way, I have been really delighted with the change to the standard game.  Much more difficult objectives, much more interesting auctions, much better a game.  Lovely.
UPDATE: Played for the first time with the expansion cards.  It changes quite a lot, since the expansion conditions are quite difficult.  Nice way of changing the view of the game.

I didn't like two things here (just my preferences):
1) The game very much rewards counting your next couple of moves in advance (especially near the end), I found it tiresome, I rather like games in which players use more of their intuition instead of strict counting.
2) I don't enjoy games in which the large part is put on how well you spot things on the board (think Metro) - here this is very important part of the game.

I generally appreciate Ystari games, and Metropolys is no exception: it is almost a bare bone auction game à la Ra, but has an element of spatiality that sets it apart, so it deserves a place inside the collection.

The gameplay is straightforward: in turn players place (higher numbered than the previous) buildings on the board until no one wants or no one can raise the "bid". The winner of the bid claims the zone and leaves the building on the board, and all other buildings return to respective owners. Rinse and repeat until one player exhausts his reserve of building.

Three things are very interesting:
1. The new "bid" must be placed in an empty space adjacent to the previous highest bid, so clever play can force decisions based on spatial positioning.
2. There's a double structure of incentives: one hidden (objective cards) and one open (bonus or malus tokens). This simple structure forces players in slightly divergent paths to accumulation of victory points, creating another layer of tension.
3. There's a final scoring based on majorities in each district, for a further layer of incentives.

A note on components: the board is not the most pleasant, but is functional enough. The buildings/bidding pieces are among my favorites of all time!

A great game, that may be my favorite abstract ever!

Easy to learn.  Good for both non-gamers and gamers.  There is plenty of stuff to think about, yet decent choices can be made without much analysis/planning.  I traded it because I was annoyed at the difficulty of making an initial setup that was balanced and/or random, and having this entirely left out of the rules.  But that's just OCD of me.

With 2, there is a lot of blocking areas and setting up combos to try to get rid of your pieces as fast as possible if you think you have the lead. With 4, the game is much more chaotic and you can pretty much forget about getting any of your secret points cards done. I like it! Thank you Jay for the quick response and sending me the missing piece. The game is great with 4 players!

The bidding element to the game is very neat.  It's a bit slow to start I've found but after people start placing a few of their pieces it gets more interesting and strategic.  The game plays very smoothly and the secret objectives add a bit of deduction + deception to the mix as well.

Good looking building game with an interesting bidding mechanism. The secret goals combined with the open goals make for difficult decisions throughout the game. Family version is great when playing with younger children. Real gamers will want to play the advanced game.

Roaming auctions? What a brilliant idea. I love how the value of each bid changes for every player. Every step the auction takes completely shifts what the next person is bidding on. Is that next space worth your bid? Is it worth bidding just to stop the previous bidder from claiming the previous spot? If you do bid, will you be setting up the next person's bid in a valuable spot? That's 3 really interesting dilemmas that you will be faced with every single time your turn comes around. There's even more, but I just used those as examples. I've never played a game that felt anything like this. I would love to play this game more in order to explore the subtle strategies I can see hiding in there. My only reservation, and the reason I won't rush out to buy it, is the fact that with all those little decisions on each bid I foresee it bringing out analysis-paralysis. Several members of my family (my usual gaming opponents) suffer from this already, and throwing a game at them where there are so many little things to think about tends to just magnify the situation. However, with the right opponents, this game is not only original but lots of fun.

Meropolys has simple rules, but with depth and substance all in a quick playtime. The unique bidding mechanic allows for clever play and keeps the game tense. The hidden agenda cards and various victory point conditions give the game replay-ability and longevity. An enjoyable game that feels fresh despite it's dated look.

Abstract and dry.  The auction "chain" mechanism (similar to Goa) is interesting, but I find the gameplay annoying.  I don't like bidding on something that I don't want with the hope of leading the chain toward something that I do want.  Metropolys is probably okay or good for people who like abstracts.  I prefer Goa which has more Euro-game stuff going on... and you aren't forced to buy something that you put in the auction chain.

I generally like hidden objective cards, but the one for surrounding the statues is frustrating; it is just exceedingly difficult to accomplish based on the competition for neighborhoods.  Perhaps surrounded statues should be worth more than 7 points.

A clever twist to the auction mechanic is the basis of this game. I like the way it goes and I hope it lasts. You place buildings of a higher value than the preceeding player or drop out. That's the auction part. There's special tokens that give VPs and secret objectives to meet. Quite a nice game.

I really like hidden agendas (goals) and the bidding mechanism in this game is very interesting.  Every game I've played, someone always amazes me in how they can work some end game auctions always to their favor (due to their crafting of board position early in the game).  Unfortunately that amazing player has never been me!  I need to play this one more so I can get better at it... or perhaps realize that I don't like as much as I think I do! ;-)

RATING: 7.5
Se trata de un juego de subastaas en el que no se utiliza dinero. Al principio de la partida cada jugador recibe unos objetivos secretos que le informan de cómo debe colocar sus edificios para obtener puntos al final de la partida. Después de esto, cada jugador en su turno, coloca un edificio en la ciudad. Los edificios están numerados del 1 al 13. Pues bien, al colocar un edificio se inicia una subasta.. por la cual, el siguiente jugador, puede colocar un edificio de mayor valor en una zona adyacente al solar que ocupó el edifico anterior. Además, por la ciudad hay repartidos puntos adicionales (positivos y negativos) en forma de counters. 

Juego extremadamente sencillo de explicar y de jugar y con una profundidad y carga estratégica muy interesante. Altamente recomendable.

Me lo trajeron los reyes en 2012, en casa de Javi y Patri. Todo un acierto.

I really enjoyed this game.  The rules are very simple, yet the bely a deeper heart.  Players need to be very careful of the buildings they 'spend', and need to make sure that they get 'value for money'.  While this may seem like a really pared down bidding game, in reality it is quite a deep and rich bidding game, with a very simple set of rules.

All in all an excellent game.

UPDATE: Played the advanced game. It was OK.

For me, this is a classic, disposable, OK game. I've enjoyed it, I might play it again, and while it's rather clever and unique, there isn't a *whole* lot there and the play is quite abstract and a little tricky at times and it tends to turn on a small number of high-stakes plays rather than game-long competance, so I'm not quite drawn back to it. It was compared to Manhattan, and while I think Manhattan is a much better game in most terms and better for playing with younger gamers, mixed groups, or casual gamers, Metropolys is probably better if you've got an exclusively gamer crowd.
---
If you read my comments for Ystari games, you'll find I don't generally like them. But I found Metropolys fairly entertaining. It looks like sort of a bidding game, and there is a bidding element, but like all Ystari games it's primarily highly tactical. I liked Metropolys more because unlike the other Ystari games, it's not horribly overwrought and is pretty clean so it can be tactically interesting without the multi-dimensional insanity (and inherent wild imbalance) of games like Ys or Caylus.

I played the "basic" game and see no real need to move on to the "advanced" game. It seems like the advanced game would make it more like a traditional Ystari game, i.e., hopelessly overwrought. But I could be talked into trying it.

Like all Ystari games though, Metropolys is badly theme-deficient.

Can't say I've ever really played a game like this one, and I'm not even sure how I'd explain it.  It's a neat twist on bidding, where you're trying to win certain locations on the board to score you points.  The trick is that every time a bid is increased, the current area of the board to be won changes, so you're trying to snake the bids across the board in such a way that you have a chance to win the areas of the board that you need.  I think you just have to play it to understand it!  While I didn't find the game to be all that exciting, it was refreshing to play something that didn't feel like a rehash of something else.

Clever tile laying/auction game.  The auction values develop through the game as certain properties are developed.  A clever tile layer will manoeuvre his opponent into very difficult auction positions.

This one surprised me - it's a very good "auction" game with an area control mechanic. It's quite interesting and you always face some tough decisions! You are able to push other people and constantly have to consider what to do, especially when you have to consider your hidden goals, which I think add a lot to the game. It's a good game which doesn't remind me of any other so-called auction game, and even though I'm not really good at it, it's fun and can be played in 30-45 minutes.

This is a great auction/bluffing game. The game concept itself is very simple and easy to teach. There's always zero luck as almost everything is open information (beside objective)

The main criticism is that there ae limited objectives and it is a bit easy to guess what the secret objectives are but that makes it more interesting sometimes to block and be generally annoying. Also the objectives are not very balanced I understand that the points awarded are different to balance it out, but even then it's not the most balanced. I guess being two players make it easier to stuff someone up unlike 3 or 4 players.

 Having spatial thinking definitely help in the game. Definitely underrated. 

I think this is a great 2/3/4 players game.

Metropolys is one of the best light- to medium-weight games I own. And, I know I'm saying that despite the fact that it is not an incredibly popular game. It is a game though that "scratches many itches" for me, with interesting spatial positioning on the board and one of the most intriguing ways to implement an auction that I've run across. The result is a heck of a lot of "game" in a relatively straightforward and simple set of rules. 

In Metropolys, each player has a set of buildings valued 1 to 13. To "bid" you place a building on the board, and the next player can overbid by placing a higher value building in an adjacent spot. The bidding ends when everyone passes or if there's no empty spaces adjacent. It's that last point that makes the board critical.

My wife and I have played this a number of times. In one game, she made a crushing move to end the game, dropping her last six buildings without even letting me intervene, even though I had a "13" building. That kind of move is only possible with this wonderful combination of auctions and spacial element.

...and what's all this about the vomit-ugly board? I won't call it gorgeous, but it's far from the hideous monster that some people are reporting. The delicious and tough choices make my brain hurt--not the board color. I'm not sure what the fuss is about.

RATING: 4.5
Cute, modestly clever, more than a little opaque and has some nice edge and painful corners lines with extortion -- all things to like.  The hidden used player pieces are perfectly trackable and thus entirely unjustifiable: just expose every player's pieces to review and allow free board examination.  The hidden goals are silly and probably not justifiable.  I suspect the game would play better if they were also exposed.

The claimed playtime of 30 minutes is a joke.  Expect to spend at least 90 minutes.  The game is worthy of that level of thought.

The published art is just good enough that reverting to a home-made version of the prototype art is not worth it, but that's not saying much.

Rating may rise with additional plays to somewhere in the 7-7.5 range but is unlikely to go higher.

Rating raised to 7.5 for the simple reason that I still have little idea of how to play this well, and yet I seem to play it well and win often.  This is perplexing and even irritating.  I wish I had some clue as to how to play this game -- a clue I understood well enough to verbalise.

Update: Rating dropped to 6 and likely to fall further.  Perilously close to not being a game.

April 21, 2009 -- Perhaps one of the more bizarre and ugly game boards around, but it's still designed well enough to get the gist of what's what. However, it's the gameplay that truly shines. It requires a lot of thought, and you have to keep in mind that you need to run out of pieces but in a way that nets you points for your scoring cards.

The one nagging feeling I have in the back of my head is that I've played something else very much like this before. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves me with the feeling that Metropolys isn't all that unique. Still, for an abstract thinker, it's worth checking out. 7/10

Ystari did it again. I'm giving them a minor free pas with regard to the board being a little garrish. Other than that I love the simplicity (by far the simplest ystari game). The rules are simple, and there is zero randomness after setup, but there are many tough decisions to make. Has a bit of a Manhattan feel. People will say the game had bidding (as do the rules), but it's so different from people think of as bidding that it does the game a disservice to even use that word. Secret objectives keep the game from bogging down early, and by the end of the game you can tell what everyone's objectives are, but it doesn't really matter by that point. It's a pretty quick game, which for me is nice.

Metropolys is a subtle bidding game which, especially in the advanced version, can induce a lot of min-maxing on the part of the players as there are many contrary options to consider. Do you take your losses to avoid someone else from gaining an important foothold? Do you sacrifice a large building to consolidate a position here and now? As such, it packs a pleasant amount of punch for its rather simple appearance. In some vague way it reminds me of Ra or League of Six—there's a similarity in bidding amounts up to a certain limit but knowing that you will lose bidding power in doing so; plus that different areas are rated differently for different players. The game is definitely more interesing in the advanced version as the relic-tiles can take on positive values as well, otherwise they are just blind areas you really would do well to avoid. It is precisely the extra amount of options which give Metropolys the little extra bite it needs.

However, there has been some nagging doubt as to whether the assignment cards are properly balanced. Take for example the card which nets you five points for having 3 buildings around a lake. It is [i]very difficult[/i] to get any meaningful amount of points from that, especially if you must block others from gathering around statues or forming strings of buildings. There simply are not many neighbourhoods on which you can end a 'bid', and your bidding options are limited: basically place the highest of your buildings on the right area. The rules indicate that you must try to 'read' an opponent, and this sort of thing is a dead giveaway, allowing others to easily block you. If you have another assignment, you can afford to let others guess longer. I'm not really sure I like the idea of the players to guesstimate what their opponents do as a requirement for the game to be balanced properly.

What also gets to me is the garish design, however. The box is beautiful, but apparently money was gone at that point. The board is dark, drab, and at times confusing: lakes are hard to distinguish from canals, why on earth are parks [i]yellow[/i], goals on cards need meticulous explanations to point out the proper landmarks and goals, ... . What a corker it would have been would the box art have made it to the interior... Nevertheless, fun and interesting game.

[b]Update[/b] Please Ystari, if you ever reprint this title, [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/48565/simplified-board]this[/url] is what the board should look like.

Seemed to play like this, if the player with the highest building left wanted a location he got, if a "free" location could be taken it was. The little chits offered little or no incentive to placement. The graphics are unpleasant.

Fun little bidding game.  Doesn't really seem like it will work, but it has some interesting ideas.  The blind victory points helps it from dragging, but by the time you figure out what the others are going for, it can become tense.  I liked the art work, but it probably isn't for everyone.

Components: A very visually loud board, but it has a cool Naboo style to the buildings. All the components are well made.

Experience: Very cool. I like the secret missions, collecting (or avoiding) the various tokens, maneuvering the chain of bids, and managing my building supply. Starts out seeming arbitrary and extremely difficult to build in a desirable district, but by mid-game it is extremely tense.

Clever limited resource placement game. Some very nice ideas here, such as how you can force plays from other players to kill off their higher-priced towers. However, the game loses a little when you throw in the Secret Array Of Buildings and the Secret Colored Space scoring mechanisms. In one game, two thirds of the green spaces had negative point chits on them, dinging me for points out of the gate. Otherwise, this game would rate an 8 or even a 9.

I liked the idea of how the auctions worked, but the basic game was a bit flat.  It was a little too easy to work out what the other people were going for.  The goals did not seem to have the ability to keep up with the scoring tokens either.  With that said, I think the game would improve greatly with the advanced game.  I hope to have a chance to try it again and see if the rating improves.

Starting this out at a 7 after one play, but could see lowering it after repeat playings.  It is pretty much an abstract, spacial game.  The towers are a nice touch, but there isn't enough theme in this game to keep me coming back.  I did enjoy my one play and look to improve next time.  However, the player that plays right after the newbie has a huge advantage.  My poor play was able to secure the player to my left an easy victory.  I took the 3rd (experienced) player down with my bad play.  Final score 50-18-18.  :)

Indeed, after 4 plays, lowering it to a 6.  I just never really want to play this game.  It's just a little too dry and the board hurts my eyes.

Players are trying to score points for majorities of buildings in city districts, as well as achieve their hidden agendas.  Solid game with an interesting bidding mechanic - building pieces have bid values printed on them, and are placed on the board.  Higher bids have to be places adjacent to the previous bid, creating a chain effect across the board.  Interesting game - you may not want to win a particular area, but you may want to win to get control back, as the previous winner starts the next auction location.  Easy entry point, but good game play.  Liked it.

Possibly the ugliest game I have ever seen.   The art style isn't the problem as much as the colors and blocky layout.   Quite hideous.   The game itself isn't any better.   Players lay out chains of buildings with higher numbers, borrowing a key element of RA but executing it far less effectively.   There's majority scoring, some positive tokens, some negative tokens.   I was tentative going into this game, after seeing it on Scott Nicholson's show (btw, not sure what he was drinking when he rated this a 9?).   It was actually much worse than I expected.

I thoroughly enjoy this. Strange enough. Nothing special happens in this game, every turn is the same, and although luck doesn't play an explicit role, it does in the shape of the cleverness of the opponent who sits next to you.

This game combines Ra-style bidding, minor route planning, and hidden objective.  It's good in the fact that it's quick but there are a lot of interesting decisions to be made in it's short time frame.  They are not painful AP inducing decisions, but interesting ones nonetheless.  This is a really fast game and it has a family version and expert version which makes this a great family/gateway game.  As for the caveats, some have complained about the visuals of the board and while it's true everything is not as clear as it could be it's not something that would keep me from purchasing this title.  In addition to that, people complain the secret objectives are not balanced and I partially feels this way.

Fun game- Rules are short (you either propose to build by placing one of your pieces adjacent to the one just placed or pass), it did not clarify if you go over buildings that have won the proposal in previous rounds going straight or that building ends bidding (proposals), this was our first game and we played that you go over them to next empty city- We still had a lot of fun with it. 

Edit:  Just saw a video by "Boardgames With Scott" and the buildings do create a dead end and bidding stops.  Yay!   We will be playing more now with correct rules.  It’s a really good family game.

Have only played a couple of 2-player games and I like it well enough. Nothing great but the bidding mechanic is unique and provides entertainment with bluffing and second-guessing. The secret goals are rather transparent in 2-player play but that's just the way that goes.

Played again today and now discover that the initial set-up in the illustration is NOT an initial set-up, it's only for illustration. Because in the picture, the blue zones have all the -1 tokens and the red zones have all the +3 tokens. Which means the game does need a balanced set-up somehow. Will not down-grade my rating yet, but tempted to after today.

Very enjoyable game, just my sort of thing. Very quick to play, some tricky but simple decisions, got faster as the game progressed, lots of open information and secret goals, all very visual, just what I like! My only caution is if the game will get dull, but right now, I'm glad I have my own copy.

Light but good with nice bits and a beautiful board.  Good gateway game for auctions and bidding.  Streamlined and simple without being silly.  I'm not a big fan of light games but here's one I like!  Great for families.  I like how the game ramps up at the end- you can't let one player lead play and end the game before you're ready by continuing to place their pieces and keep leading play until all their pieces are gone (a game ending condition).  This threat grows as the board fills up because more dead ends are created that cannot be challenged by other players.  


In my opinion this is a good two player game as well.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's like a spatial Ra.  Love it.  Unequal valuations and discrete bidding pieces with a dash of deduction/bluffing thrown in.  The main difference here between Ra is that competent play in Ra still relies heavily on playing the odds, while in Metropolys the other players are the biggest factor especially if you're able to deduce what their scoring card is.

Part of the game is just trying to get rid of your low pieces.  There's this intense tension between grabbing valuable spaces for you early on and holding off because of the greater control you gain the longer you keep your big pieces back.  Wait too long, though, and watch as you get too few pieces out before the game ends.  

Because of the spatial element there's a bit of opportunity for AP, but it still doesn't end up being that long.  It's especially nice when the game plays at a nice clip in about 30 min.  This game just has it all going on.  I love the box art.  The map is fairly heinous, but after a half game, it's as usable as anything else.  What other game can you collect such trendy hats?

I'm not rating this game since it's not published. I only played it once, and we did missed some rules, but it was still very good. It contains a fresh new bidding mechanism where placement is crucial. Moreover, you never know what you will really be auctioning, since the object of the auction changes everytime somebody overbids. Sometime you will bet on a space you don't really want, wishing the auction will be driven towards a space you desperately need. Take my word: this one will be published.

Többször szembetalálkoztam már vele ilyen-olyan fórumokon, de valahogy mindig hidegen hagyott. Most se volt sok kedvem leülni játszani vele. Hatalmasat csalódtam, szerencsére kellemesen. Ennyire szellemes mechanizmussal nagyon rég nem találkoztam. Egymásra kell licitálni, azonban a licitekkel nem csak a "ár" változik, hanem az is, hogy mire licitálunk. Konkrétan azt mondom, hogy nekem egy terület megér 5-öt, akkor a következő játékosnak minimum 6-ot kell ajánlania, igenám, de nem ezért a területért, hanem bármelyik szomszédjáért. Nagyon érdekes helyzeteket szül ez a csavar. 
Amúgy a játék gyorsan tanulható, gyorsan lejátszható, de nagyon agyalós. Azt hiszem be kell szereznem valahonnan.
Sajnos a grafikája kifejezetten nyomasztó.

RATING: 7
Bidding games with a spatial element are nothing unheard of (cf. Big Shot) but Metropolys is rather unusual in the way it combines them. Both your bid and what you bid for are determined by placing your pieces on the board. As there can be only one piece per space and you have to place adjacent to the previous bid you can, for example, move the auction into a dead end to cut the current round short and prevent others from bidding any higher.

The game is fairly easy to grasp and plays rather quickly, yet the scoring is surprisingly opaque. The hidden player goals are only part of the reason why that gut feeling of who is winning and losing can be quite misleading here.

"Metropolys" est un peu à part dans les jeux Ystari. Il ne ressemble à aucun autre et se détache par rapport aux standards de la gamme. Gamme dont je salue en général la qualité, par ailleurs.

Le jeu a une simplicité bienvenue, des mécanismes évidents, d'une fluidité exceptionnelle, les règles sont expliquées très rapidement. Mais, comme souvent dans les jeux de Sébastien Pauchon, cette simplicité s'accompagne d'une grande subtilité, qui permet une approche "famille" mais aussi un niveau de lecture plus élevé qui permet aux "gros joueurs" de prendre du plaisir. Le système d'objectifs cachés lié à celui de buts visibles de tous est très malin, permet à la fois du bluff, du jugement pour voir qui a tel objectif, de l'anticipation (on enchérit rarement à l'endroit où on veut aller) et du contrôle pour éviter de se faire avoir sur le long terme. La manière dont se déroulent les enchères est très visuelle et très futée, apportant là-aussi une grande richesse à un jeu aux mécanismes extrêmement bien huilés et très équilibré.

Je ne sais pas si Fritz Lang en serait fan, mais moi, en tout cas, je l'adore et je prend un réel plaisir à jouer à chaque fois, d'autant qu'une partie est assez rapide.

A nice and simple "auction" game where you place buildings as bids.  The game plays quickly and has some nice strategic choices.  Unfortunately, the board art is horrible for figuring out what district you are in.  Could have been much easy to play with better art.  I like the secret objectives in the advanced game.

I think Metropolys has a lot going for it. It utilizes the bidding mechanic in such an interesting, yet simplistic way that makes game-play fluid while still being a challenge. It is rather difficult having to forward think your plan, but in order to reach your goals you almost have to "bully" the other players around with the way you place your bids. In that regard, it's a somewhat cut-throat game. I like games that require you to read other players and think deeply about their next moves and motives. Its play time is perfect for what it is. Could get more chaotic with a fourth player but I'd like to try. It's easy to lose control in this game, which is frustrating. But when you are able to follow through with your plans, it's quite satisfying.

Fun family game that's got one heck of a busy board. Took me a while to make out where the bridges are and which neighborhoods are adjacent to which. Not a lot of choices in the game, but there's enough to hold interest. The fact that you can teach the rules in 5 minutes makes it another good gateway game.

RATING: 9
The initial impressions are extremely positive.  Metropolys has a unique bidding mechanic (hints of Goa and Ra) that propels the engine of this area control/ hidden agenda game.  Players on turn offer up a proposal for a building by placing a numbered tower on a space, following players either pass, or propose a larger building on an orthogonal district.  This continues until all but one player passes allowing them the right to build that building.  The bidding, like in Ra, allows for some clever play as people can risk bidding slightly higher either to try and push out an opponent or trap them into bidding more than they would like to.  As areas fill in dead ends begin to occur which can be of great use to rid one's self of low numbers.  There are multitudes of ways to generate clever play, and the hidden agendas/ various VP conditions create a nice randomizer for repeat plays and game life longevity.  Metropolys plays quick, offers real choices, presents a fresh bidding mechanic, and supplies real tension.  It finds a nice balance and marriage between strategic and tactical play.

Metropolys is easy to learn and could be an excellent option for a gateway game.  The advanced rules don't bog down the game, and it is recommended one just jump straight into the deep end, rather than fluff the experience with the basic rules. 


A lot of people complain about the garish board art, but I am of the opposite camp.  I find the board to be pleasant and functional.  The only minor issue I have with it is that the lakes and rivers are sometimes hard to discern (too similar in colour), but this only matters if you select the lakes bonus card.  It is also an issue that is fleeting however, and a few turns in presents no problem.

This game combines bidding, strategic placement and area control to gain victory points. Although the game gives you quite difficult choices at times, it is fast and fun. Its main weakness is a board that is "so colorful it hurts the eyes" and that it feels a bit chaotic.

This game comes under a lot of criticism for its art, particularly the board which looks like a well-used artist's palette. Strange considering the art direction on the box and tokens is quite lovely. 

Regardless, there are two things that make Metropolys stand out in a way that I think only a few games--Ra and Speicherstadt come to mind--have and that is simplicity and quickness combined with really tough decisions. You can teach the game in less than 10 minutes and there aren't any crazy exceptions. And then gameplay itself is over and done within 45 minutes or so as it's merely up the ante or pass. Add in the tokens, the battle for height majority, and the secret goal cards, and you've got a really neat little game perfect for the beginning of a game night or a game night cap.

Dry like the desert but probably no luck involved. However rather high replay value as you want to try better next time. The only downside is that it is not greatly balanced. Saying that means that the quicker player will most probably win (this means that even though the game is turn based not all players will be able to play the same amount of their pieces). However once you learned that you will be able to counteract and create turn angst.

The geographical bidding mechanism (to raise a bid you have to also propose changing the building site exactly one space away) is genius, and the standard light Euro scaffolding is... not bad enough to put me off the game, I think?

An area control styled game but really an auction game, Metropolys is a gem of the early generation euro games. Actions are simple. Players increase bids or pass. If all pass, the winning bidder wins the space bid upon and lose that bidding token. Players want to win spaces corresponding to their secret area and alignment objectives. The game is fast, scales well, and is immediately approachable with an unassuming amount of depth. All of this makes for a great game. It's use of aggressive art deco art style may have put many off on initial release. Now, its a wonderful gem to discover from a previous era of game design.

The game is just a sequence of auctions inspired by that mechanic in "Goa". You bid for building spots and bonuses on the board, but each sequential bid must be for an adjacent area. The goal cards make players value different building areas, adding interesting tactical decisions. A minor problem is that it is entirely up to the players to create a balanced setup - not even the provided basic setup does that. Also, there is a big potential for kingmaking.

Really interesting twist on auction games -- the roving spatial bidding movement, when partnered with secret and individual goals as well as area majority, really makes the exercise of valuation very interesting (and impossible to know in a determinate manner). While this is a bit of a mechanical mish-mash, it is very elegant (in that it does so much with so little). Last but not least, it shows the sign of a good game: the tension continues to ramp up all game.

I like how unusual this game is. A sort of auction with a spatial element involved that makes it unlike anything else. However, it seems like the end comes suddenly and unsatisfyingly, with one player being able to chain five or six free spaces together. The resultant windfall can be swingy. Still, I've only played once and suspect it's worth trying again.

Metropolys is a somewhat unique bidding game, with area control and secret goals.

The bidding structure is somewhat similar to Raj, but also somewhat like a climbing game, or even a bit like Goa- players all start with a similar set of 13 building tokens, in three different heights, with ascending numbers.

These are placed in differently colored areas of a city, with 5 areas, lakes, statues, bridges, and a couple of dead-ends, as well as special point tiles scattered evenly across the map. The starting bidder places a first building, and each player gets a chance to outbid the current high by placing a higher point building in an adjacent legal spot, if one exists.

If the winning space has a token, the winner takes it- this can be beneficial or detrimental.

If all players pass, the winner starts a new round. First player to place all their buildings triggers a final point count, based on tokens won, and secret goals completed.

It's logical, fairly abstract, different, and rewards observation, but also creates interesting valuation questions early on: is taking a less effective space worth it to begin the next bidding round, or should you pass for a better opportunity, and let someone else potentially claim now?

My first take was that the Family version was a little mechanical for what it is, but the Advanced version- not all that complicated actually- makes for a much better balanced game.

Revised rating after 5 plays, based on Advanced game play.

Hm. I really like the core mechanism of this game, which felt fresh and thinky to me. In a good way. But all in all, the game failed to live up to my high expectations. The main problem was that while I followed my plans and in that interacted with my opponent, there were no "wow" moves, no "take that", no fire in my mind. So I enjoyed the game as a good abstract with fresh idea, but it wasn't very much fun for me.

Underneath all the boardgame bits this is a trick taking card game. 4 players, 13 buildings each = 52 deck of cards. Of course, trick taking and auctions are kissing cousins. What sets Metropolys apart from most other auction games is the introduction of a spatial element that affects bids. Someone could bid "2" and win even though other people have higher ranked buildings because their exploited the built city to get into a dead end.

This and Modern Art are my two favorite pure auction games.

This game has a couple of problems for me.  First, it's wide open in the beginning, and it makes it hard to bid on things.  You have about four different ways to value things that are being bid on and the whole wide world to do it in.

The second problem I have is with the goals at the end being a bit uneven.  The 3 districts in a neighborhood is just simply too easy to do.

The idea of a 2-dimensional bidding game is an intriguing one and the overly busy board is actually cleverly designed in that more and more 'dead ends' appear as the game progesses. Some vulnerability to the "I didn't see that" effect that can give points away carelessly, and you can ignore any theme, this is strictly an abstract. Interesting, rather than a must buy for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is about what I expected it to be, a rather light, fun game with a very unusual bidding system and plenty of theme for a light Euro.  I enjoyed the building and collecting points (even though I evidently hate history way too much for my own good), was baffled as to how I could possibly influence where other players bid to my advantage, and was impressed by the catch-up mechanism.  Fun.  

The ability of players to put themselves out of the game by using up their high buildings is a problem though.

Also, SHUT UP I LOVE THE BOARD.   It's very clear to me where the regions begin and end and what color they are.  The colors work well together and the art is both beautiful and thematic.  I don't really understand what people are complaining about here. (2 plays)

First played June 16th, 2008. Taught in about 5min, played in just under an hour with 3 players. Each player has 13 blocks numbered 1-13. 1-5 are small, 6-9 are twice the size, and 10-13 are three times the size of the first 5. Players each secretly gets a random mission card to start with as well. Missions are: each building on the edge gets 3 pts, each build next to a statue gets 3 pts, each building next to a lake gets 3 pts, and each building next to a river gets 3 pts. There are also three chits that give points: "M" metro, most gives you an extra 3 pts for each (most in game gets 1 extra point), Lady gets you an extra 1 pt for each (most gets you an extra 1 point); artifact gets you -1 for each, and the most gives you -2. Each person gets to place one of their buildings on any space. The next player can only place a building with a higher number on it and in an empty adjacent space to the previous placement or pass. Once you pass you are out. Play rotates until either all have passed, the highest number has been placed, or there is no opened adjacent placement. First player out of build pieces ends the game. This is pretty fun and I'd recommend giving this a try especially if you know someone who has it to borrow.

Mar09: I love the blend of spatial relations and auctioning. There's a big game of chicken and lots of maneuvering going on. The scoring is just unique enough to keep the winner a true surprise each time. (We used the advanced version each time. The sky-scraper bonuses were a very fun source of points.)

I do think the board hurts the usability, but as others say, it's not bad enough to try and replace.  And it does add a very cool design style to the game.

If you like spatial games and auctions, then definitely give this one a try.

Metropolys is a open bidding game combined with city building theme. Players build their different values of buildings to acheive their tactical goal. The final score is determined by players occupation on the territories. Metropolys has very simple rules and provides certain fun. One of the drawbacks of the game is terrible artwork. The main board and parts look dark and dull. It is hard to figure out the regional boundaries. Generally, Metropolys is a quite good game, but not enough to grap my mind. I could say the game is not my cup of tea.

Interesting game, didn't find the board as bad as  it has been depicted.  Played 2P, 3P and 4P games, think they all play well, but obviously the more players, the harder to score where you want.  EASY game to teach and play, kids can handle it so that is a big plus.  Kudos to the company for sending me a piece that was missing from my game box.  Would be good to teach new gamers, although strategy is difficult at first and you can feel like you are just playing random buildings in random places.

This is an excellent new offering from Ystari.  While the rules are not particularly complex, calling it a light game does not seem particularly capture the feel.  Its the kind of game that could trap AP players, even though in the early rounds thinking too hard is likely to be counter-productive.  But as the game progresses the strategy gets more and more interesting.  The inter-relationship between a bidding game and a positional placement, with the possibility to play both offense and defense is really unusual.  I can imagine this game hitting an 8 if it gets enough play.

I liked it moderately at first (doubts about control), then I got to really like it and now - after 13 plays - I'm back at square 1. I claim the control is way unsatisfactory.

There is one more problem.  Using high pieces early and decisively looks like a strong strategy (experience required!) and the only way to respond to that is blocking a player employing such strategy.  You focus more on this than on _your_ actual strategy.  
I hate games which allow one player to impose the particular style of play on others, force them to block this player or follow his footsteps with no other viable option left.

The above problem might not occur in _each_ play of Metropolys (hence rating '6'), but it's enough to deter from the game.

RATING: 7
Nice 60 – 75 minute light midweight (with 4 players), it looks like a filler but there are nice multiple ways to score and some tough decisions to make. A couple clever moves can be pulled off although it is far more tactical than strategic however some planning is there.  

Tough decisions do mean a little AP so be wary but it moves along fine most of the time.  I Didn't think the 2 player would play well but I see quite a few comments to the contrary.  Pasted theme. Simple ruleset. Low luck factor. Suggested setup looks unbalanced so choose your own and one secret goal card is too strong, take it out. Could lose freshness quickly

Rated based on two 2-player family-rules games and a 4-player advanced-rules game.  Wow... this turned into a tense abstract game fast.  Quickly I was thinking about building placements that would force suboptimal responses or flush out key opponent buildings.  With 4 the abstractness dropped a bit as you are not focused on a single opponent. At key times you really want to "lead" and may win a round that does not outright score just to get control.  At the end of the game you have to watch out for an opponent being able to finish all their buildings. The rules are simple but there is a lot to think about here.  Another great Ystari release!

The second play was almost 4 years after the first, and before I looked at my logs I couldn't remember if I'd played it before or not, even after the game was over.

Can't really rate since I haven't played myself, but based on watching nearly a full game I'd probably put it around a 5, maybe a 6.  The futuristic graphic design is a real turn-off to me and also makes it difficult to pick out certain key board features.  The auctions and spatial element are moderately interesting.  Not a title I'll be clamoring to play any time soon.

RATING: 8
Two plays only.

Core building placement mechanics are very German, pretty much a Knizia-like auction with a spatial element. However the Frenchness comes through with the hidden objective cards which add life to it.

Can you predict what the others are after and baulk them? Can you hide your objectives from them to prevent them baulking you? Can you set up situations allowing you to pick off easy building sites with your low value buildings?

A great little bidding game where bid markers are placed on the board.  The winning marker stays put, so the board area shrinks as the game progresses.

This is a fantastic addition to the Ystari series of games. It's by far the lightest offer to date, even lighter than Mykerinos, but the mechanics are solid and the game play is fast and fun.

The game is essentially a series of auctions with players bidding with their towers which come in three different heights and are numbered 1 through 13. Bidding has a geometric component since you must outbid by placing a higher numbered tower in an area adjacent to the last tower bid. Each player has two secret goals that tell them where and how they want their towers to be placed on the board in order to get points at the end of the game. There are also a few types of chips that can be picked up, and have different effects on the scoring at the end. 

The rules are really simple (the above almost explains the entire game) and it plays in about 45 minutes. 

I've been very happy with this game so far, it's pretty much perfect!

Metropolys is untypical for an Ystari release in featuring one central mechanism as opposed to a wild mix of them. It could be a Knizia in its simplicity with the challenge coming from the diverse scoring options. At its core, it's a game of auctioning building lots. I like the spatial component of the auctioned lots which gives it an old-school abstract feel.

I can see how others may not like the game.  The theme is very uninspiring and I can appreciate other people's complaints about the board artwork (though it is not as bad as I anticipated).  The game is certainly overpriced for what you get, which is essentially a dressed up abstract game.  But I like the bidding mechanism, which involves a spatial component which should heavily favor strong abstract players.  It also reminds me of Ra, where you need to work to draw out high-valued buildings, avoiding certain penalties, and you try to score districts on the cheap.  Because it plays so quickly (and scales quite well, though I definitely prefer it with fewer players) I would be happy to play this just about anytime.

RATING: 8.5
After six plays, this is an 8.5 for me.  Lots of strategy and tactics in a 45-60 min game.  Lots to balance ... becomes a real juggling act. Deciding when to use your best buildings is tense.  Knowing when to sacrifice buildings to block opponents also provides some tense decision making.  Long-term planning is difficult but possible...

Do I think the goal cards are a little imbalanced?  Seems like maybe. What I think is the easiest (three buildings in each district) isn't always as easy as it sounds.  The starting area (from the manual) should be adjusted slightly as well.  I do think that you could virtually ignore your goal card and focus on another area of scoring and compete. 

For set up, my suggestion is to give each person the architecture, fashion and metro chips equally and take turns placing them on the board (before passing out the area goal card).  This ensures some randomness and chits are likely to be placed fairly.  

UPDATE: Tried it with 2 players and it didn't go over too well.  Think this is probably a four player game only, since some of the districts aren't used when playing with less than four.  I think if I played again with two, I'd give both players two colors of buildings and use the whole board.  I'd pick something else with three players.

The theme, which attracted me, is not very present. The whole point of this game is it's unique mechanic, but since you know nothing of the opponents goals, there is not much you can do besides go for yours. I believe the game would be funnier (but more complex and therefore AP) with open goals.

There are two things that make Metropolys really exciting.  First is the totally unique auction system that involves the spatial element of actually placing out buildings into empty neighborhoods.  While only the last (highest-number) building placed will actually be constructed (remain on the board after the auction), the fact that you can use a building not only to increase the bid but also to change the direction in which the bid moves across the board is just so freaking cool.  

The other thing that I really like is how the game accelerates towards its end.  Many games start quickly because the choices you make aren't as important in the early game, but then slow near the endgame as players agonize about what move to make.  But in Metropolys, it's almost reversed.  Early on, everything's wide open and there are tons of options for how you want to plan your strategy.  But as the end nears, we again we see the impact of the spatial facet of the game, becasue as the board fills up, your options for play diminish while the choices you make get more important, thus preventing the possibility of much analysis paralysis.

A unique area control auction game that has players vying for control of different areas in the city. The game is easy to learn, but some aspects are difficult to grasp right away.

Played once.  I was really looking forward to this game, and when I played...it was slightly disappointing.  That still means it was pretty good, but it seemed like at about the halfway point, the end was set in stone, and three of the players were simply playing for second.  I hope not all games of this will end the same way - with the winner essentially playing 3 or 4 of his bid markers uncontested.  And, I must say, the board, while great looking, could be clearer and easier to use.

RATING: 7
A tactical bidding and spacial set-collection game where the final results are calculated as areas of influence and special conditional scoring.  Every player starts out equally with the same set of bidding buildings of three different levels and must use these limited 3-D pieces to bid for spaces/lots that help with your final scoring.  If players bid too early and acquire too many lots too early, one player may end up with too much control and power in the end game.  Whichever bidding pieces you use to win, will stay at that location and you will not have it available for use during the rest of the game.  Warning:  Be careful not to use all your pieces too early b/c by the end game, you will be without any control to win anything.

While the game is not broken, this is my first game ever that I opened the box and nearly just closed it right back up again.  In retrospect, I wish I had done so.  This seriously has to be one of the most hideous boards ever with its modern and garish appearance - bleh!  The game itself is okay, but I just cannot give this game a good rating with its appearance!  Less would be much more in this case.  Think RA but each person has the same collection of suns.  Then think area majority as each person chooses whether to bid higher than the previous person or not with one of their towers in an adjacent province.  Whoever ends up with the highest value tower in the chain keeps their tower in their province and everyone else picks up the rest of their towers.  There's a couple other nuances in scoring but mostly people are trying to achieve their secret objectives as often as possible.

played on Jeux sur Plateau. An uncharacteristically clean design from Ystari that still provides fun tactical nuances and just enough randomness and hidden information to offer okay replayability, but it won't stay fresh forever.

Probably only suitable as a two-player game for the hardcore gamer, but it is a refreshing change of pace as a two-player filler, and I could probably be talked into playing with 3 once in a while. Also seems like an okay family game since it is pretty simple, although it doesn't have enough luck and chaos to help junior win consistently if he isn't plain talented.

Wow! Fun. Quick! Simple... Like TransAmerica quick, and 'simple' fun. We have no problem with the board; some report problems with the graphics scheme - I expected this to be an issue, "not". Have only played 'basic family style' - but that worked well. We are torn between keeping the 'family' game going for a while (it is Perfect for a weeknight quickie) and going Expert. The rules for 'expert' look great - stay tuned for an update (I can't imagine this going down in rating). A *great* 30 minute game!

[UPDATE 2008-11] Not as thrilled by this any more (sorry). The capricious card draws are a nuisance. There's not enough difference between the Family and Expert games to improve the experience or change it much at all. Dropped my rating from 8 to 7. Still nice that it is quick.

Rating based on one play of the family rules.

While I enjoy the auction mechanism, this is really all the game is, and requires people to think and play quickly to keep the game interesing. Further, the full game will have several layers of depth, but without expedient play I can see this one becoming stagnant, and people becoming relucant to play.

I like the base ideas and enjoyed this, but if people try to play it more "thinky" it might not be worth the time.

Update:

Doesn't really play much differently with the full rules versus family rules. I'm thinking there's not a whole lot fo game here...

With 52 buildings divided into 4 colours (one for each player), this is a trick-taking card game in disguise, however, the geographical element of the board, combined with secret objectives, makes this quite a bit more interesting. I like this game a lot. Unfortunately, I don't get to play it much anymore because one of the people I usually play it with is not a fan.

RATING: 2
I would say burn all copies of this game, except I do like the theme.  It is just utterly boring and uninteresting to play.  The idea is sound, but the execution poor.  Its too easy to figure out what everyone's secret agenda is, and the decision to build or not is really not that hard.  Thus the game fails on pretty much all levels.

RATING: 8
An abstract at heart, but a very good and involving one, and the excellent graphics definetely contribute a lot to the fun.

At first, the one thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was a strange disconnect between my gut feeling for how well I did and the actual scores: I was convinced throughout my first game to be way behind everybody else and, furthermore, saw one player as a total runaway leader. End scores were 25 points for the "runaway leader" and 24 for the other three players.

This gets better the more you play it, and with more experience I begin to understand how to use knowledge about the other player's goals.

Played 4 times.

Decent game.  I like the 'secret objective' aspect that's combined with area-control.  Board is colorful (if a tad busy), and the player pieces sort of unexciting, but the overall game is great.  It plays fast, looks good as the board fills, and is really easy to teach and to learn.  I can see this one getting regular play.

10-30-11-Just got in our first play (2p) and both Miles and I loved it!  He really ran away with it though.  I'm never the fastest learner.

Totally abstract, but plays fast and has a unique feel. It's an auction game with a spatial element, which adds an extra layer to the decisions. Additionally players have secret goals (which aren't hard to figure out) that create different sets of incentives. People who complain about the board are just whiners who object to colors other than brown being used in boardgames.

RATING: 9
The more I play it, the more I want to play it.  It's quick and easy to teach.

I think Metropolys is destined to be a sleeper hit.  When I first read the rules, my reaction was "that's it?"  When I played it I found it to have fresh and intriguing mechanics.  It doesn't feel like a rehash of some other Euro.

When teaching this game, I always refer to the archaeological sites as crack houses.  You don't want to build in a crack house district, do you?  This also helps give the game some local flavor, since I live in a city that has more crack houses than fast food restaurants.

What makes it a 9 instead of a 10 is that I don't have a constant urge to play it like I do with Twilight Struggle or Brass.  I don't ever see myself turning down a game though, and do see myself playing it many years from now.

A favourite of my girlfriend. She describes it as a similar build mechanic to Carcassonne, but without the luck of the tile draw. She's right, too (always much quicker to pinpoint a game's focus than I am). Other than the cards dealt to start, the choices, good or bad, are one's own. Perhaps that's why she enjoys the screwage so much more than in Carc(?). I can't pretend it's bad luck when I lose...

I'm not a big fan of auction games, but the intriguing and visually rewarding bidding mechanics mixed with moderate amount of bluffing makes it a tense, yet highly entertaining game.

After 50 plays. Incredible game. Gets better with experience. Maybe too skillful, too interactive (opponents have a ton of control over each others choices), and too spatial to be a big gateway game mass market hit, even though its rules are more than simple and intuitive enough to qualify for that possibility. 

The feel of play is like no other game I've played. It's rare these days to find a game which feels unique, and this one does. 

Graphic design could be better, however. Doesn't bother me any more now I've internalized the board, but it annoyed in the beginning. 

From a pure aesthetic point of view, I wish the board's color scheme had matched the amazing and unusual color design of the box cover. 

I'm better at this game than all my current opponents. If I find an equal match, I may end up raising the rating.

A unique game that takes Ra style bidding onto a board game.  There are a number of ways to score with secret objectives, negative and positive VP chits that are picked up, etc.  Plays really well with 2 but I would think 4 players would make it too chaotic.  UPDATE:  After 2nd play already knocking down a point.  I still really like it but it's probably too dry for many groups.

Első körben két játékossal próbálva. Megmondom őszintén, kicsit féltem tőle a módosított szabályok miatt (pl. térkép egy része nem használható), de egyáltalán nem igazolta: ez bizony két játékossal is egészen jól játszható (bár gondolom 3-4 játékossal még nagyobb lehet az élmény-faktor).

Szabályok egyszerűek, kb. 3 perc elmagyarázni még a profi variánst is (mert hogy van egy könnyített "családi" szabályvariáns is a kezdő játékosoknak). Amennyire egyszerűek a szabályok, annyira jól lehet taktikázni benne.

Újrajátszhatósága is teljesen rendben van, a játék elején felhúzott titkos célkártyák miatt.

In love with this after one 4-player game. We'll see if it holds up. My only complaint is that the board is ugly as sin, muddled and not so functional.

The 2-player game is pretty good too.

Brilliant game. Playing the players is the key here, as well as knowing when to spend your high numbered buildings and when to hold back. I tend to keep them around until late in the game then spend them in a flurry. Of course, if you don't meet the requirements on your goal cards, it doesn't much matter. In fact, the goal cards are the only thing I don't like about Metropolys; some are much easier than others. There are lots of decisions here, deciding how much to value a given spot on the board and whether you can afford to let your opponent claim a given spot.

I have the Metropolys cards from the Ystari box.

Really fun and different area control game with lots of different things to pay attention to.  I have heard many comments of "I just don't quite get it."  I think it has to do with the weird way you have to plan for claiming areas.  It's not a simple matter of just declaring an area and setting your price.  Instead, you have sort of guess what surrounding areas others might be willing to pay for.  I think this throws some area-control fans, and I can see why it's tough to grasp... but I think it's great!

A great auction game with a similar feel to Ra, but with a visual spatial element and something of an abstract feel as well. 

This is just a very solid design that provokes deep thought from its players and allows for some clever moves. 

Add in some good scoring cards to create objectives and this is also a very good Euro design. 

With all of those labels, Metropolys is something of a chameleon...but one I highly recommend.

Metropolys est très apprécié des gens à qui j'ai fait découvrir ce jeu. Les couleurs du plateau prêtent un peu à confusion, mais après quelques parties on ne s'y méprend plus.

La mécanique du jeu (des enchères à la chaîne) me séduit (et est quelque peu déroutante à plusieurs joueurs!), tandis que c'est peut-être la valeur de certaines cartes missions qui me laissent un tout petit peu sur mon appétit.

Quoiqu'il en soit, c'est un jeu que je trouve fort agréable, que j'accepte de jouer avec enthousiasme lorsqu'on me le demande, et que je recommande!

Il est particulièrement agréable avec d'autres joueurs qui aiment calculer. Car ici, tout est question de prévoir où se terminera la chaine, quelle position il en résultera, et du coup, s'il y aura apparition de "cul-de-sac".

Each player has bid tokens from 1-13. There are three sizes of bid tokens, with the larger numbers represented by the larger tokens. One places their tokens on city squares to attempt to capture them, but the trick is that your bid has to be adjacent to another bid. City sqaures contain prestige markers, or penalty markers. In addition, players get special cards with victory conditions (eg earn 2 VPs if you have a bid in the city, or earn 4 VPs if you ahve three connected markers). It's a different game, with tactics and makes you think.

Works very well with 2, 3 or 4 players, and every number of players make the game a bit different. Metropolys is easy to teach with its intuitive mechanics. The board and the bits could be better made and more beautiful, but all in all this is one of my big favourites from Ystari Games.

it is an enjoyable bidding game if played in 40 minutes, unfortunately it tends to be longer, and that brings boredom.

With four players it is a tasty, nasty little auction game with interesting auctioning mechanic. Not sure how well it works with less players as it might not be as tense. I'm not sure how balanced different secret goals really are. As there aren't that many points available in the game they might be deciding factor in some games. 

The game looks rather nice during game as there is no text/numbers or board/components (when not bidding).

It's surprising that auction games with new mechanics keep coming up - Metropolys is a particularly elegant and original one. Players don't bid for concrete goods but to place one of their towers on a field of the board: each bid is a tower on a space adjacent to the one bidded for previously, sporting a higher value than the other towers bidded in the round. Certain spaces contain chits that bring positive or negative bonuses when taken.

The family and expert variants of Metropolys are simply different scoring systems adapted to the special features on the board, and both achieve their aim: the family game allows to warm up to the peculiar auctioning mechanics and the considerably heavier expert game adds tension in every single move, since there are several possibilities for bonuses that can be exploited by the players. Both variants are outstanding. 

Beside its original bidding mechanism, Metropolys' other great asset is its huge flexibility: both scoring systems can be combined, the bonus chits can be distributed arbitrarily on the board at the beginning of each round and the game for two or three players plays on a limited amount of sectors on the board, allowing an impressive number of possible setups.

RATING: 8
Metropolys is a really, really smart way to blend bidding and area control - there is a whole bunch of interaction and timing wrapped up in these un-Ystari-like streamlined mechanics. For once, it's completely true when the Family and Advanced games are presented as two different entities: indeed the Family game has quite a lot going for it in its own right. It's a tiny shame that some of my wooden components weren't up to scratch, but that was easily solved with a little paint.

I won this in a raffle! Bordercon 09.

Nice looking game, albeit with slightly weird graphics. Worst ziploc bags I have ever encountered, but that's hardly a deal-breaker.

Basic game is very good, quick to play, keeps people engaged and has enough depth to be interesting. A "heavy filler". 

Not 100% convinced by the "advanced" game - some of the point cards seem unbalanced. It's a lot easier to get towers either side of a bridge than it is to get three in a row, and the score difference seems wrong. Will need to play more to be sure.

Read the rules to this and you'll be left with the feeling of "Is that all?!?" When you play the game though, it becomes a tense auction/area control game. With a little bit of Ra with the "open information auction", a touch of clans with its "hidden colour scoring" and some of numerous other games with it's "secret goals", this one is a hidden gem of a game.

Great game!  I cold bought this one after reading much about it here and was correct that it is right up my alley.  I love the spatial "bidding," the limited amount of bid tokens, the hidden goals, the variety of ways to score, and the real tactical moves possible as the game winds on and more dead end spaces appear.  Our 2-player Family Game was less fun--the 4-player Full Game was awesome!

I am finding however that the difficulty in planning is throwing off my slightly more casual gaming family.  They feel the bidding mechanism it is too unpredictable...almost random.  I like bluffing/prediction games and enjoy trying to shape things the way I want them to go.  I like this  much more than those I've played with.

RATING: 6
Although the game was well-constructed enough to keep me interested through the first playing, I haven't felt any desire to replay it. The secret objectives naturally lead you to launch yourself at specific sites, so it gradually becomes clear what's people's objectives are, and then it's an exercise in leading activity away from similar sites. There seems little point bluffing throughout the whole game - you're just denying yourself the big points. So it seems to be a game of who falls into the points when the group's defenses are down. Too repetitive all in all.

RATING: N/A
It's in the "Knizian" genre of short (45 min) games with simple rules but lots to think about and plenty of interaction. In some ways it feels like Ra on a map, as you are bidding on lots which have very different values to different players, and you have only a limited stock of fixed bid denominations to use. In others way it reminds me of a trick-taking card game. It can be very important to 'take the lead' in order to get rid of low-numbered bids. The secret objectives provide just the right dose of uncertainty about player valuations, and there's real satisfaction in choosing just the right bid in the right place to force a difficult choice on your opponents. I've played it 2, 3 and 4 player with gamers and non-gamers and it's gone down well every time. I might actually like it best 2-player, as less happens between your turns and it gets really cat and mouse. Oh, and I actually like the board.

Based on one play: Play one of your pieces on the board and then others can play adjacent to yours in turn order as long as they play a piece with a higher number. Once no one else is willing to play or can't,  that player takes the spot. Each player has a secret objective to connect pieces or play in certain regions plus there are point tokens in some. Very simple mechanics but there is enough strategy plus it plays in under an hour. Well worth a try.

Kind of a disappointment... After two plays, it felt as if I was playing a trick-taking game with board restrictions. Also subtle references to Ra was noticed in the bidding part. I've always been bad in that kind of bidding games.

Special Score cards seem to be a bit unequal to me. Some feel easier to achieve than other. There is also a mean aspect in game and you can be easily left behind. 

This just doesn't feel to be my type of a game. Second attempt wasn't fun anymore. Perhaps I'll try this again someday.

Edit: Was more tolerable with 2 players. There is just something I do better when only two are involved, don't know what. Want to try this with three before the most final opinion.

RATING: 5
Reminds me of a more involved version of Clans in that you are trying influence movement around the board to finally bring it to stop to meet your hidden agenda. Interestingly, this movement is governed by auction via buildings (with printed values) as well as positive and negative scoring chips in locations to either channel or sway the next move. Smooth, intriguing but ultimately too Chess like with the added problem that once a player has committed his high value buildings too early has to sit out of some of the action.

An elegant abstract game with auctions. It reminds me Ra. In a way, the rules have something of the purity of those of the games of the GIPF project by Kris Burm, except it's playable by 2 to 4 players. In my opinion, it's the mark of a great game. My rating may grow up.

This is a quick and very enjoyable bidding game that has a city theme, but really isn't a city builder. In essence the buildings you get are your bids. A player puts a cool looking plastic building in a spot, and if another player puts a building that has a higher number in an adjacent spot, they are essentially outbidding them. You play until you are out of buildings, and players score for tokens picked up off the board, one or two achievement cards in their hands, and then tallest in each region. Very light, very casual.

RATING: 7
An intriguing game. 

Yes, it is a bidding game - but very different. The bidding is spatially oriented where the player is actually bidding on a different component.
Each player has his own objectives so each space is worth a different amount to each player. 
It seems that an objective is to drive the bidding to locations where the results are worth more to you than your opponents. 
I like how when you realize an opponents wants a space you can start the bidding there which denies the space.

Yes the board can be garish, but I like the look of the game as well as how it plays.

Many compare that game to Ra. That last one is without a doubt better than Metropolys. While the rules are clear and easy to understand, The game isn't easy to master the first few plays. Certains objective cards seems easyier to realise than other. Will probably come out often because it plays realy fast for that type of game. The material is nice.

Plusieurs le compare à Ra. Mais ce dernier est nettement supérieur à Métropolys. Les règles sont claires et faciles à comprendre. Le jeu n'est toutefois pas faciles à maîtriser les premières parties. Certaines cartes objectifs semblent plus faciles à réaliser que d'autres. Va surement sortir souvent car il se joue rapidement. Le matériel est beau.

Played it only once and got smashed by the experience player. I am not a big fan of games that have a handful of make n break strategies that will instantly kill everyone else.

Gameplay:
One of the better auction games out there that can be played in under an hour. It helps that it's really easy to teach to new players. There's not much luck in the game, except the potential to get a bad goal card in the very beginning which has the potential to leave two players fighting for the same territory while another has certain spots all to himself. Players will have to learn to properly thwart others plans, so it could take a couple games to start seeing the patterns in strategy.

Metropolys' unusual two-sided bidding token system is similar to Y's, also by Ystari Games. However, Metropolys is easier to learn, faster to play, and has much nicer production values.

Unfortunately, Metropolys is not as mechanically interesting nor balanced. Each player's victory conditions feel obvious and are either too easy to block (even accidentally block) or are too simple to accomplish without being blocked.

While I enjoy playing this game for now, I'm not sure how much shelf life I will get out of it.

Current house rules: Metro + Historic regions + 3-4 public scoring methods ONLY. 1-2 colors, 1 of the advanced challenges and tallest building in each region. the player who scores for the 1-2 colors that are 'valuable' but only the player with 'the most' of the advanced challenge scores it. (and only once) So if fountains is the advanced challenge only one player will score the 7pt bonus for it. (unless there is a tie, and then all tying players score)

Excellent game. Nothing compares to it. Simple, yet complex. You 'bid' on sectors to build in, based on a 'secret building mission' that was distributed at the beginning to each player. You may also score positive or negative points, depending on tokens stacked on some properties.

Interesting auction game with opportunity for player manipulation. Players are architects in some dystopian world, vying for premium building locations. The game plays out simply: place a city with a higher value adjacent to a previous one, repeat until players back down (pass) and only the final placement is built. The funny thing is, you can sort of lead or "egg" a player on, depending on the path you create when you place the next building. One may start to wonder on their turn: "Is this where I actually want to go, or am I being made to follow?" or "I am simply being lured into placing a new building here?". This is great stuff!

It becomes a tense, competitive game of chicken, using a cool mix of auction and area control mechanisms. Even rarer, and wonderful, to see an auction game that plays out so well with two players.

A refreshing twist on auction games. Being able to lead a bid in the right direction while taking advantage of the dead ends and archaeological sites is a satisfying experience. Every turn is very tactical, and it's difficult to plan for future turns. Family game is playable, but there are a lot of "dead" spaces on the board that no one wants. While this creates more artificial dead ends the regular game adds much more value to various spaces and the bidding has more of a dynamic flow to it.

a unique take on bidding combined with a nice (but not overwhelming) deduction/deception element with hidden goals for each player.  The game offers more control that it first appears, and the game stops feeling as chaotic once all the players have the hang of it.

Played first at [[Pionek]] September 2008.  Didn't know what to expect and was quite impressed.  Very clever unusual central mechanic that combines auction mechanics with territory control tactics.  All 4 of us liked it a lot, and I want to play more.  Plus the art is unusual and cool looking.

Have played it 2-player, and it works well.

--July2008-- Fun stuff.  Reasonably subtle, fast, simple to explain for the most part.  The board is nearly as ugly as advertised, but I find it doesn't detract at all from the game experience: the rest of the components are very nice.  Very glad to have bought it; rating may improve with further play.
--July2009-- Still amused: I definitely prefer the "Expert" game, though; the decisions are more interesting.
--Feb2010-- The expansion from the Ystari Box is nice, too.

By FAR, Metropolys is at its best with two players. Metropolys is not nearly as good with more, because there is going to be chaos. With two, this is a very smart contest. Just the right amount of "think" for my taste. Reminds me of Ra. The first time or two that you play, the artwork is hard to get around. But by the third or fourth play, I found myself loving it, and actually consider this one of the more beautiful games that I own :p

It is an auction game - maybe that's why I didn't like it as much... For sure it's interesting, it has some layers to care about, not too much. Probebly after some plays you can make up some strategies. But for now on I don't want it. I can play it when it hits a table, but... I won't suggest it.

A pretty good Eurogame that unfortunately got less interesting with each successive play. It only really kicks into gear in the second half of the game, and then it gets quite good. Still, it should be more engaging the whole way through. Those who like the bidding would do better with Ra. The board is quite unique though.

This is an abstract bidding game where players are bidding on locations on the game board to occupy.  Bids are placed by using a finite number of numbered building pieces.  Bids continue until all players pass, then the last building placed wins and remains on the board, thus reducing their ability to bid that same number in the future.  When bidding you must bid on an empty lot adjacent to the one just bid on, thereby creating a path of proposals.  Each player has a secret objective which awards them points in the end.

The players must decide how much they are willing to spend on which lots, knowing who can still outbid them.  As the board fills up dead ends are created, which can offer for really cheap buildings.  The game can play fast and furious, or you can puzzle over the strategies and guess what path your opponents will take.

Ugly board which doesn't match the rather nice box artwork. The game is a bit tedious. Bidding with buildings of different values from 1 to 13; placing them in lines of increasing value until no-one wants to bid any more. Do this lots of times, pick up bonus points and then add up the scores. 
It gets vaguely interesting when the space gets tight but overall - dull!

A good idea. When using a random setup, the "modular" board causes some imbalance.

RATING: 7

I like this game, but the start of it feels weird. It's almost like a sucker has to bite the bullet and do a sub-optimal play or two to get the ball rolling, before strategy comes in.

Opaque auctions.

I hate the artwork. Too futuristic and colorful for its own good. Classic case of artwork overwhelming gameplay, as some things like bridges, closed-off corners, connections etc become hard to see due to the garish artwork, dull color palette and faint boundaries. Artwork closer to real life (real subways, protected district, slums, parks etc) would have made the theme much more immersive and enjoyable.

The really different thing about this game, and the one that gives it its cerebral quality, is that you can't bid again after you pass. In regular auctions, this rule is merely cosmetic to prevent never-ending open auctions, but in Metropolys, the added spatial dimension to the auctions and how the object value changes with each successive bid means this usually simple (and indeed obsolete) rule completely changes the game.

4+3

Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

Metropolys is a quirky little game that feels a bit random and/or puzzling at times, but it's really quite fun.

Picked it up after watching the Scott Nicholson video review, and I'm happy to say that it quickly became one of my partner's favourite games (plays well with 2).

Recommend!

UPDATE - Just printed out the promo cards from the Ystari magazine (available as a PDF for download in the Metropolys forums), and I'm pleased to report that these add another layer of mystery and flexibility to the game - check them out!

A rather novel take on the auction-placement genre.

Players have secret objects for scoring. They then use buildings labelled 1 to 13 to 'bid' for locations on the board. The next higher bid needs to go at an adjacent location and this chain continues until it all players pass. The highest bidder flips the numbered building over and wins that location and any tokens on it (+ve or -ve vps at end of game).

Though it seems random, there are interesting ways to 'force' the auction into corners, etc. The buildings are lovely to look at but the board, OMG, it's messy and horrid. This is Art Deco meets the future meets Impressionism.

The basic game provides lots to think about but the advanced game will just take it several notches up the brain-burner scale (could be brutal).

Teljesen megértem, hogy sokaknak ez a játék tetszik legjobban az Ystari játékok közül. Ez sem illik igazán ugyanis a komolyabb Y-os koncepcióba, sőt. Ez egy könnyed, fél órán belül letolható játék. Nekem a kinézettel most sincs bajom, szokásos Ystari. A családi változatot próbáltuk, ami nekem kicsit csalódás volt. Különböző nagyságú épületeket helyezünk le egymás után, addig, amíg tudunk szomszédosat, illetve felül akarjuk licitálni az előttünk tevőt. A cél a mindenkinek különböző célkártyáin szereplő helyek megszerzése a felhőkarcolóival. Minden célhely 3 pont, ezen felül vannak még különböző tokenek véletlenszerűen a pályán, adott terület megszerzésekor kapjuk őket, ezek további plusz vagy mínusz pontokat hozhatnak. Úgy gondolom a családi változat csak ezeken a bónuszkorongokon dől el, mert nagyon könnyű a célkártyának megfelelően elhelyezni az épületeket. A bónuszkorongok véletlen felhelyezésén pedig sok múlik azáltal, hogy a pluszosok ki céljának a legmegfelelőbb helyre kerültek. Nekem emiatt nem igazán tetszett. A profi változat további pontokat ad, további bónuszkorongokat vezet be. Mindenképp ki kell próbálnom a végső értékelés előtt, mert ez így nekem nagyon karcsú volt.

Oh Ystari, there was a time when I would buy any of your games without trying them first.  Those days are gone.

This is a good enough game that borrows heavily from Dorn's Mancala variants, but ultimately is dry and abstract.  I like the concept of how this works like a 2D trick taking game, with the winning player placing their lead piece first.

The game suffers from a graphically confusing board and accidental turn order give-aways that remind you that Puerto Rico is a resort hotspot rather than this Guantanamo Bay.

Nothing overly exciting, but then again, nothing particularly wrong either.

Metropolys revolves around a spatial auction and is in fact quite abstract. I'm not a fan of abstract games and auctions are often not my cup of tea. Metropolys is the exception to both rules.
While abstract at its core, the goals and structure do feel very Euro-like, which is probably why I like it. There is pattern recognition but it gets combined with valuation, bluffing and hidden scoring mechanisms.
Gameplay is tense and full of moments of clever gameplay. I especially like how you can put pressure on your opponent by having them make the difficult decisions.
A great game, highly recommended, in spite of the horrible and non-functional artwork.

A nice twist on an area control game, where you place buildings of varying heights.  There's quite a bit going on in the relatively simple gameplay that makes this game an elegant one, since you can capture trendy neighborhoods but avoid archeological sites and still have to meet secret objectives.  Might be a touch high here, but I'll have to have repeated plays to give a full verdict.

RATING: 7
Metropolys is an auction game at heart, but I can't say I've played anything like it. Today the euro market seems dominated by card combo games and non-confrontational VP odysseys. In both cases, the board is there mostly for bookkeeping. So it's nice to play a euro with a strong spatial element, and the hidden objectives are a nice touch. Metropolys is a throwback to the days of short, simple interactive euros with lots of replay value, and that's exactly the sort of euro I like. This one feels like a climbing card game more than anything else, except it's not always clear whether going out first is best. The board is muddy and unattractive, but the game is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really enjoyed this game!  Part of it reminds me of Ra bidding, where you are trying to bully the other players into getting them to use their big numbers in bids.  It adds a strategic board element where placement is very important and clever play can help you set up chains.  Very nice job.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An abstract area-majority game with a very thinly painted-on theme. Plays pretty quickly, though. You have to balance several different ways of earning VP chips. With repeated play, should be easier to see/create situations where a low bid still wins (e.g., creating areas with no way to raise the bid). I just don't think the game is all that much fun to play.

SUMMARY
Setup: place counters on the board, 1/space. These are -1VP, +1VP, or +3VP. Each player starts with their 13 buildings (numbered 0-13, 3 different sizes), and 2 game-end VP bonus cards (kept hidden). End game bonuses are either 2VP/area controlled of a specific type, or 4-7VP/instance of achieving some type of board position (e.g., controlling the 3 spaces around a lake or fountain, having 3 pieces in a region, having 3 contiguous pieces, or having a pair of buildings across a bridge from each other; may only apply a specific bldg once towards this bonus).

Starting player makes a bid for an area by placing one of their buildings there. In turn order, players may raise the bid by placing a higher-numbered building in an adjacent space to the last-placed building (but not across water, unless there's a bridge, or if the space already has a building). Continue till everyone passes; final building is flipped upside down and that player takes the VP marker; everyone else takes their losing-bid buildings back. The first person to accumulate three 1VP markers takes the +3VP Bonus card from whoever has it, or from the bank (like longest road in Settlers). If you took a -1VP chip, you take the -2VP Penalty Card from whoever has it now, or from the bank. Bid winner starts the next auction.

Play continues till the end of the turn when someone has run out of buildings. Award the 5VP chips according to control of regions: player with most of the highest buildings in each region gets the bonus 5VP. If tied, check next-highest building in region. Most VP wins.

Probably my favourite auction game for 2 players.  No, definitely my favourite auction game for 2 players.  This is an under-represented style, and I think Metropolys is at the top of the heap.

Easy to teach, incredibly tight, a bit of bluffing, a bit of pushing of luck, and nearly perfect information.  All in all top notch design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever design.  If you exit the bidding, the trail might eventually reach a space you covet.  If you remain in the bidding, you could end up with an unwanted space.  I enjoyed my game and I'm not normally a big fan of tile laying and finding the optimal place on the board, so I can see where most will like it even more than I do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very well-designed filler with an original feel.  This game consists of players placing towers of increasing size trying to one-up each other until all other players pass or are unable to place.  Some spaces give or take points from players so the aim is to end on a valuable space (or trap opponents onto less valuable or even negative spaces).

This already offers a great deal of depth and forward thinking but each player also has a pair of hidden goals that will earn them more points.  I love hidden objectives so this certainly fueled my interest even more.

I will say the game is better with a full compliment of four players.  With fewer players, sections of the map are removed and traps are more easy to achieve (some secret objectives are also arbitrarily hurt).

So what we have is a game that plays in 30 minutes, has great depth, elegant mechanics, and hidden objectives.  I'm sold!  Too bad the game is out of print and copies are hard/expensive to come by.

The physically moving biding makes this interesting with anywhere from 2 to 4.  Player chaos increases substantially as you increase players which makes the game more tactical.  With 2 players you can often attempt to control where the bids are heading in terms of location.

The hidden information of the cards plays more of a role with 4 players, again as the chaos tends to shield goals for longer than in the two-player where it becomes rapidly more obvious each play.  I wouldn't say one is better than the other, but the player number does significantly change the "feel" of the game.

Excellent, sadly neglected auction game with an intriguing spatial element. Players have a fixed set of buildings numbered 1-13; a "bid" is placing a building on a region. Subsequent bids/buildings must be placed in adjacent regions. The winner leaves their building in place. Scoring is by collecting special tokens on some regions and by secret goals (2VP for building on a red space, 4VP for having buildings on both sides of a bridge etc.).

It plays quickly and very well, going from a deliciously opaque early game to a deliciously cut-throat late-game where balancing player incentives is important. I'm not convinced that the goals are balanced ("3 buildings in a region" in particular seems too easy) but I am also not convinced that they are not.

The short brainburner is my favourite category of game and this one qualifies. I even quite like the board.

Update: the Ystari Box cards are probably an improvement because deduction is harder. Removing the "3 buildings in a region" card (one of the expansion rules) definitely is.

Metropolys has a neat bidding system that not only resolves who gets to place but -where-, meaning there' s a lot of strategy to working the bids around into the area where you want them. The hidden goals are okay, though some seem almost stupidly hard. I wish the colors of some areas were easier to distinguish but I appreciate that at least the building styles were different from color to color. Decent game, I'd play again, and if I were a bigger fan of area-control type games I'd probably love it, but as it is it's a good not great in my book.

It's also a two player head to head battle.  I am recognizing this aspect better in games that play with more than two.  Sebastien Pauchon has become one of my favorite designers.  If only he would produce more.

4 player : Agonizing and tense, but, oh so good.

Bidding using sky scrapers. I always look forward to this and then don't quite enjoy it as much as I expect to.

To me 'Metropolys' feels like an older classic from the 90s.  "Simple-yet-elegant" may be a cliched descriptor for the older German-styled family games, but the fact is this design is both, and its simple elegance does indeed hearken to a less fiddly era when rules could be summarized in a few pages.  (Sometimes contemporary euros, though I'm admittedly fond of many, seem to come not with rulebooks but with manuals.)  Despite its lighter set of rules, the game itself packs a nice strategic punch. 

With two, 'Metropolys' is probably my favorite 2-player bidding design.  It may be even as enjoyable with three, but it does have a different feel at that point, perhaps a less confrontational vibe.  Like 'High Society' you can only bid in pre-set denominations which creates some absolutely yummy strategic decisions based on timing over the course of the game.  Also, I love the way the game ties its open bidding with a spatial control mechanism that plays out on a city map; not only can you *not* bid in every increment that you'd like, but neither can you have 100% control over what zone on the map your bid may win! Lovely! These constraints means far less analysis paralysis than might otherwise plague an almost-perfect-info. bidding game of this sort.  It also means less tactical and more strategic gameplay.  For maximum strategic planning, playing with advanced scoring is a must!

There's not too much to say in favor of Metropolys other than the basic mechanics of combining bidding and area-control by putting values on the placement markers seems to work OK. However, balance is a real issue with this overly dry abstract, including the initial placement of the bonus chips (I played the basic set-up which put 4 of the 9 negative-point chips on my goal color of blue) to the goals themselves. The game isn't very fun, and there's not enough going on to be really engaging. All of that coupled with artwork that not only is garish but also hurts functionality of the graphics (making connections, bridges, etc., difficult to distinguish) equals a rare but utter failure for Ystari.

I've never seen any game simultaneously combine auction bidding with area-control placements, and this is very novel.  But Metropolys also feels a little samey.  Once you've picked up a few critical tricks, each game will repeat those same moves over and over again.  It's fair to say that the ugly board doesn't do Metropolys any favors, especially compared to the similar design requirements for the dazzling San Marco.

Tough call here.  The playing time can be extremely short, but it also seems that a good amount of solid thought can be put into the game.  Does not try to overextend itself, which is a rare thing these days.

UPDATE:  After a few more plays, my thoughts about Metropolys are a little clearer.  Although I enjoy the game, setup can really determine much of the outcome of the game (because of the random nature of the secret goals).  It is a striking game to look at, and it plays so smooth, and is a breeze to explain.  It also plays much better with a full slate of 4 players.  As a 4P game, I'd raise my rating a full point.

So far so good. This is an auction game, but it's more about winning a good spot on the board than just outbidding your opponent at every turn. For that reason, it plays well with two players. The board also looks great in person (pictures of it tend to look a little bit dark and cluttered) and playing with the skyscraper bidding markers is just fun.

RATING: 7.5
For an unknown reason, this one just stays put in my wishlist. Often when a game is here long enough, I get tired of it and remove it. But I keep thinking this looks like a very clever bidding game. I like the idea of spacial bidding.

After having this game on my wishlist for over a year, I finally acquired a brand-new copy. And I'm glad I did. I've played it a few times with my wife now and the only complaint is that is seems I'll never beat her! I can look at that in two ways, that's awesome because she'll always want to play it--being that she's good at it, or, it sucks because I'm never going to win. Either way, it's a keeper among my ever-growing auctioning-game collection. I have about 6 games that involve auctioning mechanics now, but I can honestly say Metropolys is unique in its implementation of "spacial bidding."

If you're curious about this one, I say give it a shot. It has lived up to be what I was hoping and expecting: tense, tactical, interesting, and thought provoking.

Abstract-y game with an interesting bidding mechanism.  The mix of art deco with bold colors make the board a bit much for some, but it's growing on me.  The family version of the game seems a bit simple (but then again, that's probably the purpose of family versions).  The [i]secret[/i] goals are pretty apparent about 1/3 of the way through the game, but keep down some of the initial blocking moves.  It will be interesting to see how this holds up to repeated plays.

It has been a while since I've reacted this positively to a light family Eurogame.  I've found many recent offerings in this genre to be bland and derivative.  Even those that I consider somewhat clever and interesting often don't merit inclusion in my collection because they don't surpass games that I already have in the same niche.

Now, I don't think Metropolys is the best game ever by any means, but it is good and different enough for me to consider it worth owning.

Fantastic art, simple rules, area control with area bidding mechanism. Very innovative mechanism for area control. The game is rather simple but it is nerve breaking the decision making. You need to get a hourglass so no player will be allowed to go into deep thought and put the other players into sleep (this is my only complain for the game). Excellent game, very clean, very challenging, and there are plenty of strategies that can apply in this game. And it looks stunning!

RATING: 9
One of my favorite two-player half-hour games. I find Metropolys to be a wonderful simple bidding game, with a great use of the spatial element to lead to interesting decisions and the hidden goals to make it not perfectly mathematical. I enjoy the game best with two players - less chaotic, an improved deduction element, quicker time, a smaller board - but is fine with 3 or 4 players. As far as the graphic design goes, I love it. I have no issue with the colors or anything, and almost no opponents have either, even a color-blind one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
pulled from a geeklist comment i made:

in general i love bidding games, and the added spatial element made this look REALLY interesting.  and it IS fun... but man, is it slow to GET fun.  

the last half of the game works well for me - interesting decisions on the tight board, and with some of your bids spent.  but the first half - particularly the first third of the game.  man, does that section drag.

unlike others in my group, i just couldn't see the point of going up through all the bids (sequentially from 1, every time a new bid started) so early in the game, step-by-bloomin-step.  it sapped the fun out of the game for me - dragged out the first third of the game painfully.  it isn't even AP, just... reluctance to make a definitive bid early on.  

basically, i want the board to be tighter, sooner.  so the conclusion is that i would far rather play 3 rounds of No Thanks followed by a few rounds of Dutch Blitz than play this one.  

good, just not good enough.

(though i wish someone would take this mechanism and reimplement/improve on it in a new game... i love the spatial bidding.)

Perfectly playable with two, Metropolys offers quite a bit of turn angst for its short playing time.

RATING: 7
One of the best games I have played in the past 12 months. A little surprised it flew under the radar when first published by Ystari and RGG. It certainly hasn't garnered the same attention as Yspahan or Caylus, though the latter does deserve extra recognition. The game is light on rules, but heavy on tactics. These tactics come in several subtle layers that may not seem obvious, but with some thought and careful observation, several clever strategies will emerge during game play. Central to the theme of this game is an auction with spatial restrictions....something closely related to the spatial restriction found in Goa where players place ever-increasing auction tokens based on placement of token by the previous player. Hence, selecting when to play the token where is crucial to winning the game. Equally important is when to concede the auction without overbidding. Points are scored based on random tokens scattered across the different districts on the board as  well as secret and public end-of-game objectives. There are a few "flaws" to the game though. The board design and colors are truly garish, looks disorganized and deserves the general scorn from gamers. The secret objectives though fine, are quite easy to guess. Perhaps increasing the number of available secret objective cards will help. 

This game really feels like a Knizia design. Simple rules with a few actions per turn but with multiple layers of strategy. With all the agonizing decisions to be made, this game is delightful and easy to embrace. I also enjoy the totally irrelevant steampunk theme and oh, did I mention this scales beautifully with two?

I love this game. The spatial auction mechanism is brilliant, and the secret goals work extremely well. I love how, apart from the secret goals, there is absolutely no luck. This makes the game very exciting, as there are many different ways to approach the game. I also love how there are several strategies that are not apparent at first glance, but are very rewarding when discovered. For example, taking negative chips can actually be quite useful, as if no one else wants to take -3 points (-1 for the chip and -2 for the card), they will let you have all of those spaces for free, which can help both with placing small buildings and with completing your secret goals. Pure genius.

Nice artwork and highly refined mechanics make this one a very pleasant experience.  A seasoned gamer will pick up the rules in a matter of minutes, but forming a strategy and reacting to the unexpected will challenge anyone.

Terrible graphics, the different areas on the board are difficult to distinguish as there is very little contrast. With a better board this would be rated at least 1 point higher.

Metropolys is such an elegant game. The concept is simple, the execution flawless. With 13 bidding 'chips' (buildings of three sizes numbered sequentially one through thirteen) players early in the game are in a tense game of chicken as they each try to flush the high numbers out of their opponent's hand. Later in the game, as the available spaces decline and the available chains decrease in size, the placements become brutally tactical. I love games that have a playing arc, and Metropolys is a poster-game for playing arc: goals and strategies must be shifted as the game traverses distinct beginning-middle-end game phases. I also love how much you get in the package-- here I am not talking about design or bits, although I do find the box art and the bidding "buildings" fantastic. Rather I specifically mean how cool it is that you get two worthwhile games in the box: both a "family" and a "gamers'" game. I have now played both, and for the intended audience, each is spot on. Unlike many games that throw a "family game" in the box by doing nothing more than crippling the game with a a few lines of rules that take something away from the "real" game, Metropolys achieves a genuine "2 in 1" by including two very different card sets in the box. One card deck has a single, simple goal for each player. This version is a game that I would be proud to pull out with kids and non-gamers. The second deck, entirely distinct and separate from the first "family" deck, includes not only a more complicated set of goals for each player, but multiple (sometimes conflicting) goals for each player. This is the meaty gamers' game that is so good I want to play it again and again. While I am not usually a fan of abstracts, and already have too many collecting dust on my shelf, and while any honest assessment must admit that theme is non-existent in Metropolys, the game arc, excellent tension, tough choices and challenging look ahead makes this a big winner for me. Did I mention playing time is short enough that it won't interfere with playing longer meaty games on game night? Another huge plus. And, while a knock against the game seems to be that the board graphics interfere with game play, I'd agree only a little: while the board takes some getting used too, I have many other titles in my collection (for example, El Capitan) that have worse usability issues. A third of a game in, and difficulty with the graphics were resolved for even the most critical player at our table. This is a game that I am not only thrilled to own, but one that I think will see a lot of table time in different groups and different settings.

You have get control of parts of the town. You have goals that give you extra points. In order to reach that you bid on a part by putting a building on it (number 1-13). Your opponent chooses a part next to it (wich isn't build on) and bids higher if he wants it. The highest bidder gets the part of town he was standing on. 

Problem is that not all the parts of town are good (additional tokens on them)and you only have 13 buildings.

Nice game, but the colours could have been clearer.

Surprisingly, this is a short brain-burner of a game.  There's definitely a tactical edge to it, and there's a need for being able to recognize spatial areas in order to play the game best.  The mechanism for bidding guarantees a different way to play the game each time, but the tactics will remain the same from game to game.  It's interesting, and intriguing at the same time.  I think the game may work best with 4, because then no regions are removed from play, and there are fewer dead-ends where players can run themselves into a corner to ensure a spot.  There are certainly other places on the board to do so, but adding two or three extras seems like a bad idea.

Here's a Euro that just hits the right spots for me, but apparently not for everyone.  It plays fairly quick but has great elements of bluffing and bidding.  Early on you feel like you lack a sense of direction even though you're looking at a map of the path you need to follow to accomplish your objective.  As the game progresses, you need to reevaluate whether you want to get the most points from your stated (hidden) objective or try to get them through other mean.  Knowing when to bid and corner areas to take advantage of when winning is critical.  But if you don't like bidding games then this one probably isn't for you.  I'm always happy to sit down to this game as I know it won't go too far over an hour in length.  One last thing I have to mention is I absolutely abhor the board.  The colors run together and some areas are hard to define what they border.  Despite this one issue it's a game I would heartily recommend.

Another in the recent line of "superfillers".  A 30-45 minute game that does a nice job of combining auction and area control type mechanics.  I like it a lot for what it is - a short family game.

Area majority and bidding go together well in this charming little game. I sold it at some point but found it at a good price second hand and added it to my collection again. I need to play it again soon.

I think the game has a lot going for it. A unique enough system. Tension. Fun. However, the graphic design has let it down. It is overly busy, and I wish they had brought out an edition closer to the prototype. Nice box cover though

Early on the game is a game of chicken. Who is going to spend their high numbers first? Then it gets tight as you have less and less choices. I like the middle to end game. The first part is ok. Overall, it is a good game.

Rating after one play via jsp-mag.com.

So far, it seems like a lot of very abstract scattering of pieces, trying to be the person who gets to drop all your remaining pieces in the 1-space holes and end the game. Not real interesting, but I'm willing to give it more plays to see if it gets better. It may also be a game that doesn't translate to play-by-email very well.

A neat blend of auction and spatial play. Oddly, the "expert" (random) setup can lead to unbalanced games unless players take steps to give the tokens a fair distribution. The game is at its best when played quickly. I'd prefer not to play it with overanalytical players.

A quick and simple, perhaps not very deep, but intriguing game with a very different auction mechanic in which the location you're bidding for changes with each bid. Unlike "normal" auctions, it works pretty well with two.

The game is a balancing act: getting buildings down so as not to be left behind vs. holding them back to outbid people later on. Getting valuable tokens (and avoiding penalty ones) vs. getting the neighbourhoods you actually want. Achieving your goals vs. not revealing what they are too early on and getting blocked!

The only downside is the murky colour scheme used for the board artwork. It's a real shame because the rest of the art is great!

Cool auction game with hidden goals. Has a great spatial element to it. The board wasn't as bad as people had made it out to be, I had no problems with it. Very simple game but variety in hidden goals and board setup gives it some good replay value. Plays well with two but I'd really like to see how chaotic things get with 3-4 players.

Somehow (despite the commonly hated board design) I like the way it looked. However, it was nothing more than a simple bidding game. In other words, your options felt very limited.

Will replay at next opportunity. Not sure about all the secret objectives; we played with the Neighborhood, Area, and expansion pinks. The pinks are really strong - three specific areas for 9 points. By comparison, you need three specific areas for many of the Area cards (three lake, three chained, three statue) but you're only getting 4-7 points. Another issue with the pinks, you are in a stronger position if your pink lines up with your Neighborhood objective. Looking at only the Area expansions, chained (4 for a three contiguous chain) is really weak. It's a better point-per-building ratio to take three that correspond to your Neighborhood. Moreover, the district objective (4 per district you have three) offers the same points but much greater flexibility, allowing you to pursue the trendy neighborhood tiles. The bridge objective is solid because some spots overlook two bridges, and the point payout is the same as the Neighborhood objectives. The statue objective is among the riskiest because the positions are so specific, everyone can see that you are striving for it, and your opponents have an incentive to shaft you if there's a trendy neighborhood tile near a statue that also helps them fulfill their Area or Neighborhood objective. (Easy to drop a 13, also pick up five points for the highest building in the district, while denying you 7.)

Setup positions are random but can render some players' hidden agendas worth more or less points from the get-go. There are also too few of the hidden agendas, which makes guessing easy and reduces replayability. The gameplay is not immersive but the bidding mechanic is combined well with the area control mechanic. Player interaction is reasonably high. Artwork is quite bad in that it is not functional. Game component quality is ok.

This game is an odd combination of auction and spatial game.  This oddness will make it hard for some folks to grasp... but once you grok how to make things happen there is a really interesting game to be played here.  I really like how the hidden goals make so many spaces have different values to different players game to game making the "auction" prices far from automatic.

I went through three stages of thought about the board.  When first looking it over I thought it was very attractive... then I wasn't sure how easy it would be to play on as it seemed a bit busy making some important features kind of blend in.  Then while playing I had no trouble and all seeing what I needed to see.  A nice functional board if you can tune out the busyness.  Love the big chunky buildings too!

The bidding is for sure the most unique and frustrating aspect of Metropolys.  Rarely does the opening proposal go unopposed unless you start with a high value or if there is no legal placement.  Sometimes you would pass only to find the auction has extended onto the neighborhoods you really wanted but there is nothing you can do.  This unpredictability decreases as buildings are erected and the board is filled up.

I dislike the fact that probably nearly half of the spaces available offer no incentive for a given player, thus effectively eliminating that person from the bidding.  I also did not care for the times when one has to sacrifice himself and make a claim for a useless neighborhood just to prevent someone getting it too cheaply.  This is most evident towards the late game and especially important if he is able to trigger the ending condition.

The hidden objectives of the advanced version allow more ways to score.  However, they seemed to be unbalanced in terms of their individual values and not necessarily because one is more difficult to achieve than the other.  It also becomes fairly obvious as the game progresses who has what, which removes the tension.  Overall not a bad experience considering how fast it could be played.

I'm not sure why Metropolys rubbed me the wrong way as harshly as it did.  Could it be that there's a pretense of a theme?  That's certainly not bothered me before.  The atrocious art direction?  Nah, although that doesn't help matters.  How about the fact that it's overpriced for what you get?  Most Ystari games are.  No, I think it's a culmination of these, plus the perception for me that the game just lacks a soul.  Dry and unengaging.

I've played a decent number of two-player games of this, and it's a delicious game of tricking your opponent into helping you get what you want, while hoping that you're not stuck with one of the stepping/bluffing stones along the way, and that your opponent doesn't obstruct your plans.  With three or four players, the dynamics are a bit different, but it's — well, different, but equally good.  You can feel like you're not participating in the game, but it usually leads to consecutive, stronger strikes later.

After 5+ Plays: I'd been wanting to try this for a while, and I really liked it. I'm a little worried about how balanced the different bonus goals are, but I'll have to play it more to find out. I'm looking forward to trying it with two.

--Update: I'm upping this rating from 8 to 9.  There really aren't any other games like this, and that's something I've grown to appreciate more with time.

Reminds me a lot of that game where there is a grid of dots, and both players draw lines to attempt to close a box. If you close a box, you go again. The same principles apply here, with players attempting to guide the buildings into a deadend for themselves so they can control the placements. The secret objectives and Metro / Neighbourhoods / Ruins features add a lot more thought to the game.

Cada jugador recibe un set de edificios de distintos tamaños. Con ellos comenzarán subastas por distintos sectores de la ciudad colocando una ficha al lado de la otra. La mayoría de PV los obtienen por los objetivos recibidos, aunque hay PV al edificio más alto de cada sector, fichas de PV y otros más.

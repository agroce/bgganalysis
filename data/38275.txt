I wanted to be a little longer but you can play several times in a row. The first making a mistake is out of the game.

After few games, things start to get repetitive. Robotory doesn't offers enough to keep my interest in it.

Ounce for ounce this is a good game.  Having said that, its size (playing field, number of pieces, etc., not its actual size) limits it somewhat so that no matter what we do it always seems to comes down to whoever moves last.  I would like to see this game remixed or expanded in some way that would give it some staying power.  Physically speaking, the components are much too small for me, even for a portable game.

Robotory is an abstract game for 2 which plays in 10 minutes, but because of this I actually think the gameplay is somewhat lacking. Sure you need to think, and preferably a couple of moves ahead, but the game is just so short that there aren’t really many decisions to be made. There are many other abstract games for 2 I would rather play, even though they take longer to play (like the games in the GIPF-series or more family-oriented abstract games like Ingenious); I think the rewards of playing these games make up for the added playing time. This game is just too uninteresting.

I played this with my 12 year old daughter.   It's a fun, quick little game, marred only by the lightweight board.  A bit heavier grade of cardboard ~ or even tiles instead of a folding board ~ might have improved the experience.

If you want a simple and quick abstract game, this is a great choice. This is a kind of tug-o-war between two players which try to get the two robots to their side at the end of the game. It’s clever, but I am concerned with the long term replayability.

Robo-Tory is a tactical game with elements of timing and proper placement.  The idea is to place cubes in such a fashion so as to maneuver the robots into your territory and force the depletion of one of the cube colors to achieve victory.  While this may sound like a deep challenge, in reality it is a fairly light exercise that is simply too basic.  There is no sophistication.  The playing area is small and a player's options are limited.  There isn't much room here for cleverness, deep thought, or skillful maneuvers.  As my friend Kevin Nunn commented, "It is too straight-forward."  While the game plays swiftly -- 5 minutes or so -- there isn't enough here to maintain one's interest beyond a few playings.

Robotory is a decptively simple enough little tug of war over three tokens, using attractor discs (energy discs) to chart a path for the robots, until the time when the energy supply is entirely alloted and the person with the most robots on their side of the line is the victor.

Because a player has to play discs to draw discs, and exhaust the supply, and a player can play a disc, move a robot or draw his disc supply back up to four, the positioning of robots, supply of discs and timing of actions all come into play.

After (1) play I am starting this at a 6.25, but really it could swing anywhere with play if I grow to appreciate it more, or to ignore it more.  I do not find it hugely compelling, but there is certainly room for a deal of thinking about this before I run out play with it, and it is very small and packs smaller, if travel games are desired.

Neat little abstract strategy game. Wish the board was chipboard instead of paper (can be hard to make it lay flat) and the little energy chits are tiny, but that should not steer one away from picking this game up.

Edit: Traded off. It's not a bad game, just wasn't getting any play ATM (my collection is steering towards complex solo-play-possible games and easy party/high-player-number games). I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to grab another copy.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (January 2012)

It´s been awhile since I last played this. I don’t remember all the game nuances, but I remember clearly that I didn’t like it. The game components seem very cheap, and the folded board never stays flat making hard to play on it. The rules are pretty easy to grasp, but the game is very boring for me. If I’m going to play and abstract, I prefer Kamisado or Yinsh. Robotory is way too simple.

On the good side, the game has no luck (I think) and it plays very quickly.

I will give Robotory a second chance, after all I played it only once and it wasn’t a very pleasant experience. For now, I´m leaning toward selling/gifting the game.

Game comes in a small box. There are 3 larger pieces, indicating the different Robots. Also 20, very much smaller, pieces which indicate the supply cubes. The board folds out with a minor gripe that it can be a little tricky to keep flat. The rulebook explains the game perfectly, it is very quick to learn and very easy to explain to your opponent. With few pieces, it packs away quickly and easily afterwards.

The game itself is a very simple concept, but does have a lot of strategy and can be fiendishly tricky to win. It plays very quickly and is definitely fun. A great, quick, little 2 player game.

Most abstracts have enough going on to keep my attention, but few have enough to make me want to play them over and over again.  Robotory is a short game with a small footprint, and it seems clever enough for now, but it seems to be an aggressive game, where your best move might be a defensive play that limits your opponent's choices.  It's not bad, but it can feel a little frustrating.  I wonder if this will have a lot of staying power in the long run.

My first thought when opening [i]Robo-Tory[/i]'s slim box was that someone had forgotten to put the game inside. Then I noticed the tiny gameboard and bag of bits underneath the paper rules, rules that spanned two pages thanks only to multiple illustrations. Was this game nothing more than a puff of air?

Those worries dissipated once I discovered that the game creates a pleasing puzzle for both players as they engage in a tug-of-war over the trio of robots and learn how to deal with unintended consequences.

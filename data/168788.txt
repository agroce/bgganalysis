A very light game. When you get a rulebook with a lot of flavor-stuff but less rules you know what's going on. More a "beer & prezel"-game. Glad I just went in for the basic box plus the heroes belonging to this factions.

To shallow for my taste.

More plays - more insights: As soon as one captures (destroys that is) one of the VP spots or is able to kill the Kraken the game becomes heavily "imbalanced" - it is over soon since the extra abilities one receives  work as a speed-factor for ending the game.

While this mechanism prevents the game from draggin' on forever it also mmakes it clear who will win the game.

Droped my rating again from 5 to 4.

Resumee 2016: A lot of eye-candy with less and less of a game.

Backed the Kickstarter.
I wasn't overly impressed with the models, which is the main reason I backed the kickstarter. They are still great models, but I was expecting something amazing. Hopefully the models will look amazing with some paint on them.
So game pay so far has been improving with each time we have played. I like the endless mindless crew, and the heroes on both side work really well.

Completely flew under my radar, had never heard of it until I saw it demoed at gencon 2015. MOBA style board game, where you are trying to destroy objectives on an opposing pirate. Multiple "maps" provided via the french, chinese boats. Looks really fucking cool, but $100 price tag means I'll be trading for it if I get it.

RATING: 9
I love this game, but I was a rough first play experience, and I think that it is a good example of how a lot of people will initially experience this game. One team, my team, quickly understood what the game was about and had a lot of fun throwing caution to the wind and going for objectives. The other team played Rum and Bones like it was a skirmish game, focusing completely on killing our heroes and keeping theirs alive, while getting increasingly frustrated that they were behind on objectives. They were so irritated by the game that I went home from the game night and went through their deck and heroes again to see if they were just horribly unbalanced, and frankly they were fine. Additionally, their play style caused the game to drag out an hour longer than it should have. All of this being said I cannot blame them for accidentally playing the game this way, as most games reward this style of play; this one just doesn't. I really hope I can get them to give it another shot after what they learned from the first session, since I think this is a fantastic chucking dice game and am really looking forward to playing more of it. Note: first play was with six people, which just from that session I imagine might be my preferred way to play. The team dynamic is just fantastic in a way I haven't really seen in any other game in my collection.

Great fun!

I feared it wouldn't be since I read a few negative reviews before actually playing for the first time, but I tremendously enjoy it so far.

Lots of back and forth going on.
One game both players had an "if we had time for starting another game I'd give up now" moment and the tides turned again.

Try never to lose all three of your heroes in one turn ;-)

If you concentrate too much on destroying crew instead of setting up ways to destroy objectives, it can take significantly longer than the suggested play time.

It's a tabletop MOBA!
While certainly an Ameritrash game, it's fantastically fun and has a surprising strategic depth. There's a really strong push-pull to the flow of the game and knowing when to hold back vs when to push is crucial to success.

Very fun. I highly encourage trying it out.

RATING: 8.8
Fun, fluid, easy to grasp zone combat with two competing pirate crews. Chuck dice for combat, activate Hero powers, damage and capture objectives. There are a few minor variables in each game, depending what you draw, what factions you choose, which Heroes, when the Kraken and Sea Dragon appear, etc, but it could certainly use some more. The only other grip I have is that it should be easier to set up multiplayer without everyone needing to share factions. You can do it, but often have to turn to fan maps. Otherwise, Rum & Bones delivers, and it looks gorgeous.

Kickstarter backer, and although I only played it once, it was very enjoyable to play.  The play time is almost double what the box says though.  When playing, if you focus on the objectives, then it could be a fast game.  Yet, why go after the objectives when you can attack the other player directly?  I mean, you are pirates after all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
MOBA in a board game in the best way possible. While your underlings smash into each other, your heroes move around and do real damage. It looks and feels like a ship boarding fight in a pirate movie. Slightly luck based, but for me this only adds to the excitement!

RATING: 7.5
I never played the game without the Upgrade Kit, and I've only played the Bone Devils - who I really like. Condition play is really fun, and I really like the crew spawning mechanics. See notes for base game under Second Tide.

Because kickstarters are such a mess of content and seem to exist only to generate endless BGG database entries, I'll be filling in the same rating for all the various separate bits and bobs I have.

Side note - I wish Kickstarters would a) stop pretending that they will ever go to retail and b) packaging up add-ons and exclusives that will never be reprinted as if they will be retail products. I threw away SO MUCH packaging when I got the product form both Kickstarters (second hand - and most of it hadn't been opened by the original pledger).

Having played this once, I'm not likely to want to play it again. It just didn't grab me. While the minis were gorgeous, it didn't feel like there was that much going on.

1st edition rules can make the game play out a little swingy: if first player has a really good turn one, they are hard to stop.  If first player has a really bad turn one, they might never recover.  Alternating the individual hero activations between players (like they did with 2nd edition rules) makes the game flow better and reduces the 'down time' between turns.

Fairly good miniatures game. Deckhands movement shouldn't have to be so one dimensional. Just move forward until you are blocked, killed, or reach the edge of the ship (what happens then? Fall overboard or turn into a queen?) Deckhands should have more options otherwise much of the deck is not used. I'm sure deckhands are not supposed to be mindless. Sorry to go on about that but, in my opinion, it spoilt an otherwise fairly good game.

There's part of me that feels for this game because it is one that will be misunderstood. I have a problem with games that have a disconnect, where the win conditions and how to get there are opaque. R&B feels like a game where you should be beating up on your opponent, but the reality is you need to send your characters past your opponent and onto their ship to cause the damage that leads to victory. Still though with so many check boxes ticked with this game I'll be playing and keeping for years and years.

Written after 2 plays:
Another CMON game that hits my buttons in just the right way. Not too many rules (but deffinitely not stupid), great fun, time just flies by when you play and it looks amazing (mainly the miniatures and few maxiatures). Each fraction plays very different, they don't just have different looking heroes and more ships. But still they are very well ballanced. Of course, there is a lot of dice chucking but that's what you would expect from this kind of game. 
BUT the game is deffinitely designed for 2 people, not 2-6. The rules for higher player count fell artificial and I don't think it is still that fun.

I would consider this to be the ultimate guilty pleasure game. The rules are simple, there isn't a ton of depth and the game can swing heavily to the person who kills the Kraken. Despite this, the game is a lot of fun and has fantastic component quality. I especially love the artwork and the extra fluff in the rulebook. I definitely want to get the expansions and see how the game improves with the army draft mechanics.

A lot of good stuff here, rather surprisingly. Captures a lot of the tempo and special ability combos of MOBAs. I don't like the theme, but I do like what they did with it in order to make MOBA conventions vaguely coherent.
[EDIT] Very fun and fast. You need to house rule the Kraken (credit should not automatically be given to the last hit) and perhaps the number of mercenaries, but this is a winner.

Really represents a MOBA game very well. Love the pirate theme and all the mechanics that go with it (the kraken, going overboard, etc...).

The one thing though is that it's easy to lose sight of the game objective and end up slugging it out for 2 hours only to realize you should have been killing objectives. The other thing that can lengthen the game is the kraken spawning and clearing out a bunch of you your opponents stuff. This leads to having to wait a couple of turns to recover your forces and to defeat the kraken to get back to fighting for objectives. Luckily defeating the kraken gives you a really nice boost as well as some victory points.

Good but not great - however, with added 2nd season turn structure and scoring becomes much better. Can't wait for 2nd tide, as it will surly make this a great game.

As is, the game can drag on, and doesn't really have an arc to it. I have all the expansions and KS exclusives, which adds a whole strategic teram-building layer to the game; I wouldn't play it with just the base.

Had so much expectation for this one, but it disappointed. Because of the constant minion spawns + almost always 3 Heroes in play, the game just progresses very slowly.

The fact that enemies block movement spaces makes it worse. There just doesn't seem to be enough places to move, unless you rig over, which places you at a disadvantage. Killing minions just kept going back and forth with no end in sight.

This is a tug-of-war game which just never seems to go anywhere.

Aye,matey wait til ye hear of this tale! I love pirates and pirate stories of plunder and treasure so I thought this would be right up my alley! Right out of the box the figures and design detail are PHENOMENAL! Gameplay? Well let's just say if you love playing Lol (league of legends) then this is right up your alley. For beginning boardgames beware it has a steep learning curve and by steep I mean your first playthrough might be agitating and frustrating depending on if you play with learned gamers that catch on fast. This isnt a boardgame for the faint of heart and requires strategy and it is dice fated so if you aren't rolling well....well you might not stalk away the happiest pirate on ye ship. That being said I did enjoy the game quite a bit and look forward to playing it again real soon. Happy gaming everyone!

Rum & Bones can be summed up by the following four words, 'fun filled pirate goodness'. It's far from perfect but the sheer enjoyment, theme, great miniatures and simplicity drag it up a point or two for me. 

The game board is made up of two separate pirate ships that are paced alongside each other and locked in mortal combat pon the high seas. Each ship has 5 objectives worth 2 victory points each, the first team to get 6 victory points by destroying 3 of the objectives on the enemy ship wins.(Though you can also get 2 victory points if you dare take on either the Kraken or sea dragon)

Deck hands and Bosuns quickly pile onto the board, their movement and attacks are both satisfying and simple, brining much to the game. They plod across the gangplanks one space per turn attacking all enemies in their path.

More importantly, each team has 5 heroes to choose from and can deploy up to three at a time, but don't get too attached as they won't last long in the heat of battle. Luckily though, a defeated hero isn't dead only KO'd for a round before they can return to the fray. Hero's have 3 actions per turn, and are allowed any combination of movement and the three actions on their card. The hero's make up the bulk of the gameplay and are well designed, each with their own unique feel. A highlight of the movement is rigging across to the enemies ship, this can be quicker than crossing the often crowded gangplanks but always runs the risk of leaving your character dumped in the drink for the rest of the round.

Each team has a deck of tide cards that can be used at any appropriate time, but take care how freely you use them lest you incur the wrath of the legendary Kraken who's appearance can upset the best laid plans.

I can't express how much fun this game is, it's an absolute riot. My 8 year old and his friends love it as do my other kids. However 8 year olds will need an adult player especially for the first few plays. Additionally one character card includes a swear word, so be aware before letting kids play.

But it isn't all good, I can't help feel that this game could have used a bit more play testing as a few rules either lack clarity, or are simply omitted altogether. These are never serious, but just a bit more work could easily have ironed out these little problems, so its a bit of a shame.

Overall though it's one of the most distinctive and fun games I have played to date. I highly recommend it for some simple yet exciting play. After all, there is little more fun than hurling pirate insults at the land lubbers opposite as you take out their deck gun. AAARRRGGGHHH!

Good pirate MOBA (only pirate MOBA?) if that' what you're looking for - but not to my taste (don't like pirates, don't like MOBAs).

Gorgeous artwork and minis. Clever game design (love the idea of rigging) to reflect the theme and MOBAs. Interesting characters and strategy (?) options. WILDLY swingy (literally) with kraken everywhere, heroes rigging across the map and cards that change everything in a moment. 

Your job is to figure out how to win amongst the chaos, not smash heroes in the face. If the latter happens, game can take too long. Should not last two hours (as my first play did). Overstays its welcome in those cases.

It's an Ameritrash game trying to be a MOBA-lite. While it does capture the essence of a MOBA, I don't think it's a particularly compelling game. I would rather play a real MOBA than this game any day, it's far too stripped down and simplified, although the basic MOBA mechanics are there. 

I'm not a believer in patterning a boardgame to a computer game, because simply put the computer game will almost always be significantly better, and the boardgame version will just be a pale shadow of it. This is especially true in the world of Ameritrash games of the RPG or strategy genres. So I'd rather not see games like this come to light. 

To make it worse, this game is made by Cool Mini, which means they will charge you an arm and a leg for half the game and charge you another arm and a leg for the rest of it. I find it a disgusting practice for a mediocre game, so I can only really recommend this game to people who love minis first and foremost and can't really recommend it to actual boardgamers, and certainly not for computer gamers. 

This isn't the way to win video gamers over to the analogue hobby, folks.

I loved this team vs team tower defense game. The idea is Team 1 and team 2 each have their own pirate ships, with objectives worth points. Each spawn point has a steady stream of brutes who advance on the other ship, and each player controls 1 or more hero characters who are the real damage dealers. You fight the other player's guys and try to bust up their ship before they bust up yours. If players use too many action cards, a giant sea monster spawns in the middle and attacks everyone. It has the right amount of strategy to luck, a great sense of humor, and the most interesting thing of all is that nearly every other turn I felt like my team was unstoppable and was going to win and then on the next turn I felt like my cause was hopeless in the face of my opponent's onslaught.

The game can run a little long at times, under the right circumstances, which some players have felt is a problem. I've usually enjoyed the process of the game enough to not be very bothered by this, although there are some expansion characters with frustrating auto kill abilities that can extend the game beyond my liking, as they aren't particularly good at taking out objectives, which is the ultimate point of the game. That being said, these are expansion issues and edge case situations in what's otherwise a fantastic game.

A very solid MOBA rendition in a board game.  There are some rough edges (last hit killing the kraken, imbalanced heroes with free form customization) -- those are critical but fairly easy to fix.  However, much of the game is thematic, full of tactical choices, and not too fiddly to execute.

If I played more 2 player games,  I'd probably rate this a point higher.  If it didn't need house rules, it would probably get another point on top of that.

Another very promising concept destroyed by a lack of play testing and a superficial implementation of game mechanics. The concept is extremely attractive and the game may be fun if.... they would understand that in top wargames dice should not solely decide the winner. Ideally, dice have no place in war games, but  if they are tied to a fun mechanic they are an acceptable addition. This game can be translated to -- roll a die to see who wins...

05-12-2015. Rated after 3 plays. I do like Rum & Bones. R&B is unique, two armies of pirates slog towards each other in the middle of two ships. In the middle of the churning chaos of these marines, heroes with ref sheets, activated abilities with costs are the true gameplay pieces that count.

Both players try to obtain 6 objectives, which can be objective tokens, the kraken or sea monsters. Objectives also give you special abilities if you defeat them.

Fun game. But the deckhands and bosun figures are not very itneresting and quite fiddly.

Coolmini make another game just to sell minis... it's wrong?? Of course not! 
   But it's like you make all the preparation and all the tactics and decide in a roll of dice... so it's better to be luck than smart... 
   The push a system based on luck and hope that you "get the point" with a LOT of cool minis... 
   Sometimes i wonder if they want to make cool games or just some miniatures and selling with 200% profit just to see wrap it up on a game... 
   Anyways... it's a OK game... nothing more... with you have all the expansions, and spend a lot of money on it, it's a big game on components... i prefer spend my time on a less roll the dice and wait to be luck game.

MOBA-style game where players control colourful pirate heroes accompanying AI-controlled NPC mooks. The goal is to destroy objectives on the opponent's ship, e.g. cannons. The mooks exist largely as obstacles and because their defeat provides coins, required for the heroes' most powerful attacks.

Lovely production and some neat thematic touches (rigging, characters, kraken attack...) but basically a dicefest. Still, as dicefests go you could do a lot worse: it's quite streamlined and there's real variety in the factions and characters.

The downside is that characters seem wildly unbalanced and I have major reservations about some rules -- in particular, it seems far too easy to push pirates overboard and the penalty too severe. There's also something not quite right about the kraken: the penalty for using kraken cards is too low, it's too easy to kill once it arrives, and too distorting a gameplay element for something bound to appear in every game.

CMoN games never seem to get enough development and this one is no exception. If you're just in it for a rollicking pirate battle, though, it's well worth picking up. I almost regret not backing the Kickstarter.

Exciting battle game. Lots of cool special abilities. A bit slow paced, and the Kraken is way too much of a bonus for whoever gets lucky and kills it.

I like the idea here, and the variety (if you got the Kickstarter version) but there are a couple of issues.

First is the fiddliness. Moving all of the deckhands every turn is very fiddly. I was hoping it wouldn't be too bad after watching the gameplay videos, but in practice it gets annoying pretty quickly.

Then there are a couple of gameplay related issues. The first is an obvious first player problem. If the first player gets lucky he can take out an objective or two by his second turn. Even if he doesn't get lucky, he forces the second player to react and lose momentum. He also gets to draw and use his cards before the other player, and the cards can have a big impact on the game. This could have been easily addressed (and there are some variants on the BGG forums that seem promising) but the fact that it wasn't addressed makes me wonder how well the rest of the game will hold up balance-wise.

Another thing is the Kraken. It's an NPC that each player can attack but only one person gets the credit for killing it. This seems really luck dependent (if you have bad dice rolls, you might not get to finish it off like you were planning so your opponent gets the easy points) and detracts from the player-vs-player aspects of the game.

I really wanted to like this, but the gameplay issues and the fiddliness keep me from it.

Update: Rum & Bones Second Tide is out, making it apparent that this version was just a publicly released prototype. Second Tide fixes a lot of my issues with the game system and is actually fun to play now.

Sold. Get Second Tide.

There is definately some fun here! I'm not sold on the MOBA side to the game; the "more than 2 players" rules are not ideal; and the replayability is probably quite limited.

Ameritrash filler with some meat. Variable hero powers on a grid movement of opposing pirate ships broadside. Action point system to zerg crew, tactical use of the pirate heroes, while softening them up with your deck cannons. I really like how the pirate heroes get more bad ass and become a force to reckon with. The rigging action is entertaining, as is the mechanic of destroying opponent ship tiles to gain special advantages. Add the tactical play from the tide cards and throw in a kracken into the mix--how can this not be fun?

This game is high energy, strongly thematic, and has excellent art and miniatures. There is plenty of design space left unexplored, and few serious flaws in balance, but all of that can be easily dealt with with simple house rules - and I believe the sequel is eliminating a lot of the issues.

Nevertheless, the wife and I enjoy playing one-on-one, and the high school strategy games club loves playing it even with odd team arranges (3 v 2, etc.). 

Overall, glad I bought this game and would buy it again (but hope I  don't have to; it's expensive!).

Second Tide fixes almost everything slow or problematic about this game. It is a strict improvement over this first edition.

Abysmally slow, prone to long periods of time where not much ground is made by either team. Kraken is both a blessing (may wreck your opponent so you can hit his base), and a curse (may completely wipe both of your boards so can extend the game for turns at a time). 

It's okay I guess.

Found this game fun and exciting. I was worried because I hear repeatedly that it wouldn't play well with 6 people.
It played great with 6 people and everyone was fully engaged throughout the whole game even when characters got knocked out. A 6.4 geek rating seems unjustified. Looking to buy expansions in the future.

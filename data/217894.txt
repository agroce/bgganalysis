Quick summary: the tile laying (less restrictive) and unit placement (with unit types hidden) of Carcassonne combined with the story based decision making of Above and Below.

To start the game, each player receives a set of three dungeon map tiles, their choice of one of four different factions, and three XP tokens. There are four different types of characters (Delvers) that comprise a clan: brutes (roll three weaker dice), thieves (roll loot oriented dice), mage (get +3 fighting power in rooms with a magical rift and roll two weak dice), and finally leaders (who roll one loot oriented die along with a stronger combat die). The factions each have a unique special ability that can be activated by spending an XP token and two Delvers of one type and four of the other types.

Play consists of placing a dungeon tile from their handing into the existing dungeon, with the only limitation in placement being that corridors on placed tiles must line up with existing corridors, unless that restriction is overridden by spending an XP token. A single Delver can be placed on the newly placed tile, and if any rooms or corridors are closed off as result, the room/corridor is resolved. If a torch is in the room where the Delver is placed, it goes face up, otherwise it goes face down. If a torch is added to an existing room, any Delvers in that room are now turned face up as well.

In resolving a corridor or room, if no Delvers are in that area, nothing happens.

If only one faction is an area being resolved, then an Encounter card is read, and the player with that faction must decide between one of two choices, which they will end up either failing or succeeding on. If successful, they'll end up with half of the gold cards shown in the area, plus any treasures. If they fail, they might end up with a little something or nothing at all.

If two factions are in the area being resolved, they'll end up fighting for the available prizes. Fights consist of rolling the dice indicated on the Delver tiles and counting up combat ability and bonus spoils tallies. The higher combat skill gets the lions share of the gold and treasure cards, while the highest (untied) spoil count gets a bonus gold or treasure card.

The game ends by moving the turn marker along its track one space for each sun diagram found on the placed tiles. Once the turn marker reaches the end, every player gets an even number of turns and then game ends. The victory points on the gold and treasure cards that were collected by each faction determines the winner.

Overall, an interesting blend of tile laying and unit placement along with some (so far as I have read) reasonably well written encounter cards that provide a solidly themed competitive dungeon exploration game.

Delve has a combination of simple gameplay filled with interesting choices, a Choose-your-own-adventure style encounter mechanic that has theme (and humor) bursting from the stitching in your leather armor, and great components with gorgeous art. I will be delving through this dungeon over and over again, trying to find all the secret treasures the game has to offer.

I enjoyed the experience of this once, but I would not want to play it on the regular. Reading the choose-your-own-adventure text was fun (at one point we had four cards featuring "an old warlock" in a row and it started to seem like the dungeon was actually a retirement home for wizards) and the tile laying and area control stuff was fine, but there's so much stuff bolted on to what's basically a filler game that a learning game with four people took something like two and a half hours.

Takes a little bit to get used to the tile laying rules, but once you're moving it is a lot of fun!  Empty room are never empty but rather miniature chapters of a choose-your-own-adventure book where you have to use your individual delver's stats to weigh over risks.  Definitely a unique concept to build your own dungeon,  Hope to see expansions on the situation cards because they are some of the best times in the game!

So bad our entire group quit 1/3 of the way through.  Rounds took way too long.  The tiles were hard to see mostly because they are very shiny and the corridors and gold rooms look too similar.  The doors are also hard to see.  The character chips were too large and covered the icons (or the tiles were too small).  We had trouble fitting them in their correct rooms.  And loot was far too random.  The tiles were too random also.  One of our group kept drawing the "play another tile" tiles.  Ugh.  Luckily we played a demo copy.

RATING: N/A
This looks like another game in the designer's tradition of taking a solid existing Eurogame system (Pandemic, Risk Express aka Art of War, and now Carcassonne: The Castle) and adding a bunch of "theme" and luck to it.  I found myself attracted to these games due to my love of the underlying system, but then frustrated by the added luck-based resolutions.  I'm pretty sure this one isn't for me either.  It seems very tedious for every scoring to involve resolution of a story card.

This is a fun tile laying game you can play in about in a hour. The most fun comes from the encounter cards. I love listening to the little story and then hope I pick the right choice after. Dice chucking to battle for loot is also great fun.

Some cute ideas in this light, tile laying, dungeon crawl. . The encounter cards have flavor text with a binary decision, which is mostly run or fight, but there are others that are more interesting. The characters in your party have some differentiation, but I wish there would have been more synergy. Dice rolling is not my favorite mechanic for a random element, and this is pretty vanilla in that regard.
I think this would be a fun game with kids, but for me personally, I find this to be a bit longish for a light chaotic game. Definitely one I could recommend though, if the idea sounds interesting to you.

Carcassonne with significantly less strategy. Delve also presents itself as a sort of narrative game, but -- for the majority of cards -- it is merely the illusion of choice.

Delve is a serviceable game, and aside from some questionable production choices, there isn't anything wrong with it. There just isn't anything great about it.

The encounters are the star of this game.  having to choose option A or option B is cool.  The tiles are pretty good as well but the characters peices are a pain. the plastic squares are to big to fit in some of the rooms.  I made small two sided tokens and solved the problem.

RATING: N/A
2-4 players? A tile-placement game with fighting and dice rolling. Ugly tiles. Videos 151695 and 146937 shows unexciting gameplay. (So boring that I couldn't get through either video.) There are fewer big, exciting dice-rolling moments than there could be for three reasons: 1) reroll icons delay the final result, 2) players don't know what they need to roll to succeed in encounters, and 3) players sometimes need to roll multiple times because there aren't always enough dice (e.g., when XP is used for additional dice). A solution to players not knowing what they need to roll to succeed in encounters: the player who reads an encounter must announce the test requirement, or roll for the fight, before the active player rolls. A solution to the lack of dice: buy two copies. Another problem with Delve is that the encounter cards are a bad mechanic for two reasons: 1) they can be memorized (/thread/1712751 and youtu.be/1-WS9lLP1qo), and 2) they include a lot of small text (youtu.be/MZHJm732pCc?t=25m46s) that must be read aloud, which slows the game. A solution to the encounter card problems is to read only the most fun option of each card (e.g., fight options at /image/3405046), read no other text, and do that option. Rules: /thread/1806501.

Finally got the Kickstarter version with addon to the table. It does play a bit long as others have said, but my son (8 years old) had a blast and wanted to play again right away. 

It's a great balance of luck and strategy for kids, although it doesn't have the depth that the best tile placement games have. The story element was fun, and the randomness is controlled by special abilities and deployment of XP tokens.

I suspect that Delve will find a regular spot on our dining room table.

RATING: 6
Tile-laying, dice combat, choose-your-own-adventure encounter cards. There's a lot going on here, most of it luck-driven. Those looking for a strategic challenge should probably look elsewhere.  The components are sturdy but the graphic design of the tiles is awful. Card art and dice are terrific. Delve is fun, but it's also too long and too rough around the edges. I'm going to keep it, but I don't think it will make it into the regular rotation.

Delve is a fun kids game. The high randomness keeps final scores close despite differing skill levels. Building a dungeon and the occasional fight for location control is very exciting. Encounters, which happen a lot, are fun but I wish the writing was more at the level of a 10-year old audience.

Some good ideas, but a mostly unfocused take on Carcassonne with a dungeon crawling theme. I was worried going in that the tiles would be confusing to figure out placement, which was further enforced by the rule book, but it ended up being fairly simple once I started playing. I think what bothers me about this game is how rooms are ultimately scored by either rolling dice or resolving an encounter. This sounds fine, in theory, but it just feels kind of disjointed and forced. Having to pause the game and score after every room can get tedious after awhile, which only serves to strip this experience of any excitement that is inferred by its title. Not a poor design...there's just nothing captivating about it.

Was okay but doubt I'd want to play it again other than to be sociable. When I saw the goofy artwork I thought "this is a game that desperately wants to be fun" and it was desperately trying to be fun but seemed too random and long (I would automatically play a sun tile just to advance the end of the game). Tiles were confusing with corridors and some rooms sharing a similar colour. Delver counters were too big and covered icons and were difficult to place in the correct segment if you drew something like a crossroads. Encounter cards just slowed down game play while another player narrated them. Felt like a game targeted at teenagers rather than gamers. Unsurprised to learn this was a Kickstarter.

Delve is a tile-laying dungeon exploration game with many of the same sensibilities of Carcassonne. Players place a tile from their hand, and then optionally place one of their pawns on it. When an area is closed, that area scores. Unlike Carcassonne, there aren't restrictions on placing your pawns in the same area as another player's pawn. In fact, the pawns fight when the room closes, each using dice according to what kind of pawn it is (which is usually hidden from other players). The winner gets the majority of the treasure printed on the tiles, and the losers may or may not get some rewards as well. Closed areas with no competition instead draw a card from a deck, which can have them make some sort of thematic choice, which may result in a fight or some alteration of the printed rewards. I thought this game was an interesting take on the Carcassonne system. While there is a decent bit of randomness, I did find it less dry than Carcassonne.

Carcassonne plus dice plus roleplaying minus strategy. The different faction powers do not feel balanced. The tile art is ugly and doesn't make for very nice looking room connections. Delver just sits in some awkward in between zone of being too long to be a filler and too random to be a full strategy game.

You know what's worse than a bad game? A decent game that's so marred by bad production that it's not worth keeping. I dropped the score 1.5 points due to design issues.

We played this game for the first time last night ("this" intentionally withheld for now). As I'm explaining the rules, I pull the top event card off the deck as an example. I can barely read it due to the tiny font. One of my friends couldn't read it at all.

This was portentous. The rules are reasonably simple, but key information is missing or misplaced in the rulebook. The playing pieces are too large for how they need to be used. The graphic design of the stickers makes things needlessly hard to see. The tiles have brown rooms and identically brown corridors separated by brown walls.

None of these issue are game killers, but there are so many. This feels like someone's carefully crafted but still amateurish hand made prototype of a good game still in development.

But...  I rather liked the game. Another player *loved* it. You *might* love it too. The game was "Delve". I don't want to talk you out of buying or playing it, but it is an example of why game production can be as important as game design.

(I might still keep it, but I might sell it to my friend who loved it instead.)

I feel like I dodged a bullet no backing this. Possibly the most random game I've ever played. From the dice rolling, to card and tile drawing. There is no strategy at all.

The game took far longer than it should have because of the tile laying and having to read cards aloud. Not a game for me.

Delve is an interesting mix of Carcassonne-esque tile placement and dungeon crawl dice chucking craziness.    Play a tile with some restrictions for how corridors are supposed to connect, add a guy to the tile, then resolve any finished rooms.  While the tile placing provides the framework its those room resolutions that are at the heart of this game with contested rooms being fought over by players with dice and even better... take a room by yourself and resolve it with a little story card!  I was afraid all the random dice chucking and treasure draws would bug me, but there is a bit of luck mitigation to be had and the way the dice and cards work still lead to predictable results more often than not... though throwing those dice in the close ones is pretty exciting!  I'm still a little annoying how hard it is to differentiate the hallways from the tan rooms and the player pieces are a bit big to always be able to easily tell what room they are in... but once you get past those fiddly problems with the game the play is pretty easy to grasp and a fun time to play.  My oldest daughter was pretty captivated by that first play (she's named all the characters and tells little stories about them interacting before the little story cards even come up!) and I'm sure I'll be going on plenty of Delving adventures.

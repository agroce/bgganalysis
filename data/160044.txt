Cleaner rules than sixth, for sure. The Psychic Phase is a big improvement. Tactical objectives leave me cold and I miss some the oddball stuff like jumping off buildings or special warzone traits.

7th Edition Warhammer, while entertaining, is considered -- by me -- to be one of the most unbalanced versions of Warhammer 40,000 I have ever played. So much so, I took a hiatus from 7th and waited until 8th came out. 7th will go down in my Warhammer career as my most hated version of one of my favorite wargames.

RATING: 8
I have a Blood Angel and a Dark Eldar army. 
I am late to the game and started in Sixth Edition. I like 7th better as I think it is cleaner and easier to play. I like the tactical objectives and the expanded missions.

As a long-time player of 40K, (since 1st edition), I am very impressed with this latest version of the rules. Thorough, complete, and most importantly it has an excellent index!

RATING: 7
So I quit warhammer for good about two years ago. I was a dedicated player for years collecting multiple armies. However, seventh ed. became just a huge, complicated and bloated rules monstrosity that it became no fun for casual players at all. To the game designers credit they corrected with eight ed. cutting the game back to a very tiny rules engine (four pages long). Kudos. But I'm not going back, the bitter taste of 7th is just to much and now I (and my money) are free for other pursuits.

As usual, one step forward and one step back.  Adds some interesting new concepts, forces Apocalypse rules into the core game (thereby breaking the central concept) and adds some new rules that seem poorly tested.

Migrating my comments over to 8th edition. I wasn't thrilled about buying new books, but the changes look to be for the better.

Very hard to judge objectively since the 40k universe is more than just the game.

The rules are bound by the game's history though and in desperate need of modernisation. The game can be fun and looks great but players really need to be on the same page about what they're about to play. With such lax rules the game is not really fit for competitive play.

EDIT: Completely superceded by the eight edition. No reason to go back.

Few games played. Previously played 5th edition - like the new psychic phase, unbound armies, overwatch in assaults.
The game still has the same problems as always:
As a casual (and not so frequent) 40k player, our group doesn't know all the books by heart - obviously should, since a huge portion of the time is often used searching for rule x that refers to rule y, either from the rulebook or codexes - both could have been laid out with more thought.
When it comes to miniatures, I consider to be first and foremost a modeller. But I also want to play. And yet the actual game often fails to capture the "feel" of the models and the fluff.

The return of the Psychic Phase was nice. This edition had fractal supplement creep like no other. It was possible for a Chaos player to have to reference 7 different books for their army.

Oh well, never did try it.  Have a shiny set of background books...  Currently still valid for Horus Heresy.

More of a hobby than a game. The game itself has some issues with army balance but sometimes you can forget about that once your army hits the table (as long as it's not grey plastic vs grey plastic).

If you play the game casually it's fine but due to the frequency of releases at times leaving you with outdated rulebooks and the plethora of extra content that can be daunting at times the game itself is better left as a hobby for those interested in model building and painting. There's much better wargames you can spend your time and money if all you care about is gameplay.

This is probably more of a reflection of my life circumstances than the game itself, but it just gets harder and harder to organise games of 40k due to it's size, space and time requirements. I have substantial armies as do some of my friends, but we very very rarely play these days, opting for games like Mansions of Madness or Pandemic instead as they don't have such huge prep requirements.

Good game.  Though the rules do a terrible job of capturing the feel of the universe and books.

RATING: 9.5
Not feeling like a new edition but an improvement on the previous one, the new stuff is the pyschic phase that is not so uggly as expected. in the other hand the most appealing new stuff are the missions, generated each turn, a good motivation for playing a more vanguardist game.

With a Blood Angel Army, if I just had time to play...
sometimes I wonder if I don't like the fluff and backstory more than the gameplay.
Necromunda seems to play much better....

GW saw how bad 6th ed was and so spent no time at all in trotting out 7th ed. After 5 minutes in Bugmans bar they gave up bothering to even try and make 40k into a modern 21st century set of rules and stuck with the 30+ year old dinosaur rule set. "Games Workshop?" Hardly an apt name.

Games Workshop have this aversion to making things balanced. This could be down to multiple people writing the rules and not consulting each other. The competitive scene is also leaking out into the friendly scene.

This game used to be fun, now it's just a matter  of who brings the cheesiest expensivest models to the game, it's all about big guns now, or bigger... No balance what so ever either... and the formations they added completely broke the game into no-fun.

Nicely presented.  Really just version 6.5 with collated rules for Super Heavies and minor changes.
The split of three books is a great idea, although the Hobby book is not much more than pretty pictures.
Still 40K.  Still a great game, although I'm not a fan of the new Psychic phase.

7th edition is kinda of meh. I hate the Psyker Phase and how they changed Psyker powers. Just another stab to psyker armies on top of having randomly rolled powers. Units can choose what special weapons they want, why can't psykers pick their powers?

This game is very cool. We saw it in Avalon Roma Games near the Vatican and had to pick it up for Christmas. For Pandemic lovers it is familiar and intuitive but pretty different than the original:
-the theme is strong and semi-historical 
-the map is well-crafted and beautiful
-the new rules (railroads, ports, purified water, etc.) add interesting depth to the game-play
-the roles are sufficiently different than the ones for the original game
-two historical scenarios that are basically mini-expansions come with the game

Reimplementation of Pandemic. Makes the game more thematic which I like much more. For me Pademic was always a bit too dry and abstract.

RATING: 7.5
While I always considered the mechanisms of Pandemic to be very elegant and quite fascinating, in particular the way outbreaks work, I was never a fan of the game. Something seemed off to me. It felt too much like a logistic exercise, while being also abstract. I couldn't really wrap my head around why its lack of theme bothered me so much, as I usually like euro-games. Nevertheless I left the table underwhelmed and disappointed, because I was really hoping to like the game. Then, years later, I watched the review of Iberia and my interest was picked again.

Iberia didn't seem to change a whole lot about Pandemic's basic formula, yet it seemingly added many thematic elements to it. So I went out, bought it and now I can say, that it all makes it for a better game in my book.

First of all I love the way the game looks. Great wooden components, nice artwork and a beautiful board. Everything looks great on the table! Even better than the second edition, in my opinion. I also really like the new mechanisms, like the purified water and especially the railway. I can't really explain why, but there's something satisfying about building the railway network. At the same time it offers another puzzle to solve, because you will have to figure out how to build it so that it fits the problems of that particular game situation at best. In general I think that together this mechanisms add a depth of tactics to the game and some more balls to juggle with at the same time. It definitively makes the puzzle more interesting. It's also very cool (and thematic) that you can't actually cure the diseases but only study them. This makes the game even more of a challenge!

Iberia maybe didn't turn Pandemic from a game I thought to be mediocre to one of my all time favorites, but it definitively made it a game I really enjoy. If you though theme was what Pandemic was missing, you might want to take Iberia into consideration. I really enjoy this title and I recommend it a lot.

Probably on its own a better game than Pandemic original plus one expansion, maybe in general (the transport and water are just more interesting ideas than research center placement games).

RATING: 6
Gets rid of the monotony of base Pandemic, at least, without being as absurd as The Cure. 

That said, card sharing is much harder in this one and it seems like you basically have to have the railroad guy in the game to win, and the luck of the draw is more important.

RATING: 7.5
I would say I like it less than Legacy, but it is more challenging than vanilla Pandemic. I miss the world - the peninsula seems too small for the epic feeling and I miss the sense of achievement after creating a cure. In this version it changes too little.

We haven't tried included variants yet.

You must adjust strategy from base pandemic, and that is good. As a warning though the 5 player games will be VERY difficult even on only 4 epidemics. another hint, purifying water is essential...and a crutch...adopt a house rule that only one player can purify and you will do much better.

RATING: 9
My favorite of the pandemic games you can play without tearing apart (Pandemic Legacy Season 1 is even better, but can't be played forever).

When playing the Iberia version I see more collaboration between the players than in regular pandemic. It's more discussions on how to solve the problems, and not always the same player giving all the solutions.

This time there are no direct flights, but possibilities to make a railroad. The railroad has to be made strategically to be efficient later in the game.

Iberia has a new mechanism with water markers, that works almost like the quarantine markers in Pandemic Legacy Season 1. The water is placed in regions with multiple cities. The water prevents the next disease cube arriving in one of the cities.

The character roles are great and every player has to make the best use of their special abilities.

In the box, you also find extra challenges with Historical Diseases Challenge. It's four cards with new rules for each disease that make the game much harder. It's possible to play with just one or any combination of them.

In an exceptionally weird twist for a longtime gamer, this was somehow, in June of 2017, the first Pandemic game I've ever played. It felt like an aged co-op design with some chrome added to try to spice it up, which seems right on the nose? I still enjoyed it, and look forward to finally trying the original which has rotted on my shelf as well as Legacy, which everyone seems to agree is the bee's knees.

It says a lot about Pandemic that it can be mutated into myriad forms and still work as an excellent game. This version is fitting to its historical setting, so you can research diseases and win, but not eliminate them, but I love the track building and water purification elements that distinguish it for core Pandemic or Reign of Cthulhu.

A seemingly more difficult version of vanilla Pandemic (and without some of the less fun rules from the second half of Legacy Season 1). As another plus, the game is, to us, the most visually appealing version of Pandemic. Overall, its simply the best version of Pandemic I've played. The board, the water tokens, the rail line placement, and the core Pandemic game play add together that creates a very good, engaging, package.

The best standalone iteration of Pandemic yet, offering a little bit more depth and a little bit more theme integrated with its mechanics.  Ultimately, I like it but would turn to Spirit Island if playing with an experienced group or by myself, or Burgle Bros with newer players. 
 Doesn't quite find its niche in my collection.  Pretty as heck, though.

After just a single play, this game feels just like Pandemic...which is mostly a positive comment. The additions of building railroads and adding purified water tokens are both new and cool. Some of the new role cards like the Nurse and Politician also feel fresh. The art and aesthetics are very pleasing. I haven't played any of the variants that come with the game but they seem like they would be a fun challenge. I also appreciate the variable starting locations for players rather than always having to start bunched up in the same city. The core game of Pandemic is still clearly there with the same win/loss conditions and same tension with every Infection draw but the tweaks and new mechanics means I prefer this version to the original version...so far. That's a tougher choice if you play with a bunch of expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this a little more than base Pandemic because I like the 19th century theme a little more. The variants are also nice as they add extra challenges to the game. Would recommend over Pandemic except for the fact that this will never get expansions, but as far as base sets go, this is much better

I rate this game a 9 because it is good, but I find it's hard to determine how much I value a game which appears to have captured the top notch game play of Pandemic using primarily the identical mechanics. The new stuff, such as the purify water to slow new cubes being added to an area of the board and traveling by ship to port cities and building train tracks plus traveling by rail, was all excellent and well implemented. I enjoyed my one play very much which we lost on our 5th epidemic that caused a chain reaction of too many outbreaks. It was one turn before a win and down to the last 4 cards in the deck. It really felt a lot like Pandemic.

If you like Pandemic and want more of it, then Pandemic Iberia is a great bet to work for you. If you don't like Pandemic then keep your distance because this will be much of the same.

Interesting reworking of Pandemic. I really enjoyed this game. There are a few minor differences in the game mechanics and the roles, but the most drastic difference is the map. Because Iberia is basically one huge chunk of land, there are far less distant areas and it is easier to reach everything.

This Pandemic feels like the random role assignment and event cards are actually worth it. Regular pandemic means that sometimes your role assignments or event cards can be punishing, but here, the game is fluid enough that they feel like the strategy shake up that they were meant to be. Plus the additional two challenge modes? Amazing. Played with Pandemic veterans who loved the game. An excellent edition.

Great game.  I never played the original pandemic, but this game is awesome.  I played it several time with my girlfriend when i bought it and i would like to play it again anytime.  Simple and not to long.  You can ajust difficulty easily with the 2 variants proposes in the game and it gives a great replayability.  I don't think it will have expansions because it is kind of a pandemic stand alone expension itself but i wish to.  The artwork are nice, i would have prefer better artwork for the card, but the board is a great map of the Iberian peninsula and everything fit together.  I know i will play it a lot.

A lovely version of Pandemic, a "cooperative" game, where players team up to stop the spread of disease. Very customizable difficulty levels. I absolutely love the map on this Pandemic version, and all of the character abilities are superb. Although the design is definitely for 2-4 players, I’ve actually enjoyed playing this game solo as well. I bump up the difficulty slightly, play all 3 or 4 characters myself, and I have a great time. Great game design!

Fantastic alternate version of Pandemic. The ability to 'treat water' to slow the spread of disease, as well as adding the ability to move by rail and ship really changes up the basic Pandemic formula. Strategy feels quite different; my husband who dislikes the original Pandemic actually enjoys this one a lot!

Different enough from the original Pandemic to warrant owning both. This iteration feels much more tense due to those differences - mainly the new restrictions and allowances on mobility and hospital (research center) usage.
The game has great production value and is quite pleasing aesthetically.
I'm looking forward to trying out the included "challenges" (variants) as well.
In my opinion, better than the original Pandemic as a base game (with the expansions, the original still comes out on top, from my viewpoint). If you don't want to bother with expansions, then I'd recommend this version or the Reign of Cthulhu one over the original.

Really great variant/re-skin of Pandemic, and the whole package is just outstandingly beautiful - one of the nicest looking games on my shelves actually. I particularly like the design choices for the graphics on the backs of the cards, which are stylised as Iberian tiles with distinctly viral undertones - really great touch, and look stellar. Furthermore the game adds a great new challenge to the base game and a number of really neat thematic changes as well. Thoroughly enjoy this one, more than earned a spot on my shelves next to the base game.

This game is so tight the whole time and it is so satisfying to win when you have no actions left. I love the railway and water tokens.  The movement aspect is really cool , each game you travel differently.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ As Pandemic, great co-op game that is more and more tense until the end (it's always more tense the more we go, unlike base Pandemic, where the tension was a bit more like a roller-coaster, since curing disease gave us opportunity to eradicate them, which is no longer the case here).
++ Great component: the box is thick, the board is nice looking, the cards are of nice quality and linen finish, and even the insert is made of thick cardboard.
++ I like that, in addition to the number of Epidemic cards we can use as the base game, there is also two new level of difficulty, namely the "Influx of Patients Challenge", which really change up the game and bring it to a new level for us, and the "Historical Diseases Challenge" which also add to the challenge even more (randomly choose from 1 to 4 cards to give the disease a special power).
++ I like the two new major mechanism added to the game, the "Build Rail" action and the "Purify Water" actions. Both change the way base Pandemic is played and both are thematic too for this time period.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The Event cards background color could have been another color than yellow, which is a disease color already.
-- Once sleeves, the cards doesn't really fit well in the bottom part of the insert, so I had to remove the insert with is sad because it was really nice looking.
-- As Pandemic, being a co-op game, it is prone to the Alpha Player Syndrome (where an experienced player can dictate other players everything to do to ensure a win).
-- Not different enough from base Pandemic to give it a good replayability if we have overplayed the base game (like we have).

This nicely mixes up the Pandemic formula, so if you are a fan of Pandemic and still play, you'll want to check this out. I enjoyed Reign of Cthulhu for what it is, but this is definitely a much more gamerly and far more versatile package, with several play variants included and much less direct overlap (all the roles are new, for example, and while some are recognizable many are very distinct).

Wow, this is straight up comparable to the base game + an expansion. Even if you don't play with the included variants, the restricted movement + rails alone are a really interesting new wrinkle. It requires much more forward planning than vanilla Pandemic.

I honestly didn't expect much from the Patients variant - I expected something similar to the monster movement in the subpar Cthulhu version. I'm thrilled to report I was wrong. This is a GREAT challenge, on par with On the Brink or In the Lab. It's not the hardest variant necessarily (though if you throw in enough of those Historical Diseases, it might be) but it's tough in a really interesting way. It makes optimizing your actions extremely difficult, since you have to plan for so much in advance.

Other Pandemic modes present fun, interesting puzzles wherein the challenge is largely figuring out how to win. Once you've done that, it's generally not too tough to replicate (barring ridiculous unlucky pulls from the bottom of the Infection deck). With Iberia's Patients mode, I feel like Pandemic has finally landed on making the challenge "how do we win THIS game?"

I really didn't expect to say this, but this is now my favorite version of Pandemic (barring Legacy which is its whole own thing, of course.)

I found Iberia to be little more challenging than base Pandemic.  The movements are different as it takes a little while to get around  early in the game. I really like the extra variety in action choices. It definitely makes you think before making your play!  I love both games and would venture to say most people who enjoy Pandemic will also like Pandemic Iberia. The components are beautiful and well made.

Well was looking at it but Asmodee priced controlled products, thanks but no thanks, I refuse to pay a tax to keep the club houses opened needed for Magic the Gathering. If Asmodee wants that let them open their own local shops. 

My main reason is they claim they are the savior of LGS, but they seem to favor big volume online sellers like CSI, which have local store fronts. They clearly are playing both ends. 

They clearly are hurting the majority of retailers below CSI, MM, to stay in business., Noble Knight comes to mind. Worst if they don't have a buy back option retailers are stuck with their inventory forever once the hype has wane as they can't discount it off their shelves. Someone will pay for that lost. This just isn't good for the hobby.

- theme is somewhat more interesting

This feels very much like regular pandemic.  The major differences are:

* you can't eradicate diseases.  This means you have to keep on top of all the colours all the way through the game

* Your mobility is much less than what you might be used to.  No aeroplanes!  You can take a ship from one port town to another port town, if you have the cad to spend, and if the port town is anywhere near where you want to go.  We didn't use that feature the whole game!

* You can instead build railway tracks, which really, really help.  Get those bad boys down early!!

* The space *between* cities is now a thing, called a region.  You can apply abilities to a region that affect all cities touching it, e.g. 'water purification' - one water token will prevent one disease cube being placed.  Those were incredibly useful.  The nurse also has a cool region ability.

- Loads an loads of special events cards!! 

- Special 'disease' cards that add an extra element to one disease to make the game a bit tougher

I found it quite enjoyable and a nice twist.  Plus there was some nice flavour text on some of the cards with interesting historical facts.  I'm not sure it's necessary to have both regular pandemic and Iberia, as they are very similar, but if you are a big Pandemic fan like I am, then it does add some variety to a game that has already been played hundreds of times!

This is an interesting modification to the Pandemic system, but it's still just Pandemic at the core.  The changes were interesting, and definitely posed new challenges.  We especially liked the moving patients, and the disease-specific challenges.  But these, of course, just modify the basic Pandemic formula.  That formula is a good one, and this is probably the best version of it, but it is just not an engaging challenge for us.  We tend to like engine-building and combo games, and not puzzle games, which includes Pandemic.

Legacy is an exception because of the development and the story it tells over time.  I think we'll just stick with Legacy Season ?? for our annual Pandemic fix.

That being said, you don't really need this game if you already have Pandemic and State of Emergency.  I only got this because we are Pandemic junkies.

Great variation on original pandemic which my girlfriend and I are huge fans of. The difficulty is raised considerably due to the inability to completely eradicate diseases as well as losing the ability to fly to a city by discarding it's card (this is replaced by being able to travel from one port city to the another by discarding a card of the correct colour). The gameplay is different enough from basic pandemic to feel fresh but similar enough to feel familiar. The components are beautiful and feel very luxurious compared to the 2nd edition of pandemic. All counters and pieces are wooden and the card stock of the cards is significantly sturdier and more robust. Everything about this game shouts "deluxe". I have yet to try the historical diseases variant but am looking forward to it.

Absolutely great evolution from Pandemic. The theme ties perfectly to the mechanics. Need more plays to decide the rating more precisely, but right now feels better than the original.

EDIT: Definitely better than the original. Plays great solo too.

A great take on classic Pandemic. The loss of flight is mitigated by sailing and building railroads. I love preventing continued infection by spending cards to provide water in the space between cities, preventing a cube from being added to an adjacent city. As seasoned Pandemic players, we barely squeaked through our first game. Looking forward to the more difficult variants.

This version of Pandemic is closer to the original game than Reign of Cthulhu and much more close than The Cure. The main attractions to Iberia, other than gorgeous graphic design are the changes to movement and how the board is divided into regions which can take purification tokens (similarly functional to quarantine tokens in Pandemic Legacy and State of Emergncy). There is no flying and moving between research stations, the 5 card drop off needs to be in a 'research station' of the same colour as the cards, and when you get 'the cure,' diseases aren't easier to treat. You can take boats which are somewhat similar to flying... easier card requirements but only good on coastal locations. You can also spend actions to build a railway infrastructure which makes movement easy. You can discard cards to place 'quarntines' that cover multiple cities as well.

This game includes two variants as well: A way to make each coloured disease more difficult to deal with and a variant that has the disease cubes move towards the 'research stations.' If I had to nitpick, I would say that some of the connections are a little too small for the rail markers and sometimes the purification tokens obstruct the location names.

Pandemic Product Comparisons:

I consider this the best version of any non-legacy pandemic if you don't take expansions into account. I think it's even a more worthy purchase than Reign of Cthulhu. I say this because the roles and events in Iberia seem more differentiated than the original Pandemic than what you find in Reign of Cthulhu. This is great, if you're already familiar with the original base game. In addition, this comes with two variants to change up the gameplay. I think I'd still rather own Pandemic + it's 3 expansions for the sheer variety of what you get, but this an amazing stand alone product. It's a shame that it's a limited edition, because that means it's unlikely it will ever get an expansion and will probably get expensive to acquire in the years to come. Buy it before it goes OOP.

My favourite Pandemic by quite a margin. It takes elements from Pandemic Legacy which I think were severely lacking in the base game. One particular point is that you can actually do things to prepare in this game. Purification of water prevents disease cubes being dropped onto the board and this helps turn a very reactive boardgame into a more strategic one.

A decent reimplementation that may increase in rank with more plays. The railroad building aspect is just weird and historically inaccurate in terms of motivation to me when considering your role and that you are building railroads to strategically fight disease?
2nd play: rating lowered due to frustration with too much luck needed in card draws to do well and limited hand size. Maybe certain character roles need to be selected to increase your odds but that just adds another reason why the game has too much luck. This play annoyed me so much I find myself reassessing the Pandemic genre in general.

RATING: 6
Interesting variant on Pandemic but not overly special. 
The water purification action seems very very overpowered and we easily won without a single outbreak occuring. 

It also seems strange that water purification tokens go on the spaces between locations rather than on cities. It feels like this was a prototype mechanic before they polished it in the legacy version.
The railway movement is very cool and I like that forward planning is rewarded

I would like to play again using the variants and special rules but I am not in a rush to get it to the table any time soon

Nagyon jól sikerült variáns. Az értékelésből azt most kihagynám, hogy mennyire szimpatikus az árképzésrésze. :)
Látszólag alig pár dolog változik, amitől elsőre tartottam is, de nem kellett volna. Pont annyi a változás, hogy elég más a játék érzete tőle. Azt nem mondom hogy feltétlenül van helye egy alap pandemic mellett is, de ha csak egyet tarthatnék meg, akkor ez lenne az. A kórházak tetszenek benne a legjobban, mivel komoly stratégiai opciót adnak a betegek mozgatásával. Ezen felül nagyon kellemes meglepetés, hogy a szerepek mennyire mások lettek, mint az eddigi változatokban.

It is a nice variant of pandemic. I like the aspect with the railroad. Traveling is really hard at the beginning as you don't have a direct transportoption for non-harbour cities. The clean water seem to be a good idea - although in my only game so far we didn't use it very much.
The variants seem to be interesting too. 
Overall I like this version. The only complain I have is that the city-cards don't have a habour symbol printed on. So you often need a bit longer to realize if you can ue it for fast travel. (At least for persons like me who only know about 5-10 of the cities in the game.)

Over all our game felt easy, but I think that has more to do with using the railroad character, the water character, and a little luck, more than anything else.

Based on one solo play with moving patients (fiddly!).

The game feels the same as Pandemic, but at the same time completely different due to impossibility to cure diseases. I liked it, but you have to completely change your habits from regular Pandemic (or as in my case - Legacy).
The movement with trains is great, the uasi-quarantine with water tokens is also cool, but somehow I didn't feel the thrill. Maybe it's just the case of solo plays. We shall see when played multi.

An elegant take on the core concept of Pandemic. It looks lovely, and the new mechanics around railways keep things fresh.

Having played the original Pandemic quite a lot, I prefer this version as the theme is less generic. Both the cards and the board also look better, inspired by 19th century maps and Mudejar art. The addition of real diseases is also great, as is the addition of specific rules for each disease (but following these rules makes the game really hard to beat, fortunately they can be ignored). I like the way purified water is used and the fact that you can travel by boat or by train. Even though some of the place names are difficult to pronounce, the historical background makes this game more interesting and exciting than the original.

Iberia est une édition limitée qui se passe donc en Espagne (merci, Cpn Obvious!) au XIXè siècle. On se déplacement lentement mais on peut construire des voies ferrées pour aller plus vite. Les maladies soignées ne sont pas éradiquées. Elle continuent à se développer. Il faut donc continuer à faire un travail de fourmi, même quand on a trouvé les médicaments (et non les vaccins). On peut purifier l'eau pour ralentir la progression. On gagne si les 4 maladies sont soignées. Très sympa.

Az alapjátékot is nagyon szeretem, így lehet, hogy elfogult vagyok az Ibériával. Amikor először halottam, hogy meg fog jelenni egy új verzió a Pandemicből és az az Ibériai félszigeten fog játszódni a 19. században, hát nem voltam túl izgatott. Ekkor még a játék designja sem fogott meg. Ahogy utána olvastam, hogy milyen változások lesznek az eredeti játékhoz képest, egyre inkább felkeltette az érdeklődésemet. A játék vásárlása után nem bántam meg, hogy megvettem azt. A módosítások új élményeket hoznak a játékba. Továbbra is megmarad az izgalom. A vírusok egyedi képességének köszönhetően újabb kihívások várnak a játék során. A játék nehézségét tovább lehet szabályozni. Víztisztítással egy kicsit előre fel lehet készülni a vírusokra, az új közlekedés egyszerre segíti is a játékosokat és ellenük is dolgozik.

Pandemic Iberia is a thematic reimplentation of Pandemic, reflecting the state of medicine in the 1800's, the mechanisms of travel available, and the actual diseases prevalent in that time.

In many ways, Pandemic Iberia captures what was best in base Pandemic, and adds what made the 1st expansion, On The Brink, terrific, in one package.

The requirements to spend a colored card to establish a disease specific hospital, the option to spend cards treating water to prevent disease, and the limitations of travel to ship, road and the coming rail system all make even the base game more challenging and more interesting.

Regarding the rails, players may also use their actions to build a rail system in the Iberian penninsula, and once rails are in place, may travel along the rails without spending a card. This and Shipping actions replace flight, but Sailing still requires a Card (like Flying), while Rails require building, both of which add to players' decision space.

The artwork, player powers and special event cards are all nicely done.

All in all, a wonderful game, and a nice alternative to either base Pandemic + expansions or to Pandemic Legacy if you cannot bring together a regular group to enjoy legacy type games.

This is a very pretty and interesting variant of basic Pandemic.  The majority of the rules are the same, disease cubes appear, epidemics happen and outbreaks occur, but the rules that differ have a significant impact on how the game plays.  The two variants included in the box increase the variation in game play even more.  For someone who has not played any Pandemic I don't think I would recommend this over the base game (the global theme resonates more) but for someone that enjoys Pandemic and is looking for something a little different this should suit very well.

Akiknek tetszett az alap Pandemic azoknak tetszeni fog ez is. A játékmenet ugyanolyan jó, de mégis tettek bele annyi újítást, hogy érdemes legyen külön beszerezni. 

Nincsen repülés, csak a szomszédos városba lehet utazni, vagy hajóval lehet egy másik kikötőbe utazni. Lehet vágányokat építeni ami majd meggyorsítja később az utazást. Nincsenek kutatóállomások, csak kórházak és a betegség ellenszerét csak a megfelelő színű kórházban lehet felfedezni. Itt a kockák nem vírusok, hanem betegek, akiket meg kell gyógyítani és ha felfedeztük az ellenszert, akkor sem tudunk egyszerre mindenkit meggyógyítani. 

Lehet minden betegségnek sajátos tulajdonságot adni, illetve lehet úgy játszani, hogy a betegek el kezdenek vándorolni a kórházak felé és ha tele van a kórház, akkor szétspriccelnek és ez kitörésnek számít. 

Nekem annyira megtetszett, hogy egy játék után máris kívánság listámra került.

We liked this more than the original Pandemic game. The addition of railroad building and the water tokens really add to the game play. My husband felt that the railroads and water made the game more interesting, giving players more to do and making it less same-y than the original game. I might be able to convince him to play this more as he won't play the original game anymore.

Maybe it is the newness of the game, but I feel like this is a more engaging game than standard Pandemic. I like the track laying aspect as well as the water purification. The influx of patients variant is also a cool new addition, and I look forward to trying out the different disease variants.

Perhaps the reason I like this version better is the art and components -- I think it's a much more beautiful game than standard Pandemic. The game also feels much more grounded in reality, which is a big plus for me.

RATING: 7.75
Pandemic with a twist: this time, you need to contain the outbreaks without a chance to cure -- and you do it by laying down the routes to get to those cities first. If you like Pandemic but are needing a challenging version between Legacy games, this is a title to look at.

PLUS: modified to be its own game without losing the core of the game, standalone
MINUS: you need to love Pandemic to really love this one

Reboot of base Pandemic with a few interesting twists to match the theme. Patient movement and the lack of flights and cures are crunchy changes that mix up the standard pandemic formula but it’s all still pretty familiar. Artwork is beautiful all around, though coloring on some of the board text can make it hard to read. All in all a great game, one I like just SLIGHTLY more than base Pandemic. But I would still probably prefer to play Pandemic + one of the expansions.

After 20 plays:  it is an enjoyable game, but not as varying as Pandemic.  There are less different paths to victory than the regular Pandemic.  My wife and I have settled on the "sweet spot" of 3 roles, 5 epidemics, and 2 special diseases which we tend to win about 2/3 of the time.

After two plays:  not sure if this is better than regular Pandemic as many have indicated.  It seems like there is one overwhelming strategy: build rails.  We won our first two games (4 epidemics and 5 epidemics) even with 4 outbreaks after the first two turns.

Similar gameplay to Pandemic but new twists to make it fresh and unique.  Design allows to vary difficulty with number of pandemic cards but also how many diseases have unique abilities.

I have a few friends who feel this is the best Pandemic made to date.

RATING: 9.5
The mechanics are largely identical to Pandemic – the players collect cards of the same colour, they cause infections and trigger epidemics in the same way, and the rules for outbreaks are identical. You lose in the same way as in Pandemic (running out of disease cubes, time, or allowing too many outbreaks) and win in the same way (except that instead of curing a disease you must research it). So is it just a re-skin of Pandemic? Is it worth owning both games?

The water purification idea is an ingenious way to allow the players to hedge their bets and prepare in advance to reduce the likelihood of outbreaks during epidemics. The substitution of hospitals for research stations has little impact on the game until you play the patient movement challenge, which adds a significant and potentially deadly likelihood of outbreaks as patients congregate in and then flee from overwhelmed hospitals. The possibility of building a rail network adds a neat strategic element in which early investment in infrastructure may make all the difference to how the game turns out. The diseases can never be cured, but research allows you not only to win the game (perhaps) but also makes it easier for you to purify water, which in turn helps to keep infection incidence low for other diseases. And the historic illness variant makes each of the (now named) diseases behave differently, and makes the game much harder to beat.

The game has a similar, and yet different feel to it from Pandemic. The similarity comes from the totally familiar mechanics of cards and infections, the puzzle of how to use the roles to the best advantage, and the same welling up of disease despite your best efforts to keep it down. Part of the difference comes from the water purification – hospital – railways elements, but part also comes from the art, the event cards and even the wooden rather than plastic cubes. Playing this I am in a familiar universe, but an absorbing one in its own right.

Obviously, since this is a variant of Pandemic, it isn't "Freedom: the Underground Railway" or "Ticket to Ride". It's very definitely Pandemic, but Pandemic viewed through an interesting new lens. For this reason this game is more than a re-skin, and I am happy to have both Pandemic (on the Brink) and Iberia on my shelf, alongside Pandemic (the Cure) and a still-wrapped box of Legacy.

Nagyon mutatós Pandemic variáns. Tetszik, hogy "igaziak", azaz nevesítettek a betegségek, a grafika gyönyörű, és bár nem olcsó, azért ez végül is egy kiegészítős (modulos) Pandemic. Az alapmechanikában csak nagyon kicsi változások vannak, így hasonló a játékélmény, mint az alap Pandemicnél, tényleg valamilyen szinten gyűjtői kiadás ez, bár lehet, hogy valaki teljesen lecseréli vele az eredeti példányát. Különlegesnek különleges, az biztos, de leginkább tematikailag lehet érdekes, játékmenetileg nem feltétlenül.

Es similar al pandemic normal pero con algunas diferencias:

- Se puede purificar el agua, que permite proteger una región
- No se puede erradicar los virus
- Se puede desplazar a una ciudad con puerto gastando una carta del mismo color a esa ciudad
Me pareció más difícil que el Pandemic normal, sobre todo por dificultades para juntar cartas. Puede ser que los personajes que nos tocaron no fueran los mejores.

The new elements of Purify Water & Build Railroads are both very good additions to the game and the random Event cards mechanic is a breath of fresh air. We haven't tried the two new challenges yet but they look very nice and I'm sure they'll make the game even more difficult. The graphic design of the game is extremely well done and the roles also seem very well designed. The only negative is that you don't feel like you're saving the entire world as you do in the original game. Otherwise it's just as brilliant as the original game but it still has a different feel to it because of the changes and the theme. I would probably still use the original game as an introduction to newbies but this is still an excellent addition to the Pandemic line.

Stand-alone alternative to the classic Pandemic, with built-in expansions ("challenges") for added depth and re-playability. Beautifully illustrated and graphic designed. Clear and easy rule book. Perfectly executed to the last detail.

The water purification, railroads, and sailing mechanics are simple to learn, thematically engaging, and extremely fun to use, especially the railroads.

The challenges are indeed challenging (particularly the Influx of Patients!) and really change it up each game.

One of my absolute best game purchases. Recommended to any and all!

This is my favorite of the Pandemic games. My least favorite aspect of Pandemic: Original Recipe is trying to get to some new Outbreak late in the game with limited resources to get there. Adding the railroads makes that part of the game far less annoying. Now if you lose because of a late Outbreak, it's less due to luck than you just not making an adequate railroad early in the game. The look is great and it feels a little more thematic than the original. It also seems to scale much better than the original. And it is a complete game right out of the box, whereas Original Recipe NEEDS On the Brink.

That said, this game is MUCH easier to beat than Original Recipe. I routinely beat it on Heroic. It almost feels like the base game should have been one of the included Challenges, both of which are better than most of the Original Recipe Variants.

Absolutely stunning. Great components and graphic design. 

A better thematically integration (wonderful immersive).

Great changes: train tracks, purified water and board layout are great ideas and work perfectly. Also I like the new hospital building mechanic. 

And thanks to 2 module expansion it has a great variety. The idea with the "hospital movements" sound great (haven't played it yet) and with the different behavior diseases you can change the difficulty level even more. And it is also great.

I love the new characters AND the new event cards which are much better as the event cards in the original game. I love the thematically explanation in the rule book.

tl;dr: Great changes. Better than original Pandemic

First impression after on 2p game.  My favorite version of Pandemic.  I played the original Pandemic (no expansions) and Pandemic Legacy many times.  There are many things I prefer in this version.  Excellent components/graphics.  5p built into game.  The map feels very intimate/claustrophobic/focused and with the rules regarding ships and rails it and the elimination of flight rules movement is very interesting.  The fact that one cannot cure a disease adds an interesting challenge and maintains the tension.  I cannot wait to try the hospital variant and the historical diseases, I see this game as having very good replayability.
With regard to Pandemic in general, it is such a polished, evolved, thoroughly tested game that it is a must in any collection.  One of the games my wife likes to play and will ask me to play, in fact one of her favorite games.  A game that is easy to suggest even to newcomers to the hobby, that is usually well received, and a good gateway game that can also be appreciated by gamers looking for a challenge thanks to its scalability, variability, and polish.

A little too close to vanilla Pandemic to be enjoyable for me. Some of the new roles felt very unique, the included expansion modules in the box were a nice touch, and I really liked the railroad aspect, but everything else left me feeling unimpressed. The water purification is very close to a mechanism seen in Pandemic Legacy, and otherwise the game is almost the exact same thing as Pandemic. I think I might actually prefer vanilla Pandemic except for the railroad mechanic here, which is something I very much enjoyed. As it stands, however, Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu is the only game in the family that I still enjoy.

Iberia capitalizes on a beautiful historical setting to introduce an array of innovative mechanics that are largely incompatible with the original design, creating a true stand-alone variant that forces players to totally rethink their normal Pandemic strategies.

I have only played two cooperative games, Forbidden Island and now this one. And since FI for a long time was my only experience of cooperative games, I was never that excited when someone suggested it. And the "legend" Pandemic never really tickled my curiosity enough for me to buy/try it. (It's the artwork I guess.) But then I saw Pandemic Iberia. And me beeing the history buff that I am, could not resist this one. Especially since the historical reseach seemed so thorough. And this game is so much better. The theme fits perfect. The mecanisms are similar to FI, but works so much better here. All things - map, hospitals, outbursts, railroads etc. - come together beautifully. You get drawn into this game like few games do. My wife even said "I want to play this again." Something she's never said spontaneously before...

The design of Pandemic is excellent, and Iberia stays true to the original vision while adding just enough chrome to feel unique. There are also several challenges inside the box to add variety and help ramp up the difficulty. Production is gorgeous across the board.

I think that I prefer the more stream-lined feel of Pandemic: Rise of Cthulhu, but the theme here is much easier for me to get on a table. Beyond that release, Iberia is probably my favorite iteration of this classic cooperative game.

A nice variant, adding the ability to build railways to zoom around the board and to use cards to place water tokens that will kill off future cubes. I also liked that you had to build a hospital in each colour. The character abilities are a bit different as a result, but when it gets down to it, it's essentially the same game, just on a different map ... Pandemic with some twists, not a twisted Pandemic. As a result, still very likeable, but not a must-have if you've invested in base (especially with the pool of expansions that feed off the base but won't add to this.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is an excellent version of the game.  The historical theme is cool.  What makes it Pandemic is that cities get infected every turn and there are epidemic and outbreaks.  However, the actions you take and the way you research diseases feels different from regular Pandemic.  If you like the original Pandemic, you will definitely like this version.  You also be pleased that although it is Pandemic, it still feels very different and unique compared to the original.

It's Pandemic...yet, different. It almost feels like Pandemic with an expansion forced into it right off the bat. Definitely not a bad thing at all, I was just hoping for a [i]little[/i] more difference then the original game. I really enjoy this as it adds 2 variants and the minor (sometimes major) differences in the basic rules make this a welcome change. If you hated Pandemic before, this isn't going to change your mind, but if you liked it and wanted something different, this is excellent. The artwork and new characters are very nice.

First impression is that it's more interesting than original pandemic. It is certainly better looking. 

Having to place your rail network, purified water placements to help keep diseases at bay, and the concept of regions make for an interesting twist on the standard pandemic game play. Also for historical reasons you don't eradicate diseases anymore. You have to research all four diseases to win. New strategies are required.

The new variants included also look very interesting. 

I so far prefer this version of the game.

The new mechanics like Railroads, the Purify Water, the Port movement, the option of moving the patients and deseases, makes this game a must have, especially, for Pandemic fans. The looks + historic aspect make it even better.
The only 3 things I don´t like is the option of moving a Hospital, because it does not make sense, the fact that Albufeira was not a significant city in that period and the fact that they wanted to do a historic game and due to some religious problem they didn´t wanted to use the AC or BC in the founding dates of the cities cards, that's just confusing and ridiculous.

Good variation on the original game with a different feel to it. If you know Pandemic the rules are easy enough but that experience also led us to play it like the original game which made us lose badly.

In this game the diseases don't get easier to cure once they are researched. Instead you can rely on placing purified water to prevent the spread of diseases. Movement is also different. Rapid travel is possibe between port cities by discarding cards of the destination color. Building a railway network is also necessary to be able to travel quickly. As long as two cities are connected by an unbroken line of railway, movement between them requires only one step.

The game also comes with two variations included (not played these yet)
The first adds patient movement, where infection cubes move toward the hospitals you build, threatening outbreaks.
The second adds extra flavor and challenge by identifying one or more of the diseases with a real name and variations to their behavior.

An enjoyable variation on the theme of Pandemic, with a refreshed aesthetic and a different enough vibe from the original to warrant a (half-price, admittedly) purchase. The new roles fit nicely with the different mechanics and there is good potential adjustment to the difficulty with the disease characteristics. So far, it has been relatively comfortable: the Event cards seem to be a lot more powerful than in previous versions. The cubes are a bit measly for a 'collector's' edition, and I was missing one of the pawns from my copy, but nothing too worrisome. Muy bien.

Pandemic with a different theme. This is set in Spain in the 1850s. We have to deal with real diseases like Cholera and Malaria, which each have special abilities as an added optional challenge. Having boats and trains instead of planes definitely makes things more challenging. Diseases can no longer be cured, but the water purification mechanic balances that out. The new roles are refreshing as well. Same formula, different mechanics and board, still a pleasurable experience.

This isn't anything groundbreaking, and it still is basically Pandemic. But for those, like myself, who have played enough of the base Pandemic that it had worn kind of thin, there are enough wrinkles here to bring that initial joy back. I also really like that you can play up to five total players now, and that there are a few extra variants in the box to help add variability to things. For those hoping to find a game that would basically play like Pandemic but be just enough different from the base game, I think this is an excellent buy. I'm looking forward to playing the dozen or so times before this likely gets a bit stale and feel a bit solved like base Pandemic did.

RATING: 9.5
Much more challenging than base Pandemic. Very satisfying to be just able to complete a move because you had the foresight to construct the perfect railway line. We haven’t played with the variants yet, but I love that they’re there for when we master the game. Great details, including the art on the back of the cards and the microscope tokens. The board is beautiful, but my only quibble is that the arrows indicating where the towns actually are should have been more subtle—we were so confused as we thought they indicated something vital to gameplay. Overall, I’m very happy to have both Iberia and the original Pandemic.

The changes made to the Pandemic formula makes it a much more fun game for us. There's a strong satisfaction with building a good railway network and the usage of purification is a cool mechanic. Adding to this is its beautiful production quality and this is a hit for us.

This is my cooperative game of choice.

Lovely version (THE BEST I know...) of "Pandemic" in my country (Spain) and Portugal in the 19th Century. It´s like the classic "Pandemic" but more difficult, so it´s a real challenge to win. It adds some very interesting aspects to the base game that uplift the traditional mechanics in original "Pandemic". One of the best cooperative games I know.

I enjoy this version of Pandemic much more than the original. The historical element lends an air of urgency and realism more so than original Pandemic. The historical diseases variant is great, and the water purification and railway construction actions add a new and interesting strategic element to be considered. The artwork and component quality are excellent. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's not different enough from Pandemic that I think it's worth owning both, but if you don't own Pandemic yet, I would recommend picking up this one instead, particularly as it is more fleshed out than vanilla Pandemic sans expansions.  The addition of railroads and water purification makes it feel a bit more like you are strategizing how to set-up a good infrastructure rather than just putting out fires in your race to collect sets of 5.  The other big change is that you don't get any benefit for curing a disease (no automatic Medic ability) or eradicating a disease (no such thing - cubes can still come back even if that color was cured and completely absent from the board).  Most players are going to be much less familiar with the location of Spanish cities than world cities, so it can take players a little more time to locate cities.

I think this might be my favorite version of Pandemic (with the exception of Legacy), and I think I like the gameplay of this more than Pandemic Legacy. I *love* the routebuilding aspect with the trains and also the use of the negative space within the cities as ways to prevent additional disease cubes from coming onto the board. It comes together and works so well that I've actually found myself suggesting to play this, which certainly does not happen with the other flavors of Pandemic.

UPDATE: I continue to enjoy this with continued plays.

Deals with a lot of issues that I have with the original game. The original felt a bit too swingy and often came off as very unfair. Iberia's challenges are slightly more difficult but are also more manageable; a slow burn.

Relative to base Pandemic game, there are fewer strategic choices each turn without the charter or direct flight options, which makes the game a little less interesting.  The game relies heavily on the railroad network that players build to move around, but development of that is a little dull.  This game introduces the new Purify Water action, but it only minimally impacts game depth, as decisions on when to use it are often obvious.  I do like the published variant that gives individual characteristics to one or more of the historical diseases, as this makes theme slightly more immersive and the approach to attacking these diseases slightly different.  The other published variant that allows patients to move on the board towards the hospitals I found fiddly and slowed down the game without adding a commensurate amount of positive challenge or fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Insanely good spin-off of Pandemic. I'm not one for theming or aesthetic, but the artwork and style of this game is so satisfying to me - very immersive. The changes to the base game are great, from the concept of "regions" to the downgrades of movement and research to fit the time period, and especially the railroad addition. I almost always prefer this game over the original now.

The differences between this and the base game are relatively minor, but really change the feel of the game.  I especially like the track laying aspect of the game and peppering the board with purified water tokens, both of which give you more strategic control in the game.  That being said, the game seems to be a notch more difficult than the base game.  Presentation is beautiful and the included variants seem like they will be really good.

Slightly more difficult than original. But the functions it takes away are generally compensated by adding new features (railroads and sailing vs. flying).

First play impression: This may be the definitive version of Pandemic. While I consider Pandemic Legacy the [i]best[/i] version, you can't play it after completion (or at least you shouldn't).

As for a Pandemic that I can just pull out and play any time, I don't see myself reaching for regular Pandemic over Iberia. Iberia feels like Pandemic, it has (almost) all of the same rules, but it adds a couple of elements.

One is a new railway system. You can't discard a card to fly around the board like you can in regular Pandemic so initially movement is a little slower. But as you build up your railway system during the game, you'll eventually be able to zoom around the board at will.

Pandemic is bloated with expansions, but Iberia has two variants included that give it an expanded feel while keeping it tidy. One of them is a new hospital mechanic that gives the hospitals (similar to research stations) more of a purpose. The other is a variant that makes one color disease behave differently.

Iberia also plays five players out of the box.

So far I'm impressed with Iberia. It's still incredibly easy to explain to new players because the Pandemic system is so simple, but the couple of new twists make it more fun for a Pandemic veteran.

my favourite version of pandemic, theme is wonderful and the tight nature of the map makes it very believable.  The addition of the railway mechanic is really strong, although the inability to cure diseases does make it brutal.

I played this after having played through most of Pandemic Legacy Season One, so that certainly colored my thoughts on this.  As a standalone game, Pandemic Iberia is certainly fun and challenging, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging co-op.  However, I couldn't appreciate it nearly as much given my love of Legacy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nice Pandemic variant. Cool map and production values.

Pandemic + expansions is still a better choice, but if you're comparing just base games, Iberia wins hands down.

Is it worth owning if you already have Pandemic +  On the Brink/Hinterlands?..not really, but if you're a fan of the system, it is a nice variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A beautiful, interesting take on a classic co-op. The theme is realized in a number of ways (managing rather than curing disease, no air travel) and the port and rail systems add neat wrinkles to the game.

There are a couple of advanced scenarios to play - one where you manage patient numbers and another where each disease has a unique trail. I look forward to attempting those during future plays.

Pre-order from CoolStuffInc. Fall 2016. More brutal in many ways than regular Pandemic, particularly given you cannot cure a disease.

This one may benefit from more players, unlike other flavors of Pandemic which gets easier with two players.

1st impressions: Very much a Pandemic experience, yet different enough to offer a veteran a different puzzle to solve. Determining the usefulness of rail and water is fascinating, and lovely that the new roles play off these unique characteristics. Beautiful production marred by shoddy quality control (several of my cubes are flawed). Makes me want to buy Rising Tide.

A few times per week me and my girlfriend play a boardgame in the evening. Favorites are Trains, Istanbul, Kingdom Builder and, very recently Pandemic Iberia, our first coop. 

What we like is to figure out together how to beat the epidemics. Since I'm aware of the 'Alpha player problem' I try not to dictate what she should do, and that goes amazingly well. Not in the least because she thinks about purifying and treating, while I tend to worry about hospitals, infrastructure and those cute wooden microscopes. 

So far we played 10 games together and by now we’ve reached the skills to beat 6 epidemics. Haven't tried the included variants yet.

The community appears to suffer from Pandemic burnout, as this stand-alone is habitually on special.  But it's a worthy reconfiguration that lets players run amok on the peninsula before the diseases do the same.

Wow! Seriously -- wow!

We've owned the base Pandemic for a couple of years, as well as its first expansion On the Brink. With Iberia being a single print-run, we decided to give it a try -- and we're so glad we did!

Artwork - brilliant. Gameplay -- brilliant. Theme -- executed wonderfully.

My wife and I can sit down and enjoy playing through a game of Iberia anytime. There are two included variants.

1) Influx of Patients - Patients (cubes) will move each turn closer to the hospital of their color.

2) Historical Diseases - Very similar to Virulent Strain epidemic cards from On the Brink.

These two variants add a lot of extra replayability. It's an amazing game, and one we can't recommend enough.

Rating the game slightly lower to its predecessor initially, as I think ourlove for it will eventually grow as we play it more. I like it a lot, although I´m not very fond of the choice of map, nothing wrong with Spain/Portugal but it's like playing on a Ticket to Ride map full with names we have no idea about. Makes it a sub-game to try to memorize the cities which is not necessarly a good thing as we try to focus on the prime objective of the game. I guess this will go away after more plays, my point is probably that there is some higher entry level on a game that is already hard to win due to our own ignorance of the whereabouts.

Just played once (5 players) without playing the challenge modules. The artwork/styling is really gorgeous. Wish the character description text were a bit bigger, I had trouble trying to pick out my character when all the cards were laid out only 1 or 2 feet away from me. Trying to pronounce the names of the cities was a bit tricky; it makes me think of Ticket-to-ride in this respect. A few renamed roles and a few new roles. Building rails and having water are interesting new mechanics as well as having a new way for quarantine. I thought the little wooden microscopes were cute, they're markers for the different diseases. Overall, it is not super amazing, but it is beautifully designed and enjoyable for Pandemic fans. I'd like try the other challenge modules. Maybe it's unfair to compare, but I enjoyed the Cthulu theme much better, so perhaps the theme could have been more creatively done. Otherwise, it's really just Pandemic with a new map and a few tweaked mechanics.

Szkeptikus voltam, de meggyőzött a játék. Pont annyi újdonság, hogy ne tűnjön bőrlehúzásnak és az új emberek, valamint a régi fanok is rákapjanak. A vasútvonal fejlesztése, a víz tisztítása, a kórházak működése és az új karakterek mind-mind jól sikerültek, így a tökéletes látványvilággal egy újabb méltó Pandemic rész született. Egyedül az ára lehet kicsit elrettentő, ennyiért akcióban az alapot és az On the Brink kiegészítőt is megkaphatjuk, így azért nem ajánlható feltétel nélkül mindenkinek.

Acquistato in data 19/01/2017 da MagicMerchant approfittando anche della spedizione gratuita. Lo proveremo quanto prima, anche se già c'è il legacy in gioco mi piaceva l'idea della variante "iberia" per via delle comunicazioni diverse e di alcune dinamiche del regolamento che andrò a studiare.

Pandemic is excellent game! As my friend has regular one, this variation will be more than welcomed in my collection.

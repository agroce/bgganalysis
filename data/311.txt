I was one of a number of playtesters, and in our playtest, we almost broke the game. They finally called the game as we were in a singular loop from which we could not end. I think they may have made a rule change to keep that from happening in the future, or the past...

Probably the best 'time' game. SCiFi Background is the same as ThroneWorld which helps. Not a light game - and quite subtle, it takes a game or two to realise that you have to actively end the game (by uninventing time travel) - and it's the timing of this event that's critical. Needs a reissue with nicer bits.

Six races battling to change time forever!

Love this game.  The first time you play you know you're in for something different.  The game is simply produced and could be dramatically rethemed and upgrade for chrome, however as every thing works well and isnt overly cheap I can't complain.

There is a neat twist in the end game which can change success vs failure on compeltein your mission.  Each race has a differing set of victory criteria a couple being very balanced and the other 4 being somewhat 2 pairs of "sortof allies".  Meaning if you will allow me that some races slightly affect you, one will help you, and the others drastically hurt your race.

Learn your races special abilites.  With the stealthy types its better to avoid contact and maybe let another race better suited for combat come along to aid you.  You don't have to be the one to hold a hex to get the points from it being controlled so think loosely and direct your efforts to the objectives that really help you out.

Game Board is a bit sterile and abstract. You need (i.m.o) 6 players for a fun game. The rules are easy to learn but the game itself can be quite tough. The rating can vary (today it´s a 6). Have a test game before considering to purchase it.

The game is fun even if it really screws with your noodle.  The flash game aid here on the geek makes the recordkeeping in this game a breeze.  My rating could go up with more plays as increased understanding would certainly help where my inept fumbling strategy failed.

This is a fun, richly-themed game. It certainly shows its age, but its still worthwhile and not really supplanted by any more recent game. The computer-assistance is necessary for figuring which tiles to flip, else you get kind of a jumbled mess.

Each player plays a different race who are going back through time and re-writing history to ensure that their race comes out on top. Or rather, that their race was always on top. Anyway, each race is different, but races have some natural alliances and enemies.

This is a great game! Play it with a laptop to calculate VP/RP and a game plays in under 3 hours. Rules and board design look very dry, but don't be deceived - this is one of Tim-Jim's best. Could be a classic if people actually bothered trying this one out...

RATING: N/A
Have instructed the game several times, with first plays.  Will rate after getting a group of experienced plays together.

Best way to teach the mechanics from my experience is to play a game where the Brutus do a first turn 'game over'.  (Which almost certainly assures their loss.)  The alternate realities all work through and shows mechanics well.

Where to begin? Where to end? This is the initial problem with Time Agent. Ending the game does not appear to be an easy task. Played for 3.5 hours and didn't look close to finishing it. Would love to play again. This is different to any game out there (obviously, I don't know every game, I'd be interested to know if there were anything similar).

We were all completely lost for a strategy. The strategies are probably subtle and complex. I would imagine an experienced player would thrash a learner.

There's a great game here, I'm sure of it, but it needs a lot of plays to find it, I think.

My wish would be for Mr. Lehmann to introduce a beginners game, maybe where each race starts with more resources or the events are cheaper or something, so that you can have a few games played to completion, pick up a few strategies and then play the game as intended.

Very original, very cool mechanics, though a bit hard to track some of the timelines.  Only played once and only got about halfway through the game, but very much looking forward to future games.

RATING: 7
This looks to be the best time-travel game available.  After one play, it has a neat feel to it.  Quite different and very thematic.  The first play, I was still caught up in the mechanics of the game and didn't focus too much on the strategy of the game.  Working together with other players with common goals should be a big part of this game, but I didn't get that far.

Computer scoreboard is a must for this game - can't even imagine playing it otherwise.

It's long and I think it requires a full table to be worth playing.  Put those two together and it took forever to finally get it to the table.  And it would take another forever for a second play, so I ultimately sold it off.

Very opaque, but fascinating.  A long game.  I played this a few times back in the 90's.  

Played again in 2012, using the nice app found on this site.  Great fun!  I have lots of good memories with this game from years ago.  It was wonderful to play it with some of my more recent game opponents.

Even eith the app, the game is a bit of an effort to play.  I think it is worth the effort, but this is not a game you lightly agree to play.  As so often happens, the game is actually easier to play than it is to understand or teach.

I have a strong desire to play again.

Except for the possible time length, this is an interesting game.  If you are a fan of Doctor Who, like I am, it does offer you the enjoyable theme of "multiple time streams".  Send in your time agent or squad and try to manipulate events that gives your faction the victory.  It's asymetrical but really nice with six players.  Using the time agent computer app is a MUST!  Time Agent is a wargame of events where time is the territory.  If not for game length, I'd give this a 7 rating.

Won an auction.  What a really great game.  Accounting somewhat involved, but not so awful if done all at once at end of turn.  Unique.  The board is quite an eyesore, and if you cannot see patterns easily, this could be a nightmare.  Some clever moves to be made.  Wildly unpredictable playtime.  Could see some stalemates occurring.

One play in. It's a long, slow paced game. I'm sure after you're comfortable with the turn style, the initial rounds probably go much faster. Ending the game seems difficult considering the 75 cost of the main Time Travel space. You have to maintain your lead and still be able to afford to hit that space. Not sure how hard it would be to rotate spaces to block it, but the secondary TT spaces aren't that hard to reverse.

Fun for the first few hours, though it gets bogged down during the mid-game.  The game promotes holding position, with no mechanism that drives the game to its conclusion.  The races are unique and flavorful, but the theme eventually wears out and gets lost over time with all the onerous bookkeeping.

This one I thoroughly enjoy playing solitaire. There's a somewhat meditative quality to the game for me when I play it. An extremely fun game if you play along with the theme. The graphics and components are anything but spectacular, and some of the maintenance routines can get to be tedious, but overall I love this game. The best thing about this game is it really does come down to the very end to see who wins.

I would guess that I have 6 or 7 plays prior to 2005 when I started logging plays on BGG. No recollection of the dates of play.

RATING: 6
Very unique-feeling game with an RPG feel. You take on the role of an alien race and work backwards in time to change events to increase your resources or victory points, but each event can help or hurt other people too, which makes it interesting. Finally, once you're winning in victory points your goal is to "un-invent" time travel to solidify yourself as the winner.

However, there are some problems with the fiddly rules and really unbalanced group of races. The game would be basically UNPLAYABLE without the computer aid for keeping track of victory points / resources, which really kills the game if you don't have a computer nearby. Also, if you're new to the game you'll be studying the quick reference sheet non-stop to see what events in history are advantageous to you and/or disadvantageous to certain specific players, and the events are not intuitive at all. Maybe they work thematically, but mechanically it is a very big disconnect.

Besides that it was a very interesting game to play and I'd love to try it again with each person really taking the role of an entire alien race trying to better themselves by shaping their history.

Everyone like the idea to change history (to their favor). This game is a good example to show why no one ever succeed, but mind you this game is the closest thing that you can have in boardgame format, to simulate the effect of multiple change of history.  On one day, I shall try the RP/VP Excel aid, to see if it remove the analysis paralysis problem.

This is a great game. The components could have been a lot better (just eliminate/replace all the chits for money, better counters for the pieces, and the time tiles to eliminate the white color (either solid color exits or two-color exits).
But if you exclude the component problems, this is a very interesting, innovative, and clever game. Time travel at its best!!!
This game was way ahead of its time!
Clearly a game for gamers, but a very good one.
Get the html application from BGG that allows you to track resources and victory points, This is a must have application for this game.

The visual design is, of course, pretty retro, and there's a lot going on the board. The way you constantly write and rewrite history is awesome, though. A lot of opportunities for grand plans, grander failures and backstabbery. If you win, it's a deserved win - and you were the winner all along.

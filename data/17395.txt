GAME: Prussia's Glory II
RANK: 4790
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The same problems of the preceding volume: the battle scenarios don't feel like linear battles, just a few stacks pounding each other. The scale of the game is more suited to depict the armies' movements before the battle than the battles themselves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Prussia's Glory has an interesting game system. The organization of the army in wings and groups gives the players a strong feeling of being in charge of "real" troops. The activation system makes very important to perform tactical movements. However, the game plays a bit slow since there are many steps to go through in order to activate units.The possibility of switching between units deployed and in column is a great option but flipping the counters can be uncomfortable since often you have several counters stacked. 
The stacking order is also very important, and is an extra factor to keep in mind that might slow the learning of the game. Still, once you get in it, it is a an excellent game.

Like its precursor, Prussia' Glory II has nice maps and counters but still suffers from a game level that just doesn't seem to capture the style of warfare fought during the Seven Years war.  The games can be interesting from a war gaming point of view but leaves one wanting more if your goal in to get the feel of battles during this time period.  The rules can be a bit to get through though I did find them somewhat better than the first game in the series.

RATING: 5
Preliminary rating after playing the Leuthen battle scenario from [i]Prussia's Glory[/i], which is the same system. Interesting if cumbersome combat system. The abstractions are a little strange. It's clear that modifiers are much more important than odds in combat.

With regards to modifiers in combat I think the designer was trying to emphasize the importance of leadership and unit quality over raw numbers, but an analysis of the CRT may leave you baffled, mainly because the CRT doesn't make a lot of sense until you get into the "7 or greater" range. The net effect is that good die rolling appears to trump good tactics to a large degree.

The other abstraction that's strange is the "supported defense" rule where it actually becomes more difficult to attack two or more units in the same hex if you're flanking them. In some cases it works out that you're better off [b]not[/b] flanking those units, because then only the top unit is counted for defense. It's stranger still that facing doesn't matter.

The result is a game that doesn't feel particularly tactical, with abstractions that seem far too outlandish to be enjoyable.

Traded.

RATING: 6
a great subject and some very clever mechanics, but ultimately it's held back by trying to confine itself within the rules complexity of typical SPI quads. (because those were so great) which is just generally sad considering the level of research, innovative mechanics, and rich detail that the designer demonstrated with Clash of Monarchs. I'll keep this one to explore tweaking it when I do enough research.

Well, after many years I finally managed to progress to the second game in the series.   This was quite a barrier for me as I'm not fond of the counters or the "blob" style command rules with their rather abstract state changes ("activated" or "degraded" are not terms you find in any military manual), and the convoluted and sometimes strange army morale system.  However, deciding battles by army morale is still a good choice in principle.  The choice of including the approach march is still brilliant, and GMT finally chickened up to include the originally planned fog-of-war rules.  Unfortunately at this point the people who'd have been willing to play this ftf have moved on to other games.  Presentation still marred by counters that look beautiful close up but give no feel for "linear warfare" when deployed, and  maps without the roads that figure prominently in the battle accounts.  However, kudos to the designer for sticking to his vision and putting those battles out.

OK, after playing a number of games so I sort of have the fiddliness down I could see myself returning to it if I have the chance to play a full scenario with fog of war. So I have increased the rating just on the strength of that feature.

The view of the battlefield from 10,000 feet. Don't be fooled by the superficial resemblance to other GMT titles like GBoH, Glory, or Musket and Pike. This is not a tactical game, it's grand tactical or quasi-operational. The game wants you to ask "What on earth was Frederick thinking attacking uphill at Kolin instead of going around to the left," not "What would have happened if the 57th IR had gotten off a few extra volleys." 

There's a lot of grinding and die rolling. The system assumes you are willing to do a hefty amount of work to visualize what's happening inside the hexes. Some may conclude it's entirely too much work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is an unusual scale: too zoomed out to be truly tactical and too zoomed in to be operational, but since Frederick's approach marches were almost always a key part of the battles, the scale still works for me.  The engagement and combat mechanisms are a little artificial, but do a fair job of restoring a sense of tactical linear warfare.  In any case, I enjoy every battle and learn - painfully :-) - each time.

I had a lot of fun running through a couple of scenarios of this game. Prague is a good one to start with, not too many units, and it gives you a chance to whet your teeth with a full-on frontal assault as the Prussians. Great looking game, with colorful units and maps. Once you get the hang of the rules it plays quite fast, certainly doable in an evening. I'll definitely be returning to this game in the future!

Well, I like this game and the first volume also. However, I'm not sure when a unit has to retreat - is it when it hits 4 or below or the next time its called upon to lose a point (after it has fulfilled the loss-requirement?) A lot of the time I fudge it as I play solo. In Kunersdorf though a retreat can throw the Prussians outside those hard-fought-for Russian defence works so the issue becomes critical. I like the PG games despite this. They take a bit of getting used to but are curiously addictive.

This game clearly fulfils the designers intentions of a playable in an evening battle set, with tactical flavour but operational overview. Each of the four battles comes with multiple replay options and teaches the history well. The rules, once learned, are clear and tight. The learning curve is a little steep and I suggest that you make notes on a copy of the player aid sheet in appropriate places to stop yourself referencing the rulebook for the nuances of the game systems. But once you have made the effort it is a great game with 8 different battles in the series.

RATING: 5
Good presentation - very much liked the counters and the maps.
Particularly enjoyed that you could start the scenarios earlier, and the maps give a lot of room for maneuver. From the casualties in the combat system you can quickly see why some of the maneuver occurred.

The system looks simple but but is heavily dependent on modifies, strength points have a double limitation steps and points so both can turn to limit you. The supporting unit rules is hard to wrap one's head around. Perhaps a bit overdone but provides some interest

A nice try on the wonderful topic of Frederick's battles.

I like some of the ideas. On the most positive side is the need to use your cavalry wisely. If you charge too early you will be disordered and an easy target for your opponent. If you charge against non-disordered infantry, you waste your cavalry. That is good.

On the downside: The system is a very fiddly. There is too much going (ruleswise) in one hex. Like others have commented: the scale is not good. There is no feeling for linear warfare. Instead all action takes place in a 3x3 hex radius, with dumplings of counters pounding each other. I am not satisfied by this.

The BAR series gives a much better feel for this, and tells a much better battle narrative. However, it takes much more time to play.

A good, large scale (500 m), moderately complex tactical game.   Is not an up close, linear formation game, scale is too big for that. Lower complexity allows for play in an evening.  Its strengths are it allows for pre-battle movement that historically occurred in SYW.  Another strength is it mostly puts you in the role of the overall commander in large part by limiting the use of less reliable formations, and Command initiative abilities. But does a surprisingly good job, considering the scale, of implementing smaller scale features by use of stacking and factors affecting battle resolution, such as cavalry vs. infantry.  Rating may go up a little.

Does an excellent job simulating the era with a minimal of rules.  Lots of elegance packed into a small package.  In particular, the unit morale rules (morale generally decreases with step losses) lead both armies to feel "tired".  The cavalry rules in my opinion are very well thought out with out complications of charge zones, morale checks, etc.  You'll get one or two charges out of your horse - importance of reserves really felt.  Gave it a '9' due to rules confusion, and balance at Kunersdorf.

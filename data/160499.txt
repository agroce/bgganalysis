I have a love/hate relationship with KoNY compared to KoT; I think the buildings add more strategy to the game, but I dislike how they work... Fundamentally KoT is a showmanship game; you push your luck, you assume a character and sort of act it out. That's how it's best. If you're treating it like a serious game, I think it falls flat because it's rethemed Yahtzee. The problem is KoNY wants to sort of become that gamer's game...

Love this game! It fixes the main issues we had with KOT (although we still like KOT).  No more rolling for victories while ignoring the other monsters.  Also a lot more going on with the board.. moving, smashing, better cards etc. No power up is why it is not a ten. Cant wait for power up with this edition.

King of Tokyo filler is a light gate way game.  Add extra mechanics and you lose that.  If you want more decisions New York delivers but I feel at the cost of accessibility and extra time.  Not a bad game and if you want a more gamer version of King of Tokyo then it could well be great for you.

This was not an improvement on Tokyo. I have found that the star dice ruled every game that I have played. Maybe the upcoming expansion will alleviate this problem?

RATING: 8
4 plays / 3,5 players

LIKE: Same monster battles as in King of Tokyo. The new building tiles are fun, because smashing things is fun. With certain infantry tiles, you can heal in Manhattan.
DISLIKE: Seems to take a bit longer per player.
OVERALL: Fun. More to think about and more things to attack you than the original, which adds a little extra time per player. Points are easier to get through a variety of ways.

Added: Space Penguin, Cthulhu, Kookie.

King of New York is a great update to the King of Tokyo system, adding another layer of complexity that perfectly fits with the theme.  King of New York is thematic where King of Tokyo is simple.  Both good games for different audiences.

RATING: 8
Strictly better than King of Tokyo. Seriously, I am trading my copy of King of Tokyo. King of NY is just superior. King of NY has all the same core mechanics as Tokyo but with specific improvements that are not only mechanically superior but thematically aligned with the games concept so they make sense. Now monsters can topple buildings for awards, which triggers miliary units that can hurt monsters in different districts but also be destroyed for awards. There is more to do for monsters outside of Manhattan and more reasons to stay in Manhattan than Tokyo. They replaced the 1, 2, and 3 faces of the dice with better actions to aim for. The cards and components are better etc etc. This was a really genuine upgrade of Tokyo IMO.

It's definitely more complex than King of Tokyo. However, it might play just as fast since you can't really turtle. No rolling for 1,2,3, although rolling for superstar does more or less the same thing. Also, the buildings/units thing is fun too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More of a gamer's version of KoT. Because of that however it loses it's purpose for me since KoT is a game I bring out for some fun with non-gamers. KoNY is a bit more complex than I need it to be. I have better fillers to play with my gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game. It can be a bit repetitive (although you have different action card you can buy). I have not played the King of Tokyo so i don't know if it is better or not.
In any case this is a light game, that will bring some fun on the table. I like the fact that "YOU" decide if you want to be the targeted player or not (stay in manhattan or leave (live)?) I would not refuse a game (but not play a second game right behind)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this offers a lot of upgrades to [thing=70323][/thing].  The buildings and military aircraft are a big improvement over the 1, 2, 3 dice of Tokyo, as are the fame and Statue of Liberty card.  Multiple boroughs with monster movement was neat idea, also.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like it as much or maybe even a little more than [b]King of Tokyo[/b].  It has some slight changes that make the game a little more gamer-y: more ways to get points than just a punch-fest, more actions and less numbers on dice.  I was hoping I wouldn't like it, but now I have to buy it...

I consider this to be a fairly significant improvement over King of Tokyo. The board is much more dynamic with the NPC military units taking potshots, and the unenjoyable strategy where someone can sit back and win by rolling nothing but hearts and numbers has been eliminated.

[b]26.11.2014 - after 1 play[/b]
KING OF NEW YORK is the "big brother", more "advanced" version of King of Tokyo. Whoever played the big hit from last years will have no problem playing / getting started with KoNY.

I will talk only about the big differences that the last implementation brings and how they affect the gameplay:
- Buildings/Army Units: the new tokens add easy to obtain points and more importantly, health. Now it is easier to survive in Manhattan
- "Superstar" card: it makes winning by points more difficult, as you need to gain this card before "rolling" for points.

This modifications change the game in two ways: it makes it more "tactical" for experienced gamers, but, more important, it loses the "game for the entire family" status. All the non-gamers that could be attracted with the easier, more streamlined KoT, this title game loses them.

King of Tokyo made more complicated than it needs to be, as I don't think one plays a King of Tokyo type game without expecting it to be quick fluff.

Too chaotic and new game play elements detract from the primary goal of the game. 2015 UPDATE: Main gaming group played this and felt it was too long for what it's worth. We usually play King of Tokyo as a before or after filler game on epic game days. King of New York simply takes too much time away from the main headline game for the day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For sale or trade. Good condition; played a few times with no wear showing as far as I can see.

——

Not a game that was on my personal wish list, or something that would normally pique my interest, but I picked it up with the intent to appeal to our guests and for small parties of 6. Plus I got it for a great price.

Fairly light Yahtzee style game that I think will work for the more casual or non-gamers we have over. The parents have always like Yahtzee games, so figured this would be a nice medium for us.

Played with 2 and 4, better with 4, so hoping 6 will be fun for the group. I also think this will be a good game for the kid(s) when older, and ready to start getting into board games with mom and dad.

Played in the Iello room @ Gen Con 2014. They only had 50 copies per day to sell unfortunately. Played 2p which kind of removed much of the tension, as you could just destroy buildings and move around before the military response became something that really needed to be worried about. The additional features are great, I'm not sure that it replaces the original and I am also not sure that I would rather play this one. I think it will be a massively improved experience (as with KoT) multiway. After one play, 8 for now, same as KoT.

RATING: 8
The same level of simple dice-rolling fun that made King of Tokyo such light, family fun, but the inclusion of stomping buildings adds another element of options that can add a temporary score pay-off but also increases risk by revealing troops in each borough.  The stars on the dice seem to add little value with each game rapidly devolving into a war of attrition rather than a race for points.

Thoroughly enjoyable and over in just the right amount of time.  Highly recommended.

A great lite dice game. I way prefer it to King of Tokyo by comparison. The actual layout of the city brings a lot to the theme. Definitely a fun filler but nothing more than that.

RATING: 8
At first play the game felt more random than its predecessor King of Tokyo. In the second play the game felt already better. It has more randomness, but in KoNY the players are more involved all the time. There is no safe place to run. Even though the two games have a lot in common, they are still different enough. If players want more confrontation, KoNY might be a better choice over KoT.

There are mechanics here I like more than King of Tokyo, like the interactive boroughs with smashing buildings and being attacked by the Army. That said, I was rather shocked that the individual character powers introduced in Power Up! were not carried through here, something I thought would be a given. Excellent game regardless, but doesn't beat out KoT yet.

Basically I want Power Up! cards for the six new characters so I can play them in KoT, and then some sort of system to distinguish all the monsters from both games but in the KoNY map/rules...I hope an expansion will address this.

I only wish it had some sort of way to make each monster unique, and not so generic so choosing monsters will feel a bit more personal. Something like the KoT power ups.

King of New York is a great step 2 game in board gaming. It isn't quite a gateway game, because it has a lot of variations and if/thens that confuse people if they don't understand the base game. That said, once people play Tokyo and then this, they see how great it is and want to play this all the time. 

I can't wait until there's an evolution/power up type expansion for these monsters so we can roll those 3 hearts again!

I find King of New York is much better for 2 players than King of Tokyo, but in general I do not enjoy this as much as the original.  It is a very good game, and might get equal to King of Tokyo as I play it more and more.  It is certainly much deeper and involved than the original; but that might be why I do not love it as much, because I am used to this game being a fast fun romp, where this is longer and deeper.

I was about to buy this instead of King of Tokyo, but fortunately had a chance to play both before buying. I thought that the "complexity" would make this game better but I was wrong. It only made it confusing.

As games they are quite equal, but King of Tokyo is more straightforward and clearer which makes it a little more likeable.

It's everything I love about King of Tokyo (see that comment for details), but with deeper choices and more to do. I like the different boroughs, I like that you can destroy buildings / units for bonuses, and I LOVE that the city might fight back. Now when you push your luck in rolling it's not just that you might end up with a suboptimal roll, now you may lose health!

This sequel to king of tokyo, for me, is better than the original, but only by a little. King of new york plays much the same, but adds more locations which will randomly have tiles that let you focus a bit more on what you want to do, as some give health, some give points, and others give energy.

I like that you can kind of focus your efforts to a strategy more than in tokyo. That being said I rank these the same because while new york is better with gamers, I bring out tokyo more because of how easy it is to teach and learn, and the argument could be made that it doesn't any more complexity than the expansions give it.

This is a tremendous follow up to the original King of Tokyo.  They've added a few elements like, blowing up building and military that attack...these work really well.  It's not much more difficult than King of Tokyo to teach, but it's not nearly as clean of a design.  Hopefully, Iello releases an expansion or two for this.  The Power Up expansion transforms the original game and I'd love to see something similar for KoNY.  If you're a Godzilla/Toho/Kaiji fan then this is a MUST buy.

This wasn't a bad game at all, it simply didn't hold our interest well enough. We played it at 3 players, and it felt like it needed more to have a chance of standing out. Great art and components, but ultimately a bit too simple for us. Would be a good game with kids, or maybe after some drinks, but I prefer something more involved and thinky.

RATING: 6
1 play:

I get the motivation for KoNY: take King of Tokyo, which was on the simple side, and step up the complexity. But I think the added complexity falls flat. The relationship between the boroughs isn't intuitive, and the more finely detailed scoring system doesn't add much. Meanwhile, the power up cards continue to disappoint: they are not especially interesting or compelling in either their powers or muddy identity.

It's still enjoyable, but adding this sort of complexity to a silly brawler doesn't deepen the experience, it just makes it more tedious.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a different experience from King of Tokyo and I like it.  You have to be careful when destroying cities because they attack back, however, I don't feel this one is quite balanced as it seems like just rolling for energy for abilities will win out in the end.  Course that may just be my bad rolling.

RATING: 7.5
A faster playing King of Tokyo. That being said, it feels more soulless. The upgrade cards are more "sterile". While the buildings/units do technically add a little more strategy, it barely changes the game.

If you already own King of Tokyo, it's probably not necessary to pick this game up.

RATING: 8
I like King of Tokyo quite a bit and this is a great take on that system.  It complicates it a bit but makes it more interesting.  Given the choice I probably rather play this and it is kind of annoyingly similar to it's predecessor to the point where I wouldn't normally keep them both.  However, King of Tokyo is one of my favorite games to introduce new people to games and to play with non-gamers and I think the added complexity here would take away from that aspect of it.  So KoT stays in my collection too.

Un buen Filler para echar unas risas.

I borrowed a copy from the PAX East 2015 library to try with Allan (Keyflower just seemed too complex to try and learn on the fly). We missed a few rules with each playthrough but we got a good idea of how the game goes and I ended up ordering it online. It's a fun, quick game. After our first round, even knowing we played wrong, Allan was the one who wanted to play again. It made me really happy! I am creating a dice tray specifically for this game now! I was the dragon and Allan was the robot. I won the first game, but our rules were way off. Allan won the second game more legitimately and our rules were closer to the real ones.

I really wanted this to be better than King of Tokyo but it is not. It adds rules but forgets to add fun. King of Tokyo has a much better rules explanation : fun ratio. I'm passing on the expansion as I am worried it might have the exact same problem of adding rules but not making the game more fun.

RATING: 6.5
First couple of plays. Of course very similar to KoT, but the big difference is the overhaul of the 1,2,3 VP mechanic of the dice. The new system is more complex and detailed, but for a game based largely around the luck of the dice something is lost by trying to add extra layers of rules and more strategy. Still though, quite quick and fun even with 6 players.

Dice Rolling/fighting game

Pros:

Mutans fighting over New York and destroying buildings, it's a fine theme
Little more things to teach/learn then KoT(Tokyo), but much more interesting
Gets even better with the Power Up Expansion.

Cons: 
Can be tricky to get everything (symbols, rules for buildings and army, etc.) for new gamers (but it's really not that complicated)
NEVER play with les than 3 players... even 4

RATING: 5.5
I don't know about this one.  I like that you're destroying buildings and there are military units actually fighting back, but the game is a bit more fiddly and I'm not sure it's worth the slight increase in depth.  

I really come away just asking what does this really add to King of Tokyo and whether it was really worth Garfield's time.  Would much rather have seen him work on something altogether new.

--------------------------------

After more plays I'm actually disliking the new buildings/military units because it makes players have to focus on the board.  Direct interaction is lessened and the game takes a stance at trying to be more thinky and yield greater depth.  It doesn't fit seamlessly and I think KoT is a much better, more streamlined design that brings the fun.

Overall a fun game, an improvement over King of Tokyo. The buildings/military is a really good improvement over the 123stars. I wish energy came at a faster rate as many games go without many of the cards ever getting purchased and there's so many that have fun flavorful effects on the game it's a shame they don't come into play as often as they could. I think my playgroup got bored of the game due to this miss. Games often all felt the same and that's a shame because I think the core of the game is really good.

RATING: 8
For my money, this game is just strictly better than KoT. I miss the Tokyo theme (giant monsters invading Tokyo just feels more right) and I don't like the monsters themselves as much (they went too far all-out-weird vs. KoT's balance of weird and classic movie monsters), but since you can just use KoT's monsters anyway....

So, let's see. Rolling for VP's is way more intuitive (it always takes people at least a full game to remember how the 1/2/3s work in KoT) and VP is now just a more viable strategy. In fact, it seems like win by elimination is now way less likely, which I think is just a good thing. Nobody liked being the one to get killed off in the beginning of the game.

The way the VP goal cards work also increase interaction between players. Keeping tabs on the VP count of those currently holding the cards and actively rolling to steal them away from those in the lead is now an important part of the game.

Staying in Manhattan for multiple turns is also now more viable, and offers richer rewards - which in turn increasingly incentives the OTHER players to lay the smack down on anyone in it. It all just balances out perfectly, IMO, whereas in KoT, it was way too hard to actually... well, very rarely worth the risk to be the King of Tokyo.

The addition of buildings is great mostly for the reasons above (has a chance to add healing to Tokyo / increases VP rewards), but also for another reason: adding actual risk to the pushing your luck element of the game. It's just plain more tense and fun when you're risking actual harm, vs. KoT tamer and duller risk of landing useless rolls.

The cards in general also just feel more balanced - there's still tons of fun powerful combos to be made, but nothing feels game-breaking anymore.

About the only way this is "worse" than KoT is the increased strategical options may make it a more difficult game for non-gamers to grasp. But in my experience, KoT has not been one of the best games for that audience in the first place so it's pretty much a moot point.

Worth the upgrade? If you like the original, then absolutely! And if you haven't played either, just skip KoT and come straight to New York!

Update: Last night we had a game where it was down to just myself and my boyfriend... it was his turn - he had 2 life, 16 VP, and the superstar card. I was in Tokyo with high health and an upgrade that allowed me to discard rolled stars in order to change the face of any other die in my pool. He realized his only chance was to get 4 VP and steal the win from me. With his first two rolls he got 2 stars and 3 buildings, which allowed him to knock down a 2-point building. He needed ONE STAR to win. He rolled, and everyone at the table leaned in and took a deep breath, paused, and then shouted in unison... he rolled the damn star.

Upgraded to an 8.

A cool theme but it's all rather random and some players will be eliminated very quickly.

Boring.

My wife and I love King of Tokyo, and King of New York doesn't disappoint. I think it tries to do a little too much, though: the power-up cards are more balanced, so that's good, but I don't think you need the addition of the buildings and military. It's an enjoyable departure from King of Tokyo, but I do think I prefer the base game.

Great additions to king of Tokyo. It does lose some charm tho for adding the complexity. I can bring out king of Tokyo at the family as a great gateway, this is one step removed from that, but as a gamer, I liked all the changes and would definitely play it again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As an owner and appreciator of King of Tokyo, I was happy to try the slightly more complex sibling. And, generally, if you like one, you'll like the other. As advertised, King of New York adds a bit more complexity by ditching the 1/2/3 values on the dice and subbing instead damage to buildings, symbols that trigger attacks from units, and "fame" stars.

I think I'll keep the original, and I don't need this version. It's probably true that the base game provides a path to winning of just trying to roll number sets, but it's simple, approachable, and a great gateway game. With King of New York, you have a more complex path to snagging points, but the game is slightly less approachable.

Because my audience for my copy is new gamers, I'll stick with King of Tokyo. And if I want to add more, I've got the Power Up expansion, which allows me to spice it up a bit depending on the audience.

I'm still trying to figure out what I think of this. On the one hand, where KoT has gotten a little stale, KoNY adds more options and strategy. But I rarely play KoT with more advanced game groups. So..KoNY has a pretty limited play value. Basically it seems to fit this niche of people who have played KoT with us, enjoyed it, and a ready for a little more challenge. For that reason, I've barely played KoNY. I wish I got it out more, for me personally I think it edges out KoT in fun. I still don't have the rules down perfectly where KoT is so straightforward, I can bring it out without having to dig through the rulebook first. So, yeah...what do I do with this game??

A bit more complex version of King of Tokyo that relies slightly more on mechanisms besides the dice. I still have to be in a dice-chunking mood to enjoy it, but it's pretty good for a dice-chunker.

Like King of Tokyo, but with a few extra features.

It requires a little bit more thinking and I had the feeling you're faster drained of your lives. 

It takes a bit more time to play so I believe King of Tokyo serves better as a fast party game. 

Still it's tense and evokes a lot of emotions :-)

King of Tokyo with more strategy, such as rewards for holding Tokyo (Manhattan) for longer, and a destructible environment. 

Being able to resolve the dice in a preferred order does seem to remove some of the strategy though. More games will be needed, but I prefer KoT based on it's speed for now.

High hopes for that one. 

Never bought King of Tokyo, because something was missing. The numbers 1-3 on the dice definitely bothered me and seemed to me as a wasted opportunity.
KoNY solves that problem for me an brings some cool flair to the game with being able to destroy buildings, jets etc.
Would like to see some expansion some time. Like the KoT Power-up one, just to have some unique skills for the monsters.

King Of Tokyo, vous connaissez ? Ben, King of New York, c'est tout pareil, mais on change de ville. Toujours des gros monstres qui vont se mettre des baffes, encore des baffes, toujours des baffes. Oui mais maintenant il y a des buildings, des véhicules, des avions. Donc on va pouvoir casser du building et gagner quelques précieux bonus. Et puis bon, détruire New York, c'est toujours fun. Ça me rappelle les jeux vidéo nintendo d'il y a 25 ans où on montait sur un immeuble avec notre gorille et qu'on cassait tout. Rampage, que ça s’appelait (le premier qui fait une remarque sur mon age se prends une baffe)

Looks much more fun than actually plays.

My impression was that there's simply too much "stuff" (the destroyable tiles, three levels and two tracks of manhattan, the cards with token effects etc.) compared to the amount of actual doing.

The game needs a scoring track of some kind that would show all players' victory points and health at a glance. That's the information that matters, and with the current score/health trackers it's difficult to keep track of different players. Many times someone winning is just anticlimatic because no one noticed they were getting close to 20 points.

That said the graphics and dice rolling will surely attract younger players. Then again, player elimination probably won't.

Let us look back and think why King of Tokyo was such a great hit. It was easy to pick up, with not many rules, with a relatively short playtime. So, let's keep the core mechanisms, but add in a whole bunch of stuff that makes the game overly complex that doesn't necessarily add any additional value to the game. If someone asks me to play this game, I'll tell them to play King of Tokyo instead.

Okay game for what it is. Better than King of Tokyo in the sense that there are several more decisions to make and things to account for, but even more randomness with the skull die face. There are essentially more consistent sources of damage and points to make sure the game goes by quicker.

I've enjoyed playing this game much more than King of Tokyo. I like the extra depth of destroying buildings and having the army attack you or other monsters. Also the extra rewards for staying in Manhatten present a real dilemma about how long to stay in and when to get out. But my wife and brother-in-law, who have played it with me haven't been as impressed. I'm not sure why.

Sold as I recently played King of Tokyo again and quite liked it.  King of New York will be harder for the kids to grasp so I bought a copy of King of Tokyo instead.

This expansion is definetly suited for bringing out when you want to play a more strategic KoT.
There are many new things to watch out for and do that the essence of KoT got diluted.
It is a great game that I enjoyed, the monsters are funny and the cards have cool art/humor.
Between KoT & this, my group enjoyes the more fast paced dice chugging KoT.

P.D It's funny how they integrated the whole Monsters appear in Tokyo and everyone runs a la Godzilla, but Monsters attack NY and the military comes.

This version expands the gameplay of the original King of New York and adds a fresh game play to the game.  While the other was perfect for casual game night this one adds just enough to expand that option after everyone gets use to the other version or makes this game a better suited normal game away from the party.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Edit: Revised this game up to a 7 because after playing a bit more my opinion has improved.

Despite our groups love for KoT, New York is never requested, and I never really want to suggest it either.

If I want to play a light game, I'll play KoT, if I'm looking for something heavier (which is what KoNY tries to be), this doesn't really fit either.

From a gameplay standpoint, I feel like there are a lot more wasted dice in KoNY, aside from the Claw/Heart/Energy faces, all of the other faces are only useful if you get enough of them; this is especially problematic with the 'smash'(?) rolls, as they are often very important at certain times, but never seem to turn up when you really need them.

Perhaps this needs more plays to really give it a fair chance, but it hasn't done a good job of hooking my group, and never sees the table even though it's always with us. (We managed to cram KoNY and KoT into one box, but KoT is always the one that gets unpacked)

I don't want to be that guy. I tend not to be that guy. I'm generally all for Kaiju movies and stuff... but for some reason I don't think I can play King of New York. It just hits too close to home. It's a shame Sam and I greatly enjoy play...ing King of Tokyo though.

I know it is a double standard, but in King of New York you can apparently have your Kaiju knock down buildings. I lived too close to the real thing and have vivid memories.

Sorry Mr. Garfield, I just cannot play it quite yet.

I was really surprised how much I didn't care for this as compared to King of Tokyo.

I managed to pick up a copy of the gen con pre-release, and am very thankful for it. King of Tokyo has been a staple in several of my game groups, friends and family for over a year. However, even with its expansions KoT has begun to feel predictable with its lack of strategic options. 

King of New York genuinely feels like a breath of fresh air. There is enough of the original mechanic for the game to feel familiar, however the inclusion of several new possible strategies makes the game seem far more involving than its predecessor. While I am not keen on most of the new character designs, I would say this is irrelevant considering the vast improvements upon game mechanics. 

I should note that King of New York works brilliantly as a two-player game, partially because the game appears to be much better balanced between winning with victory points and being the last monster standing. King of Tokyo always fell short in this department, being virtually unplayable with two players and being completely imbalanced towards victory points. It still has the party-game feel of King of Tokyo, however it is great to have a version that can be played outside of large groups with good success. 

If you enjoyed the theme, style and gameplay of King of Tokyo but found it lacking in tactic and variety, I would highly suggest you check this one out.

I like KoNY, but I still prefer King of Tokyo for what it gives me. When I want to play KoT, it's specifically to chuck handfuls of dice and have some mindless fun.

After a handful of plays, I'm not sure if it is better than Tokyo or not.   The smashing of buildings is definitely a thematic element that was missing in the first game and it is nice to have it here.   It fixes the turtling problem and the rules clarify a number of small issues with Tokyo as well.   So maybe it is better, even though I rate it one point lower, mostly due to the fact that half the game is re-hash.

This game is pretty cool. You and your friends battle for the domain of new york as Kaijus, winning points (stars) by destroying buildings and buying cards. A great theme, nice components, a lot of fun. 

It's all about dice, they are really great, although some players can't handle the Building destructions and units damage of dice (Is a little confusing for non-board gamers).

If your friends or family are board game players, KoNY is a great game, but if they don't, then go for the King of Tokyo version, cause it's easy to understand and clear to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a good game, made worse by the fact it's predecessor exists. 

King of New York aims to fix a couple of problems we found in King of Tokyo:
1.) The pacifist approach of rolling nothing but points and staying out of Tokyo at all costs
2.) Players who would avoid all interaction and tech up, becoming unstoppable in the late game

King of New York fixes these issues. It does so by being more complex. 

Unfortunately, this may mean that there's no real place for King of New York anymore.

King of Tokyo was so simple that it worked as both a gateway game and a filler. King of New York is just a bit too complicated for non gamers.

Competitive, Light

Quick and easy, free-for-all dice chucker.  Plays in a reasonable time, great for table banter and just enough variety that the game doesn't get monotonous.  Player elimination is generally ok but sometimes people do get killed fast (usually THEIR fault though) so there can be a decent amount of time people are just sitting around waiting for the game to end.  At least turns are fast enough that players still in the game don't have a ton of down time. Colt Express has however kicked this off my go-to 6 player light game.

This is the sequel to the highly regarded King of Tokyo.  The game retains the Yahtzee style push-your-luck element of the original, but adds more decision and depth with the addition of destructible buildings and military units that respond to the damage you do.

An excellent sequel to King of Tokyo. There's just more going on/more ways to win with this version and experienced gamers will probably find themselves coming back to this version more often than KoT. We did have to house rule the Superstar mechanic, however. Since it's so easy to score a quick VP win with it, every game turned into a straight-up fight for this one card. After making it "Once you own the Superstar card, every 2 stars you roll (rounded down) yields 1VP", our games started having more variety.

King of New York might be deeper than King of Tokyo, but I don't think that is a good thing in this case.  It's a simple game, and the additions to this one seem to work against it.

King of New York has a nice blend of simple strategy and push-your-luck.  Keep an eye on the cards and your opponents points because some pretty insane combo's can be built from the cards in the marketplace.

While luck is a definite component over the game, King of New York plays long enough that for the most part it averages out, but the dice will still cause some holy-shit moment peaks in the action.  

Not too heavy, not too light.

To me, the extra cruft included in this game detracts from it as compared with the original King of Tokyo.  This is similar to the way I feel the Cities and Knights version of Settlers is far less enjoyable than the base game.

King of Tokyo gets done everything I want it to do;  I see no need for and don't value the extra elements.

Not as good as KoT, to me, but it'll take a while to match the nostalgia factor with that one. It's solid, and more game-y, which could be ok but at this point it feels to me like 80% of a game that needs an expansion to really shine.

Edit: Now with it's powerup expansion, it's fully better than KoT in my opinion. Still would play either, but if there's a mix of gamers and newbies, I'd reach for KoNY

I don't feel this game is really any better than KoT, it's just different.  You can still roll for points but you have to earn a goal card for that.  The buildings give you more choices but the military attacks end up being yet another way to get hurt instead.  The cards are swingy as before.

See comments below, but this is a straight downgrade from King of Tokyo, a game I still own (for now) but haven't played in forever because there's not enough actual game there.  Wasn't sad at all to give King of New York away.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

A straight downgrade from King of Tokyo that adds more fiddly bits but no real extra strategy.  Absolutely awful with two, despite the original game being passable at that player count.  Not leaving a numeric rating because I only played the one time, but if I did it would probably be two points lower than King of Tokyo.

RATING: 6
I enjoy the occasional game of king of Tokyo and so I am looking forward to this as an influx of new cards and characters that can be used in the original as well as a new(ish) concept i.e smashing up buildings etc

Interesting but quite different to king of Tokyo. There are area control aspects and some random units which means there are more targets for your damage. I am surprise how different a game of this feels to King of Tokyo. Currently Manhatten feels a little overpowered as you gain so many points per turn whilst being in a very aggressive position, and the cards are very hit and miss with large swings in cost (up to 12energy I believe). I dont like either of the goal cards either.... once you have the fame one it is difficult for someone to take it off you and you can score lots of points very quickly.

I think I prefer Tokyo for its simplicity, but I do like the buzzsaw weilding mantis :)

SI te gustan los dados y los juegos ligeros lo disfrutarás. El juego no está mal, pero para mi tiene un fallo gordo: la eliminación de jugadores durante la partida.

I prefer the Tokyo version instead as it is tighter, faster, and more fun.

This version adds 3 extra symbols on the dice so you rarely get what you really want, and makes a simple, quick game longer by adding in the building/military tiles.

RATING: 8
I freaking love this game.  Fun theme.  Fun art.  A light-hearted game that no one seems to get annoyed at losing all the time.  Seriously - you will not care about winning  all that much when you play this game - you'll be laughing and smiling at the characters and abilities and such.  There's lots of dice, but there's rerolls, so don't worry about it if you hate RNG.  There's also lots of abilities you can get from cards which can effect the dice (further reducing RNG) or give you a whole host of other abilities.  You'll never get through the whole deck in one game, so its got replay-ability.

Just read the rules carefully.  We missed one key rule that's half a sentence long in one place in the instructions the first time we played and it changed everything.  What we missed caused one person to be eliminated some 3 turns in, and had everyone else doggedly avoiding actually entering New York, which is kind of the point of the game.

My housemate owns this game, so I haven't bothered to buy it, but its my first purchase the moment I move out.

RATING: 9
Pros
-Thematic use of monsters destroying building leading to army coming to fight off the monsters
-More player interaction than King of Tokyo
-Game makes full use of 6 sides of dice for fully different effects rather than just 1, 2 and 3 as in King of Tokyo
-Feels like more things to do than King of Tokyo, more (focused) paths to victory
-Adds a small spatial element to the game
-Opens up design space greatly

Cons
-Still luck based game
-Slightly more complex
-Possibly longer game length
-Higher chance of (early) player elimination
-Can feel frustrating when you can't roll what you need, even more so than KoT because not rolling 3 star means another player benefits and gets to keep Superstar, Ouches might hurt you etc.
-Monsters are all the same
-High price point
-Limited integration with King of Tokyo
-Overlaps in game collection with King of Tokyo

Why is this a bad game? First the character choices. They are silly and I personally find them stupid design choices. Why? because if you look at King of Tokyo and its first and second edition the monsters are clearly like kong and godzilla and great choices. Even the sea monster was great. The art was well done too. This art for this version is more cartoony but the fish bowl monster and a dinosaur as Sherriff are stimply stupid characters to add to this game. It's not merely an opinion, it is a fact and lowers this game to a game perhaps fit for 6 year olds. Yet, it is suppose to be the more adult version of the game and adds that complexity. Epic Fail on that and I blame the Ello designer. If there were a Razzie for board games for Worse Boardgame of 2014 this game would win because of reasons like that. But on top of that, King of Tokoyo already existed and in reality the better design choice would have been to put out an add on expansion that gave you a new expanded map of Tokoyo (or New York) and the mechanics of using the tanks and buildings like you see in this game as OPTIONAL rules. They are there if you want to use them and you add to your monsters and existing KoT game. So your simply adding some extra options to the game you already own. If wanted they could have added a new monster much like the power up, yet I would not have if I were the designer, since if you don't like these options to play your KoT game you could just skip this expansion. It is purely for those who want it. Yet, if you wanted to use that for the KoT since KoNY adds them your forced to buy a much more expensive second core game just to get it and new monsters which a) are needed as they are alternative clones of the existing KoT monsters, and b) they are stupid monsters. If they had monsters they should have expanded to something like a Space Moth (like Mothra) or something similar, like a flying something type monster, and they don't need another ape or dinosaur, but the Mecha Lizard was I think done in the KoT second edition so they don't need that, though a Mecha Kong might be ok. I do like the soviet looking ape for KoNY. Still I am saying all this because Ello could have made a good game but instead dropped out this pure Razzie winning game.

Very light game that requires some boisterous energy from the players to carry the entertainment.  Fortunately, the game flow promotes that energy.  More interactive than King of Tokyo, but  similar enough that I'm confident in saying that if you like/dislike KOT, you will feel the same about King of New York.  Prefer KOT for it's simplicity.  If I want to move up the complexity scale, there's other games I'd prefer.

Great game! 
Despite being a dice game and luck playing a big part in it, this is still a very strategical game where you can mitigate dice rolls and plan strategies trying to take advantage of whatever you roll.

Plays well with 2 players, although sometimes one player can just get away and go straight for the win. It's awesome to play with 3 to 6 players, even with 6 the game flow doesn't slow down, however the more players the more time the game will take.

If we want to play with 2 players, we do one of two things. Either we each control 2 characters, or we use the 2 player variant (by turtleback):

1) A player does not receive a victory point for entering Manhattan.

2) A player in Manhattan receives one victory point less in each section of Manhattan. So, instead of gaining one victory point and one energy in the first section of Manhattan, the player would only receive one energy. In the next section the player would receive one victory point and one energy instead of two victory points and one energy... And so on.

A fun dice game with some cool monster theming. The theme is fairly light, though, and in a 2 player game it can end very quickly - which is a bit of a shame since there's not always enough game to make the setup worth it - as well as feeling a bit unfair, since the benefits of being in Manhattan are seriously overpowered in a 2 player game. In a game with more players it's much, much better - lots of back and forth and interesting strategic choices, with a very good playing time.

Az alapfelállás egyszerű: legyél a legnépszerűbb szörny vagy maradj csak egyedül életben. Tehát két út vezet a győzelemhez, amelyben a többi kis karmos-csápos-fogaskerekes-páncélos-agyaras-szőrős szörnyeteg meg akar akadályozni, hiszen csak egyetlen királya lehet ennek a városnak is.
Akcióid kockadobásokon, újradobásokon alapulnak, amelyek során gyógyulsz, sebzel másokat, energiát szerzel a továbbfejlődéshez és zúzod a várost (amely nem szégyellős és vissza is csap).
A szerencse szerepe igen nagy, viszont cserébe a jó hangulat garantált (ha nem vagy sértődékeny). Meglepetés győztesek is születhetnek, de királlyá nem csak válik az „ember”, hanem néha azzá teszik.:)
Ami negatívum, hogy 5-6 játékosnál nagyban megnő a holtidő, a játék hosszúvá válik. 3-4 fővel viszont szépen felpörögnek az események, főleg, ha az egyik játékos valami „atom” jó tulajdonságot szerez meg.

Es un casi-filler, competitivo, que se juega en base a tiradas de dados. 

Cada jugador lleva a un "megamonstruo" (un mecharobot gigante, un "king kong", etc. son inventados ex profeso para el juego, pero cumplen perfectamente) y su objetivo es derrotar a todos los demas. 

La jugabilidad está bastante bien ajustada y lo mas importante: es muy divertido de jugar. 

Quiza le falta un poco de "chicha" a los personajes, y a las artes, para ser magnifico, pero se mantiene en un nivel muy bueno. 

100% aconsejable para neofitos y para introducir jugadores.

Significantly better than its cousin; the increase in aggression and complexity is very much worth it. In Tokyo, half the die faces were boring and too many of the cards were dull--here both of those problems are solved.

I can understand why some people prefer KoT, although I don't share their opinion.

I really like King of Tokyo, so I thought the more gamerly iteration would be a smash hit. Unfortunately I think the original is better.  I think the ability to smash buildings and military is a great idea, but simplicity of the original is preferred in this case - and the monsters are sooooo much better in the original too!

I'm hoping that an expansion comes out and makes the game better.

This just goes 10 Minutes longer than King of Tokyo because Players are thinking a bit more about their options. 10 Minutes is not a lot for the more thematic approach, but since this game has player eliminiation, that is a long time. So for that reason 3 points lower than King of Tokyo.

Reasonable upgrade to King of Tokyo, King of New York offers a few more options and a few more decisions for players to make.

Though not a bad game, I almost never want to play this when King of Tokyo is available as well.  I don't understand the appeal of turning a great thirty minute game into a slightly sloggy 45-minute game.  There's too much bookkeeping and the turns don't fly by the way they do in King of Tokyo.

And half the time you just die to the military units on the board, rather than head to head kaiju throw downs.  Where's the fun in that?

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2015)

Better than King of Tokyo, but still a very boring game for me. The luck factor continues to be through the roof (dice rolls, random cards) for a game than can take up to an hour to finish. It gets boring very quickly and you always do the same every turn. I had never have any fun playing this or King of Tokyo. The strategy is very low and the best play seems obvious.

The game components and art are pretty good.

Bottom line, King of New York is way too simple and has way to much luck for a game of this time length. I will do my best to stay away from it.

That was a letdown.  It takes a simple, approachable fun game like KoT which encourages players to beat each other up.....and tweaks up the scoring options so it's more viable to euro it.

RATING: 7.5
Dice rolling game where, after two possible re-rolls, you try to wreak havoc on the city of New York, strike the other monsters until you're the last one left, gets cards to increase your power, or just heal yourself to last another round. The learning curve isn't steep, but you may have to reference BGG for card clarifications more than you think. It's a little more aggressive than King Of Tokyo too, since the city eventually fights back.

PLUS: fairly easy to grasp, enjoyable artwork, fun for all ages
MINUS: players get knocked out and may have to wait a while for playing again
SEMI-MINUS: Tokyo players call Manhattan the wrong city!

King of New York takes all the stuff from King of Tokyo and ramps it up into a more "gamer game".  This isn't necessarily a good thing.  While it's not a bad game by any means, I think I'll stick with King of Tokyo.  It's easier to play and get into and just more fun at its basic level.  New York will come out once in awhile though if I play with folks looking for a little more substance, but Tokyo will be my go-to when in the mood for monster Yahtzee.

King of New York takes the basic mechanics of its wildly popular predecessor and adds a handful of strategic considerations. The movement decisions, in particular, contribute a welcome freshness to the game. That said, after playing KONY it became clear that much of KOT's charm is derived from its simplicity. KONY is fun but, like the vast majority of sequels, it doesn't rise to the bar set by what came before it.

UPDATE: The Cthulhu Monster Pack, with its KONY mini-expansion elements, is worth the investment.

RATING: 6.5
Excellent, fast-paced fun for 2-6 (though for two players you'll want to each take a pair of monsters). 4 players is really the sweet spot though - go any higher and you're guaranteed one or two other players will be knocked out very quickly and have nothing to do for the next 15-20 minutes. One of the few games in my collection that would benefit from chunkier pieces for the monsters, rather than cardboard standees.

Yahtzee with a theme.

Take King of Tokyo, a game that is the perfect level of simple for all its dice rolling and add more complexity? Bad idea. Why make King of Tokyo into a "gamers' game"? It feels better without this complexity. I like the power ups from the expansions, but all the city buildings, and the way that enemies just pile up keep this from being a welcome iteration.

Easy to pick up and play and is an okay for family play with younger children. Game doesn't provide much depth, it is almost too simplistic. If you like deeper strategic games then this isn't really for you. Not much more than a basic game like monopoly or sorry. I found myself saying "so what?"

Bottom line: This game is popular because of its theme.  It's not a particularly good game, but it is better than it's predecessor: King of Tokyo.  There is more to do in New York.  You can't sit back and bide your time in this game like you can in KoT.  Some people like the characters better in KoT than the ones in KoNY, but that has zero effect on gameplay; the tokens might as well be different colored meeples.
This franchise has appealing artwork, but at its core it's just another luck based dice game.

The next iteration in the King of series, moving the action to New York removes the numbers on the dice, and replaces them with fame and destroying the city. A quick and accessible game, I managed to get my 70 year old mother to play - and she won the game! Easy to play, simple rules, and lots of fun, I highly recommend this game to anyone.

The sequel to King of Tokyo.  Very similar game, if you are familiar with King of Tokyo, but there are some cool new mechanisms added.  There is now more of a map to move around on and there are buildings and military units you can destroy.  Very fun and maybe a bit more in-your-face than King of Tokyo because it is harder to turtle in this game.

The denser board seems like a good tactical addition, but I wasn't convinced by the military, where a single unlucky final reroll could kill a player (although maybe we just happened to have an army-heavy board, in the one game I played). The stars felt out of theme, and crushing real-world buildings and events seemed like a bad tonal mis-step. Think I probably prefer Tokyo on balance.

Although probably better than King of Tokyo which I gave an "8" to, This game is just not "different enough" for me from King of Tokyo, and there are no specialty cards for the new monsters would be another tick against it.  I'm a bit disappointed that I have to wait for a coming expansion to buy specialty cards.  So, my recommendation, if you don't have King of Tokyo, buy King of New York.  If you own King of Tokyo already, don't bother.

RATING: 7.5
What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve "Fame", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.

The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.

The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I didn't think I would like the changes in this version of the game but it actually works very well and enhances the game. The game also seems to push along a bit faster with monsters having more opportunity to take damage as well as score a bit more easily. The buildings which grant points/health and then turn into military units which can hurt monsters is a nice touch.

Monsters go smash New York!
A development on King of Tokyo, KoNY brings a destructable map, and a local population that can fire back. Unfortunately this makes the game take on a more defensive tone, as it is simply too dangerous to go all out attack (which was what made KoT such fun in the first place, especially with the expansion) - hopefully the expansion can make up for that
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
King of New York succeeds in making you feel like a giant monster. The destruction of buildings and subsequently dealing with the military adds a lot of flavor to the King of Tokyo formula. 

But I'm not convinced King of Tokyo needed to be more complex and at higher player counts, this game can drag.

I'm giving this a preliminary 8 with the feeling it will rise to rival KoT. 

It's a Trzewiczek style evolution of a system, which is a very good thing. The dice have been massively tweaked making each roll more tense and decision filled. 

It's a bit longer, but much of that seems to be inexperience. The game also seems to lean toward winning by VPs, even though tons of damage is doled out and players killed, it seems TPKO wins might not occur as often. Time will tell.

So far owning both is a great thing. The old game is so different, especially with expansions, that I won't be selling it off any time soon.

More depth than King of Tokyo, replacing KoT's numbers (half the dice faces are strictly for accumulating points) with extra actions. In addition to smacking the monster in Manhattan (this game's Tokyo), move around the other four boroughs smashing buildings and fighting the army for effects targeted at what you want to collect (points, hearts, or energy).

"Better" or "worse" than KoT, though, is not the right question in my mind. KoT is superior if you want to ensure that a game is up and running quickly (for instance, if you're playing with younger players or teaching games at an event). KoNY is superior if you're OK with the moderate additional rules overhead.

A really fun dice game with an amusing theme. Some elements of strategy despite being mainly luck based due to the dice.

Power ups are always great fun though some seem to be absurdly powerful in relation to others.

A superior version of King of Tokyo in every way.  Heard some complaints about points and superstar being too strong, however, that just means that you are ignoring claws.  The game has enough content where I feel that the Power Up expansion isn't a requirement to enjoy the game, unlike King of Tokyo where it was a must.

Essentially King of Tokyo that is geared more towards gamers but is still easy to learn.  I like KONY better than KOT because it adds more gameplay and more fighting.  Be warned, you will die much faster in this game if you're not careful.

Small changes to the rules that makes for some extra layers of strategy. Feels like King of Tokyo and it's more or less the same game, plus more. Will definitely play some more! So far (9 plays) I think the game is actually better. It's faster, there's more to do, but not at all overwhelming, and the artwork is gorgeous. Miss the Power Up expansion though, but I guess you could just add it. Looking forward to seeing the expansions!

More of the stellar theme, artwork and components. 
Slightly more complicated and deep than KoT, which is both good and bad, depending on the circumstances and who you're playing with. 

Some balance issues seem to emerge from destroying buildings, which can render the whole Superstar aspect of the game very inefficient in comparison. Card effects might be also slighty less exciting than in the original game? To be played more.

Played in Essen and that won me a Space Penguin. I think I like KoT better, but that's because I compare the two. KoNY looks and feels bigger than KoT. Where KoT is a themed Yathzee, this is a little bit more. Still, I like a (simple) themed Yathzee more.

If I have the chance, I will play KoNY, but for now I stick with my KoT. If anyone is willing to sell/trade me the KoNY monsters, then please PM me. ;)

There is a bit more chaos here than in King of Tokyo. More things happening, more choices, more bits and pieces. I love King of Tokyo but found it could almost be dull if you only had 2 people playing, King of New York has more going on so it seems to work better for two players. I would say it is worth having both in your collection (or at least in your game group).

I already really liked King of Tokyo (especially with the expansions), and this feels very much like a better version of that game. Instead of just rolling for victory points (1/1/1, 2/2/2, 3/3/3), which led to some players choosing not to interact at all with other players, and wasn't particularly thematic, you now have to stomp around destroying buildings in order to win, which fits perfectly with the theme, is really fun, and leads to interesting gameplay choices. Great!

Got nuked by the tanks as everyone gunned for me.  Good times!  Hilarious since my wife gunned for me (while she was in Manhattan herself) and ended up dying with me as another player took us both out.  Died with 8 powers.

Este juego fue un regalo y después de jugar la primera partida (en menos de 8 minutos) pensamos que habíamos interpretado mal las instrucciones, y cerramos la caja. Tuvo que pasar casi un año hasta que volvimos a jugar, con otro grupo, y entonces si que empezó a brillar un poco más. La cantidad de interacción que hay dependerá del grupo con el que juegues, puede que sea  muy agresivo y en cuatro rondas ya haya un monstruo muerto a zarpazos y ni de tiempo a jugar alguna carta, o al contrario, partidas que se alarguen, donde se compran un montón de cartas y las unidades militares hagan muchos estropicios.
Solo lo hemos probado a 4 (muy divertido) y a 2 (que no merece la pena)

It's a better game for gamers than KoT is... It adds a bit more choice making to the game and I like it better than KoT for that...

I think that the Theme of the game that monsters are causing destruction in the city is more prevelent in this one than in KoT...

Having said that I think that KoT still has is merits, it will appeal more to family games and children than KoNY because it's simpler... it's almost only dice rolling and little to none decisions to be made... KoNY makes this a more challenging game and therefor less accessible for everyone

RATING: 4
I was expecting something better, a little more complex and even more fun than Tokyo version, which btw. I absolutely love. Is it more complex? Yes, a little but is that makes it more fun? Absolutely no, I'd say it makes it less fun. The buildings/military idea is great but military can kill the game too quick sometimes and there's no time to buff your monster with cards which is the best part of the game to me. I've tried it with the same group I did the Tokyo one for the very first time and everyone were into Tokyo much more. It's just a type of game that loose on the level of complexity and elements - less is more. Not to mention we dig monster characters in Tokyo version more (and we all know they are VERY important to the game, haha!). I might give it another chance tho as I feel it needs few plays to get into some tactics and get the most out of it. If there was no Tokyo I'd give it a higher rate probably but... Looking forward for some expansions maybe they will help.

+1 great combination of theme and artwork. Even little things like how huge the monsters feel on the small board add to it. 

+1 icon die rolling/rerolling balances a little strategy with randomness well. 

+.5 Several mechanics (dice rolling, few vs many) mechanics combine to give a 'running the gauntlet feel, which adds a small amount of tension and drama

+.5 the game has a little strategy to it, somewhat mitigated by setup time, and taking longer than a filler game to teach. 

+.5 Plays 6 well, without adding a huge amount of playtime - mitigated somewhat by all of the "wait, what?" reactions being in the 5-6 part of the rules. 


-1 Player elimination. Can happen suddenly, unavoidably and without any real 'mistakes' from the player. 

-.5 For a box-board-n-lotsa-pieces type game, the strategy feels a little shallow - but it does still feel like you're making decisions.

People say it is worse then King of Tokyo because it is more complicated. That is ridiculous - this game is only a tiny bit more complex. And that difference makes it much better for me to play. I also did not find anyone who could not grasp it on the spot, even if they did not play KoT before. Excellent, light, fun game for 3-6 players.

RATING: 6
Too many fiddly rules for what it is. KoNY should be a light, easily accessible gateway/end or beginning of night game.  They tried to add meat to it and ended up making it too heavy for what it is, but not heavy enough to be a medium-weight game. For the amount of time it takes to teach new players this game's rules with all the new (since KoT) extras, I'd rather play something meatier like Dice Town or even Lords of Vegas (which would take a bit more time to teach, but would be a much richer gaming experience).

Also, the camping is Manhattan strategy is way too strong with two players and either needs to be house-ruledto fix or just not played with two players.

With the power up expansion, this game really shines as all the monsters receive abilities that differentiate them from each other.

RATING: 6
It definitely improves upon the first game, but there is a major issue that remains. Every game, there is a player that "runs away with it", meaning they get all the energy early, buy the best power-ups, and then seen untouchable. The game is balanced in a way that by the end, this person doesn't ALWAYS win, but it makes the game itself feel like a chore. When your friend has 3 power-ups and 10 energy with almost full health, while you sit there with no power-ups, 2 energy, and low health, it's not fun. It feels deflating. You might sneak out a win against all odds, but the moments before the win are empty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I didn't think much of King of Tokyo but at least it was light and reasonably quick and some conservative play seem to be rewarded. King of Tokyo seems more convoluted but more randomness. I think the monsters need to start with more hit points, say 15, because getting poor early rolls and then getting pummelled early by slightly luckier players is too quick considering the increased complexity of the game.

Haven't played King of Tokyo in a few years, so I decided to give this one a shot. As I suspected, this is a more fulfilling experience than King of Tokyo is. Everything is largely the same except that you get points mostly from destroying buildings, and there's a bit more of a spatial element as you move around the city. I'm a big fan of the presentation, as it really looks like you're playing around a city full of giant monsters. I still find the gameplay to be entertaining, but not exactly interesting. I tend to disagree with most that this is the more complex game. I always disliked having to explain how points are acquired in KoT, and I like how it is handled here better. A fun game, but I'm not sure it's anything I need to own for the long haul.

Fired King of Tokyo from my collection.  I like that KoNY gives the players more to do if they aren't in the main point-getting parts of the city (Tokyo/Manhattan).  I'll of course keep KoT, so I can keep playing as Cyber Bunny!

EDIT: Not sure if I'll ever play this one with more than 4.  At higher player counts, the game drags and it's really hard to see anything on the board.

EDIT PART DEUX: Traded away.  Could never get anyone interested in playing it.

Great dice chucking fun surrounding a yahtzee dice mechanic. Great chucky custom dice that are a blast to throw. The art is great and having the town attack you as you play is a great addition to this series. The cards can feel a little forgotten at times, and by the time the cards come into heavy play the game is nearly over. Not a big deal, but a slight issue. I almost wish they had done the special abilities a bit differently, but still great. Highly recommended!

What the game did right what giving us an actual board to do stuff on and removing the less exciting die faces of the original game (1/2/3).

Unfortunately, King of New York doesn't solve the main problem of King of Tokyo. Sure, the army NPCs increase lethality so that stacking hearts/energy in your corner isn't as prevalent as it was in Power Up; but that makes sitting in Manhattan way too dangerous a proposition until there are 1-2 opponents left, leaving the game potentially worse than its elder in this regard. It's still about fleeing that area you didn't want to enter in the first place, but did because rules.

Other negatives are the initial setup (where you're supposed to make piles of chits on the same face without ever looking at them) and the generally cluttered board that doesn't add enough depth to justify how hard it is to read, since each stand-up monster will fatally prevent at least one player from seeing a part of the information.

The kaijū of the west are determined to dominate New York. 6 new monsters vie for the title of King of New York! Similar to its predecessor King of Tokyo, King of New York utilizes a Yahtzee-esque dice-rolling mechanic, but adds additonal game elements in the form of buildings and military units for the kaijū to smash ans eat for additional health, energy, or victory points. However, the military doesn’t always sit idle and will strike back! Who will be the King of York!?

I doubt the elimination in this is much, if at all, longer than in King of Tokyo, but even in that game, I hate knowing that my friends can potentially be out of the game for 20 minutes or more due to freak rolls. I wish they would make a King of... game that didn't have elimination but still had the wailing on monsters :(

Love the theme of this series though and would like to try this. I just hope it keeps the fast-paced spirit of the original.

Played, and I like the six different things the dice can do now. I think the tanks and stuff can slow down the game unfortunately though, and I dont think the king of series is meant for any sort of strategy. So the lack of elegance of the original hurts this one. Also liked old monaters more though drakonis is cool imo. I think if they could combine elements of both games while making it fun and exciting this game could be really good esp if they removed player elimination

There is a lot more strategy in this one than King of Tokyo: you have to invest more time plotting your moves in order to gain victory points, and there are more strategic ways to damage other monsters than simply punching. However, it is not as accessible as KoT, and it outstays its welcome a bit by artificially lengthening KoT's short but sweet formula.

This was much better than the original.  I still got killed pretty quickly towards the end, but this is much better in that regard.

If I ever pull the trigger on this, this will be the edition that I will be looking for because it gives you quite a few ways to get points and life, which is pretty cool.

A more complicated version of King of Tokyo, which personally takes the charm out of the game. The reason I love Tokyo is because I can play it with anyone. I can't play New York with anyone, just gamers, so when I had the choice between the two, I bought King of Tokyo. Still a good game.

Der Nachfolger von King of Tokyo verkomplizierte ein Spiel, welches durch seine Einfachheit glänzte und sitzt dadurch arg zwischen den Stühlen.
Zu verkopft für lockeres Umhergedallere, noch immer zu simpel für ernsthaften Wettstreit. Dazu hat sich die Action verlangsamt und die neuen Monster sind auch nicht so cool wie ihre Pendants auf Japan.

This is King of Tokyo on steroids. I suspect this is an attempt to make another market hit by adding some features to a very popular game. It will probably be sucessful, but I already advance I don't like it.

IMHO, it takes what made KoT great, the simplicity and the fluidity, and takes them away in order to add some meat to a game that was very light. But the bunch of new rules don't add any significant depth to the game, it is still very light and luck based, and to pay for that you have some administration and rules complexity to deal with.

I see KoT fans loving KoNY, but I don't think most new players will like KoNY more than KoT. 

KoT is probably the game I played the most since I bought it 2 years ago (I see 31 games registered at BGG), probably because its a game I can play with any group, and my association hosted 2 tournaments in the last year. That would not have happened with KoNY.

I was afraid this would be not "new" enough and just a copy of KoT to sell it again. 

However it turned out, it "fixes" something about KoT that I wasn't even aware needed fixing before. In retrospect the numbers do feel a little bit bland now compared to destroying buildings and becoming a superstar :D . The game also moves a little quicker especially with more players as nobody can hide and heal for a while.  

I however still like KoT a lot and KoNY is not gonna replace it completly as I have the feeling KoT scales a little better for lower player numbers (our variant for 2 players - getting one point less each round for being in Tokio - still seems to work ok for KoNY but games are still maybe a little too short as it moves in general a little quicker which is maybe a little too quick for 2) and also is still easier to teach to new people.

A little more strategic than King of Tokyo with more options to obtain victory. Also more complex though, while the core game mechanics are the same.

RATING: 7.6
Everything that was fun about King of Tokyo, but improved. The buildings/military targets add an interesting element to the game, and they fixed the issue in King of Tokyo with the numbers on the dice - it was too often in someone's best interest in KoT to just accumulate VP with dice, rather than attacking other monsters or building up energy. 

King of New York removes that, and makes attacking buildings or fighting the military a part of the game. It fits better thematically.

It's probably better than Tokyo because the dice "keep vs re-roll" decisions are a touch harder to make. The game adds buildings to the board, and replaces star rolls with stomp rolls to stomp buildings for points, and chomp rolls to damage other people by the number of stomped buildings in their area. That's basically it. Other than that, it's much the same game, same experience. It's not different enough to own copies of each, nor to give a different rating for each. It's still a fun dice game loaded with great theme though.

Fun! Takes King of Tokyo, adds boroughs to the board, adds in buildings and units to attack, and has the units potentially hit back. Neato! Not the greatest 2-player, but still fun. We've been playing with Turtleback's variant.

I really treat this one as an expansion, rather than a stand alone game. I find it more interesting than Tokyo, but I always use Tokyo as an Introduction, so for me there is no New York without Tokyo.

Buildings devastation and human army raids are extremely thematical and the map is beautiful. Some monsters are really cheesy though.

I keep Tokyo, both Power Up expansions, Halloween and New York in a very satisfactory Tokyo box. I use no insert and some well chosen deck boxes to keep cards, dice, tiles and cubes.

I have mixed feelings on this.  If I'm playing this with a group of gamers, I'd rather do this than King of Tokyo, since destroying buildings and having to deal with the military is something that a true Kaiju monster would have to deal with.  It makes it so much more thematic.

However, if I'm dealing with people who want a more streamlined playing experience, then I'll go to King of Tokyo instead.  My personal preference is King of New York, but that's mainly because of the crowd that I hang with.

I'm not really favorably inclined toward Yahtzee-style games, but this one takes the basic system introduced in King of Tokyo and throws in a bunch of bells and whistles in an attempt to make it a little more strategic.  You do have more options here, so instead of just punching whoever is standing in the middle, you can also decide to destroy buildings or fight off military units.  There are also multiple spots you can stand outside of the center (Manhattan), which are differentiated by the various buildings and military units present.  I liked that there were more choices in that respect.  What I didn't like was that if no one was in Manhattan, you were forced to go there.  This was often a bad idea--I wish I had the choice.

I was originally going to buy King of Tokyo as I've played that multiple times with friends. The store I was at, suggested I buy this one as it was a little more fun in comparison, which I have to agree with. King of Tokyo is nice, but needs the expansion to make it more of an enjoyable gaming experience. My husband and I both were pleasantly surprised how much we enjoyed playing this game. It is now one of the games we'll bring when visiting friends. It's quick, easy enough to get into, and you can play with a larger group. 
I just think the t-rex character name could have been better, and would have liked a bigger board as with all 6 players it gets a little crowded, but overall great game. one of our top 5 most enjoyed ones currently.

King of New York is a great compliment to King of Tokyo that adds more depth to the original game without losing its simplicity. If you liked King of Tokyo but were hesitant to pick this up, do not be - get it.

Pros:
* Great theme and quality components.
* Easier to utilize more of your dice rolls by eliminating KoT's 1-2-3 point scoring system.
* Adds more tactics and strategy since now you have more to do when not in Tokyo (Manhattan).

Cons:
* I should have bought this sooner.
* The Superstar card could have just been replaced with rolling 3 stars = 1 point + 1 point per additional stars rolled.

It is impossible not to compare this to King of Tokyo. Of the two games, KoT has greater variety with the play of the cards. KoNY centers more on the buildings, which is not bad, but there is less variety. My experience has been that the cards (with the exception of the two special cards) are far less significant in KoNY. 

I suppose it is a matter of taste; KoT is certainly more chaotic but (in my view) more fun. I enjoy KoNY and would probably like it even more if KoT did not exist.

Mechanics: light press your luck dice (Yahtzee). Lots of dice rolling. Best w/3-4 players (not 2)
A bit more complex and a bit more thematic than KoT, but also diversity of ways to score points (not as focused on fighting) and die outcomes are more fun/solves some of the dead spots/more decision points.

A worthy sequel to King of Tokyo. Essentially the game is the same as KOT, except here, the people not in Manhattan actually stand in their own provinces. The dice have new sides, which allow you to destroy buildings in the provinces for points. Then the buildings flip over and become army men, who on a different die result can attack you. Manhattan (which is essentially like tokyo), also has a nice new thing to it, the longer you stay the better your reward is at the start of your turn, which adds a nice new tension to the game. I will say that if you feel burnt out of King of Tokyo, this game probably isn't different enough to get you excited again. I appreciate the new features here.

A slightly heavier and more "gamery" game than King of Tokyo, but still a pretty simple push-your-luck dice game at heart. Unfortunately, that puts it in an awkward middle ground on game weight. The additional rules make a it a bit more interesting than Tokyo, but also make it a much less suitable game for playing with non-gamers. If I'm going to be playing with gamers, this is still a bit too light.

If I end up playing King of Tokyo a lot with some group (say, my kids) and they start to get bored of it, this would be a perfect step up in complexity.

RATING: 9.5
9.5 - I've only had a chance to play the game with two players so far but I have to say that this version is a drastic improvement over King of Tokyo.  The mandate to move into Manhattan if it's available forces people to go on the attack, the buildings give you more to do than just grabbing points, and the military units add a nice push your luck element as you gobble up buildings and hope you don't get shot.  

*****
After playing with more players I rather enjoy the back and forth but the Manhattan movement track is a little off putting to some non-gamers I've tried this with.  King of Tokyo definitely works as a good first step before King of New York.

Although quite the upgrade on King of Tokyo we (my family and me) thought of it as a bit to much. It actually kills the ease and leisure of its predecessor. You have to really think on your moves because there's more thanone way to get killed now (military tokens appearing after destroying buildings). And, since the superstars actually allow for a win by fame points, you have to balance your options quite a bit to stay alive and do well enough.
On the plus side, you can heal in Manhattan (formerly Tokyo).

* The new decisions can slow down a game that's at it's best when played quickly.
* The longer playing time makes it that much more painful to be eliminated early.
* In KoT it was fine that the player pieces were huge because there was nothing you needed to see on the board. In KoNY, the player pieces obscure important building/unit information. I think we might pick up some smaller monsters from a toy store.
* Way too many game changing promos that are hard to acquire. In as much as the power cards are the heart of the strategy, it's disappointing that IELLO has chosen to keep so many people from being able to enjoy the full game experience. As with other games with this issue, I will be docking the game 1 point for "component issues"

Neutral
* King of Tokyo was pointless with 2 players. I'm still not sure if King of New York would be a good 2 player game.

Variant Thoughts:
* Curious if the game would still work if you played it Nexus Ops style. That is, the game is over when the first player gets eliminated and then it's most VP for the win.

= 2015-06-06

Had an opportunity to play this with 5 players on Friday and couldn't pass it up. I really like this game, but it's at its best with a full table.

While there are certainly more decisions to make in KoNY (vs. KoT), the decisions are still mostly "what do I want to _attempt_ to be able to do?" and then the fickle dice determine whether you're going to have a kick ass turn or a dud. I quite like the ability to destroy buildings and units to earn things and using that to heal while in [-]Tokyo[/-] Manhattan is neat, but all of the additional decision making kind of slows down a game that really only works when it's played quickly.

A nice addition following King of Tokyo, but other than the multiple Boroughs and the addition of human armies, not a lot changed.  Which is neither good nor bad.  It is still enjoyable to play with any age, although the slight bump in complexity may be overwhelming for youngsters who never played KoT.

Solid game and enjoy playing it. I like the orininal (King of Tokyo) more.

This game increases the complexity of the game for really no reason. What's great about King of Tokyo is that the game is simple and recognizes that it's a dice game.

King of New York adds a lot more to the game in an attempt to add more strategy (I think), but there's no strategy actually added. It's still a fun dice game.

This is why it got a lower rating than the original for me.

Adds a nice twist to the original... which spices up the strategy and inevitably provides even more ways to die! Of course there will have to be the inevitable NY power-up expansion! It is a little more involved...not much...but sometimes enough to put some people off. KoT first. Then KoNY.

I feel like this game really cleans up a lot of the issues that were in King of Tokyo.  In King of Tokyo, the strategy was pretty straight forward: stay out of Tokyo and roll for points.  This still allows you to roll for points, but they come a lot slower meaning that you have to make more decisions.

Way way better than King of Tokyo. It has a bit more options than Tokyo, even without evolution cards. Love that they got rid of the straight victory point numbers on the dice and implemented a military enemy instead. It's fun to pass around/steal the superstar and Statue of Liberty cards. I see no reason to ever return to Tokyo after playing this, but I might keep both just to have more variety in monsters and to see if the evolution cards are still useful.

Have played a half-dozen times with 3 and 4 players - usually my wife & son.  Fun game that moves along, though I wish it were maybe a bit simpler (maybe try King of Tokyo?).

The necessity of moving into Manhattan on your turn if it's empty and how attacking either into or out of it is sometimes a hurdle for the first few turns of a new player.

Still, the artwork is great.  The dice are hefty and the rules are relatively straightforward.  There are a couple corner cases regarding power cards that grant movement and the Manhattan rules, but they can be looked up.  It's a bummer that they DO need to be looked up, though.

Will continue to suggest this for a lightish and quick game.

I only played this for the first time in April 2015, even though my wife got this game for Christmas and another in our main gaming group has had it since I think a little before that...

I have since played a second game, in October, and my opinion hasn't really changed. I don't really see much reason to own this game when you also have King of Tokyo (as we do). It's not that it's not different enough - it's actually a lot more different than I had expected - more that I didn't find the extra elements added enough that I enjoyed, while taking away a lot of the feel of the original. (It now feels much more like a VP race, with quite a lot of random damage caused to people, with relatively little of the direct attacking of the original.) I still found it relatively enjoyable though, and can see the game growing on me perhaps, so I still give it a "good" rating of 7. But I'm not convinced that there's room for both KoT and KoNY in a collection.

Refined, stronger game overall than KOT. Slightly more complex, but still very much a gateway game. The monsters in the original game are more interesting, but completely compatible to be used in this version.

RATING: 8.5
King of Tokyo was fun, but I never felt like there was a lot to it. It was hard to justify staying in Tokyo in a larger game, and often I'd find myself just rolling for points.

There's quite a few new ways to try and win in KoNY, whether you're jumping between burgs smashing buildings, trying to take down other players, rolling for stars, or dominating Manhattan, which gets progressively better bonuses each round you stay in.

Overall, KoNY is just a better built game, with plenty of room for expansions, powers, and improvements.

My feelings are confirmed. I don't like KoNY because:
1) You don't want to eliminate a friend playing with you;
2) If you get low on life, you are stuck trying to roll for hearts for ever. So the manhattan monster has more chance to stay there. If you happen to roll a claw and you group is agressive, they can make you enter manhattan, and then you are dead.
3) If someone takes the lead by a strong power, forget it. You cannot force then to leave manhattan and keep a high health at the same time. The best rolls on the first or second turns will probably define the winners...

I don't expect KoT will solve this issue. Trading this one.

08-12-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Improved King of Tokyo. You still roll 5 dice and attack the monster that is in Manhattan if you are outside manhatten. In KoNY, areas outside Manhattan have special abilities though and both Manhattan and the other boroughs have military/building tiles that you can kill to obtain health, energy or VPs.

Also KONY makes it more difficult to win in points because just one player can use the tactic at the same time, as it is unlocked by a card that has to be earned and can be taken away quite easily.

Fun game, certainly beats vanilla KoT for me. The evolutions I really liked in KoT, hopefully KONY will get something similar.

RATING: 9
Having played two games; these are my initial impressions, mostly as a comparison with King of Tokyo.

First of all it can be slightly more complicated to explain to new people, but all is understood after the first few people take their turn.

There is a lot more to do. There are loads of ways to earn victory points; destroy buildings/units, superstar card, staying in Manhattan or by buying cards. All the different ways are also that, very different, and all have a separate counter tactics to them.

I see a lot of hate or 'meh' feelings of the super star card but I quite like it. You have to roll 3 stars to get it before you start earning points from your stars, and there is nothing stopping someone else just taking it away from you by the same method. This makes it vital for the superstar card to keep changing hands in order to not be effective, which makes someone "waste" their turn countering rather than playing their own game.

The building destroying is my favourite part and has quite a bit subtlety to it. As the units that the produced through the act of destroying a building is always harder to get rid of than the original building, they units seem to hang about for quite some time, making some zones less attractive to visit.

This also means that by the mid-later part of the game there are no completely safe zones, which means that you can never be quite sure how much damage you will be receiving in one round. This heavily effects peoples decision to stay or leave Manhattan as well, as leaving Manhattan means that you will quite possibly end up in a zone with 2-3 military units.

I also feel like this is a faster game compared to Tokyo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only recommended if you already know how to play King of Tokyo.  I think this game is a bit better balanced; when I played with 5, only one person was eliminated. Garfield was wise to replace the numbers on the dice with more exciting things and I like the way the board is dynamic and interactive, however it is not big enough and gets cluttered up far too easily.

RATING: 8.25
Better than King of Tokyo which is already a fantastic game and was one of my favorites.  This game has the rare distinction of killing my interest in another game as I can usually see enough differences to treat them separately in my mind.  But the added strategy of the city board and reward chits is simply a fantastic idea.  It brings in some actual strategy.  And I love that they removed the strategy of sitting outside of Tokyo and just trying to roll numbers for points.  That always seemed counter to the actual fun of the game which is punching your opponents in the face!

Unless someone just doesn't want to play New York, I can't see reaching for Tokyo any longer.  Well, I'm still going to use the monsters of course!

Not the same as "King of Tokyo" despite the similarities. This is a great game that is very strategic and constantly changing. A few of the rules are unclear so you'll just need to create "house rules" around those issues as you come across them. Good balance of strategy and chance. I've played this a dozen or so times and I have never seen anyone win by victory points which makes it quick action and almost plays like an arcade game. This is probably my favorite game right now and because it can be quick you can usually get a few games in.

I'm always afraid this one will be a bit too complicated for new players (and find myself wishing a bit for KoT instead), but then when I teach it they "get it" immediately and it goes over really well! I'm always pleasantly surprised.

I do think the cards could be a bit better though. I don't think the cards that give you special powers for being in a specific burough or being able to kill a specific vehicle more easily are really that fun, but there are quite a lot of them.

En mi opinión, el juego acaba a medio camino entre dos tierras. Tiene demasiados elementos para ser un juego rápido y sencillo (como si es King of Tokyo) y demasiadas pocas como para ocupar su lugar como un juego complejo y largo. Así que, para mi gusto, acaba en un punto intermedio que no satisface ninguno de los dos roles, pero puede servir para aquellos que estén entrando en el mundo de los juegos de tablero para ir profundizando con mecánicas algo más elaboradas, especialmente si ya han jugado a King of Tokyo.

King comes to America. And gets fat. That's pretty much it.

More stuff means that the play is not so straightforward and also the groupthink and interaction isn't as central - it still is, just less so. Apart from fighting other monsters you can also fight the game and the game can hit back. Just what eurolovers ordered. 

What I liked it the atmosphere - the map and buildings/units evoke the vibe of an american style comic, so it has that going for it. A bit more narrative, whereas KoT has none. Yet the cards seem bear much burden of getting point,s which also means they're not as interesting (at least from initial impression). 

But I don't like the character stand-ins. They worked well in KoT, but here they don't gel with the map - it gets overcrowded and hard to read soon, also the map has a different type of art which is now more prominent. This game would actually need minis. 

Verdict: happy to stick with lean and in your face original.

Rating down to 1.0 because: why does this exist?

Jól kitalálta a KoNY-ot Garfield, ugyanis elég lényegesen különbözik a Tokyótól, ezért egy fanatikus biztosan beszerzi ezt a kiadást is. Egy kedvelő viszont nehéz helyzetben lehet, mert én úgy érzem egyik játék sem jobb a másiknál és így ha nem lenne meg egyik sem nem tudom melyiket választanám. A NY esetén eltűntek a számok a kockákról, helyüket rombolás, halálfej és a csillag vette át. A térkép megnőtt, most már több helye van szörnyeinknek, akik nemcsak egymást ölik, hanem az adott terület épületeit és katonaságát is. Ezek adják a pontokat a kockán levők helyett. Az épületek lerombolása után a tokeneket megfordítva katonaság jön ki ránk, ami halálfej dobás esetén megtámad minket. Nagyon tematikus, jól kitalált. A csillagok dobásával szupersztár válhat belőlünk, ami után a csillagok győzelmi pontot hoznak, talán ez a legkevésbé ötletes dolog. A központi helyen Manhattenben már több lépcsős az előmenetelünk. Nem fixen 2 győzelmi pontot kapunk, ha körünket ott kezdjük, hanem 3 különböző bónuszt attól függően milyen régóta vagyunk bent. Abszolút jó játék a NY is, nem jobb, nem rosszabb elsőre mint a Tokyo így ugyanannyi pontot adok rá. Tetszett.

Think King of Tokyo is better for the niche this game would fill for me. This adds more options and perhaps more balance between those options. But:

* The cards are more boring

* Even though there are theoretically mor ways to hurt your opponents, it feels much less "smashy"

* Buildings and positional choices lead to players focusing more on the board than their opponents

King of Tokyo is simply more direct. King of New York attempts to translate the fun into a "real game", but the more complex parts aren't really that interesting to me. I'd rather just have one way to smash and one way to score points with some item cards thrown in.

Also: Monster names in this one are really stupid.

I am not enamoured with the King of ... gameplay. I'd rather play cosmic which can play in the same amount of time.

King of Tokyo with extra stuff. Its not bad but in a game with giant monsters I rather see them fight and not focus on gathering points which seems to be where most of this game is. Plus at this level of complexity I rather play something else since its not as silly fun. Kept King of Tokyo and sold this one off.

RATING: 8
A bit of an upgrade from regular King of Tokyo but a bit of a downgrade in case you have King of Tokyo with expansions. As KOT is one of my favourite games and easily rated as 9, KON can is also easy to rate as 8 (which could go up, if similar expansions ever appear, that improvied KOT).

This game has even more variation than King of Tokyo!  Replacing the 1/2/3 rolls with the alternative symbols probably alienates new players, but it also increases the complexity of the game.

No man's land.

A few things about this game:
- This is not gamer's King of Tokyo.
- This game is even less about fighting each other than KoT.

Very disappointed, it just does not deliver. Both gamers & non-gamers prefer King of Tokyo, even more so when you play with Power Up.

We enjoyed our first play, but I can't say we were wanting to rush out and get a copy.  It's a good, solid game, but Tokyo gets played rarely enough that when we do play it, we get the KoT experience.  If you've played a ton of KoT, perhaps NY would help.

Not sure if this is better, worse, or just "different" from King of Tokyo.  It adds more fiddlyness via more setup, more phases, and more rules.  I'm not sold that it's that much deeper or more strategic than King of Tokyo, or at least that the complexity : depth ratio is worth it.  
 
It does seem to play faster, based on my limited experience with it.

This game adds a lot of new mechanics to the King of Tokyo system which, in my opinion, make it a lot better.  Without the "Power Up" expansions, I will not play King of Tokyo.  But even without such expansions, I like King of New York.  Without a doubt in my mind, when such an expansion comes out, I am certain that this game will easily surpass King of Tokyo in my books.

This game isn't terribly deep, but it's light hearted, turns tend to go quickly, and is a fun one to play with the family. My one and only complaint is I hate player elimination in pretty much any game, especially when they can run a little bit longer, like this sometimes can.

Yahtzee on steroids which overall boils don to a push your luck game. We really disliked the fact that when you roll an attack symbol you are forced to use it against a pre-determined monster (i.e., who is currently in Manhattan) and that you cannot decide whom to attack. The cards you can purchase are neat, but again, one can get really lucky or unlucky with them. Destroying the city can be also fun, but do not expect any strategy in there. If you like rolling dice like crazy where your decisions are limited to which dice to keep and which to re-roll then here is your game. We would usually rather play something meatier where we have at least some control over what you want to do.

P.s.: The artwork of the cards and monsters are cute though. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Just as great as its predecessor, King of Tokyo!
King of New York provides a new place to conquer and different monsters to take on. It has the same concept but introduces another layer of complexity and difficulty (to be more precise... more mayhem). You can now destroy buildings and units, but risk the chance of getting hit by the units themselves. Power cards really changes the game, so buy what you can and make use of it.
Future expansions will really make this game shine just like King of Tokyo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really well-made game, and more interesting that KoT.  I generally don't like dice games, but it works in this game and I enjoyed playing it.  Unfortunately, the player elimination means that it won't be on my shelf.  It's too easy for one player to get kicked out of the game while the rest keep on playing for another hour.  If you're okay with player elimination, then I recommend this game.

07-Jan-14: Bought this last Friday, and have played it about 5 times with different groups and people. Great re-implementation of King of Tokyo, and addresses my beef with KoT, which was those booorriing 1,2,3 die sides. In KoNY, those sides have been replaced with [star], [skull], [destroy], which are much, much better implemented. Plus, the board is actually used to keep more than just "Are you in Tokyo?" state. There are buildings and army units to destroy, and the new card effects are superb. Two thumbs up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great game (I mean com'mon King of Tokyo is my #1 all time for 5 years running) BUT I definitely like King of Tokyo better.  I will admit King of New York fits the theme far better, you really do feel like a giant monster smashing around the streets, with options to move to areas of town with lots of tanks or buildings/power plants and smash them to become more powerful!  

But all this being said, my love for King of Tokyo was that it was a light game focused on fun die rolling and monster smashing.  PVP invokes far more laughter and fun, and this game instead has you often times focus on mindless cardboard pieces to gain power.  I certainly don't hate the game but it takes some of that direct-agro out of the game that I love.

I'm not a fan of King of Tokyo. Besides it being horribly overrated, I also just don't think it's very fun.

King of New York fixes a lot of KoT's problems and is a much, much better game overall.
The 1, 2, and 3 on the KoT dice were mostly useless, so half of the time you were just frustrated because you rolled three times and ended up with absolutely nothing. The dice in King of New York are more useful so you rarely feel like you completely wasted your turn. The addition of the skull side also adds a real push-your-luck element to the game and you have to think before you reroll, where the decisions in KoT were all very obvious.
Entering Manhattan is also more interesting than entering Tokyo because you now get both energy and points, instead of just points. You also have more incentive to stay in Manhattan because the rewards get slightly better as you stay in longer.
The cards are overall more interesting too. Instead of just "get x points" or "get x energy" or "do x damage," a lot of the cards now have multiple effects and sometimes even negative effects to the buyer, so the card choice is a little more interesting.
One of my main issues with KoT, though, seems like it can still be present in some games of New York. The game can drag on and on once it gets down to just two or three players. I haven't seen this happen as often as it happens in KoT, but it can still happen if both players keep rolling health or if the player in Manhattan doesn't roll enough paws to deal out big damage.

Overall, though, this seems like a keeper whereas I got rid of KoT after just a few plays.

RATING: 7.25
King of Tokyo has become a game I don't particularly care to play unless we've got a non-gamer in the group. It can be a fantastic gateway game, particularly with younger kids.

King of New York complicates an otherwise straightforward formula, trying to make this a "gamer's game". I'll go elsewhere for that.

First Impression:

King of Tokyo v2.0. The American army is included, and as always kicks hard.

Scoring through dice has been reduced from Tokyo and insted there is now the option to raze buildings (which brings in the paindealing army) and creates some interesting situations on the board. The board itself is also much more spacious, and positioning now plays a greater role. The new Tokyo, Manhattan, is also a multistep goal, meaning that the more a monster stays in the grinder the more it is rewarded.

Despite these changes for the better the game remains at heart a simple smash them bash them game, which is great as a testosterone filler, but little more. The King of Tokyo with its expansions is arguably still a more complete game.

Overall I enjoy this game. It's simple to play, fun to roleplay, and a blast with the right group. Still, disliking any extreme fantasy setting, it's not really my cup of tea.

See KoT review.

A good game, but I prefer Tokyo variant. I don't really think the extra complexity does much to satisfy hardcore gamers like myself, and the increased complexity isn't really an advantage with newer players or more inexperienced board gamers, who I would generally want this play this game with.

The game is good and the new features are cool, but I'd recommend the original unless your entire Group is mostly hardcore gamers who wants to blow off some steam.

I really don't think that it is a huge improvement over KOT. I think I prefer King of Tokyo for the ease of introducing it to new players. I would definitely play again, but already owning KOT, not too interested in another version.

"King of Tokyo: More ways to die"
Should be the motto of this game.

This is a good thing.

King of New York is one of the more fast paced dice games that can play in 10-15 minutes but feels like you accomplished a ton in that amount of time.

The problem is... (which isn't a problem) you DIE ALOT. 

This actually speeds up the game even more but also opens up a ton of options for ideas to get ahead. For those that are experienced with the game may take more time to think about what rolls they would like. 

The best part of the game is that YOU KNOW eventually someone will die and/or get 20 points. This makes the game extremely appealing to everyone. 

I'm giving this game a "10" since its extremely fun for every type of gamer and everyone always wants to play it now!

RATING: 5
King of New York replaces King of Tokyo. It's just a better game all around. It does away with the silly 1's, 2's and 3's, and adds a destroy building aspect as well as a way to trigger attacks by the city folk, both of which give it a slight feel of the old video game Rampage (but not the boring board game).

That being said, it wasn't really a benchmark to be better than King of Tokyo, and it's better only in the sense that if you were going to buy KoT you should buy this instead. If you were going to buy any other game, then skip KoNY.

I have a copy of KoT because my son likes it, and while KoNY is a better game, it's not better enough to justify replacing KoT. But if could figure out a way to trade KoT and pay another five bucks to get KoNY I'd probably do it.

RATING: 6
[floatright][ImageID=2407103][/floatright][thing=160499][/thing] has a lot of similarities with [thing=70323][/thing]: claws to attack, hearts to regain life, game ends with 20 fame or with only one monster standing, lighting bolt for energy, buying cards with energy, an unique space for monsters to be in in where it attacks everyone out of this place and gets attacked by all the monsters out (namely, Manhattan, the equivalent of Tokyo, with some minor changes, as there is now a progression in what the monster in Mahnattan gains by staying a full round there).

But there are also several differences: now all the monsters stay in the board, in the neighborhoods of NY, beign able to walk among them; there are new faces in the dice: [b]destruction[/b], which serve to crush buildings of the city or army units; [b]star[/b], which, by itself, isn't worth a thing, but if you get three or more (just like points worked in KoT) you take the Superstar card, gain 1 fame because of this, and then, if you have the card, every star you roll in the next turns, will be worth 1 fame point of each (you don't have to roll 3+ starts for this, one or two also score) - but someone else can take the Superstar card by rolling 3+ starts; the [b]skull[/b], which activates the army units - if you roll just one skull, all the army units in the neighborhood your monster is will attack, causing 1 point of damage each; if you roll two skulls, the army units will attack every monster in the neighborhood, not just yours; if you roll three or more skulls, all the army units on the board attack in every neighborhood, which is as fun as it sounds.

The biggest difference between KoNY and KoT is the destruction of the city buidlings: each neighborhood has stacks of building tokens that have numbers from 1 to 3 (the number is equal to the amount of destruction die you must use to destroy it), and also a symbol that says what the monster will get by destroying it (usually one of three things: fame, life or energy). Once the building is destroyed, the token is flipped and now it will work as an army unit. The army units have numer ranging from 2 to 4 (if I remember right), and this number is also equal to the amount of destruction die the monster must use to destroy it; likewise, the army units, once crushed, give things to the monster (fame, life or energy). Now, when the army units activate, they do 1 point of damage each. At the start of the game this is a non-issue, as the monsters simply go to an area without army units, but from the middle to the end, there are plenty to deal with, and the units can be used to cause some serious wounds, and considering that the monsters still beat each others, its is hard to have a break to do some soul search and ponder about the meaning of the microcosmos of monsters destroying a city and the harshness of the universe.

[thing=160499][/thing] also endes when a monster reaches 20 fame points or if only one monster is still standing. It seemed to us that gaining fame is somewhat faster than in KoT, but damage also comes quicker. Our plays lasted a little longer than the average of those of [thing=70323][/thing], but the difference of time is less than I thought it would be. Maybe we got lucky, because in none of our plays there was a moment of "slowness", as sometimes happen in KoT, specially when there are only two monsters in the contest - the presence of the army units helped a lot to mantain the tension and the game going forward.

So, is [thing=160499][/thing] an evolution of [thing=70323][/thing]? In terms of complexity, yes. Not that [thing=160499][/thing] is really a complex game, but it does have more rules and offers more possibilities in each turn. Therefore, I suppose  [thing=160499][/thing] has more meat for those players with greater baggage in games, being accepted more easily and beign treated with less contempt.

I ended up liking the game more than I expected, as I read some comments that while [thing=160499][/thing] added playing time and options, it lacked adding more [b]fun[/b]. Well, it is hard to measure fun, however I did think both stayed at the same level, with [thing=160499][/thing] showing itself somewhat more interesting, and will probably last more in the tables of my gaming group. Though, I say that KoNY won't probably work as well for kids or even persons that are up for games with as little rules as possible and just want to chuck some dice, as [thing=70323][/thing] did.

The components are of the same quality as those in KoT: chunky dice, cardboard standees for the monsters and the life/fame trackers, green cubes for energy. There is the addition of building/army tokens and the board is, now, an actual board. This additions made the price tag go from US$ 39.99 MSRP (for KoT) to US$ 49.99 (for KoNY).

Finally, such as [thing=70323][/thing] when released, [thing=160499][/thing] also lacks real differentiation between the monsters. This will surely be fixed in an expansion to come. Even still, [thing=160499][/thing] was soundly approved.

Rating as a two layer game:

I really like the game, but it suffers from the same problem as it's sibling. It's too easy to camp out in Manhattan (in this case). One player often doesn't have the firepower to force their opponent out. Luckily the fix is simple. It's the same one we employ in King of Tokyo. 

1) A player does not receive a victory point for entering Manhattan.

2) A player in Manhattan receives one victory point less in each section of Manhattan. So, instead of gaining one victory point and one energy in the first section of Manhattan, the player would only receive one energy. In the next section the player would receive one victory point and one energy instead of two victory points and one energy... And so on.

We have had many a good battle in King of Tokyo using this method and it works just as well in King of New York.

I like the addition of buildings in King of New York.  They add another layer to the decision tree.

[i]"Average. No significant appeal, take it or leave it."[/i]

I don't really understand the point of this, KoT's greatest strength is that it's only slightly more complex than a traditional dice game. Adding a little more depth at the cost of extra complexity doesn't do much for it.

RATING: 7
A bit more aggressive than KoT, if only because it's harder to just pursue stars as a route to victory. The army entering in as destruction increases is a nice touch. Most of my plays have been with kids 10 and under, so I'd like to get a few plays with an older crowd and see how the game unfolds.

A more complicated version of King of Tokyo.  One of my favorite aspects of KoT was the basic, easy, and simple rules.  I could teach the game in 5-10 minutes, and it didn't overwhelm newer players.  KoNY on the other hand has enough moving pieces that it can be confusing and overwhelming.  I have played it now many times, and enjoyed it every time.  Loving more complex games, I am the type of person that this game is targeted to.  However, if I have a group that would be willing to play this game, I find that I would rather play something else.  Again, this is not a bad game, it is just not a game that makes it to the table much.

I like dice, but this falls a bit flat for me. The extra complexity compared to KoT doesn't add much in my appreciation of the game, and makes it just hard enough to set up and explain that I won't pull it out after we've had one too many drinks, which is the time slot I'd think this would work best. I've replaced this with Bang! the dice game so far.

[gameid=70323] did not need a sequel.  And this sequel just makes things a little loopier and a little more complicated.  It retains the theme, KoT's biggest selling point, but gets away from the simplicity that is the other selling point.  Worse, the complexity doesn't add any real strategy -- you're still hoping for the right results on the dice to let you win, it's just that there's more pointless mechanics in the way that slow the game down and make it more complicated.  I didn't love KoT, by any stretch, but I really would prefer to avoid this one.

This is the game we all wanted King of Tokyo to be. It is almost identical to its predecessor, but adds a few details like a simple map to stomp around on and big ole pile of buildings to stomp and army units to fight. That sounds like a lot of new stuff, but it really does use all of the existing King of Tokyo mechanics to handle them, so there is very little to relearn.

The only downside is that the game doesn't include any of the power up decks for the new monsters, so crossover games are problematic. It's a bummer, because I would throw out King of Tokyo wholesale for this new version, if it wasn't for those power up decks. They are what made King of Tokyo so much fun in the first place, taking it from a silly filler game to something really interesting.

Hopefully this new version does well enough to warrant a Power up expansion too.

I'm honestly not sure Power Up can save this for me. The amount of random damage is just frustrating. The board contains a lot of good ideas but the game feels more on-rails than KoT. I'll still get the expansion to retro-fit the monsters to KoT though.

Update: Combined monsters and other components into KoT box, but likely won't play KoNY unless pushed. Marking it as prev. owned since it isn't taking up space.

Randomness abounds but strategy pays and it's surprisingly fun for young people, i.e. it's a recent Richard Garfield game. The standard question is 'Should I go NYC or Tokyo?' King of Tokyo is a fast-playing lightweight game aimed at kids; King of New York is a featherweight game which increases the cognitive load and requires a touch more commitment; Tokyo stands out more easily from its weight class while NYC competes for table time with a host of brilliant games. Both play pretty quickly. NYC offers more complex choices. Neither calls for deep strategic thinking. They're both super fun, though Tokyo is *purer* fun in a way.

For a kid who's never played either King game, Tokyo is a perfect birthday gift; for a family that's taken Carcassonne or Sushi Go around the block, NYC is the gamier game, so to speak. Both are tremendously enjoyable.

We borrowed Tokyo -- then bought NYC.

Take everything I said about King of Tokyo and let's add just a touch more:

Honestly, both games are really similar. So similar that I think either game would work flawlessly for first-timers. But why I fancy King of New York just a hair more than it's older brother is the extra little touches.

I like that you've got actual buildings to smash now. And the more you smash buildings, the more the army mobilizes. But that's okay, because you can smash the army too! I also generally prefer the new victory point system. It's not only a touch easier to explain than the original but it's also more contentious.

All-in-all, KoNY takes an already great game and just gives it more flair, more fun and more smashing!

I'm a fan of King of Tokyo, it's not a main event and it doesn't come out a ton, but it's a fun game. This is very similar, but there's more emphasis on being in Manhattan as compared to Tokyo. The longer you stay in Manhattan the better the rewards. In addition, there is a slim chance you can earn yourself some health, but you'll add more military units to your borough which could really hurt you later. I really like how cards can be discounted based upon borough and that the cards available affect other players (I had the card that forced others to use all of their re-rolls). At this point, I'd definitely prefer this over King of Tokyo.

Played 8 games and all were 3 player. I prefer King of Tokyo. Game design is a strange thing, I thought the changes would improve gameplay but somehow it's lost KoT's magic. Not as much tension, not as much fun.

Part of the problem is the game is shorter, most of our wins were with VPs some of which you could see coming a few turns before, and even the other players combining their efforts couldn't stop.

Not played in ages but like it better now, game was a lot closer.

1. the game takes longer so the first few players eliminated have to wait around a while
2. there is less emphasis on gaining energy and so fewer power cards are purchased

Ok, I am weak to games with good themes. Here, you smash buildings, stomp tanks, grow mutations, plus there is a picture with a monster wearing a nunchaku made of two buses. Great casual fun!

Time-consuming with more than four players. A fun spin on the Yahtzee genre that takes full advantage of its theme.

I had fun chucking dice until I realized that stars don't really do anything.  Without stars being tied to cool card effects, they're a complete waste of time.

I'll stick to the original given the choice, but there's no harm in tearing through Manhattan once in a blue moon.

Some change is good, some is bad, and some is change for change's sake.  This is the latter, which is acceptable but not inspiring.

Like: Feels like a better game than KoT. Always have a good turn.

Dislike: Power Ups from KoT are not supported.

King of New York hundred percent complete lightly adult owned and used comes with King of New York power up cards that are still sealed also comes with extra Cthulhu standee and dial and power up cards for that character does not come with anything else it's just the character standee and power up cards that you see in the picture. Does not come with the cultist and it does not come with any King of Tokyo stuff only King of New York stuff.

It was fun.
For what it was.
And that was King of Tokyo with a few different things going on. Goofy with friends.

Fun to have played. No real desire to own.

RATING: 5.5
I bought this at launch after seeing all the love for King of Tokyo, and personally believing King of Tokyo as way too light of a game. Well, I found King of New York may have added too much. It takes me 20+ minutes to explain the rules and as far as dice chucking goes I have other games that are more fun.

RATING: N/A
While the additions were nice. The extended length made it so that I'd always rather put in the time to a "better" game of that length instead of play this. Kept KoT w/ powerup instead.

I like that the 1,2 and 3 on the dice were replaced (because those were a bit boring), but the setup is a bit more of a hassle. Don't know if the New York version is worth getting if you have the Tokyo version, but I like the concept.

Let's face it, it's a more layered King of Tokyo and while I had the urge to play King of Tokyo this year and still love it. New York just has more going on. My only gripe is that no one wants to take out the military once they've appeared on the board. Military is what kills us most of the time. That aside, if I had to choose between the two, I'd still pick this one simply because there is more game here.

2-6 players are big stompy monsters, rolling dice to see which actions they can take each turn. They attack eachother, invade New York, power up their monsters, and fight the military to be the last monster standing.

RATING: 7
Not as good as the original, but still a fun game. The added elements make for a lot more ways to play, but is a little overwhelming for new players. Always end up going back to King of Tokyo after playing one game of this.

I am a huge King of Tokyo fan, but this was equally fun. I have only played it once so far, so I don't know how it will hold up compared to its older sibling, but this was certainly a hoot to play.

I like it more than KoT because there are more choices for the players and it is a little bit more tactical (as far as a dice game can be tactical).

My first play of KONY left me wanting to play more. It's King of Tokyo on steroids, and I love the added strategy. It's probably best played with people who already know how to play its predecessor, so it won't replace King of Tokyo in my collection. They're for two different purposes.

Looks beautiful, love throwing them big dice, fun times. :)

My biggest complaint is the game seems to be over just as you've got some cool abilities. Everyone has a good time playing it, it's a very good game, but somehow I think it's missing that je ne sais quoi which would make it a "great" game.

RATING: 6.5
A little bit more involved than its older sibling, [thing=70323][/thing], which introduces a smidgen of confusion, but it's ultimately a little more fun, too. Again, full-contact, push-your-luck (even farther) fun, with upgrades, and even better risk/reward….

One play at Essen.
The game is easy enough to learn for Tokio players but the one player who's new to the franchise needed quite a bit of help even though he made the impression of a seasoned gamer. This will probably be a bit tougher to teach than Tokio (but may serve as a good transition to heavier games for Tokio players!) Note that I still wouldn't consider this a heavy game, of course. ;-)

The game is very similar to Tokio but I wouldn't consider a straight upgrade. Ths definitely needs more plays but I can imagine that both games could find a place in the same collection.

It is fun, but the player elimination sucks at higher player counts and it's really hard to get your opponent out of Manhattan when playing as a 2 player game. Thus, I only recommend it for 3 or 4 players.

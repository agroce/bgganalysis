RATING: 6
Fairly simple betting game, though it does have some interesting mechanics and vague elements of poker.  The theme is fun and the cards attractive.  You can do a little bit of bluffing and card holding, but have to watch that you don't get squeezed out of a tower early by others.  Not a bad filler if you have 30 mins or so.  I got mine on Ebay and I don't regret it.

Initial impressions were of clumsy, straitjacket mechanics locking together size of tower build with amount bet and card draw. Actually, that mechanism works really well in setting up many difficult choices.  A good gateway game.

RATING: 5
A nice light card/tile game in which you build towers.  The game play is pure filler and playing it with too much seriousness will leave you saying "huh? that's it?"  Game play needs to be quick and light with a bit of a race feel to it.  Have wondered if the theme were switched to skyscrapers and the tone set as a race to build the tallest first would shift the game play a bit.  The Renaissance theme is a bit over used to bring value to the game.

Trudna do nabycia gra, ale warta wysiłku włożonego w pozyskanie. Eleganckie i proste zasady, ciekawa mechanika i krótki czas gry czynią ją idealną grą w kategorii szybkich przerywników.

Standard "betting on the race" game but with lots of restrictions of where you can bet and what card you get to put in your hand. These restrictions inject some deliciously tough choices (you want to do 3 things, but can only do one... or two lesser things). Good stuff, but I still found myself wishing I was playing Members Only or Titan:The Arena.

One mechanism doesn't make the game. Or yet is does? Campanile is an example of such a game. It's not a bad thing - only when you get bored by this single idea or it wears off, there's no reason to play it anymore.

But until that day comes... :-) A solid filler.

As a 2-player game (that´s where I bought it for) this is great. While lost Cities didn´t do it for me, I like this one more, as you have more options and more to think about any yet, it´s a very easy and fast game like Lost Cities.

塔へのビッドと塔を伸ばす行為が正反対の動きになることが多く、また取れる場札の縛りがある旧版ルールではそこも考える必要があり、悩ましい。
とはいえ、クニツィアがやり尽くしているメカニクスであり、既視感はある。
旧版ルールの方が好み。

Very clever, subtle game. Players tend to always want to increase a building by 3 stages, but this reduces their betting possibilities. Biggest problem is telling the difference between building sizes, since the placement of the cards can be somewhat messy. Maybe too long for such a small game (45 min. to 1 hour).

I really like this build up and bet on towers card game. It goes by quickly, requires insightful play, and is pleasing to behold on the table (though at least one of the towers looks more than a wee bit phallic). Unfortunately, no one I've played with has been all that wowed by the game. [14 plays]

Tutto ciò che necessita un filler: spiegazioni veloci, facilità d'apprendimento, pochi tempi morti, un po' di strategia e un po' di casualità. L'idea di costruire le torri è molto simpatica (anche se 'l'impilazione' delle carte deve essere fatta con cura per facilitare i conti finali. Scala bene con il numero di giocatori. Promosso e si trova online a prezzi bassi.

A good filler card game. Add a card to build the towers. Place bets on which will be the highest at mid-game scoring & end game. Most victory point chips wins the game. Clever mechanic that dictates how much you can bid, & on which towers. makes it a bit more of a thinker than you expect.

RATING: 9.05
Este é um jogo muito simples mas com uma jogabilidade bem mais complicada do que inicialmente parece, pelo que pode demorar acima do previsto a adaptação dos jogadores. Na verdade é um jogo de apostas, no qual 2 a 5 jogadores procuram apostar nas torres que irão crescer mais no seu decorrer. Quem apostou mais nas torres certas coleciona mais pontos, pelo que o timing da aposta é muito importante, sendo que há um conjunto de regras a cumprir para se poder apostar, o que torna o jogo muito singular, algo até complexo, e de enorme emotividade. Recomendo a todos os amantes dos jogos de cartas.

Neat little bidding game with betting options/restrictions that'll keep your brain engaged. All the betting restrictions from chip limits to card selections and betting placement restrictions mesh really well to give you some difficult choices that are hard to value. As a bonus it plays well with two. The box is nice and compact, the pieces functional (although the pointed card edges will wear quickly), and the rules can be read through in a few minutes. It also plays in 10-15 minutes with experienced players. I expect this could be re-released with a modern skyscraper theme. Copies can be found for a few Euros on German eBay and I can recommend picking one up for yourself.

Trade from Frank E (NZ).

OK betting/drafting card game. Players choose to raise one of five towers between one to three levels. Based on levels raised, players are allowed to bet that amount as well as draw the corresponding face-up card on one of three piles.

When one pile runs out, the game ends towers are top four ranked by height. First and second-most bets score points according to score card.

Ok game but rules behind drafting are purposely limiting in a fashion that is unthematic and seems disjointed and inelegant.

Cute card game with simple choices unlike the others DDD games. I've only played a two player game and it seemed too short on strategy and a bit too much lucky driven especially the timing in which scoring cards appear.

Tower-building filler with some tricky decisions. Only played the 2009 reprint. Nice, compact, box. There's an added half-time scoring, and one of the constraints of the original has been softened a bit: when picking up a card, you now have a free choice from the 3 available rather than being obliged to take the card corresponding to how many floors you added. I'd like to try it the old way just to see which I prefer.

Prediction card game with a tower building theme. The aim is to place cards matching five different types of tower thereby making them taller. Once this is done, influence tokens are placed underneath one of the towers depending on how much you chose to raise the tower with the play of the card. Two scoring rounds take place, one in the middle of the game, one at the end, and points are rewarded to the players with the most influence under the taller towers. This is a quick and simple game to play but the is some tactical awareness required when selecting cards and knowing when best to place influence and where. It probably doesn't have enough variety to keep people occupied for long though.

This little gem packs a lot in a small box. The concept of tower-building through card/tile placement was ahead of its time, and this game actually holds up well today. Being an older, small-box game seems to be a deadly combination, though ... I don't see this played often. Too bad, because this one is definitely worth a try and worthy of a bit more attention.

RATING: 7.5
Плюсы:
- Игра очень легко объясняется.
- Весело играется.
- Кингмейкинг совсем небольшой и то, если кто-то чудит уж.
- После освоения длительность партии всего минут 20-25 (на коробке указано 30-45).
- Нет двусмысленных ситуаций для разруливания.
- Нет необходимости запоминать какие-то специальные правила, абилки карт, подглядывать в рулбук в процессе игры, уточняя нюансы.
- Годится как вводная игра для новичков и детей.
- Коробка небольшая.

Минусы:
- Требуется определенное пространство. Не сыграешь в самолете или поезде.
- Рандом не гипер, но заметно осложняет планирование.
- Карточки без скруглений углов. А "шафлить" их надо и в руки набирать.

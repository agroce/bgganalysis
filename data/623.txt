We used to play this one all the time, back in the freshman dorm.  The ship to ship combat wasn't much good, but the barroom brawl was fabulous.  Often I would spend half the game just maneuvering myself to swing on the chandelier or flip the table, just because it was so cool.  A bit complex for modern tastes, I suppose.

It's hard to know where to start with this. Did we have more patience in 1980? I dunno, I was just a young 'un. The rules are complicated but it looks worth playing. I dunno if I'll ever convince anyone to study it enough to get to the point where an actual game can be played.

Wonderful game with the right group - pirate sounds and all. Si-move so the outcome is wild and woolly.  Tactics play a part but so does luck.  When the right sequence of moves comes off it is worth every moment of plotting and planning.

Rather fun game where players play a swashbuckling character either on a ship or in a pub, and they go looking for trouble.  Plotted action system where you can do things from slash-with-sword to throw-ale, swing on chandeliers, etc.  Guilty fun.

RATING: 9
I rarely  have more fun with a game than I have with Swashbuckler. Constant player interaction, unintended hilarity, lots of cool things to do. Not that hard to teach as long as you avoid explaining minor stuff until it's need (like slipping on beer spills). Probably won't be well received by the ultra-competitive, but for a bunch of friends looking for a good time there's nothing better.

Not the most amazing looking game, but WOW is it fun. It may take a few plays to get the hang of things as this is a heavier game. It's well worth taking the time to learn this though. Beating on your friends in a bar is just....well fun. Throwing beer mugs at each other, slicing off their arms, kicking tables and chairs at each other, jumping from tables and swinging from chandeliers. Plus ALOT more. What more could you want? So if you ever wanted to just beat the hell outta your best friend then this is the game for you :).

RATING: 4
Playing this can be a good or bad experience depending on the group. It's fun to bean someone with a beer mug (drink the beer first), and do other swashy things. The swordplay doesn't seem very realistic and we've encountered a variety of rules questions in past playings. Unfortunately, I don't recall them but I do recall my annoyance. Don't play with miniatures unless their bases are the exact size of the squares so the right facing can be maintained.

Amazing fun, simple, light-hearted game.  I remember waving my hat, sometimes three and four times in a row.  I love getting weird looks.  It one of those rare games where no one cares who wins.

Even though this is an early personel preplotted movement game, I was more impressed with another combat mechanic.  Different actions take different amounts of time to resolve.  The vast majority of RPGs completely ignore this concept, which is handled fairly, simply here.

Hey its got Erol Flynn and Basil Rathbone on the cover.  You can stage full tavern brawls.  It comes with Musketiers and Pirates.  If it had the Cardinal's men so I could refight the 3 Musketiers it could be the perfect lite game.

Vintage programmed movement with tons of theme and drama.  Old-schoolish and perhaps a little fiddly, but also cinematic and always surprising.  Thrust your sword, just on a table, swing from a chandelier, and then literally pull the rug out from under your foe; it's all perfect chaos.

I got this as a gift when young. Played it once and watched it played, but don't know it well enough to review. I also have Adventurer. If time and patience allow, I want to try playing both without the written instructions--might try to work that out so it can be played like a wargame. A lot less pointless moving and twitching that way.

Played 2-player with my wife, and we had a pretty good time.  Pretty easy to teach (learning took some time), and we got started quickly.  Damn hard to hit with a sword, and automatic parrys a little unrealistic, and takes time to get used to the timescale (one step forward, rest, one step...) but entertaining in the end.  Won by literally stabbing her second charater in the back.

RATING: 9
Very fun and funny to play this game. Adding lots of detail is optional but I like the straightforward game because it has enough to keep everyone hopping to the fight. Players make secret moves 5 turns at a time and then you let it spin. Not hard to find yourself slashing one of your own players if you get shoved. Great fun. Never had a game where the players didn't shout out in laughter a few times.

Bar room brawls with swords!  Ah, the good ol&#039; days... Swashbuckler is a classic board game for sheer fun. The game comes with two 17th-century settings, which are played separately, not together: 

A Barroom. 

Two sailing ships grappled together. 

The barroom is a setting for Musketeers and/or pirates, while the ships are primarily for pirates, though you could have a pirate ship raiding a shipload of musketeers.

The barroom must first be set up with tables, chairs, shelves, mugs of beer, carpets and chandeliers. This is quite fun and will undoubtedly remind someone of their sister&#039;s dollhouse, but the other players are usually too macho to admit it. Once the tavern is set-up, roll for random placement of characters, and begin the game.

Each turn you write orders for your character(s). Orders are written simultaneously for six phases. So if you&#039;re planning a lunge into a given space on phase five, you&#039;d better hope somebody&#039;ll be there - and not a friend, either! 

The game has rules to cover usage of all the materials mentioned in the set-up: throwing mugs and slipping in the resultant mess, bashing chairs around, shoving and flipping tables, yanking carpets, swinging on chandeliers and toppling shelves. Of course there are also rules for throwing knives, using cutlasses and rapiers, kicking someone, shoving, etc. There are also rules for taking damage, being stunned, going prone, standing up, crawling, walking, running, running lunge, parrying - and waving your hat in someone&#039;s face to distract them.

Most items can stun you, and possibly damage you. If stunned, you replace the appropriate number of written steps with &quot;Rests&quot;, and rewrite the rest of your turn, if any. If hurt, check off the body part hit, for as many points as you lost. The advanced rules allow for different character strength, endurance, skill, etc, so you may be able to take more hits than your opponent, but possibly aren&#039;t as strong (don&#039;t do as much damage), or as skillful.

The board with the grappled ships uses none of the furniture, but does have cannons and treasure chests, and lots of rigging to swing on. Of course there are still hand weapons, too. Each side starts with a treasure chest in its hold - the object is to get the other chest, while retaining your own.  Take a stab at it?

This is a great bar room brawl game. Everything you ever wanted to do in an old Swashbuckler movie.....Swing from the chandelier, pull the rug out from under someone, tip over a rack of shelves on someone, throw a knife or a beer mug across the room........& a.....oh yeah---Wave hat!

[PnP] Programmed movement bar-room brawl game of sword-fighting, beer-throwing, chandelier-swinging, rug-pulling and table-flipping. I loost my own copy long ago so I finally broke down and made my own version. In my opinion the rules could use a bit of tinkering regarding the eligibility requirements to engage in certain actions, but it's definitely playable as is.

Dragon & Flagon (which I have not played) is the updated version of this.

RATING: 5
Preprogrammed moves ensure lots on unintended chaos (assuming there are enough figures on the board). This is very much in the spirit of the genre, though it can also be frustrating. Rules are showing their age (why am I rolling 3d6 for my Strength score, and then looking it up on tables all the time to find out what it really means in-game?)

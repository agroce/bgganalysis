A fun filler, and easy to carry.  I like it.

RATING: 7
For me, this is a 7 that barely squeaks by. Not because Flash Duel is a bad game but because there are a lot of much better two-player games out there. Tzaar or Battle-line, for example, play in a similar amount of time and have significantly greater depth and intensity. Summoner Wars takes more time but has the theme/factions element of FD. As for Flash Duel, its pretty good and it is fun to mix and match different oponents but most games leave me feeling underwhelmed - despite the cool theme, Flash Duel doesn't give me that feeling of risidual awesomeness that is characteristic of the other games mentioned in this mini-review.

RATING: 7.5
Wonderful game, fast fun and extremely diverse and deep, you can probably play for years with this one and still try something different, if you don't use the characters the base game is very dry and chess like. If you use characters variety is superb with special abilities and modifiers

Using chibi art avoids the sexist art of Yomi and gives a lot of personality to what was a very dull game in En Garde. The Fantasy Strike universe is cartoon-y; this game suits that style the best. 

Flash Duel perfectly combines spatial positioning, unique character powers and mindgames in a skill-driven contest than can last only five to ten minutes. The Knizian mechanical core combined with Sirlin's asymmetric flavour gives the game immense accessability and replayability. 

The game favours aggression, but not so much that if you overplay your hand or misjudge how your opponent will defend you won't see your comeuppance. If your opponent is up to it of course! As a 2v2 experience I think this game is excellent. The Dragon variant is also fun if you have experienced players. 

I'D RATHER PLAY: Yomi. Ultimately, if Yomi wasn't one of my favourite games ever, I would own this and play it a lot. I can't justify both in a 20-game collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
All the trappings of a game I enjoy. Deduction, luck, limited choices, variable powers, competitive banter, strategy, small weight, and high replay value. I personally believe it is a better fighting system than Yomi. My preference of play includes a stacked discard pile, so you rely on memory for card counting. Leads to more... BLUNDERS! followed by "Gosh darn, I'll get you next time!" moments.
Pro: I'm a big fan of 2 player games

Tons of fun. Very fast, with some great strategy. I know it is a shameless rip off of En Garde and I don't care. I love the fantasy strike universe David Sirlin put out, so I know I would not like the game near as much if I couldn't play Rook vs Grave. Now if only they would combine this game with Yomi...

Super-impressed with the volume of content provided in the box: 20 characters, multiple game types, etc.  I've only played the standard game, and only with a couple of different characters, but I found it fantastically quick and engaging.  At present, it doubles my (old) rating of En Garde.  Totally on Sirlin's side of the fair use argument, BTW.  Dominion has tons of clones too.  Dominion is still huge, because many people still consider it the best game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like that it plays quick.  I also enjoy the fact that it has the same characters that I have grown to like from Puzzle Strike and Puzzle Strike Shadows.

It is a decent filler, but I find that if I had my choice, I'd rather play something else.  The only redeeming thing is that it has a bunch of different play options and can play up to 5.

Score gets a boost because of it's relation to Puzzle Strike and Yomi.  I like it when games build off each other.

I love this game. I love the themed characters with their special abilities. I love the artwork. I love the gameplay mechanics. I love that it can be portable for two players. There just isn't anything I don't love about this game. There is a lot of strategy in landing that hit combined with a bit of luck when drawing the cards. And pulling off a great combo with a character's special ability is extremely rewarding. With the 7 gameplay variants in the rulebook and immense possibilities for house rules or variants, this game also has a high replay value. It's portable, quick, fun, easy to learn, and looks great.

Man. Whatta game. Simple, light, but with just enough depth to keep more serious gamers such as myself interest. Replay value through the roof. Production quality excellent. FAQs answer just about everything that could come up. Sirlin has clearly been very thorough with his work here. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.

RATING: 1
I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.
http://www.projectafterforums.com/index.php?showtopic=1363

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

His games entirely derivative anyway.

RATING: 4
The tension in this game is when to know when is time to strike, and when is it time to dance. This is based off of the count of cards already played. You only want to strike directly if you'll kill, otherwise you're better off simply dashing strike the other player over and over again into the corner and then backing up for the victory.

And that's the game's biggest problem. That is more exciting to write than it is to play out. It is essentially one tension point per round, but each round takes a few minutes to play out, and in the case of the dashing strike overload victory, it takes a minute or so to play out as well, meaning there is a rather large period of anti-climax to the game.

The individual character powers act to make it so that the tension point decision space changes from game to game, but it still remains a game with a very little of interest going on.

Usually, these types of games are not my style of play. Very luck dependent on the draw and completely tactical. 

However, the quickness of the game (it is incredible how quickly this game can be played) along with the cute characters strikes a chord with me. For now, I really enjoy bringing this out as a last minute closer to gaming sessions.

Flash Duel was one of my first designer board games, and I really enjoyed it. However, it wound up being too mechanical and luck-based to make it back to the table after I got new games. It's a little better with the updated rules, but it doesn't hold a candle to BattleCon.

Nice lightweight dueling/sparring game for 2 players.  Not sure if 25 is the best number of basic cards (1-5) to use.  It often makes the rounds go by too quickly.
I love the variety of special powers that are available though.  Not enough there to really get into the characters, which is a Pro, because i don't mind switching between them regularly.  This game turned out to exceed my expectations, because I'm really not too fond of the artwork.  Fun game.  This is a keeper until something replaces it.

I was amazed when I got on here and found that this game wasn't at least co-credited to Reiner Knizia.  It isn't inspired by En Garde, and it isn't based on the game, *it is En Garde*.  En Garde plus, anyway.  Yes, there is some flash put on top of the base game (pun intended), and yes that does make the game play differently.  But to me that's like putting a set of googly eyes on top of a copy of the Mona Lisa; sure it could be funny and technically different, but where is the credit for all the hard work and creativity of the original artist?  I hope he's getting a cut of the profits, as he is responsible for 80% of what makes Flash Duel a fun game.

Play numbered cards to advance, retreat, and attack opponents.  Combat is quick and deadly, with a single unblocked attach resulting in defeat.  Twenty different characters provide a good variety of special abilities to use, and there are multiple game modes ranging from a standard two-player duel to a cooperative assault on a dragon boss with a hidden traitor.

While I prefer the classic En Garde for the purely aesthetic reasons, Flash Duel brings in unique player powers which really liven up the game. My game group argues that some of them are overpowered, but I don't think you should take such a light game too seriously.

I am a devout fighting video-game player (namely Tekken) so this game is perfect as a non-video-game equivalent. Still have yet to try out the multiple modes and because the play time is so short and the range of characters so large, there's always something new.

RATING: 8
Great game that is fast and easy to play.  If you can count, you can play this game's simple mode over and over again, so it is even great to play with younger kids.  With over 20 different characters to choose from and seven game modes right out of the box, the game really never gets old.  I highly recommend it if you want to play a fast 2-player game, but can be expanded up to 5.

Loved it at first, but quickly got tired of card-counting. Maybe I just need to come back to it in a while.

[Update: The designer has posted a variant with less card-counting, saying that his intent was for the game to be played on intuition. Not raising the score until I actually try it, though.]

[Second update: I've gotten heavily into other Sirlin games but haven't quite had the courage-- or just the spare time?-- to come back to this one.]

RATING: 6
The concept works for what it is, a card based replica of a Street Fighter / Tekken type martial arts video game.  The special abilities of the characters keep the game fresher than not but ultimately it is a game of tug of war with numbered cards.  It plays extremely quickly so it makes for a good filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
En Garde got much of its decision-space and tension from very constrained movement rules, whereas Flash Duel opens things up and forces you to adapt to special powers. It's great while being very different from its forebearer. 
I haven't yet tried the multiplayer modes, but I very much wish to.

Pleasantly surprised. Having already played (and enjoyed) Knizia's En Garde, I honestly have to say that I didn't approach this game with the most open of minds (i.e., I don't highly approve of game designers cannibalizing the designs of others). However, despite the core of the game being all too familiar, the added touch that the playable characters added to the game were thoughtful. While I'm not sure if they would consist enough of an original contribution to make it count as a 'unique contribution' to the world of board games, what they do add does freshen up an already solid design. 

In my honest opinion, David Sirlin would probably get more 'cred' if he were a bit more transparent about the influence for his games (yes, games plural. not just this one) and attributed accordingly. Granted, the 'remix' is a skill that is worthwhile onto itself: Feld could be called the mechanism-mix-master of the last 10 years. However, most mixers that I know of still attribute the original work and recognize that their work is the way in which they were combined (and not the whole in its entirety).

A straightforward ripoff of En Garde which the 'designer' has tried to spice up with lots of special power cards. The result is a complete travesty of the original, balance being non-existent.

Dec17:

I do wish he'd given Knizia more blatant credit, because the underlying En Garde engine is just brilliant itself.

However...  all the character powers really do take the game over the top.  Standard Sirlin excellence at balancing a pile of characters.  Yes, he took 2.5 revisions to get to the current balance, but I respect his willingness to iterate and revise.

At the same time, Sirlin's base systems often get over-wrought.

So basically, it's a best of both worlds. A nicely elegant Knizia at the core with tons of unique match-ups from Sirlin balanced characters.

After watching the whole game I gave it a '2'.  That's why I was persuaded to give it a try :)

My rating improved (some decision-making showed up), but still the game has disqualifying flaws for me:
- disgusting setting, AWFUL (Fantasy Strike bullshit for kids)
- primitive (others would say: simplistic) mechanics
- I don't like combat card games in general

In short - I don't want to waste even 10 minutes on it.  Btw, 10 minutes is the actual playing time and the box has it right.

It is crazy to me that this game is rated so low on BGG. Having played hundreds and hundreds of board games, this is my favorite ~5-10 minute game.  It holds up after countless plays.  Definitely, definitely try it.  (Make sure you get the newest version that re-balances the characters from the designer's website.)

Note: 2nd Edition Revised improves balance for most characters, but leaves 1 character with ~even matchups with only 2 characters, and favorable matchups against the other 17.  Until that character is nerfed or banned, the game is not very suitable for tournament play.

I don't care at all about the Puzzle Strike universe or whatever it's called. I find the game mildly enjoying, the right length and easy to teach. However, you have to penalize the game somewhat for so blatantly ripping off Knizia without giving proper credit. Especially after ripping off Dominion. Yomi shows that Sirlin is definitely capable of interesting designs, but Flash Duel just feels wrong.

Takes Knizia's En Garde, which I am not especially a fan of, adding a "push" move and sets of one-shot actions. Adds more variety for sure but in the end it is the same game.

RATING: 9
Based on multiple solo games:

What a nice 'little' game, though there is so much variability. Somehow I did it better without a character: with a character I try to use the abilities, but that's the wrong strategy, I think...

Edit: during the night I was thinking about the game and I forgot 1 thing. The characters and the whole thing is a universe. Every character has a story and there is a story. Mr. Sirling gets a 9 for that (now there is still room to expand the universe to a 10!). I admire such creativity a lot. So the game together with the creativity gets an 8.5. I would have loved to see the character stories in the rulebook.

Edit 2: I played it a couple of times with a friend who has a degenerative eye-disease. He doesn't see very well, but likes to play games. Games become more and more an obstacle, because he can't read small cards/dice/etc. This game however is very accessible, simple to understand and also the open character of this game (discard pile is known, distance on the bridge is known, etc.) it's easy to play together even with that eye-handicap. So another half point up!

Flash Duel was pretty much perfect for us, up until I saw that there's still a buttload of ideas left to blow our mind. Twice as much characters, five different playmodes, handles more players. Sweet.

I love that the game is so simple and yet still has some fun decisions.  Rounds do not take more than a few seconds, and there are tons of match-ups between the twenty characters.  This is what I would consider uber filler, and I have not even tried the dragon modes for more than two players.  I have said it in other reviews of his games, but pretty much everything Sirlin makes is going to be an automatic purchase more, especially within the realms of his fantasy strike universe.

Quick little card/board game hybrid (mostly a card game, in that hand management is key, but you're also trying to manouevre so that you and your opponent are the right distance apart on the board), with variable player powers as is Sirlin's speciality. I have not played this game enough to know how well balanced the characters are, although I doubt there's any major imbalance. There is nothing wrong with the game (although I don't like the fact that I hear it's been blatantly ripped off from an old Knizia game, when no acknowledgement is given in the rules - despite Sirlin acknowledging Dominion in the rules for Puzzle Strike), but it's a little too simple to see any play in my groups - and it's primarily a 2-player game which my wife doesn't much care for. (And we have plenty of simple-but-strategic card games already.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Better than Yomi. Compact. But it's a minigame at best. The entire strategy revolves around playing footsies with your opponent and annoying him until he makes a bad play or played enough of a waiting game until he absolutely cannot have the counter to your play in hand and then the game just goes on rails through those last five plays until it reaches the decision point where either the opponent has the hard counter or it's still in the deck.

RATING: 8
Simple rules, Best-of-5, great balance between pushing your luck and showing restraint. I could picture two fencers literally going back-and-forth the whole time. Unique fighters add an extra layer of fun considerations that En Garde doesn't have. And the production value is a bright spot that adds to the zany, cartoon-fighting fun..

Tickles me that there are 20 fighters in the game, or 60 cards solely there in the name of customizing your fighter and adding replayability, while the actual game deck is 25 cards. When other games would probably give you a 60-card game deck and 5 characters (each with only 1 card detailing your ability). 

I'm of the opinion that Flash Duel is a variant or collection of house rules from En Garde. It's an extremely well-implemented variant with excellent production values and... value, period. But it's still a "mod" or "conversion" in video-game terms, where it appears obvious that the designer used En Garde as a starting base, and I firmly believe that starting from a base made by others is infinitely easier than building your own sandcastle from scratch. Flash Duel is so chock-full of value and appears to be such a labor of love that it stands on its own. That said, simple, elegant masterpieces like En Garde shouldn't be copied into another game of similar complexity, because it's too simple to begin with (adapting it as part of a more complex game is another story). Taking the sales issue aside (because this variant definitely murdered En Garde and the few fans it had, though side-note, it murdered Schotten Totten even harder in terms of dueling your opponent through discard-tracking), I wish [-]the designer gave Knizia more credit in the rulebook and/or game box, even if it's just "inspired by..." in 8pt font. That's the right thing to do.[/-] both designers could put their differences aside and credit can be given without threat of legal action.

[hr]

The strategic implications brought about by the special powers are endless, permuted by all the different possible match-ups. This is a treat of feinting and dancing between experienced players, with subtle layers of strategy that fly over newbies' heads. Wish the fencing theme could have been kept here (Soul Calibur maybe?).

Schotten-Totten/Battle Line was on its last legs, and this game totally decapitated it. They share the Knizia heritage of tracking discards, bluffing and hedging your opponent didn't already draw the card you want, but the well-integrated theme here (still, Soul Calibur would be better!) has disguised all traces of that ugly mechanical body. If I were Knizia, I sue Sirlin for murdering [i]two[/i] games, not just one ;) (besides En Garde). Or hire him to be my personal developer and put all the finishing touches on my great mechanisms but ultimately half-assed games.

I don't usually like games that resort to 'play X rounds' in order to add meat to intrinsically deficient content skeletons. Flash Duel is the exception, because you need the luck to even out, and most importantly, the concept of multiple rounds is built into the theme (fighting video games where it's always best 2-of-3, 3-of-5 etc).

This game has a respectable amount of subtle depth, with enough skill for a skilled player to win consistently playing the standard best 3 of 5 match, especially when using a powerful character, and the replay value does seem to hold up (though it would probably falter under intense endurance play over time once you run out of tricks to learn). This is a great game, and the variety of ways to play it is awesome because each variant mode is well thought out.

The extra component considerations, like the fact that this game comes with a deck box to pack it up for travel, or an extra board to play simultaneous 1v1 games in one package, are noteworthy.

Cards scuff very easily due to black borders, and marked cards can be problematic in this game. So I recommend sleeving.

The characters are well themed and look cool -- wish there were cardboard cutouts like BattleCON to represent each character, instead of generic wooden pawns. But the style still works.

Balance is acceptable for a light game with this many characters, but Quince is too powerful against almost the entire cast. Aside from that, even the weaker characters still have their niche little thing that they do "the best" or uniquely so character balance feels pretty fine.

This has worked both as an engrossing tournament-worthy filler with other gamers, or as a quick casual duel game with non-gamers, full of shit-talk and laughter where even bad players have a chance to win a round or two (but best of 5 means a significantly better player will come out with the vastly superior win rate over time), which is exactly what it advertises itself as and what I want it to be

I haven't played the non-1v1 modes of play much, but 2v2 shows a lot of promise (though its pretty hard to play). 2v2 and Dragon mode the coordination can get a bit complex, so I'd say those are expert only modes.

Flash Duel isn't just Sirlin's take on Knizia's En Garde. The improvements Sirlin has made to the system are dramatic and impressive. But the derivation is as unmistakeable as the improvements, and I understand why some have a problem with that. Design ethics aside, Flash Duel is a fun game of card counting, hand management, and asymmetric special abilities. The special abilities parallel Yomi and Puzzle Strike surprisingly well. Across games, the Fantasy Strike universe is impressively and uniquely cohesive. 

There's more luck here than in Puzzle Strike, but the best-of-five framework ensures that the better player will win much more often. As for balance, Gwen is horribly underpowered. Also, Quince has been nerfed in the online implementation after players discovered a degenerate strategy. Overall, however, balance is good enough for skill to decide most matches instead of the draw or character selection. Neither the depth nor the balance matches Puzzle Strike, but for a quick (10 min) duelling game, that's not such a bad thing.

RATING: 4
"Flash duel" is an appropriate name for a lightning-quick head-to-head clash. Each turn a player plays a card numbered 1-5, either to move that many spaces, strike an enemy that many spaces distance, or push an adjacent enemy that many spaces. One successful attack is a victory, but an attack can be blocked playing the same card, or (more likely) retreated from by playing any card at all. The pressure builds because a retreating player loses their next turn; a player put on the back foot is likely to be kept at the mercy of the attacker's tempo.

Being a Sirlin game, the key is a large number of special characters, each with unique powers.

My hope was that Flash Duel would be like Khmer -- the magical Japanese microgame -- with special powers, but it fails in every respect. In practice, the game almost always ends when the deck runs out (the winner is based on cards in hand or position on the track), a dull anticlimax. The special powers have an impact, but it is a minor sideshow to a system which isn't interesting enough on its own merits to bother with.

A tremendous disappointment.

I'm not much for 2-player duel games but I really like the combination of strategy, push-your-luck, bluffing, unique character powers, simple rules/components, portability, and quick play time. Matches are so fast that you can rebound from a loss by grabbing another character and trying again. I'm always excited to introduce someone new to this game.

Caveat: haven't gotten the updated rulebook, still playing with Second Edition rules. Haven't played the 2v2 or deathstrike modes.

One big downside for me is the art; I don't like the chibi style and I rather resent that each character's three ability cards use the same image. I exclusively play with a custom deck I made for myself.

I have a lot of fun with this game.  Fighting against the dragon is insanely unfair and fun in one of those how far can I get before I lose type of ways but the real fun is 2 player and 4 player.

The game features a lot of completely different characters and they are all pretty well balanced.  Some work better in other situations than others and some work better for certain play styles than others, but I rarely feel like it's hopeless to win with any one character.

Full game: 9

Many of my favorite games offer lots of good tension and tough decisions in a short period of time, and few do it better than this. Finding the right balance of attack vs. defense, considering the abilities of both characters, making educated guesses about your opponents' hand - I can't think offhand of any other 15 minute game that offers so much good tension. Add in the customization and variability of the different characters, and this is a game I can see myself coming back to over and over.

2v2: 8

It's still Flash Duel, but the larger card pool takes away some of the interesting guesswork (by making it harder to determine who has what in their hand) and it definitely feels like the variant it is in that the rules don't have the same elegant feel (though not as clunky as, say, BattleCON 2v2). In short, while definitely not as good as the 2 player version, it's still lots of fun for those times you have 4 players.

I suspect the 1 vs. many dragon mode will be better for multiplayer, but haven't tried it yet.

I know you're thinking that this might be an M-rated game, but there are absolutely no trenchcoats involved.  And sure it's "inspired" by Knizia's [i]En Garde[/i] - but the special powers really do make all the difference.

I've only tried the 2-player version so far, and that may be the full extent of my involvement.  There are plenty of other games that satisfy 3+ players, so it's  best to think of the other modes as unnecessary bonuses rather than realistic gaming options.

The uppity MSRP will scare some of you away, and that's a fair criticism.  A $10 rebate sure wouldn't hurt.

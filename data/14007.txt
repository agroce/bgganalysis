RATING: 4
Solo play only as too long by far to get a ftf game in at the moment. A 'simplification' of the GBoH system that reduces the burden of tracking command is welcome (specifically introduced for this game as it's not about big linear battles - it's rather more like Simple GBoH in feel.)

Downsides: it's quite repetitive as the Gallic hordes try to get over the ramparts; very much a game of attrition (and trying to make sure that the Gauls are all attriting in the right place).
The rules for stacking on the ramparts are also a little odd in my eyes; units on the same side cannot be adjacent to each other, resulting in gaps in the line that the Gauls can try to exploit.

The latter effect gives the game a strange feel; it may work out overall but it doesn't quite behave in the way I'd pictured.
The former is more worrying and the main reason why this game hasn't re-emerged for play since I bought it.

Probably the most realistic game on the Battle of Alesia. While the game portrays the entire donut shaped encampment, similar to the AH edition, most of the fighting occurs on a small portion of one map, as it did according to Caesar's commentary.  It is all but impossible for the Gallic tribes to storm the walls outright unless they coordinate and find an opportunity for a breach. An interesting game that can turn on the roman player being too aggressive.

After struggling with unclear rules and errata before finally playing the game correctly, it is a decent game though very long.  The critical errata prohibiting gauls from moving from a ZOC to the ramparts adjacent to a Roman unit is still only found in the blog and not in the errata.  Without that change and the resulting sieve, the game isn't worth playing.

We struggled with the rules and using the then current rules it was impossible for the Romans to defend the works. The Guals could jump up through the Roman ZOC into the empty hexes between defenders...

1) the assumptions are definitely wrong. The designer seems to think the reliving force could only approach from the southwest. Given they had MANY WEEKS to assemble, this force could have come in from another local - or moved to it.

2) Anyone who has stood on the hilltop of Alesia could tell you the city could not be taken. Caesar is not the 'lets siege them out' type - but he understood.

3) Typical effort by the designer - i.e., some good ideas but no development.

4) Rules are very complicated for what you get.

5) Not as competitive. This is not the end all be all, but it is nice to play a game where the victory conditions have been set up that each side has a chance.

Recommend AVOIDING this one - and keeping to the AH version.

RATING: 7
Great Battle of History series game vol. 11, depicting the Gaul vs. Roman in yet another siege/ subjugation warfare.  The last time we had a game on this one is the Avalon Hill's Siege of Jurusalem.  

First impression is very good as we have gained increasing amount of knowledge about the ancient war.  Slightly complex than Devil's Horseman but it's about the same as Caesar at Alexandria.  

Continuing the latest GBoH's norm of complete abandoning of turns structure.  Players alternate their play relying on their leaders' initiatives.  Many special rules on the trenches.  The 2 maps are well-done.  

A prominent feature of the rulebook and player aids is the use of every colors, the only one I've seen in years.  After play, we thought the loose ZOCs are critical to the whole game's historicity, whereas they appear to be too easy for the Gauls passing through and then attacking the Romans from the back.  The linear tactics is also gone for the Romans as they cannot keep close to each other in the Ramparts.  My friend and I find this single problematic rule about Roman units placement on the rampart.  I put several tribes into a single arrival area and they headed towards the rampart and broke through it like a nuke. My fried get upset very much. I have raised this to the game designer but then the game desginer did expressly say he gave the Gauls more than a fair chance in this battle. The game developer also in defense said it was all about scale, time and space. So, I think the game somehow justifies its own. 

The game is also too long to play for a campaign game, although 2 shorter scenarios are available for the same map.  The hexes are too small to hold a stack of counters cluttering over specific areas of maps, if the Gauls chose to concentrate on just an area for operations.  Add to the determination of facing, you might have a hard time in handpicking them and change for the number of hits incurred in battle.  

In the end, a disappointment from an otherwise well presented games.  On the other hand, the Gauls could have a more than a fair chance to win in this game if the Romans are set up improperly.  Based on my gaming experience with this game, I had a feeling that this game is a show of theatrical movement on a big stage around the town. A large number of people moving all around.

Alesia is an interesting game with simplified rules, but I think it lacks replayability.  It may be too early to judge, but in three games (I was the Gauls twice), we had virtually the same play.  Twice the Romans won the game.  The fight is pretty bloodthirsty.

A  prime example of form over substance which demonstrates that pretty graphics do not a historical game make.  I so much wanted to like this game but I cannot recommend it in its current form.  Usual sloppy GMT rules don't help, but the problem lies with the game mechanics which make it ludicrously easy for the Gauls to scale the Roman walls.  Other problems abound such as auxilia not being able to act with the legion they are attached to (they are under separate command) and retreat rules that cause units attacked in the rear to retreat towards the enemy or stay put if they are cavalry.  Try the old Avalon Hill version - dated, but a lot less ahistorical and a lot more fun.

RATING: 5
I've played several games (solitary and ftf) and Vercingetorix never got out... I really wonder if anyone did this...

The Romans are very strong when they counterattack... stronger than in SGBoH: The combat matrix is different, whether they are behind ramparts or not, so the explanation of the "siege warfare" concerning this difference doesn't quite hold for me.

The activation system create a strange effect: While Vercingetorix moves from Alesia towards the circumvallation, the Romans can counterattack Gauls from the relief army, which are then almost  totally helpless, because, seizures excluded, the Gauls can only activate the Alesia force OR another command from the relief army.

The rules concerning the Area Commanders and the activation of the Auxiliaries are unrealistic and just seem to be a "play balance" trick.

I'm not satisfied. I believe the siege of Alesia could have been better simulated and I'll develop some House Rules, just to see if I'm right or wrong...

the endless tiny minute iterations and subtle changes to GBOH are finally getting to me; I'm having difficulty remembering just how to play this one particular version.

Interesting decisions for the Gallic player, he is the driver of the game. The advance planning lets him chose a plan and then stick to it to death or victory. The Romans are in reactionary mode and need to quickly concentrate on the Gallic efforts. Lots of tension as the somehow convoluted rules about ramparts and stacking allow them to quickly scale the walls even with lesser tribes. But getting down from the ramparts and widening the breach is extremely difficult as the Roman cohorts simply slaughter the Gauls in the open. There are, however, lots of Gauls where they came from, so it´s truly a battle of attrition. Play the player´s game as the historical game is a bit too cramped and maybe too stereotypical.

A friend of my had a rule problem with this game.  He wrote the developer and got the answer, READ the rule again!  What a piece of helpful advice.  Usually GMT does a better job with support.  That is why this game is for sale.  No one to answer game questions. Ah, attitude.  Developers are genuineness's and gamers are idiots!  Didn't Hitler say something like that about his generals?

Another great entry in the GBoH series, with beautifull artwork allround.  Since this game depicts a siege, the rules differ from previous GBoH games.  I thought, after 3 games, this product is more playable than older GBoH games - unless you play with Simple GBoH rules.

Rule book could be better organized,  they need someone to read it other then the developer(game creator) and ask questions.

GBOH system did not really work for sieges - the start/stop manner of activations caused the action to feel very serial at points along the map instead of a more fluid full map affair.

Gets off to a slow start.  The Romans don't have much to do at first other than use their cavalry.  However, once the barbarians reach the walls and start climbing over them, the game picks up quite a bit.  The GBOH rules (even the modified SGBOH ones this uses) are a bit of a force fit for this siege.  The siege itself has a pretty unusual setup too, but it ends up being a decent siege game in the end.

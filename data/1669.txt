RATING: 7.5
Fun solitaire game.  The random events cards help to make the game unique each time.  Just finished my first play through and almost made it but was killed in the 7th turn.  I made a few errors regarding the rules but re-reading the rules after the first game clears things up a lot.  I would have liked to see more clearer examples in the rule book.

So-so solitaire game.  It lacks the narrative of [thing=1032][/thing], the intensity of [thing=1608][/thing] and the awesomeness of [thing=29603][/thing].  Not bad and it has aged well.  I just had higher hopes for it.

The first solitare game I purchased because it was solitare. Very challenging to win as to continue playing, your score must meet a certain level every turn which increases. But as your score increases, the difficulty of the game also increases to keep you from getting a run-away victory.

Strong solitaire offering.  Learned a lot about John Mosby from this one years ago.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another top notch solitaire game.  The system and random event cards ensure that every game is a unique experience.

Slight glitch in the rules, however, ensures that Mosby loses 1 game in every 36.  (Rolling a 1 on recruitment for both of the first two turns.)  Suggest you re-roll the second recruitment roll (again re-rolling any 1s).

 Good game thus far.  I like the theme and the play, although a few of the rules are a little murky.  This is not in the class of RAF or Carrier, but it is a good little solitaire game that I can see I'll play from time to time after I wear it out a little bit here at the beginning. :)  Acquired 9/2007.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is very enjoyable, which accounts for my high rating. What makes the game less than great is that it is fairly easy to win - to the point that I often wonder if I'm getting something wrong. The times I've lost, it tends to be very early in the game, when Mosby's forces are relatively weak. If you can survive until turn 3 or 4, I don't see the challenge, as Mosby can effectively quit the turn whenever it is to his advantage without much blow-back. Once I think I got stung by the random events later in the game. At any rate, the late game can feel very gamey indeed, and unless you are playing with the advanced rules, I can't see how it's difficult to get to 9 notoriety (I'm usually there by turn 6 or 7). I have yet to add in some of the other advanced rules, which I'll have to do, but simply playing for a higher score doesn't cut it (and even then, it's not that hard to hit 11 or 12 without trying much). I love the theme, the era, and the play itself, but it is the ease that will keep this from coming out as much as I'd like.

Tense gameplay, rulebook complete, but leaves something to be desired when necessary to use as a reference.  Game rewards meticulous, fairly conservative play.  It feels like you're doing well, so you figure you can push it a bit, maybe get a bit greedy, and then suddenly you're in the shit!  On the other hand, you need to stay on top of things, stay a bit ahead of the time pressures, because things happen suddenly in this game:  BOOM, the turn's over, and you didn't accomplish what you planned, and once again, the pressure's ON!  I LOVE IT!

Fun solitaire system loosely based on Ambush but simpler. You will bang your head on the rules only because there is no conceptual statement of the interaction between spaces, units, Large Union Forces, and space status, just several rules spread around. Once you get past that, it becomes very easy to play and quick. Unlike most solitaire games, it doesn't really have a "solution" so much as how the story unfolds, so there's tremendous replayability. However, not enough there to make me pull it out frequently, as I do with London's Burning.

I'm the designer of this game and I'm proud of it. The state of the art has moved far beyond it, but it still has things to offer. It's one of the nicer looking games we did at Victory. The artist painted me on the cover - without telling me - I'm the red haired Confederate blasting the Yankee off his horse. Funny, now my hair is gray. Oh well, game and people both age I suppose.

I have removed my rating (it was a 6) now that I realize that game designers should not rate their own games, even when they try to be objective.

RATING: 8
I tracked this down because I really like Eric Smith's approach to games, and Across 5 Aprils is one of my all time favorites.  I play almost exclusively solitaire (my 'free' time tends to be irregular and limited to very late at night), but tend to prefer games where I play both sides rather than games designed as solitaire from the start (although I do own and enjoy several of the latter).  I really like the map in Mosby's Raiders and the counters as well; I also like what the game is trying to do.  For a game that is 30+ years old, a lot of the ideas in it still seem interesting.  The engine of the game does a good job of producing choices that allow the player to act (rather than simply react, as is the case with some of the States of Siege series of games), and there is certainly enough unpredictability to provide tension/interest/excitement within the game and to provide a high degree of replayability.  All good, so far.  The problem, as others have noted, is with the rule book.  On the one hand, it is full of great historical information and designer's notes.  But the rules themselves feel badly organized with several key conceptual ideas (e.g., the reveal markers) not really explained in the rules (things become a bit more clear with play), and most of the game just feels somehow non-intuitive with enough exceptions that I found myself constantly referring to the rulebook.  And like Ambush!, it uses the operations/rounds conceptualization of time that just never feels comfortable to me for some reason.  I played 4 times back-to-back because I didn't want to have to relearn the rules... (in scoring terms, this downgraded the game from an 8.5).  The game is definitely a keeper, as it really, really excels at generating a narrative over the course of about 2 hours, but you do have to work for it and I think I will shift gears to something else for awhile.

Good solitaire game, where you try to cause trouble and not get caught.  The more successful you are, the more men diverted to fight you.  You want as much notoriety as possible, but if you are killed, you lose, so it's risky to go for the big win.

Bought from Ebay for £11.50 inc post & packing. Really nice condition looks like new! Really happy to have this back in my collection. Originally bought it in around 1991 and played it a few times. I thought it was quite good back then but eventually other games took over and I let this one go selling it at Reading in one of the Colours meets. Can't remember when nor how much I got for it. Have really got back into some of my solitare games of late and regretted getting rid of this one so managed to find and buy one...so happy days! 

Update: Have invested a bit of time this month finally re-learning how to play this. Have had three games of it so far. First a test game not completed but done to just test out understanding of the rules and the like.

Second game was a corker. Roll for Mosby's recruits produced no friends! straight into turn 2; roll for Mosby's recruits again no friends. Turn 2 ends with Mosby at notoriety of 1 requires 2...game over! Quickest defeat ever and without me doing a thing!

Game 3 much better. Went the full length and managed an easyish win with 9 points. In fact didn't have to do much but see the random action events played out in turn 8 as I had already made the 9 points. Need to play again as it seemed maybe too easy!

I played once and enjoyed it greatly.  I won, but I think I got lucky by pulling the "Lee Wants Information" event at the right time to pick up 18 reputation points off that card alone.  It made the final two turns kind of easy.  I'm going to break it out again soon though.  I was impressed with the system, I only had one rules question.

UPDATE: After a few more plays I still like it, but I'm not sure how much replayability it has

One of the better 1980s solitaire wargames from Avalon Hill's Victory games subsidy. Playing as Confederate guerilla Mosby, you blow up bridges, kidnap Union notables, etc, as directed by your your card-generated objectives. It's up to you how you achieve these things. Union resistance stiffens through the game in line with your raiders' successes. While I enjoyed it in the 80s, it has to be said that these days the PC is the true home for solitaire wargames of this ilk ......does anyone disagree?

Mosby's Raiders puts you in command of the partisan Rangers. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy lines to disrupt the Union war effort while maintaining your Notoriety and not getting killed. You wreck rails, blow bridges and take shots at the spread out Union pickets.  I like the special cards you can draw most being based on actual events.  These cards make each game played different from the other. The rules are initially tough to get through laid out in a scattered fashion but the information you need is in there.  Good examples of play are provided.

Game runs smooth and learning curve is really fast, so in just a couple of hours it is possible to start playing a sesion. Graphics are a little bit outdated, specially icons on counters. A nice map depicting the main theater of operations on ACW. As solitaire, design is elegant and replayability is guaranteed with random events cards system. Subject is for a limited audience although interesting. As a piece for collectors it is worth the investment but not recommended for players that loves the state of the art.

:d10-2: The game creates a flavorful narrative as Mosby's Raiders attempt to blow up bridges, rail lines, depots, and capture Union officers. The unpredictability helps the narrative stay fresh from one game to the next.
:d10-3: The player is presented with meaningful choices. While much of the game flow is determined a roll of the die or the card draw, it is ultimately the choices of the player that have the most impact on Mosby's success. 
:d10-4: There are so many viable ways to gain performance points and notoriety that the player shouldn't feel that he is stuck with only one or two tracks to success in this game. Bridges, supply depots and rail lines wait to be demolished. Union officers may be kidnapped. A guarded and mobile wagon train offers a tempting but tough target. And finally Union combat units may be attacked and if defeated will give Mosby many performance points..
:d10-5: The random events and action cards impart flavor, randomness, and game altering situations which make the game more fun and replayable.
:d10-6: Once the player becomes familiar with the rulebook, it is easy to find the information you are looking for. Additionally, I have found the rules to be unambiguous once I developed a decent comprehension of the game.

[b]Words of Caution[/b]
:d10-1: The rules will likely be difficult for many players to fully digest initially. This rulebook demands careful attention when reading and learning the game. The player may need to play a full game to just understand the sequence of play and how the mechanics relate to one another. This may bother players who like to comprehend the mechanics and rules after an initial reading and jump into play without much rule referencing. See :d10-6: above though for my thoughts on the rules once the player is familiar with basic gameplay.
:d10-2: Players looking for detail and simulation will not find it here. Combat and Mosby's other actions are very abstracted. Let the die roll resolve it and use your imagination to show you the troop movements, flanking, and gunfire in your mind's eye.
:d10-3: Lots of die rolling. Lots. I don't mind a lot of die rolling, but I think some players may be put off by rolling a die to determine everything. It would be nice if there was some mechanism to reduce the die rolling to streamline part of the game and speed it up, but I don't know how to do that. Ultimately, I don't have a problem with the die rolling, just be warned. 

[b]The Main Point[/b]
This game provides challenge, tension, and meaningful decisions. While many elements are determined randomly, the outcome of the game won't be determined solely on random chance. The player can evaluate the opportunities in front of him and weigh the risk and benefit of each. Luck won't grant Mosby a victory with out careful planning and adequate evaluation of the nearby opportunities and threats.

I think I'll have a lot of fun with this game in the future. I think the game found the right balance of abstraction versus theme and provides the right amount of tension as well as a colorful narrative.

Fun little game: fast to set-up, easy to play (I'd say more or less RAF-difficulty) and really tense.
I like the feel of the game, really guerrilla-like. Will keep playing it for sure!

Crack the game system mechanic, once you've done it I guess your supposed to throw it away? What good is that? Too formulamatic, could use a stronger dose of randomness.  Alas though it it had that I would have even considered it for purchase.

Another great game by Eric Lee Smith. Mosby's is an underrated game, IMO. Eric again provides us with an easy to learn system with an easy to read rulebook and great historical notes. Its got a very different feel to it than other solitaire games. I like that I am not controlling a mass of troops, its just Mosby and his band of rebels wrecking havoc on Union supplies and troops. 

Not my favorite of the VG games I have played, but probably the most fun of the bunch.

Very fun solitaire system. Great length, about 2 hours, with plenty of important decisions to make in that time and it doesnt drag on. I really like the push-your-luck feel of this game. 

I like this one a lot.

It's OK. A unique design about an interesting situation, the game is fun for the first few plays. The player only has one unit capable of moving (Mosby) which makes for a different feel from St. Nazaire.

True story: I bought this game used from my FLGS, about two weeks after having a dream about a solitaire game called "Mosby's Raiders." I may have seen the game on BGG but had no conscious memory of it.  Weird!

Anyway, it's a pretty cool design!  The action cards and events seem ahead of their time.  And the flow of the game has a nice feel to it: the early raids, looking for opportunities to wreak some stealthy havoc, the increasing difficulty as the Union starts to catch on to your guerrilla tactics, and the end, where everyone is ready for you but you're also a capable combatant.

A bit more complicated than I would have liked; I feel like I spend WAY too much time looking up things when I play.  Still, it is a remarkable system and feels really tense and exciting.  If you ever wanted to lead a guerrilla band against huge army, here's your chance.

Nice solitaire system, rules need a rewrite though. Lots of challenge and variety on how to achieve your goals. The more damage you do, the more alert the Union becomes thus becoming slightly more difficult as the game progressess towards the end.

Another good solo design. Fairly well done - you do get the feeling of tearing around behind union lines blowing stuff up, kidnapping, general mayhem. And the "shake up the hornets nest" effect on union troops adds tension - and a push your luck element. The addition of cards for events and special abilities add nice flavor. Replayability becomes a factor I think though - cards being the only thing that will keep it from becoming overly stale. I think it is best played in moderation to lengthen its welcome.

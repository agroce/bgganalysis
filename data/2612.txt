Took months to put this together. The map was the hardest as printing on A4 warped the scale for the other things. Hexes came out at 94%, and since Legal size paper is non-existent for me, printing on A3 gave a slightly larger 100% map. Completed Mar 08, first play 15-Mar-08.

After playing more 18xx I consider this one just a good introduction.

2011-07-12 (rating 9):

A fine introductory game. Yet I prefer [gameid=23540].

After playing few times one starts to look for some "twists" and this is the time to discover other 18xx games.

It captures the 18xx feel in a much smaller and shorter environment.  So that's good.  But the private company auctions at the start feel wonky to me.  And the criteria to get a public on the board means you shoot yourself in the foot if you partially fund one and it doesn't hit.  Even a one turn delay is bad - money sunk, rewards delayed.

So the overall experience feels a bit strange to me.  Don't get me wrong, I like the game and want to play it.  It's interesting and I like the shorter/smaller 18xx experience, but I think it may lose too much in the translation.

Then again, I'm an 18xx neophyte so maybe not?

This is an introductorey game to the 18xx game series. It is not an easy game to master, but quite easy to learn. It has not all the flavor that bigger 18xx as 1830, 1856 and 1870 has.

But it is good. You can play it several times without finding it boring.

Fascinating.  My first foray into 18xx territory - I'd always been put off by the duration.  Still took us 5 1/2 hours for our first (3p) game,  but certainly felt like less!  Engrossing all the way through,  but I will try to use some of the tricks to speed it up next time.  If we could get to sub-4 hours,  I'd be happy.  Certainly appears to be an excellent introduction to those who like the idea of 18xx,  but want a shorter variant.

Ouf! Played only once. Very complex and dense and...very long. Would take many games for skillfull play. 

Edit: Now at my third game, and enjoying every moment of this rich and complex game. Easier to learn that I believed at first (yet it is quite difficult to teach and supervise the very first game). My gaming group present many different playing styles and preferences, but this game is greatly appreciated by all.

It sure is one of the game that give me the most gaming pleasure.I would rate it higher (than 8!)if it was not for the fact that it is demanding to explain and lenghty, while a new players may make a single bad decision at the begining and suffer from it for the whole game. The kind of game that must only be introduced to seasoned and devoted players.

[selfmade] I enjoy this game a lot, it was a 10 for quite some time, but in the end after enough plays I find it a bit lacking as a 4 player game. 3 is probably the only number if you play experienced people. still, a very good intro to 18xx games that I am willing to play anytime.

[edit] for 3 players - 9, for 4 players - teaching game only.

the new graphic layout may be pretty, but the old one is more playable... 3 companies with basically same color of tokens is pretty bad..

Fantastic game. I love the mechanics. It's a real brainburner, so if this is one of the "lightest" 18XX, the whole series is mightily interesting for me.

The only bad point is length. Even being one of the shortest 18XX, 5 hours is the absolute longest I can get for a gaming session, so 18AL is about the longest game I can play, counting set-up, rules-explaining/refreshing and clearing up. Even then, my playgroup seems to prefer more short games over one long game, so I guess I won't be playing this one as much as I'd want, which is a shame.

This was my first 18xx experience. 18AL is a light version of the 3D stockmarket branch of the game which plays quickly - the train upgrades can fly through really fast. 

I liked the stock playing aspects to this as it was a more complex addition to my normal track laying railroad fare to this point, so based on playing this at a con and taking it back to my regular group, we now play an 18xx every month.

Rated after my first play. First 18XX ever. I really have no right to comment. There is just too much going on in this game system to make any sort of informed comment after one play. That said, I'll throw out a 6, not because it was a mediocre game, but because there are many other games I prefer. For now. I will certainly play more. The rating is likely to go up. The question is really how much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First play through of an unfamiliar 18xx not entirely unlike the first time with a decidedly more popular form of recreation: a lot of fumbling, a lot of unsureness about what should go where, high probability of an awkwardly premature finish, and a strong urge to have another go at it sooner rather than later.

Ahem.

So take 1830, toss in private companies with powers that are worth a damn, shrink the board and the bank, make the tile mix a bit more forgiving, hand out some mint juleps to everyone, and you've got 18AL.

The critical question from my perspective is whether or not this can emerge as an 18xx game that can be played in 3 hours, which will launch it into the weeknight rotation. If so, it will be highly worth it. If not, it will have a more limited function as a mildly less intimidating intro to 18xx than 1830, while being probably a more interesting game than Poseidon. For you, the curious consumer, the question is: are you handy enough to PnP a copy of your own and/or can you (like me) get a secondhand copy at a reasonable price?

I only got to play this once...and it was at the end of a tiring day, so it didn't really get a good chance. The good news is that since then I've gotten copies of 1830, 1856 and 1870. The bad news is that I haven't had a sniff of a chance to play any of them. I've been trying to find an online implementation that would be amenable to PBEM, but so far no dice.

I feel like I would probably really dig this whole game system and would bump my rating higher with repeat plays...but so far nothing. I may at some point shell out the bucks to obtain a copy of 18AL and try to introduce the shorter game to my friends.

RATING: 6
This was my second 18XX game, and I still find myself enjoying the game system and the decisions involved.

18AL is intended to be a shorter version of the system, and it is, though in 18XX terms that means that it still takes a few hours. 18AL features a fairly straight-forward catalogue of tiles, which makes it easier for players to build the routes they want instead of agonizing over how they can get from point a to b. The stock market here has a lot of room for shenanigans as well and like 1830 and the other related games, the winner is determined by who plays it the best, the board is just a sideshow.

I appreciate the effort to decrease the playtime in both this and GA but it does come with some downsides, namely the fact that there is no time to recover from a misplay, so the game often turns on one or two important stock round moves. The longer games tend to give players more of an opportunity to recover from gaffes. Because of this, I've had to downgrade the rating slightly on this. It's still good, and it's short, but it's not as satisfying as the longer games.

I also dislike the 4D trains here relative to the end game trains (8) in GA because they make late game route planning too easy and devalue careful station placement.

On a side note: this game only features 6 companies, so I hesitate to play it with 4 players, the players who each control 2 companies at that scale seem to have too much of an advantage when it comes to setting up front corporations to create income for the actual powerhouse, not to mention the ability to gut and flip. Also, this game ends faster mainly based on the small bank and the presence of the "if a stock tops out, the game ends" rule. The bank also is cleaned out faster because small cities don't count against one's engine. A decent shorter 18XX (3 hours with experience) but I prefer GA or medium length titles like 18MEX to this.

Compared to most other games in the 1830-branch this isn't much of a game. Not enough asymmetry to be interesting, and it possesses a coulple rather stupid rules designed to make the game more introductory.

The only real plus here is that the tile set is identical (or nearly) to the 18GA tile set (same designer), which makes this a PnP two-fer.

RATING: 9
This is a great, if not perfect, introductory game for 18XX series. Not to mention there is a wonderful redesign by Koryo. There are couple additional rules compared with 1830, but mostly are minor. The great things about this game is everything is particularly balanced. You can start anywhere and stay competitive. So no newbie doomed for the entire game just because his first company was wrong. 

What make this game perfect is that this game is tame enough for newbie, but still create chance for nasty play in stock or train buying by veteran. That's why it has great reply value, because there are so many strategies to explore. When you are tired of this (highly unlikely), I believe you've ready to move on to other 18XX titles.

Specialties: 
- Beautiful redesign
- Print and Play
- Balanced companies
- Forgiving tiles
- Mostly similar as the 1830
- Town doesn't count in running train
- 4D trains to double the income
- Early game can only buy one train per turn
- Short bottom on stock market.

One of the longest games I have played.  I really enjoyed it.  This game was a gateway for me to try out larger, more-involved games than I would previously attempt.  That said, I prefer its brother, 18GA.  18AL is more like other 18XXs I've played: the history gets in the way of a good game.

Edit: what a newb!  Longest games...heh, heh.  That was way before Advanced Civ and whatnot.

After 1 play, I feel this is an excellent 18XX game to start with.  It's faster, there's less corporations, and the map is smaller.  It is very similar to 1830, but with a few tweaks here and there.  I might even like it a bit better than 1830 and I really enjoy that one.  I don't know how well it will stand up to repeat plays, but right now this is a solid 9 for me.  Looking forward to giving it another go.  Our game was a blood-bath which ended in bankruptcy.  At game's end, 4 out of the 6 stocks were in the yellow.  The 1st and 2nd place players were seperated by a single $1.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A nice "short" 18XX that gives much of the feel in a fraction of the time. I definitely prefer 1830 and 1856 to it, because of its enhanced richness and general enjoyment level, but 18AL will do if you don't have as much time for 1856 or you are playing against opponents who don't want to play a legthy game as 1856. 

Eventually the symmetry of the game started to bother me. Besides, I have little problem getting other people to play the longer 18XXs, so I got rid of my copy.

I consider this to be largely replaced and exceeded by 1889. 1889 combines the main advantage of 18AL (short play time), with a more interesting game, and I do not see a reason to ever play 18AL again if I have 1889 available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My intro to 18XX is 18AL online (PBEM Rails) so take these comments with a grain of salt.   There is a line where train games become more like work and less like a game to me.  More like a simulation or academic exercise and less like a fun time with friends.   18AL pushes that boundary, but with the Rails program to manage all of the bookkeeping and route optimization, the burden is lifted.   I appreciated that very much.   While Chicago Express remains my favorite train game, 18AL gives a good reference point for the derivation and simplification into C.E.  In 18AL alliances are just as important and perhaps more tenuous, as stocks can both be bought and sold, and share prices can both go up and down.   For the most part, the game boils down to making good investments (80%) and then taking care to build track wisely, offensively and defensively, on the map (20%).   The map play is more interesting, but the stock market is more important.   I would be interested in exploring more of the 18XX system at some point.

This game seems flat to me.  Not much flavor in the privates and limited flexibility in the game play.  I understand it's meant as a beginner's game, but it doesn't have much to encourage repeat play.

Definately a good introduction to the 18xx series.  All the feel of 1830, just about, but /shorter/.

An interesting game, and probably a great introduction to the 18XX series.  However, I'm not sure it floats my boat.  I felt like I didn't really realize what was going on until the game got into the late phase (where the trains run until money runs out).  By then it was too late to redo any of my problems.  The rusting/expiring trains was a real challenge, but not one that was unstoppable.  Ultimately, let me say I'd like to try again some day.

A nice shorter 18XX with rules similar to 1830 but a slightly muted train rush and a rather forgiving map. It's not going to rocket up to being a favorite 18XX for us, but I think the game is better than the reputation it seems to have among experienced 18XX players suggests. We were able to play with experienced 18XX players in about 3 hours on our first play, so the listed playtime is actually feasible - which is nice for a change.

This seems to be a more accessible and faster playing 18XX variant. The board is smaller, with only one-track builds, instead of the two-track builds I am used to in 1856 and 1870, but interesting and convoluted track layouts still seem to result. It may be advisable to start with this as an introduction to the 18XX system, instead of the 18EZ, as there is a theme here, and asymmetry that is present in the rest of the series. I don't have to mentally prepare myself for this variant, as I do for the 1856 and 1870 variants, as there is much less going on.

RATING: 8
One of the best games currently available as a print & play. Essentially this is a cut down version of 1830, although there are a few tame rules like destinations and the restriction to only buying one train at once. Like some other members of the 18xx family this really only works with 3 players as there are 6 companies and those running two are at a big advantage over those left with just one company to manage. There's a brief, brutal train rush in mid game, but then once everyone has a permanent train and all cities are covered by brown tiles, there's still a scandalous amount of money in the bank and the remainder of the game just consists of grinding it out. $1k-$2k could be removed without losing any of the interesting part of the action. Gets a bit scripted after a while, but for about three plays a good introduction to the 1830 branch of the series.

If this game ended on a faster note, it would be rated higher, but that said, it is a great game, that is also a good introduction into the 18XX system. 

The map is small, it isn't too brutal for newbies, and yet, there is plenty of room for maneuvering and messing with your opponents.

I'd gladly play this any time!

Playing time is about 4 hours. It is a little shorter than other 18xx. The game rules is a bit easier than 18xx series. However. the game is not suitable for boardgame beginners. For me, 18xx is not my cup of tea. It is ok game.

Chris made this Print & Play copy - I bought it through the GCOM Game Days silent auction.  Chris did a great job, it looks very good.

Two full plays in, and I am really liking the system.  I enjoy the huge decision tree combined with a complete lack of randomness.

Still love this game, but nobody that I play games with has interest in the game/genre.

Even though it isn't getting played, I'm holding on to this one because Chris made it.  Even though I usually get rid of games that dont' get played, I make an exception for this.  Some day it will get played again, and I'll be glad I still have it.

Played in 2016 with Toby & Ambie.  May get repeat plays!  Glad to get it to the table again at last.

Sold via craigslist on 10/14/2017.  Ended up playing it twice with Toby & Ambie, which led into them really getting into 18xx games, so I have been able to play some 1830, 1857, 1880, etc. with them.  Have copies of a few better 18xx games myself, so moved this one on.  Really glad to have owned it and got the plays I did, and glad to move it on so someone else can try it.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 5
Wohooo...  Finally I've played a title from the legendary 18xx series.

And it's a... disappointment!
Let me get this straight - I DON'T mind long, heavy games at all.  I love several of them in fact.

But in this case my gripes are... long playing time and complexity!  Why?  It's because the game was tedious and not exciting.  And no tension means you FEEL the passage of time.  You feel you've really played 4-5h.  In excitng games you don't.
No interesting decisions in the first part of the game becomes 'analysis paralysis' in the second part of it.  But this deep analysis was unexciting for me.  I felt no appeal in it whatsoever.  I was very indifferent to it.

I'd even dare to say that the game felt repetitive for me considering I've played Poseidon (a bit simplified 18AL) 3 times before.  Especially this train management felt very 'samey' every time :-/  Of course details and flow of the specific game will be different every time, but general mechanisms (like this train management) bore me very quickly in 18xx family.

All above problems will only be worse for me in more advanced 18xx titles (18AL is one of the simplest designs) - I mean: playing time and complexity.  And core (unexciting for me) mechanics will stay the same.

So the final verdict: no future time and money investment into 18xx series from my side.  I'll be avoiding playing 18xx games.  These games might be exciting for many, but they are just not for me.

RATING: 6
Too complicated for my taste. And much less a train game than I expected. At this complication level I expected something more realistic. Examples? 
- any train let's you travel as far as you need as long as it does not have to stop in cities. Villages don't make you stop, you can visit as many as you want and they give you money for the travel, but don't limit the lenght. 
- you must enter phase 4 to be able to build a track that has any forks - before they don't know how to do it. Than how do they build railway stations anyway?

RATING: 8.2
I'd played a few of games of 1846 before I got around to any other 18XX games, 18AL was the first I tried and it has really opened my eyes.  More strategy, tactics, and mayhem.

I'm still a fledging when it comes to 18XX games but I'm loving them more and more as I explore the genre. I don't have any true favorites yet and this rating may certainly go down as I discover better 18XX games but for now this is my new favorite.

I played about 25% of this game so far. We made the mistake of starting too late on a Sunday night. We had to stop right when it started to get interesting. This game is definitely intense (and it's supposed to be one of the lighter 18xx games!), but I like games like that. It also seems very fiddly. We noticed that it's also possible to get burned really easily in the game if you don't know what you're doing (none of us did). I definitely want to try this game again, but only if we can start earlier in the day.

This was my first 18XX game - so far I have a good impression. It seems strategic enough and the stock manipulation makes it interactive. This version was reasonably short at 4 hours (all newbies), which I think is a big advantage. I don't yet see the point of playing a longer version of this kind of game but I need to try one to really know. I like the fact that I don't have the puzzly aspect of putting the right colour cube to the appropriate city as in the Martin Wallace rail games.

Tried once, game was abandoned maybe 2/3 of the way through. I was not clear on how the game functioned or how to try to make money going into it, so it was not a good experience. By the time we stopped, I had the sense that the player that got himself set up the best at the beginning would spend the next three hours winning the game, while the other players would spend the next three hours losing. I say go through the setup, declare the winner, and save yourself three wasted hours.

18xx in Alabama. Short game in 18xx terms. ***** Take in account that the first trains can get rusted rather fast. As there is not much cash in the bank, it is better to pay out during operating rounds than keeping the money in the company for a second permanent train. The cash earned during the operating rounds will most likely be lower than the end value of the stocks.

For a quick xx for newbs it's not bad at all, but rather unexpressive. If you use this to learn 18xx, you should probably just grab 1830 for your second game right away. The companies feel too samey, and the privates are quite useless for anything but your standard money laundering, except for the slightly overpowered NDY.

This was my first PnP game (made in May 2010). For someone who has never played an 18xx game, it's not a bad way to try one out without having to invest a lot of time and money.

[Played 3 times]
It's composed by two well interlocked parts: stock holding (buy and sell shares) and operating corporations (build tracks, run trains,...).
No randomness.

Gameplay feels interesting, but I've yet to fully explore it.
Lenghty rulebook (unless you already know the 18xx system).

After extensive research about a good introductory 18xx game, I've picked this one, liking the ideas of: a small map, no early "train rush", and limited lenght compared to other 18xx games. However we still needed 5 hours rather than the 3 we were looking for; I'm afraid there's just too much boring countability to perform that waters down the fun.

A well liked 18XX design because it plays quickly (only 4 hours!).  Great board and a fair stock-market (nothing too exciting).  My biggest gripe is that if all 6 companies are running when the train-rush happens it's can utterly annihilate some of the companies in play.  Of course if I was able to "see" this part of the game coming perhaps I would be able to enjoy it better.  The big problem when you don't see it is that you just spent 3 others in heavy concentrated calculations and all of a sudden you've basically lost.  I thought there should be a couple more mid-high level trains.

RATING: 6
So, it's an 18xx game, so it can't be bad. It's not great, though. A bit boring. I'd rather play something else, like 1860. For a quicker game, 1825 units or 1889.

I'm not a huge fan of 1830-style games. The one-train-per-turn rule is boring. The map isn't very interesting. 4D trains instead of diesels is good, red-to-red-bonuses are nice.

Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok, yes - I can see why the 18xx games are appealing. There's a lot going on, an immersive depth to the strategy, and many compelling choices whose consequences are opaque and the results of which can have significant unforeseen results. That said, I feel like for the kind of gaming experience it is, it takes far too long to play, and was almost painfully intellectual - resulting in mental and emotional exhaustion comparative to the feeling one is left with after a four hour long math final (and no one but the daft like taking four hour long math finals.) 

In the end, I think this is not my cup of tea.

Perfectly enjoyable 18xx that we finished in just over 2 hours using Rails as a moderator. I'm not sure why people poo-poo this as an entry-level 18xx game; sure it didn't have the twists of 1856 (for example), but took only half the time. Both seem to drag toward the end, as there really doesn't seem like much you can do to change the map, so you're just going through the motions of paying out over and over again.

The 18xx series isn't a game series so much as a lifestyle choice.  You either get it or you don't.  I'm starting to "get it".  Each map has its money areas, its lockout points, its terrain issues, its variant strategies.  The way to win each game is by having the most cash on-hand when the bank breaks, but the trick to winning each game is owning the right amount of the right stocks -- hopefully, one that you own majority stake and another two or three where you hold joint minority stake, all of them dominating the stock market.  And boy, is that harder than it sounds.

This game will take a while and it will hurt your brain in the same way that Go will stretch you.  It's definitely an trip every gamer should experience once, and this is a much easier entry point than 1830.  You'll have a more satisfying experience with one game of 18xx than with 5 games of "7 Wonders", so try it already.

2017 UPDATE: Everything holds true.  This is a perfect entry point to stock-and-train games.

RATING: 7
First impression: Hadn't played any of the 18xx series before. There was quite a lot of tiny rules to remember in a first game. I was told 18AL would be one of the simplest ones from series. I like the mechanics overall and game is definitely meaty enough and you cannot blame bad luck, only yourself if you go bankrupt. My main concern is that there is quite a lot of time spent only to deal out money to players during the game. I think we weren't doing it in a optimal way but still it will be taking some time and I basically don't like it. One of those games that aren't very friendly to rookies because you can easily do mistakes that destroy your chances to win. Especially when your companies trains rust and you've only been dealing out dividends...

In 18AL played with 5 players there was a downtime problems and game took 5,5 hours (all 18xx-newbies). People here on geek seem to recommend playing with 3 and it feels more right amount.

After playing 18AL I'm interested in trying another round of it or some other 18xx series.

Grande scoperta, siamo di fronte ad un 18XX dalla durata contenuta ma che non taglia drasticamente meccaniche comunque piacevoli. Il gioco gira molto bene, mappa abbastanza stretta ma in 4 giocatori ci si sta bene e il risultato è una partita molto godevole. Gioco che consiglio anche se print & play, la grafica e i materiali infatti non sono sublimi se non a fronte di spese folli.

It's like 1830-Lite/1830-Short/1830-Friendly. So it's not as dynamic but it's a good introduction.  I like having a 2-dimensional stock market for a short game.  I wish there were actual diesels instead of the 4D trains since they tend to put a cap on runs.

This is such an awesome game. Do I even need to play 1830? I'm not sure I really need the additional two hours for a better experience. I think I can just play this (and maybe other small 18xx games) for a long time.  I love the many ways the stock rounds influence the operating rounds and vice versa.  Also, the historical flavor is satisfying.

update, 2 years later: This is a starting good 18XX–it is the simplest and friendliest 18XX out there (i.e. not very simple or friendly if you are not used to 18xx).  Unfortunately the historical destinations make the map develop in repetitive fashion. Of Derrick's games, I like 18Mex best, then 18GA, then 18AL.  I still like 18AL, but it is down to 7 from its original 10.

RATING: 4
TRY Nov/06 (4-player): I've always been curious about these 18xx games, so I was eager to try.  Heck, I even won the game, so it's not like I couldn't figure it out.  But I was decidedly underwhelmed.

The stock market was 'ok', but didn't blow me away -- and apparently, that's the game's strong-point!  The buying & selling can obviously impact the prices & decisions, but didn't seem too exciting.  Otherwise, there was a lot of other things to do, but very regimented.  One piece of track (no option to buy a 2nd, for example) per turn, and just an optimization each round for the payouts.  The engines felt like Power Grid's power plants, with just some available until they run out (which is fine, and impacts game play).

For me, the most dissuading part was the continual route recalculations & payout determinations.  It felt like the whole game bogged down on that, and the only purchases available were engines (sometimes) and stock (sometimes).  I've played other games that do parts of all this, in a much shorter time frame, and for much more enjoyment, IMO.  YMMV.

Didn't like this game too much. Stock market is a bit refreshing subject to play with, but still, there are many better traingames out there, try them instead. Can't really see why this series is as popular as it is.

Well, at least this version had many flaws, imho! Newbie-friendliness is almost 0%, so be sure not to try this with 2+ other veteran players...

Perhaps this version plays better after you know the basic idea and system of 18xx.

[floatleft][ImageID=768337][/floatleft]My introduction to 18xx. I can already tell that I am enamored by the 18xx style of game. 18AL however seems extremely light from initial impressions. I definitely want to play a heavier 18xx. I anticipate that my rating of 18AL will drop as I explore the 18xx system of games.

The more interesting Private Co. make this a better game than 18GA although the latter is still the better intro game to the 1830 branch of the 18xx world. I learned a lot from the 1st play so I'd want to give this another go soon.

(New Decatur is only really valuable IF it can be used to get the 1st 5-train; don't count on it.)

The ability to buy and sell (trash) immediately every TURN in a Stock Round can make this a somewhat unpleasant experience. Additionally, this ploy seems too easy to do with no consequences that instead of being a decision (the forte of 18xx games) it becomes rote. Not good.

RATING: 7
A shorter version of 1830. The game is geared for 3 players. 
Liked the concept of destination token payment to encourage growth in a particular direction, without forcing.
Small cities are bonus "stops" for the trains which encourages a build to them rather than avoiding.
For theme - Birmingham starts small then becomes the powerhouse of the state.
The other difference is emphasis on building cross state routes.

The upside:
- You get an 18xx by roughly half the cost(PnP) and half the playing time.
- It's a good way to introduce gamers to the system.
- Running trains.

The downside:
- The last quarter of the game feels like you're on autopilot and wonder when you stoped making meaningful decisions;
- The quality of the game can be seriously affected by the quality of your assembled copy.
- Serious accountant exercices here.

see above, 18xx are great games. Small map with easier choices and a less agressive stock market (IIRC). Perfect to learn the game. Still, one bad move (or backstab) has implications for the rest of the game. Which makes this one is more of a race than the others. Go for the optimal line and don't let the others have theirs.

I have recently entered the third age of my investigation into 18xx now that I have some other players around who are interested in the genre.  This is a natural for us to play given the need at times for shorter, possibly easier games.  Not to mention that it is free.  

The game certainly succeeds at the goal of being relatively quick, coming in for us at around 3-4 hours.  Unfortunately, Steam over Holland holds a better place in my heart for the 3 hour 18xx game.  It also competes with the 1825 games as well.  Otherwise, the system is straighforward enough, with plenty of interesting decisions.  Were it not for the other games mentioned above, I would likely rate this a little bit higher.  Still, 7 isn't so bad. [01-01-2010]

Played over Vassal and Rails and enjoyed - now have my own copy to try and talk people into playing!
Depending on how many are playing, players can jump right in and get companies going, or with more players they may have to cooperate to get get started due to the low number of corporations available compared to other games. I think both types of play are interesting.
(I've noticed "hardcore" 18xx players don't seem to be a fan of this one, primarily saying it over-simplifies the system - however for a newbie like me this seemed just the right amount of complexity to be interesting without being overwhelming, and could be a great stepping stone to the more complex 18xx games.)

First 18xx. I feel like a better gamer for having been able to play 18xx games at least once in my life. If my group decided to play 18xx exclusively I'd be fine with that also. This one was a solid, enjoyable game to cut my teeth on. I suspect if I got to 50 plus 18xx game under my belt I'd have more discerning tastes but for now I find it hard to score one poorly because they are so impressive.

A very compact version of your standard 18xx game.  Quite enjoyable.  Everything feels ramped up to no detriment.  There certainly aren't any bells and whistles here, but it is a nice "mini-game" (and by mini, I mean it takes hours and sucks up a very long evening, rather than a whole day). It seems perfect with three. I think with four players the length of the game would be drastically abbreviated, but could possibly be too ruthless.  I wouldn't consider playing this with five. Quite solid. 

UPDATE: Screw it. I raised my rating, to the max.  I love this game.

 First playing was quite the brain-burner for all of us and we still got a few rules wrong.  I can't imagine what would have happened if we had started 18xx with one of the more complicated titles.  I can see that 18AL will become easier with more plays.  I enjoyed the game very much, because I really like Games that have multiple mini-games that intersect with each other, i.e. stock buying/selling (manipulation), rail building, train buying/selling and route running, etc.

One of my 18xx favorites so far. Very fun to play and with an excellent time of play. Privates make sense (so much more than in 1860 IMO) and I like the market. The market can be cruel enough and the game is more interesting by using it properly.
A great choice for beginners in the 18xx world mainly because of the time of play. It's real fast and fun.

Really tedious and repetitive with limited progression.  Map play is uninteresting and the stock market is really too static for my taste.  

Buy as many stock as you can, and reap the benefit every turn.  It's really hard to loose money (except with train upgrade, but they can be planned) so the winner will determined on 2 or 3 decisions made in this 4 hour monstrosity.  And don't get me started on calculating routes payout every turn.

I would play it as a computer game, but I will play Steam Baron if I want a good stock market train boardgame.

Ok as a 3-player teaching game, though I think you're better off just learning and playing 1830 itself (especially if you have four players).

Fundamentally, I don't think the 1830 branch of 18xx (loot your first company to set up your second one) lends itself well to smaller games.  Players are virtually forced into a certain pattern of development and the lack of company variety means that play becomes extremely stereotyped.

Further, these games don't support more than 3 players in practice, since each player really needs two companies to be competitive.

Between 18AL, 18GA, or 18Mex, go for 18Mex.

My first game of 18xx series, so I'll be gently with my rating. 

Making money with companies is always fun, so overall I liked the economical aspects. There's ton of excessive 'baggage' (in my mind) even in this 18xx version which should be gently for newcomers. I wouldn't mind to play a game with less baggage and more streamlined. There must be way to make this clearer, more elegant, more streamlined, withouth losing the main core? I mean running a Excel-calculation at the end of the game is just dumn, isn't it?

But I'm not really sure do 18xx fans really want any streamlining. Let me take an example: evaluating the track building (where to build your track, what company has the best prospects etc) is really hard for a newbie. Yet I suspect that not all of the 18xx players would want to make this too clear, as learning to read the obscurdities of the map is part of the process? I have understood listening what others talk that part of the fun is to learn all the tricks and to get better (beat the newbies).

Well, despite all this, I was actually able to win my first game! OK, I got a bit support in some tough spots from the others (more experienced) players, but still :)

One play of this game (second game of 18XX genre). There were four newbies (combined 2 plays of 18XX before) and we managed to finish the game in 5 hours.

I have played this game about 8 times and have really enjoyed it. The best games have been with four people which with six companied makes the game less symmetrical and encourages more adventurous play. I think it has been an excellent introduction to 18xx.

However, I have got to the point with it where I am starting to see its limitations. Well, to be precise I can't see in it quite what others describe in 18xx games such as 1830 and 1856 - the cut throat manipulation of the stock market - and I have read this of 18AL.

I have many 18xx titles but have just acquired the reprint of 1830 so I think this will be the next one to play and I'm about ready for it I think...

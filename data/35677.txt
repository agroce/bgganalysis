I find it hard to say whether I like this better than it's sister game Agricola. Both play very differently, of course, but both require quite a bit of thought to do well at. And the beauty of them both is that having thought it through for one game, the next game will de different either because, the buildings (or cards) are different or because you choose to adopt a different strategy. One of those games that really deserves repeated plays that the "Eurogame ethic" really doesn't allow.

The more I play this the less I like it.  The theme is starting to bug me (so ... am I the mayor of Le Havre?  Who the hell is my work crew and why do they only work for food?  Why are all these cattle just sitting on the dock and why aren't they eating all of the grain right next to them?), and the dominance of the build-steel-ship-steel strategy is making for less and less interesting games without a lot of room to maneuver.  I wish the special buildings were goofier.

RATING: N/A
To me Le Havre is extremely underrated. I think this is way better than Agricola. There is always something cool and productive you can do on your turn. You can play vastly different from game to game because of the way the buildings are ordered randomly. You can also shoot for points in multiple ways. You could collect a bunch of buildings for points, you could build lots of ships, you could buy a few ships and ship lots of goods, you could make lots of high value goods and only ship small amounts of them, and I'm sure there are more ways to get points that I'm forgetting. There is a decent amount of special buildings to choose from and I've barely seen any of them yet. This is one of the first games I ever bought and it's still great.

Worker placement game (yet again!), where you want to grab resources, and convert these resources into points (buildings + ships).

This game definitely shows signs of its predecessors (Agricola, Caylus, etc), but despite not being terribly original, and being overly long, it has something about it that gets it to the table regularly (it definitely helps that my wife really likes it).

Essentially, it's a 1-5 player game, where depending on the number of players, there is a set number of rounds (I usually play 3-players, and I think that's 18 rounds), during which time, you "fill the board" with varying resources, then choose to: 1)grab a resource pile, OR 2)build a building or ship.  Also at any time, you can buy and/or sell buildings.  The goal is to get the most points, and money also equals points.  At the end of each round, you have to pay food, similar to Agricola, and if you can't meet the food requirements (which can also be paid with money), you get loan(s), similar to beggar cards.  The main difference here is that it's not a big deal to get loans and paying off your food isn't as draining as it is in Agricola (not that it's easy).

You only get 1 worker to place, so you always want to do more than you can do on a given turn, and you are often torn between grabbing that huge pile of wood/clay/money etc. or building that valuable building.  Also, similar to Caylus, you use your own buildings for free, but have to pay (food and/or money) when you use other players or the towns buildings (usually).  All in all, not as good as Agricola, but still very solid- oddly enough a couple of friends like this better than Agricola, and my wife seems to want to play this as much as Agricola right now.  Seems like it scales well, BUT it's definitely a long game, which might make it prohibitive to play 5 player games (have only played 2-4 players so far).  Thanks again for making another solid gamer's game Uwe, looking forward to your next game(s)!.

151117 this is another need to revisit classic, but only one step above Goa.

130929 Yup as time goes by I've completely lost interest in these types of heavier Uwe games.  And yes I'd play Agricola over Le Havre solely due to theme.  They are both great games, but not for me.

120909 Just not my type of game.  Interesting enough but these resource conversion specials just don't do it for me.  I see why its rated so highly, but I may take agricola over this just based on the theme.

This is a newcomer, having only hit the tables a few times. Too deep for the kids -- INITIALLY. This will change, as they are asking a million questions. They certainly pick things up fast. It's possible this will rate higher, but for now it's an 8... and solidly there. Nice game, if a little on the long side.

UPDATE: The nine year-old played through about half of the two player game (not the short version). He loved it. This will see table-time again.

UPDATE 2: Le Havre and Agricola are two of our family's favorite games.

UPDATE 3: My only gripe with Le Havre is that it's LONG with more than... one. Still, a wonderful game.

Only played this once, but had a really good time with it.  Description that I heard on a podcast that struck a chord with me was that it's similar to Agricola in that you're building you're engine, but you actually get the engine fully running for a few turns instead of it just ending.

Para mi, lo mejor de Rosenberg, un excelente juego de gestión, con un elemento de presión fuerte y con multitud de opciones para lograr la victoria, de explicación sencilla y buena duración. Es de ensalzar el gran trabajo que realizó Uwe para lograr una escalabilidad casi perfecta, cuyo único escollo para 4-5 jugadores es que la duración se dispara (sobre todo en la versión completa)

Learned with one experienced player and 3 newbies including myself. Not a good 4 player game; too long; why doesn't interest go up with more loans; why does the food requirement increase when you only ever have one worker. Apples and oranges - I prefer farming in Agricola to a dock in Le Havre.

I should give it another try, but our group is usually 4+.

I was expecting this to be pretty dry, which is rather disappointing for a harbour! My rating shows how much I enjoyed the game, although having the 5 player long version of the game as my first outiing was a baptism of fire. Good mechanics and decision taking, with a point taken off the rating for the length of the five player game. Hopefully will try it 2 or 3 player soon to see how it feels at the other end. Highly recommended.

I rate "Agricola" above all other games and love "At the Gates of Loyang" almost as much, but have waited many months for the opportunity to try "Le Havre". I am not ready to hold it in quite the same esteem as the other games of the trilogy, and I'm not sure why. I think it is the lack of tactile components that puts me off. It has the ingenious intertwining actions of "Agricola" with the same lovely artwork, but some of the heart feels like it is missing. That said, this is head and shoulders above most engine-builders and the sheer wealth of options is admirable, with balanced and clever interplay. I think with more plays I could learn to love it, but it's got some very impressive relatives to compete with.

2010-04-14 (rating 8):

A very interesting game. Only minimal randomness just to assure every game is different. Very mathy especially with smaller number of players.

Rather small interaction between players in my opinion. This is somewhat a drawback for me since I like interaction between players. On the other hand playable in only 1 person and quite interesting int this form (this is how I played most of the games).

There is also a computer version (Java application) available here on BGG.

It's just so stinking quick-moving. Le Havre is simple in design, but rewarding in practice. You're never afraid of making a bad move because you're always able to get something good out of it. That's not to say that there aren't bad moves, but just that the pressure felt in this game is a fun type of pressure. There's a big build to this game as everybody is creating their empire of businesses and ships. The economy starts to expand and by the end of the game you're surprising yourself with how many points you actually earned and with the awesome layout of cards in front of you.

4 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Great theme of fish and shipyard, with a simple core set of rules. Not many high-level paths to win, but so many paths to choose from in the beginning to get to the narrowing victory points. I enjoyed the visibility of all the cards to help plan ahead.

DISLIKE: The small tiles can be a little fiddly. it's difficult to distinguish between upgraded/not upgraded from across the table, but homemade player cards help. The game is very long, even with 3 players.

OVERALL: Great game! This was a game that really hooked me onto worker placement. The short game (2.5h for 4 players) is a great way to introduce the game, but feels like it ends too soon. The self-made player mats help keep the chits in order.

While playing I was struggling the whole game to feed my workers and kept having to take loans.  I was sure I was in dead last, yet when we counted points, I had won somehow.  Need to play again to get a clearer opinion about it.  Many options and ways to score points.  Definitely a game that rewards repeated plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
For me, this is a solid improvement over Agricola. It plays very smoothly and feels well edited and play tested. The rule set is straight forward - all the action and interest are found on the building cards. The theme carries the game and aids to understanding effective play - e.g. wheat is turned into bread and can be used as food or perhaps sold for profit. The only strike I have against it is the time it takes to play. A 4-player affair easily takes over 3 hours - but the short version can get done in about 2. It never feels slow or dull or repetitive - so the time does move by without complaint. Still, at this point, it's one of my favorite games!

Juego profundo de gestión de recursos, con unas mecánica relacionadas con el Agrícola pero con todavía más opciones, muy abrumador al principio, y todavía más calculador, de gestión más fría. Probado en una partida a 3, a espera de más, para valorarlo mejor. 

Con más partidas, mejora muchísimo el asunto, es un juegazo de gestión de recursos! En mi opinión es bastante mejor que el Agrícola y algo mejor por la rejugabilidad comparado con el Ora el Labora que me gusta mucho.

A hard game that gets even tougher with increasing player numbers. Better than Agricola, because in this game, you feel like you have a lot of great choices whereas in Agricola you try to figure out which choice is the least bad. However still not worth a 10... maybe lacks some theme and immersion.

Update October/2010:
9 -> 10
Le Havre is simply the best resource management game out there. Valid strategies a numerous and the game always takes a new course.

To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones. This is especially true for Le Havre, which I basically recommend only for max 3 players, and still you should play the shortened version unless every one was familiar with the game. If I only had more space to store my games...


2016-10-26
The absolutely best thing about Le Havre is the positive atmosphere around the game. You seem to have an endless number of good alternatives to choose from. But this does not mean that your choices are insignificant or anything. Actually they are far from it. Everything requires careful planning still. You are usually better off if you are following a longer term plan in your game. However, sometimes it is just too tempting to deviate from the path you have planned to take. Thus you are facing many interesting decisions throughout the game.

If there is something to criticise about Le Havre, it would come down to two things. First one is the length. I basically recommend the game for 2-3 players only and still you should consider playing the shortened version. Thankfully the short game delivers almost the same experience as the full game. The second negative that the special buildings in the full game do not seem to have big enough of an impact to justify doubled play time over the shortened game. The special buildings are just too situational often requiring a certain resource generation infrastructure to be up and running before you can benefit from the them. And preparing the infra may be difficult because you do not know which buildings will be available. Thus in most games you just ignore them all together.

So, a full game of Le Havre is a bit long but the shortened game is golden.

Very interesting game. Has some of the Agricola flavor, but I think it better than its predecessor. Clearly has a good game arc, nad has some copetition and conflict between the players, but without the action "starvation" that Agricola can have. I always felt I could do something productive.

I enjoyed it a lot, as both a 4 player and a 2 player.

I like Agricola but Le Havre is so much better in many aspects. It feels more economic than Agricola is, we have raw materials (that can be upgraded to other materials) that we have to produce, sell, etc. The components are ok but the ideas in the game really make a wonderful experience out of it.

Really went off this game.

I absolutely love the mechanics and the feeling of construction as time goes on.

But I absolutely hate hate hate the feeding mechanic - I play games to have fun, not to be punished by the unrelenting system. This is also the reason I'm lukewarm on Agricola. It just feels like a cheap mechanic.

I also loathe that the same sets of cards come out in the same order every time. This is where Agricola excels, but Le Havre sucks.

Another win on the heavy strategy side for designer Uwe Rosenberg.  After numerous plays, I'm not sure that I would still reach for this one when Uwe's later masterpiece, [I]Ora et Labora[/I] is available to play, but this still feels different enough from [I]Ora[/I] to warrant keeping both.    

This doesn't seem to have as many varied paths to victory as other Rosenberg titles, and is much more susceptible to an aggressive starvation-type strategy (here, it involves taking numerous loans given that interest is capped at one franc per round regardless of the number of loans).  Still a solid entry, if perhaps not quite up to [I]Agricola[/I] and surpassed by some of Uwe's later titles as well.  I'm not sure the aggressive loan strategy will necessarily win every time, but I have found that the aggressive loan player emerging victorious tends to cause a certain amount of angst among other members of my playing group.

I think Le Havre is a wonderful game.  It seems complex and busy with bits but is really quite simple.  The whole game can be broken down into two actions...take resources or use a building.   The depth and complexity comes from understanding the interactions of the buildings and planning ahead.  The first play may seem a bit daunting becaue you are still learning the system but after that it realy clicks.  By my second game I had a very good grasp on the flow of the game aned was eagerly planning my strategy.  It allows for a lot of variety on how you attain victory.  Being a Rosenberg game it does have a similar feel to Agricola but is quite different.  In Agricola, it seems that unless you have a perfect hand the only way to win is through generalization of your farm.  I don't have as many plays of Le Havre yet but it feels like there are many more ways to victory (of course there are common elements everyone must follow).

Waiting to find players who know it better, seems too easy for experienced players to win.

Edit: gave up waiting with my copy.

The game presents a big problem for me, there appear to be multiple paths to victory but different strategies have different inherent values which make some clearly better than others, but only if you notice it. I find it very one-dimensional if people have to ignore many of the differing paths to focus on the most lucrative.

I'm sure there are players that play faster but on average for four players we've been at 3 1/2 to 4 hours. I feel this game is worth it though it may not hit the take as often due to that time sink. I highly recommend you try before you buy. This game is actually fun to play solo as well.

An interesting game of worker placement and building/ship construction.  Similar to [GAMEID=31260] in a few respects (e.g., food requirement, action selection, blocking other players), but more economic since it includes buying/selling and a lot of goods conversion (upgrading).

I like it.  It feels tighter in some ways, potentially harsher than [GAMEID=31260] but more flexible.  Need additional plays to really pin it down.  Game length is an issue, though it should become less prohibitive with experienced players.  Rating may improve with additional plays.

Rating bumped from 7 to 8 (4/27/09).  The more I play this, the more I want to play it.  My first 4 plays have been of the shorter variety (a 3-p, two solo's & a 4-p).  I'm liking it more and more, appreciating the different strategies or, at the very least, the different directions.  I suspect this one will shine even more in the longer variety with the special buildings.

Rating bumped from 8 to 9 (5/08/09).  I like this one [i]much[/i] better than [GAMEID=31260].  There is a definite progression to the game due to the expanding "tech tree" and increasing number of options as buildings are constructed.  There are a few different strategies to consider.  Food, and entry fees, can become a severe limiting factor, but there are a few ways to anticipate this and plan accordingly.  The biggest downsides are game length and having to use the short version for intro games.

Further comments (5/29/09).  The long game is *MUCH* better than the short game.  There's a greater sense of development and resources in the early portion become more critical.  In addition, the special buildings make the game more diverse and differentiated among plays.

That's another interesting thing -- the game can vary a lot among plays, and not just from player choices.  Order and arrangement of the building piles, order of the 7 turn supply markers, the special buildings at work -- these all combine to produce very different, diverse games.  I want to play more long games.  I am [i]really[/i] enjoying this game!  (It's better than [gameid=31260]!  *gasp*)

More comments (6/29/09):  The long game is the only/best way to go.  I'm now teaching others with the long game.  Much better than the short game.  The special buildings have the potential for dictating, or at least suggesting, new avenues to pursue.  While shipping & building are the two dominant strategies, there are so many flavors to pursue and options to consider that I'm not losing interest at all.

Plano-type boxes are a must for short setup time.  Check out the sewing section at your local craft store for small boxes.

Negatives:  Play time is a bit long for the game.  Fair bit of downtime on other players' turns.  Don't play with the AP-inclined.  Relatively steep learning curve -- lots to learn, assimilate and assess.

Still, I really like this one and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Additional comments (7/08/09):  Teaching this game is difficult.  There's a lot to cover and new players' eyes will likely glaze over at the 5 or 10 min. mark.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done about that.  In addition, experienced players will have a dramatic advantage over new players.  There's a distinct learning curve that some people may not traverse or may not be willing to traverse.  I think there's a great game on the other side, but not all will agree or be willing to play this one again.

I love how the rules are really simple but the game play is deep. On the other hand it should last at least two times shorter. On top of that last turns just overflows with resources and points counting which makes it even longer. Last but not least replayability seem quiete low for such a long game as number of good strategies is very low.

Nach mehreren Spielen in verschiedenen Besetzungen kann ich nur sagen, dass Le Havre eines meiner Lieblingsspiele ist. Wiederspielbarkeit ist durch die immer wieder unterschiedliche Reihenfolge der Ressourcen gegeben, und durch die drei Baustellen-Stapel, die in immer wieder anderer Reihenfolge Gebäude zur Verfügung stellen.
Eigentlich kanppe Ressource ist die "Aktion", die man vor Allem mit vielen Mitspielern nur 1-2x pro Runde hat.

Another all-time favorite game. This game is never the same game twice, which is a awesome element as far as I am concerned. Sometimes the Wharf card comes out early allowing you to build wooden ships faster, sometimes it comes out early, but the brick works card is buried deep, so you can not modernize any ships and are stuck only being able to build wooden ships until the brick works is finally put into play.

Juego complejo de gestión de recursos. Conocido como el sucesor de Agrícola, realmente tiene poco que ver con este. Es un juego largo, con un despliegue complicado, hay que andar eligiendo cartas dependiendo del número de jugadores y del modo de juego.
Una vez metido en harina el juego es divertido y profundo, aunque es cierto que hasta que no se conocen los diferentes edificios, se va un poco a ciegas. 
Para muchos es de los mejores juegos de gestión de recursos, yo creo que no es la panacea pero no está nada mal jugado con la gente adecuada.

RATING: 9
Well, three plays into this one and I can see so much potential. I think it is mechanically easier than Agricola to understand, which I like; however, the options available in this game increase at a much faster rate than Agricola.

Unlike Agricola where you want more actions, Le Havre has you wishing for more turns. Sure the game is longer than Agricola, but by the end of it we always wanted to a few more rounds so that we could accomplish what we wanted to accomplish. Great theme and I can definitely see this game surpassing El Grande in my "Always Want To Play It" category. Bonus points for offering a "short version" for those times when the full game isn't possible.

RATING: 7
Le Havre is in my opinion superior to Agricola. Yes it is a worker placement game where you have only one worker, but the game makes up with it with the sheer number of choices you can make. And those grow the longer you play! Amazing depth of strategy and the ability for the game to change everytime you play. Really need to have your thinking cap on for this one. Really shines in the 3 to 4 player range and with the special buildings. It is a bit long though.

I prefer this game over Agricola and to some extents to Puerto Rico too. Le Havre involves more planning over time and thus a much more complete strategic view of the game in its entirety from beginning to end. I love the variety of actions a player can perform and the multiple combinations of actions. The fact that one player's cards are playable by the opponents as well makes the game more balanced and complex. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I quite like this design; the tension has a different flavour to that of Agricola's, and the decision spaces feel more like you're medium-long term planning. Tactical is absolutely not the way to play this game. 

That said, I feel like the normal game can outstay its welcome, especially at 3 players. For two players who know the system, the normal game might play well, but for any other player counts or for newbies, I'd go the short game each time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Le havre is like Agricola, except without the good parts and the bad parts made worse. The game is not as tight as agricola. It requires a huge investment in terms of getting familiarized with the cards and card combinations. The game is wayyy slower than Agricola because you have only one worker. The markets are horrendously incomplete, imagine playing settlers of catan except without the inter player trade, so if you wanted an ore you pretty much have to wait till you mine one or exchange four for one.  There isn't any reason at all for me to play Le Havre when I can play Agricola. Le Havre is just an exceedingly poor immitation of the original Agricola.

It's very different worker placement than Agricola/Caverna, but there are some similar elements. The game takes a while to play and even longer to explain/comprehend, but once it clicks for you there's a lot you can do.  It's held back some for me because you can only do so much to manipulate your opponent or stop them if they get an engine going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The buildings are what make it for me (with some pseudo-randomized availability each game), and the 'worker placement' is just different enough from what I've seen elsewhere that it feels unique. 

The design is pretty satisfying, but there can also be some strong frustration in feeling backed into a corner without a good option for what to do. The funkiness of navigating a decent plan in Le Havre can occasionally leave me a little annoyed. Other times, it makes the game exciting. So it can go both ways.

Holy hell, this game took my head off. Amazing. Will probably be a 10, one day.

Edit: Nope, not a 10. Le Havre dropped from a 9 to 7.5 due to lack of play, and/or enthusiasm to play. The game is nearly perfect, but sullied by the inclusion of:

1. A singular dominant victory path (coal/steel). 

2. Various dead-end paths (grain/leather).  

Shame, as the core game is pretty fantastic.

1-5(3)

UPDATE: With three it's great. Loans come into play much more readily (and to great effect) and there is genuine contention over the different strategies. Two to three actions per round feels about right and the game becomes a really rich experience. Le Havre is very much a winner.

--------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: Played again and I really enjoyed it.  It's got a different sort of tension than Agricola, but it's a constructive sort.  Only played with 2p and want to get more involved (impossible as that tends to be).

--------------------------------------------------------

I'll play this any time, but it lacks the tension of Agricola (in providing food).  There are a lot of cool mechanics at play here, but I never really get a feeling of where I'm at in the game, and some buildings just don't seem like they'd fit in.  I'll need to play more to get a better feeling for this.

Just played this at Kublacon with Lyman & friends.  Very similar to Agricola but a lot more screw-you actions.  We played the full 5 players games and I was the only newbie.  Fairly easy to understand.  This time lot of interaction since you may have to use opponent owned property to do something.  More of a brain-burner than Agricola since you may have to change your strategy if someone else blocks it by their actions.
Picked a copy from Game Kastle booth at Kublacon 2009 for $70.

One play (of basic 4player). Was not super impressed. Tableau building was fine, but I really don't like euro's that feel so limited. Only having two (or even one!) action a round, combined with the ever increasing need to feed your people, just meant the game felt too limited and stressful. I did like the choosing of going to a building or taking a stack; that was a nice decision point.

RATING: 7
I only played the short version, but it took more than three hours to play, which is clearly to much for what it offers.

Basically I liked this game, but it can happen that you lose the game only because you can't bring your cows to the butcher ... one of your opponents keeps it occupied turn after turn.

On the other hand it is quite a clean game, not filled with fuzzy mechanics as in many other eurogames.

RATING: 9
Excellent resource management euro game. Lots of interesting choices for the players. You have to construct buildings, take care of feeding your people, collect goods, built ships and 'manipulate' your resources. Many strategic paths to follow and it seems that there is always a back-up plan. Money can be tight. The rules are very easy to teach, gameplay is easy at first but things get more serious turn after turn.  Real brain-burner, love it. The special buildings provide some welcomed variety.

Very enjoyable game.

The only Uwe Rosenberg title I have played so far that did not grab me. The game was very good but didn't go far enough for me. One of my favorite concepts in worker placement games, is the notion of player owned spaces, and to my recollection this was the first place I saw it. The problem was that the cost of using spaces was not significant enough for me. I wanted it to be a very tough decision whether using some one else's space was worth the benefit to them and it never was.

The first play where I did not really know what I was doing was enjoyable enough. It is a good mixture of deciding what to do now, short term and long term and balancing resources with money, building use and victory points. BUT it is far too long and the game would undoubtedly be better with 4 or 5 less turns per player and 30 minutes less game times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Update: It's not just the frustration factor. I really feel the cleverness of this game is overwhelmingly locked in to how the system operates, as opposed to any moves or choices players can make. However I do quite like playing it as long as it moves at a fair pace - which means the shorter game and never five player.

One action!?! I've waited 15 mins for one measly action!?! 

I don't know; it is intriguing, but ultimately I think it will turn out for me to be one of those games where the built-in frustration factor outweighs the pleasure from seeing my position (slowly) develop, and I don't care much for that level of frustration.

Unlike Agricola the options get wider as you play.  There's a fair bit of flexibility with the shorter game variant too.  So far each game ends with me feeling I could have played that a whole lot better.

Le Havre is a magnificent game, because it is great in its simplicity. You only have one worker, so it's not very difficult to learn, but you really have to think ahead.

I find far superior to Agricola in every way. I never thought i'd like it before i played it. It feels far smoother than agricola and it is far less random and more strategic due to the absence of hidden cards that only one player can exploit. The best thing is the lack of point scoring for generalising as in agricola. Here you can specialise all the way and any way you want. 

The only problems i found in the design are the terrific dependence on everyone playing correctly and the massive AP it induces.

RATING: 6
May 2011:  Complex and headache inducing.  Admirable design and mechanics, but for me, it just leaves me slightly cold thematically. Building buildings and ships once again. Sigh.

August 2013:  After playing this a second time, how I feel about this game is a bit of a mystery to me.  Clearly, it is well-designed and seemingly bursting with thematic elements like coal, iron, fish, cattle, ships and buildings that affect these elements in logical ways.  

Yet, surprisingly, this game leaves me feeling so cold and detached thematically.  I really feel like I am merely playing a grinding, repetitive series of mechanics and resource conversions to merely create victory points.  Additionally, I feel very little interaction or competition with the other players.  After two plays, I simply have zero desire to play this game again, so I have to downgrade it to a 6.  Very respectable design, but just can't fake any interest in it.

The second in the Harvest Trilogy and an awesome game in its own right.  The problem with getting this one to the table is its length.  If it weren't for that, I'd prefer it over Agricola.  Solo play is fantastic despite not having a set goal for each play.  Definately a brain-burner as by the midpoint of the game, the decisions present are quite daunting!

A monster of a game.  Tough choices, long playtime; a very elegant brain burner.  Was more captivated with this when I first got into gaming, but there are a lot of other games out there which offer the same strategic depth with either quicker playtime and/or more fun.  As a side note I prefer Agricola to this.

Yes. There are a lot of components. A LOT! And yes the set up time can be up there with Arkham Horror. But this is a good game. With each round you feel as though you are building up your own industry (sometimes standing on your friend's shoulders to do it). It also plays quick and there is always something you can do. Did you opponent take the franks you wanted to build that Smokehouse? Fine. Just use his slaughterhouse to make some meat and sell that next turn. You're never blocked out in this game. And if you decide not to pursue some aspect of the industry you aren't penalized for it. By the time you are finished with this game you really feel like you've built something.

Yes: This is a very good game. It is simple to explain has many paths to victory. Clever, thinky and deep.
No: This game is not for me unfortunately. Something just did not click. I could feed people (just) but had no idea how to get things going points wise.

There are almost too many options to keep track of which my brain just seemed incapable of doing.

I have grown tired of multiplayer get resource, build engine, maintain your population type games.

RATING: 6
feels like a more thematic power grid gone right to me.  first play was the full game with 4P and despite some longish turns we still pulled it off in 150 minutes.  short game with 3 was better on time and didn't seem to sacrifice much of the game, but another 3P short took forever.  somewhat interested in 2P but it might be just a bit too action dense, so i'm thinking the sweet spot is with 3.  i'm not really reminded of either agricola or caylus as i play it, and i don't like it as much as either.  it works pretty well, i think, i just don't find it very fun.  and fwiw all our games seem to come down to coke.

RATING: 8.5
Le Havre is clearly a relative of Agricola's. It's got worker placement, slowly growing pots of resources, resources that change values over time, and an ever-increasing urgency to supply food, food, more food! For some reason, though, Le Havre scratches an itch for me that Agricola doesn't quite. I've only played twice, and I'm fully willing to admit that this may change with more plays, but I think the game is a winner.

Played one short solo game (87 points) and one full two-player game (which ended in a tie, 176 vs. 176).

Bought direct from Lookout Games; own 6 of 8 promo special buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I rate this game as a 10 for the two player and possibly three player game. The solo version is also a nice game, but your only goal is to push your score beyond your previous highest score, which is also nice but lacks a bit of tension. As a four player game it is too long and you feel like you get to do much less throughout the game (eventhough there are a few more rounds) hence I would not recommend this game with more than three players.

RATING: 7
I like this game, it has a lot of the good elements from both Caylus and Agricola, but it misses out on a crucial element present in both of them: Variable turn ordering! The game needs a building that can manipulate turn order, or some sort of offer that does the same. Without this, the game is pulled back into the realm of Puerto Rico, where even the most skillful players can lose just because of turn order. I definitely prefer the longer game to the shorter (more brutal), and both always feel a bit too long; just something not quite tuned and perfected about the game, beyond the turn order issue. Will definitely play, but it's missing out on what could make the game a 10 in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems like a decent game, but it's very close to a multiplayer solitary game. It's also very much a "buy some buildings, sell your stuff" kind of game, much like Puerto Rico. It's a pretty good game in its own right. However, I don't think it adds a great deal new to that genre.

Feels more streamlined than Agricola, which I thought made it better than Agricola at first, but after a couple more plays I think it lacks Agricola's spark. I still think it is a very good game. Plays in less than two hours with two, which is about right. However, I think it is more interesting, though also longer, with three. Unfortunately, the additional hour also makes it overstay its welcome for me.

An excellent Uwe Rosenberg, and possibly my favorite since I wasn't really feeling Caverna due to it not exploring its theme nearly enough for what I expected. Anyway, in this game you're buying goods in a harbor town, feeding your boat-people, and scoring resources. The individual building powers are interesting, the gameplay solid and there's just a lot to think about. Great Euro.

RATING: 9
Great game, Looking forward to it being available in the US.  You can tell the similarities to Agricola, but different enough that I feel that I need both.  Like Agricola, it has a very intuitive feel to it.

Dryer, and not as rich thematically as Agricola.  On the other hand you have a wider range of actions available.  Also seems to scale well from 2-4 players.

Plays well solo, which is how I play it mostly.

RATING: 7
Seemed like a much fiddlier Agricola. For ex: instead of just 'food' there's three or so different food resources each with front and a back side that need to be kept straight.

This game is quite long but I like meaty eurogames that works well on 2. The downside is the setup time but since a game lasts 2-4 hours it's not that bad. The components are a bit fiddly since the resources have upgraded versions on the back but quite convenient at the same time, and way better then to double them. The game have many brilliant mechanics that works really well together. I like it that the game have instructions printed on both board and cards, you don't have to refer to the rules to set it up every time. It is Caylus meets Agricola, and the result seems better then both.

RATING: 7.9
With 2-3 players, this game is significantly less brutal than Agricola while having a lot of the same sort of mechanics. (With 4 players, it gets quite a bit more brutal, and the low number of actions each round starts to feel frustrating.) The game feels quite different with different number of players, due to more buildings being available depending on number of players. I'm going back and forth on my fear of the game starting to feel too scripted soon; will let to have experience tell.
I think I prefer the short game over the full game, as the full game lasts significantly longer, without significantly deeper gameplay. Unfortunately the short game doesn't get the benefit of the variation in the special buildings...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
EDIT: Downgraded to 7,  as I think the game is simply too long for the fun I get.  And that's only with 2 players - I'm scared to try it with more!

Still working on the shortened version (and this is quite long enough for me,  so far).  Good game in that there is always too much going on (or rather too much available,  and me not benefiting from it). It'll take a few turns to get used to the options on offer, and to take best advantage of them - in the first game we didn't get to ship anything, nor did we produce steel.  Fixed both of those in the second game, but still didn't build enough ships or do enough shipping.  Work in progress, and looking forward to more games.

RATING: 9
A wonderful Uwe Rosenberg resource management/conversion game with multiple avenues of victory. If I had to distinguish it from his other titles, I would say this game feel quite relaxing and forgiving. Each turn, you always seem to have plenty of good options. And while other players can "block" specific buildings, it tends to only create inefficiencies rather than dictate the outcome of the game. 

It's a very good game and one that euro/Rosenberg-fans should check out. 

[Update after 12 plays]: After a dozen plays, I no longer find this game relaxing and/or forgiving. What changed? Essentially, I got better at valuing the decisions in the game. Like many games, Le Havre is about picking the most advantageous path; But unlike many games, the valuations of those paths are constantly in flux and dictated by other players decisions. And that is where the skill lies. Often pile of goods will lure you into a particular action and it will be a red-herring... something you won't have enough time to convert to money. But other times, you may get fixated on a particular path and ignore lucrative opportunities, which may be taken by your opponent instead.

I simply can't get enough of this game and still, after a dozen plays, nothing seems obvious, repetitive, or boring. My only hesitation with this game is playing it with higher player counts because of AP. But with 2-3 players, it is wonderful.

RATING: 7
Was surprised how much I enjoyed this one - I really don't like Agricola and At the Gates of Loyang was okay - but this was relatively easily to understand and played at brisk pace. I suspect is because the worker placement is so restively it's not hard to identify what are you probable best moves. The regular food upkeep costs seemed a bit too harsh for me, especially at the end - but that could an artifact of misplaying the harbour cards.

One problem: the game seems a bit too quick with the 'fast' variant, but seems hideously long with the 'full' variant.

Az első játék utáni benyomásom röviden: nagyon jó, de nagyon hosszú:) Bevezetésként a rövidített két személyessel játszottam (fejenként 28-szor kerültünk sorra), a tiszta játékidő 3 és fél óra volt, pedig csak 18 épület van ebben a variánsban, a teljes 5 fősben van vagy 40, és ott is 28-szor kerül mindenki sorra, de ott 5-en:) Biztos pörgősebb a játék némi kártyaismerettel, mi is a vége felé kezdtünk belejönni. De ez egyben azt is jelenti, hogy egy profi Le Havre-s ellen egy kezdőnek esélye sincs szerintem... A játékszabály nem bonyolult, negyed óra, de komplex döntéseket kell hozni, már ez az egyszerűsített változat is bonyolultabbnak tűnt, mint az Agricola, de személy szerint nekem jobban is tetszett. Sokan panaszkodnak a nyelvfüggőségre, pedig szerintem az ikonok sokat segítenek. Mély, jól letesztelt játékról van szó, mely a szerző bevallása szerint a Caylusból és az Agricolából építkezik, nálam élményre a kettő közt foglal helyet. Rosenberg talán legjobb játéka, de egy 5 fős teljes játéknak csak úgy ülnék neki, ha lélekben felkészültem a hosszára:) A kedvencem valószínűleg nem lesz, de top10-re még esélyes:)

From reading comments:
A deep game with no luck but with a random setup of building that provides re-playability.  Rewards specialization, which Agricola does not.  People can use others' buildings with a fee, like Caylus.  Worker placement mechanic.  Buildings have a lot of text and special things that they do for end game VPs and midgame perks, like Puerto Rico.  The game is on the long side.  Learning curve is steep.  Don't play with 5 people.

Conclusion: [b]Try before Buy[/b]. I already have Agricola so I don't need to go rush out to purchase this game.  

Dec-26-2008
First game.  The game is pretty long.  Excluding the rules, the game lasted 3 hours with 1 experienced player and 3 newbies.  The game is certainly harder than Agricola since there are a lot more resources and buildings that can be used.  Because of this you have much more things to consider and decide if using those buildings and/or taking those resources will pay off.  Just like in Agricola actions is the most important resource and maximizing them is key.  Do NOT play this game with AP prone people as both of you will be frustrated.  The game is actually pretty simple to play but to play well is really hard.  The theme is decent, building up the dock/city of Le Havre.  We played it twice and felt like I was dabbling in everything.  I would like to play next time and see if I can specialize on something and still do well.  Even though the game is pretty long, I am intrigued enough to explore the game.  Unfortunately, my wife did not enjoy the game as much and said that it was overwhelming for her.  Even if I end up liking the game a lot, I don't think I'd get the game until she likes it; thus the rating.

A great economic game with multiple ways to win.  The setup of the board ensures no game will ever play the same.  Balancing food and resources is key to this game. You always want the track to be one space longer.

This or Power Grid as my favorite?  I would be torn.  I think Le Havre for 2, 3 could be either one, and Power Grid for 4.

Wonderful game of "empire" building. Take, make, bake, sell, buy, build, feed. So many things to do but you can only do ONE thing at a time. But when to do what ??
"empire" in this case is a commercial empire the only target is to make the most money...elegance & finesse are not essential...just lots of money.

The second game in the Rosenberg's "Harvest Trilogy" is another wonderful resource management masterpiece. When you breed Caylus with Agricola, you cannot be disappointed with the result!
But while Le Havre has some traits of its parents, is also quite different from them.
Where Agricola is a game of scarcity, Le Havre is about abundance. If Agricola forces to do a little of everything, Le Havre needs specialization. While the number of different choices is quite constant in a game of Caylus, the range of possibilities in Le Havre grows steadily during the course of the game.
A truly wonderful game by the genius of Uwe Rosenberg.

good economic game that is a bit long, and not really innovative in any way. I felt a little like I've done this before already, but I would gladly play more.

[edit] second play, still fast start rules, and suddenly this felt a lot more strategic when you have some idea what the buildings do

[edit...3] loans are there to be taken, no matter what the rulebook suggests. avoid them and you lose. begining rounds of the game are centered around marketplace, a pity you can't try different things from get go.

I like this game quite a bit, but am very surprised it has such a widespread appeal, what with downtime and game length..

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This is an economic game with a simple theme that doesn't seem to stick to the game. You purchase buildings, collect goods, convert them, and ship them for victory points. Of all the "convert resources to other resources" economic games, this is the best of the bunch. Random building orders and resource orders make the game highly replayable.

RATING: 9
Again, Uwe Rosenberg has a created a beautiful, exciting and complex game that can be played several times without becoming bored. I think there are several ways that lead to victory so it stays daring for a long time. the only minor point at this moment is the duration of the game.

I don't think I've managed to play a complete game of this yet, maybe once. I like building and economy, which this has, but I'm not crazy about harvests (like in Agricola) - it doesn't really fit in with the theme of the game; maybe if it was changed to "Pay your dock workers" instead of having to feed them. I enjoy it but don't play often due to the lengthy playing time required.

RATING: 8.5
This fixes what my wife didn't like about Agricola, while still providing tense, strategic game play. It does play longer than Agricola, but doesn't feel nearly as ponderous as Fields of Arle. The build up to the last few rounds where your engine spits out victory points is quite satisfying. The variation in the buildings allows for each game to feel different, especially if you play at different play counts. While I think I prefer the card-driven strategy of Agricola, my wife prefers this one quite a bit more. Aside from shipping goods, the theme is barely tied to the game play.

The somewhat random order the standard buildings come out in give this game some slight variation from game to game, but probably not enough to compensate for the fairly low amount of player interaction. It's better than Ora et Labora in this regard, but probably not good enough to keep in my collection.

Instead of placing multiple farmers on different action spaces (ala Agricola,) in Le Havre you get to place just 1 worker.  There are a TON of building choices to choose from (in the late game) so choose wisely.  

As stated, Le Havre has a TON of buildings.  Every time a player builds a building it is placed in front of that player.  Depending on the size of the playing area, it can be challenging for new players to see all of the options available.  I am probably going to remedy this somehow with player aids or maybe even a player board ala Caylus.      

The downside to Le Havre is that the constant replenishing of cardboard chits feels more tedious than the replenishing of wooden bits in Agricola.  I'm also not a fan of the double-sided chits.  I feel that players are more prone to unintentionally making mistakes.
 
The expansion, Le Grand Hameau, adds additional special buildings.  Gameplay is the exact same, but variety is always a plus. 

Last thing to touch on is which camp do I fall in, the Agricola or Le Havre camp?  Well, if I'm playing a 2-3 player game, I prefer Le Havre, whereas I prefer Agricola with 4-5 players.  

2 players, 13 plays!
3 players, 7 plays!
4 players, 8 plays! 
5 players, 2 plays!

Although not as thematically interesting as Agricola, it is challenging game to play well, requiring planning many moves in advance to acquire the variety of goods and buildings necessary to score high points.

Update: After several plays I am frustrated by my inability to do well and feel overwhelmed by too many options. I simply do not enjoy this like Agricola, another game in which I seem unable to win!

We waren verwittigd: Dit is een heel langdurend spel.  Maar... het heeft me geen minuut verveeld.

Tips: 
- Er bestaat een kortere versie.  Deze is misschien toch handiger als je geen halve nacht wil uitzitten.  Dit eerste spel was gelukkig een namiddag.
- Dit zou je heel strategisch kunnen gaan spelen, als je perfect weet welke gebouwen er wanneer in het spel komen.  Op het einde heb je zeker ook staal nodig, niet vergeten!!

The test of time will tell if this game is upgraded to a 10 ranking.  I have only played the game twice, but I love the simple game mechanics and the deep and nuanced strategy.

1.3.2012 - Now, in light of playing Puerto Rico (another resource, economics type of game) Le Havre is no longer my favorite in this type of eurogame, thus the reason the decrease in ranking from 9.5 to 7.

2.2012 - Game traded for Power Grid.  Le Havre 6th spot on the BGG confuses me a bit.  I can see the appeal of wide open choices, but the game mechanics seem so loose that they didn't provide an satisfying game experience after a few plays.  I wanted more from the game.  Then after playing Puerto Rico, I knew that it was not going to get to the table ever again.  Both games are resource efficiency/production games (like any good Euro) but PR does it better.  Therefore it truly is a game I could take or leave  (Rating Edit: 2.8.12 - 7 to a 5)

8.2012 - I have seen the light.  After giving Le Havre another try via ios/iPad, I have discovered the depth and richness of Le Havre.  Since trading the game back in February, I acquired Caylus and have played it a handful of times (about equal to the number of Le Havre plays).  The reasons I originally liked the game, as described in my 1st post regarding this game, still stand.  The simple mechanics of the game make it very easy to understand what you can do on your turn.  Figuring out what is the "best" choice with the simple things you can do on this turn is what makes this game shine.  I'm addicted to the game and cannot stop thinking about the different strategies (coke/steel vs. grain and cattle vs. shipping line, etc.)  I defer to JohnRayJr "Landmark Game" for a superior description and review of Le Havre.  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/503185/a-landmark-game

This completes our play of the harvest trilogy and we love them all.

November 2017,- after a dozen games, updated to a 9.5 . Best Uwe game I have played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
1st play and confused as hell. Straight off the bat this game has heavy flavours of Agricola; harvests and the need to produce food. Token placement on buildings to make them function. Strong whiff of Caylus with buildings bought by individuals which draw a rent from other players when they wish to use them.

However, even after a debrief we all seem to be still scratching our heads. The rules give a heavy hint that you need ships to win. Our winner by a very clear margin (105 vs 79 in 2nd place) never bought one nor shipped a thing.

Five players mean that very often a player in a 5 person game gets only one go per turn. With a need to create food to avoid loans, more often than not this one move is utterly predicatable. A 4 or even better, 3 player game would reap more turns and therefore have to be more fun.

Tokens placed on buildings just to to block them off. Especially the shipping line. Why is shipping so essential? Finally the game did seem to take a long time, after a long time to take in the rules we didn't hang about but it took well over 3 hours.

At this stage I have significant reservations.

Third Play: The penny seems to have dropped. The second play seemed to drag but after playing with people on the third time who knew the rules and had played before the game took shape. I now think this one has legs and will stay in my collection.

Its a slow burn, don't give up after 2 games there is a very good game in there trying to get out.

It was long, I got my butt kicked by people who knew this game better than I did, but I enjoyed all 3 hours of it.

What I liked about it, it was like every turn it was discovering something new and exciting to do.  ...and even though it was 4 players, I really did use most of everyone else's turn thinking about what I would do.

My only problem I had, and it's a minor one, is by the time I realized I made a very grave strategic mistake, I just didn't have the game left to make it up.  ...which is either good or bad.  The strategic mistake is that I just didn't put the money into more advanced buildings when I got the chance to do so.  Bear in mind, it wasn't that my 'engine' didn't have the buildings, it was that *I* didn't have the buildings for the opportunities presented to me.

...and for as much as I say this, what I really really liked about it, was it had the economic engine feel to it, but it didn't have the "When do I go for victory points and when do I go to feeding-back into this engine?" question that a lot of economic games have.

To address some comments I read on other geekbuddies list:

Someone mentioned that "it's another game where you build an engine and grind it out..."  that didn't work with the guys I was playing with, at all.  I tried, and fell on my face.  ...and it wasn't that they out-engined me, either.  Most of them made 1-2 big plays, neither were like the other.

The other thing, is that gameplay can be so RADICALLY different from game to game, from buildings you would like coming out late, to hearing about someone hording the wood and basically not allowing anyone to build anything.

So I have to say, great game.

08-20-13 Rating downgraded to a 7, maybe even a 6:  I played this on the ipad, and there is a definite path you must follow in this game overall...get energy, get steel, get points.  Yeah, there are certain ways to get said steel and energy will always be interesting, but in this adventure the other players are never anything more than a temporary nuisance.  It's an IQ test and 3-hour exercise.

An interesting phenomena is that it took about 15 games to get to this point of seeing the same path over and over again, which if I had actually used the board game with people, would be about 35 hours of game time... which is still a fantastic play value.  I think much of the rating has to do with few plays where you think, "I really can do anything in this game.  This is amazing, it's so deep!" until you see that you actually end up doing close to the same things every game.  At least one load-up of cattle and a trip to the abbatoir...or equivalent fish/grain.  At least one trip to the shipping line.  Then it's makin' boats 'n buildings any way you can.

I think of like the old Police Squad episodes.  There would always be the joke, "Cigarette?  Why yes, it is." and a talk with the shoe-shine guy. "Maybe this would refresh your memory..." and he would take the 20 bucks. in every episode.  They would be different, but the same.

Way more free-form than Agricola, which was much too stifling for my tastes.  He gets it right with Le Havre, though.  Other than how long it is (3 hours is almost too long, considering the large number of quality games that can be played in half that) and the randomness of the special buildings, this is an exquisite game. You can play the "short game" versions of it, too.

Hyvä peli on. Aika raskas, joten kovin usein tule pelattua, mutta kyllä täs semmosta mukavaa puuhastelua on. Tosin peli saattaa joskus lähteä heti hieman niin surkeesti liikkeelle, että voitosta on turha taistella. Joskus on vaan aina askeleen jäljessä muita, jolloin voi olla vaikeeta saada tehtyä isoja siirtoja. Tällöin pelin läpsyttely voi olla vähän turhauttavaa, joskin yleensä silti omat siirrot pyrkii tekemään järkevästi. 25.1.2010

Iniciar una conclusión escribiendo que en [url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com.es/2013/06/le-havre.html#more]Le Havre[/url] me gusta todo, desvela en la primera línea que a este juego no le encuentro en la práctica ninguna pega. Sinceramente no se empezar de otra manera. Creo que estamos ante el modelo a seguir de cómo se debe diseñar un juego, para todo rango de jugadores y diferentes niveles de dificultad.

Puedo concluir que es un juego muy bien pensado y muy testeado, que se adapta y se  metamorfosea como un guante al rango de jugadores y a la exigencia de nivel de dificultad requerido. Además, las sensaciones de juego son totalmente distintas en función de estos parámetros (dificultad y número de jugadores) ya que los edificios, que son la salsa del diseño, están reglados y varían en función de estos parámetros, (no de forma aleatoria como en otros juegos que se retiran al azar), sino de manera concreta, dando lugar a escenarios específicos y calibrados en base estas premisas.

There is a LOT going on in this game.  I must admit, that it can take several plays of this game in order to even feel like your starting to 'get' it.  So if you don't have the patience to get it to the table a few times, it's probably not for you.  Especially given how LONG the game takes.  However, there is definitely an interesting game of optimization going on, and it is interesting to explore if you have the time.  Not for the faint of heart.

Absolutely superb engine building / industry game. Haven't got anything else like it. Staggering amount of options which only increase with more players (although the actions of other players will change the efficiency of various paths to money). Feel like I'm still getting ideas on new potential strategies eight games in. 

The rules are easy to learn but the underlying mechanics will take a few games to get a grip on. The beauty is that you are given a lot of space for you to make your engine work, so you can have a fun time even if you don't win. It takes a while to play, which I thought would be a negative, but time flies away very quickly and it feels like its over before you know it. I don't think the designers could have compressed the game any tighter without taking away the freedom of choice which distinguishes Le Havre from other games.

Worker placement game with a great need to optimize the very few actions you get in a game. Unfortunately this can lead to AP and slow the game down. Le Havre allows specialization where Agricola did punish it. Interaction possibilities between the different buildings seem endless. Game lasts way too long in my opinion for the gameplay it offers. Maybe it will speed up with repeated plays but somehow I doubt this.

Game scales horribly between different number of players. 5 player game is not comparable at all with a 3 player game. Game did not get any better after more plays. Traded away.

Decent game.  Would like to play it in person, but wasn't overly impressed.  The game is non-offensive, but I wasn't overly intrigued by the mechanics or game-play.

This game is a significant improvement over Agricola, because it starts the game with considerably fewer options.  So players are able to become comfortable with those few things and then slowly learn each new ability as it arrives.  This slow build takes away a lot of the new player confusion that can arise with Agricola.  However, this game takes that feel of trying to dig yourself out of a hole to another stratosphere.  I can see what needs to happen in order to get over the hump in this game, but I still have no idea how to make it happen.  So I just find myself getting frustrated.

Perhaps the more annoying aspect of this game for me is simply the fiddliness of it all.  The piles of chits being restocked every turn, the mess of chits that you have to manage, and the annoyance of turning one chit over to create a different chit makes for so much chaos that it just seemed downright chaotic.  Again there is a massive learning curve here, as in Agricola, and it can be frustrating to have your score doubled by a pro.  My only other complaint would be that theme is extremely bland.  It makes sense, for sure, but it really doesn't interest me at all.  I'd much rather play this again than Agricola, but I doubt I will ever suggest it.

The food aspect is still a bit odd to me, and I'm not entirely certain that it really fits in the end (aside from as a payment to other players for building use).

There isn't as much processing of each individual good as I might like to see (a bigger chain).

This game makes me want to play other, better, games about production and refinement (Neuland, Roads and Boats).

It's a bunch of "take 10 of one good and make something out of it.  Make something else out of the remainder of that and another good you happen to have."  Takes the problems present in Agricola to the extreme.

Have played this mainly with two or three players. 

In terms of whether a dominant strategy exists for this game I would agree that the coke, iron, steel strategy seems to be the best. however as more than one player is likely to adopt this strategy it allows players focusing on other strategies to become possible game winners.

I enjoy the choices the game presents whether to focus on food/money and the future/now effects that loans and ships provide.

Played it once. Unfortunately I had read up on strategy here on BGG before playing it which I shouldn't have done. I ended up crushing my opponents which made it less fun. Other than that it seems like a really good game.

But please, don't read the strategy section on BGG, it absolutely does not make the game more fun.

I need to play this again.  It is heavy and deep and it's a fun game.  I like the massive build up to the end.

Second play was much like the first where I simply took too much time to sort through everything at the start when I didn't really know what was going on.  In the second half, I just made moves and everything flowed much better.

My rating has the potential to go up if I can just zip through the game a bit quicker.

This is another excellent game with tons of replay appeal.  The game is easy to explain and it is easy to follow the mechanics.  After about three turns play begins to slow because decisions become more difficult.  This game will bring the analysis paralysis out of the gamers.  I use a timer to play the game to keep players on track.  Once you get about three gmes under your belt you can ditch the timer because players will more use to the mechanics the strategies and the paths to winning.

This game is simply awesome.  There is pretty much nothing in it I don't like.  I love all of the goods, I love the multitude of 'economic engines' that can be made with the different buildings.

The only thing I want is more special buildings.  I play a variant where each player gets a few in hand and can play them out (like the Constructions Site Card).

We also play with the Harbor Wharf out from the beginning so you can't get screwed on building locking.

Good, but I am not crazy about it. Seems too linear, and every game feels the same. There should be more variability, some way of varying which buildings are included to a greater degree. Can't see hpw you would do that without breaking the game though.

Only one play so far and it is definitely good, very good. As good as Agricola? Better? Not sure yet. Certainly it has the same feeling of masses of options and a shortage of turns - of wanting to do so many things but only being able to do one.

It also has the same feeling of watching your opponents and trying to choose the strategy that will benefit from what they are, and are not taking. You can go all out for short term benefits or plan for the longer term. Definitely want to play it again. Several times in fact.

7 plays and I still enjoy it a lot, maybe not so much as Agricola, it can occasionally drag a little with more than 3 players, but a lot.

Euro madness at its worst: all you can do here is struggling in vain to feed your workers while you’re doing your best to spare some resources and buy or build things. 

The game ends as soon as it starts, since you need to plan everything in advance and stick to it no matter what: in fact there’s no room for randomness, risk or sparkling plays, it’s just the same greyness all over the entire game.

Really enjoyed my first play.  There is some similarity with Agricola, but not enough to me to pick one or the other.  I can't really imagine playing this with 4 or 5, it just seems like you wouldn't do much of anything.  The special buildings add a nice variety, I imagine.  I like the different ways to victory.  I played the points on the cards way and only shipped a couple of times.  My opponent shipped alot and garnered up his money that way. Once you get the procedure down, it's not a difficult game. Looking forward to playing again, soon, now that I got a game under the belt.  

Update:  Played very well with three.

Update 4/2010: overtook Agricola.  Much rather play this.

As of right now this is my favorite Uwe game. I much prefer the way the tension comes from being the most efficient and getting buildings from other players, rather than having to just worry about surviving like in Agricola.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Update: Yes, this game is way too long.  For a game where every turn is basically take a pile of resources or use a building, it should not take 2-3 hours.  It's so damn repetitive.  And lets not forget having to add resource chits to piles AFTER EVERY PLAYER TURN.  On more than one occasion we have had arguments over whether we had stocked the offer spaces.  All I can say is, KILL ME NOW!

The special buildings are more like Agricola cards than I cared to admit; too many of them, a lot of them will never be used and you only draw six and use even fewer per a game.  Unfortunately, Le Havre needed some variability as the game's strategy is very basic.  Certain buildings are much better than others.  Most games revolve around setting yourself up for cokery and shipping and I still haven't seen anyone use hides to good effect.  Special building should have been that element that suddenly turns fish into something usable.  Instead, even if a good fish building is in there, you may not see it until late in the game when it's far too late to properly use.

At this point I think Agricola is the better game despite being more complex and having its share of flaws.  The brutal battle for resources in that game is just a lot more engaging than the dry optimization of Le Havre.

--

Very strange to see Uwe Rosenburg on a roll of high profile hits.  Considering that prior to Agricola his only notable game was Bohnanza, to seem him become a prolific designer of heavy gamer's games is unexpected.

Le Havre is somewhat similar to Agricola, having many types of resources and again running on a worker placement system.  However, Le Havre is definitely a more tightly designed game than Agricola.  I suspect that the predilections of most gamers would lead them to prefer Agricola because of its empire-building and the neat graphical representation of your farm's expansion.  Le Havre's theme, in contrast is far drier and the nebulous nature of property ownership and the lack of exciting visual cues of your exploding wealth does not excite like a well-developed farm in Agricola.

Some seem to want Le Havre to emulate Agricola's incredibly harsh beginning where food is a precious resource.  I am not sure that fits the theme of Le Havre at all and in fact the whole food thing never made too much sense to me in this game.  Which is not to say I don't understand it's purpose, which is to keep this from being a very staid optimization game by injecting repeated and urgent need to spend actions on food.  I may agree that the need for food is ameliorated too much in the later rounds, which contributes to a somewhat tedious endgame.

My main complaint centers around the length.  As noted, with food no longer pressing, the endgame devolves into an exercise in calculating which set of actions nets you the most points.  Thus, your last impression of the games does nothing to improve the perception of a game that has long run its course.  The short game is a more appropriate length, but you lose special buildings and some normal buildings and the former really add to the game.  Yes, among the special buildings are a few duds, but it's nothing like Agricola's cards.

In summary, I am not sure Le Havre justifies the length of play given it's unimaginative mix of mechanics.

Heavy yet dead simple. Take an offer or enter a building. Buy or sell buildings and the next guys turn. So much to do you have to decide between 20 good options, 10 great options, and that one best option. Whoever hits that one best option most often comes out ahead. I feel worn out at the end of every game. And yes, that is the sign of a good game.

One of my favorite games of all time and my favorite Uwe game. The mechanics are simple but the depth of decision making is vast. There is pressure to do many things and lots of options at every turn. You never feel that you haven enough time to finish everything and the order in which the buildings come out each game has a HUGE impact on everything. I marvel that this game is simply a worker placement game with a single worker. So brilliant and for me the ultimate example of streamlined and deep design. Some complain that the shipping is too overpowered, but of course it is overpowered...the game is about shipping! If all players are aware, then the fierce competition for resources (coal, coke, iron, steel) is phenomenal and the tension to see who can time things better is palpable. A wonderful game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Not at all the same constant fight for survival as in Agricola, instead resources is abundant and one has to build the best engine possible with the buildings available. Really like this game as either a 2 or 3 player game, but will not turn down a 4 player game either. The only thing missing is some more expansions to give it even more variety.

Recently played 4 times, 2 solo games, 1 2er, 1 3er.
Iron-coal strategy was proved very strong in all those games, but i wonder if it is still true in a 4+ game. As every one will have 6 actions less in 4er game than in 3er game, and thats almost exactly how many time you could go to iron factory/coal producer. Willing to play more to get a better idea.

Quite a few tough choices to be made each round and it's

use resources to feed my workers, but it makes sense in the

Loved the idea of constructing/buying buildings. We are always racing against one another in order to build better ships to feed our people. My only concern is that after a few games in, the base game felt kinda samey with the same building cards being used. The special buildings does change the game a little but i think we need more variety in the primary buildings! Nice cartoonish artwork and great game design!! My wife and I absolutely loved it.

I feel like the biggest drawback to this game is how rapidly the search space for possible moves increases mid-game, making the considerations required for each turn enormous unless every person is committed to casual, almost random, play.

I feel like this bogs down the game radically without adding to its fun.

Maybe if you had a group of really experienced players, this wouldn't be an issue. Maybe. I'm not sure how to get to that stage without a bunch of awful games though.

This economic game created by Uwe Rosenberg is a brain killer. Rules are clear but game is complex and challenging. 
If you like games like this You should give a shot. Playing this I always feel like under the huge pressure because I have to plan my moves precisely for the whole round (!), one mistake and my strategy for the specific round can be totally destroyed.

- it shouldn't be the first contact with euro type games
- created for experienced players (box does not contain such information), newbies can quickly discourage themselves to this type of game.

- playing time (120-200 minutes)
- no fun in this game, just heavy strategy all the time
- lack of scorebook :(

**You can try this game on tablet or smartphone - it is availible for iOS and Android. It is the same like in real & costs much about 5$.

After a couple of solo plays I quite like this game!  It's interesting and rewards good planning in the solo game.  I'm looking forward to playing with other people, as building blocking and resource grabbing look like they'll be very important.

I really enjoy this game.  Something about it just draws me in.  It's very strategic, rewards planning and efficency, but also requires you to be adaptable and creative at the drop of a hat!  I've played several times with other players now, and I will not be playing solo again.  I'm not much of a solo player to begin with, and I cannot see the point of going back to this without the challenge of another player or multiple players. I do like how the game adjusts itself to accomodate the number of players so well.  Brilliant design!

After 21 plays I'm still loving this game.  The number of options is tremendous and the subtle interactions and timing decisions have a long term impact on the game.  You need to be able to manage a number of different facets at a single time (food, ships, buildings, resources and evaluate the impact of what doing something now as opposed to trying a wait longer) yet work it all into a cohesive long term plan.  I'm still learning to try and work the special buildings into my plans on a more consistent basis and do get caught ignoring one of the facets from time to time.  Just an amazing game and one I'll continue playing for a long time to come.  Best with 2 to 3 players, acceptable with four.  If you want a five-player game I would not recommend Le Havre.

My first 10 rated game.

If you've been around GCL at all, my love affair with Le Havre should come to you as no surprise. It's a brilliant mix of planning and adaptation with a liberal dash of little choices having big long term effects. The end game is generally similar, but there are so many different paths to get there, and the game really rewards aggressive play (in the form of blocking) tempered with restraint (you can damage yourself more than your opponent if you're too aggressive with blocking). Even after 79 plays I'm nowhere near done with this game. I would like to play it more with 3+ players, but my group has now told me that they won't be playing this or Agricola with me anymore, due to the difference in experience, so I'm not sure how that's going to happen.

Several plays in and I still find this game to be more work than fun.  Strategy-wise the game obviously has quite a lot going for it.  The game drags on for quite a long time, but that may be that nobody I have played with has multiple plays with the game.  A good portion of time is spent re-reading cards and then analyzing, slowly, what to do.  I keep wondering if I should give it more tries or just get rid of it.

This is a great resource management game but to rate or understand this game, I think you need to have played it at least three times.  At first play, it is not apparent what you need to do to succeed and win.  Players who first try it will find it quite open-ended and daunting when the starvation factor escalates.  Le Havre is quite elegant in it's design especially with the double sided chits,and card setup.  It takes a bit of time to setup but with a good storage solution for the chits, this time can be halved.  With the included Le Grand Hameau expansion, the game variations are almost endless.

Le Havre is from the same designer that gave us Agricola (Ewe Rosenberg), and there are many similarities. Commodities accumulate and players choose between taking a stack of goods that are raw materials for building or producing food, or building things with the materials you've collected. All aimed at accumulating wealth (=VPs). You need food and several methods for staving off hunger (need to take loans) are provided. You have a worker that bounces about the table as a means of recording a specific action you've chosen.

The theme is the hustle and bustle associated with a trading port like Le Havre, so is a somewhat more sophisticated (industrialized) model than the agrarian Agricola. I agree that the theme is not as well realized, but the familiar tension of having to choose between many things, all of which you would like to do, is still very much there.

I enjoyed the first game I played but also agree that five players is very challenging, not to mention long! I'm not sure you need copies of both Agricola and this despite the very different themes. Enjoyable enough, but it seemed like more of the same to me, and a little dryer for reasons I can't quite put my finger on...

RATING: 4
Longer cousin to Agricola. different randomness than agricola, more control and more likely to suffer from AP. 

Not sure I'd want to play with 5, and even 4 is pushing it (takes too long).

Update - current play group have got burned out on Le Havre quite quickly. Play length is the main factor, and concerns over certain buildings. Rating dropped.

Unlikely to see much play now, on the trade pile.

Update - played it again, and liked it less, I think I dislike the way you can (or can't) apply a strategy, you can't go in deciding to do X, and even picking a route to victory early on isn't that viable as it's possible to have a vital building blocked. So given the length I find the annoyances overwhelm the stuff I like - overall much prefer to play Agricola. 

*** Traded, unlikely to play this again. Just too dry and mechanical, and the AP ... Agricola is similar enough for me to always want to play that rather than this. Rating dropped, again. Quite surprised how quickly I burned out on this one :(

I prefer this game over Agricola.  It doesn't leave me as drained at the end of the game as Agricola, and is a top-notch game.  So much to do every turn, with no where near the time to do it.

Excellent worker placement goods conversion engine builder. The way the game flows endlessly through the supply spaces is brilliant design. Also, I'm one that loves the 'feed your people mechanic'. The tension between having enough food and having the goods to build buildings and ships is delicious. It's right there with Odin and Agricola as Uwe experiences I really really enjoy.

RATING: 6
An economic engine game set in a french port.  Le Havre could be classified as another multiplyer-solitaire title and you wouldn't be that far off the mark.  However the "puzzle" Le Havre presents isn't as easy to solve or as deterministic as it is in other lesser titles like Puerto Rico or Agricola.  In other words, when I played Le Havre, I didn't feel that my choices were obvious nor forced by the actions of the other players.  The game gave me a lot of latitude in choosing how best to grow my shipping concern.  It's this opaqeness of its puzzle and the latitude it offers that makes it an enjoyable game for me.

Le Harve rates a solid 7 in my book due to it's gameplay and the fact it's a very friendly 2p title.  Just make sure you address the food issue first thing every turn and you'll have a good time.  Definitely the best of the Agricola. Le Havre and Loyang trilogy.

RATING: 9.5
Inclusive with Le Grande Hameau expansion and some self printed player mats for the storage of the goods!
Try the advanced version with 2 Francs to pay for 2,3 or 4 taken loans (depends from number of players!) Maybe played with a small modification in use of the Grand Hameau Cards. Every player gets two personal GH cards in his hands in a 1st turn whitout harvest! Only one of them can be later be bought, when a player sell his own previously built or bought building to the city. The other GH card must then be discarded and is out of play.

10x10 2014. The resource economy in this is complex enough to be interesting but simple enough that you get all kinds of grand ideas and strategies in your mind even on the first couple plays.  Something's very satisfying about converting resources- smoking fish, slaughtering cattle, baking bread, making steel etc.  Lots of variety from the cards and always tons of options on your turn.  Similar to and not quite as good as, Ora et Labora- my favorite Uwe game.  Awesome and very fun.

After about 6 months, I think I prefer Agricola to Le Havre for replayability.  However, I still really like this game.  For solo, the replayability is somewhat limited... I've played it about 20 - 30 times and I need a break from it for a little while (but I definitely think I'll be playing it again soon).  For multiplayer, I strongly suggest playing the first game with 2 or 3 and then trying 4.  I like it multiplayer and am hoping to get more opportunities to play it.

Haven't played a full full-version game yet, but it's promising that one of my gaming partners says "this seems like a GREAT game." I was looking for an Agricola alternative with meat and choices, and that's what I got. Also, I wanted just a 2-3 player scale, which fits Le Havre to a T.
UPDATE: played several matches and it certainly lives up to its billing. Difficult to learn and not smooth to play yet, hopefully our pace will pick up soon. We are still exploring several paths and aren't near to figuring it out yet.

RATING: 6
So many buildings! Thus far Le Havre feels like a pleasant stroll through an RPG village, picking up what goods you can find. Only near the end is there any sense of competition, at which point players are evaluated on the strength of what they were able to find earlier. Don't get me wrong; this is extremely pleasant, and anyway in each game the point at which the competition phase seemed to begin has moved earlier and earlier. I like it.

RATING: 9.5
Tons of decisions and a variety of viable strategies makes this one a winner! Due to how great each of the choices are you are allowed to be more flexible in your strategic approach than with other euros (like agricola). The theme is lighthearted but the strategic depth of this game is very heavy. Awesome, albeit pretty long, game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played this once while tired, so not entirely sure what I think yet.   I found it difficult to keep track of all my options with the different buildings, but I suspect that will not be as big of a factor when I'm actually awake.  One good sign is that I keep thinking about it and trying to figure out what I'm going to do next time.  Preliminary rating of 7, expect that to change with more plays (probably upwards).

EDIT: Upping rating from 7 to 8 after another play with slightly more active brain cells.  It definitely takes a while for players to figure out the prep work necessary to build the higher-value items.  

EDIT #2:  Another ratings increase from 8 to 9 after a few more plays.  It's nice to play an economic engine game where you're faced with an embarrasment of riches for once!

One play. Nov 2008.  Spent a lot of time trying to get food.  The key factor is the very limited number of turns -- sometimes just one a round.  Really makes one have to focus.  Having only one card that can convert items (cattle and clay) for example creates a bottleneck that may or may not be intentional.

First plays 01/22/2011. Awesome game. Played full version with 3 people (cut first game short as there was a clear-cut leader just over halfway through, other players wanted to retry). Good length, lots of choices and strategies seem to be available. May bump to a 9 on subsequent plays. I can see this one hitting the table a lot, especially as we often have 3 people in our game group.

02/22/2011: Played with the wife, who is not a gamer at all. We played the short version and it still took a couple of hours, but was her first time and my third, so to be expected. Very fun, the wife enjoyed it, and we're looking forward to playing again.. 

Edit Feb 2016: Bumping down from a 10 to a 9, more from the fact that having 3 Rosenberg's in my top-5 all time seems too much. Swapping this score with Caverna.

For some reason I thought Le Havre would be too similar to Agricola, but after just one play I liked Le Havre a lot more. Not only is the design very elegant (lots of depth with very few rules): everything flows smoothly in this game. I also love the fact that you can specialize.
------------------------------
June 2010: First impressions can be deceptive. The fact that goals are shared in Agricola means there is more competition and interaction. After some more plays, Agricola tops Le Havre, though admittedly not by much.

RATING: 8
A solid follow-up to Agricola. Uwe does it again! A geekbuddy said that it doesn't have the same out-of-the-box appeal which I agree with. I think this game has a steep learning curve. And it is certainly a gamer's game and not meant for casual gamers.

The game does tend to progressively bog down as the number of available actions becomes overwhelming. However, after a few plays, the buildings become familiar and gameplay should speed up.

Wouldn't want to play with 5.

I also own the complete 12 expansion cards from Essen 2008.

Edit: After 5 plays, it seems that a dominant strategy is to go for the craft buildings. First player advantage that is not scaled. Also, the game slows down as it progresses because of the increasing number of available options.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tight and heavy optimizing game. I generally don't like games like this that take very long time to play and have down time between player turns. In Le Havre the beginning goes smoother but the later rounds can drag a bit. Five players is definitely too much and with four the game lasts easily 4 hours. That's about one hour too much for my taste.

Nevertheless I'd play it again and it's a good game for those who are more into such games (like Agricola etc.)

A bit scary for a first time player due to more and more options becoming available, but I might consider it a 10 after a few more plays.

After a few more plays I'll still give it a 9. I got the hang of it but there are still a few things that keep me from giving it a 10. Also, it's simpler than I first thought...

I wonder how well a strategy with multiple shipments works. Last time I played a 3-player short game, and one shipment was all that I needed. Maybe in a longer game there could be something you really want to buy, or you might want to pay off several loans and an earlier shipment could prove useful.

Anyway, the short game is quite good too.

A solid game, and in some ways I like it more than Agricola.  However, I also end up feeling like I've just been WORKING for a couple of hours after playing this one.  Not sure that a game should be so exhausting.   The psychology of having to battle to break-even is a tricky one.   Agricola feels the same way.

Jan 2011:   After a few more plays, rating up to a 9.  This is a game that although I'm not in the mood for it all the time due to game length, I do find it very engaging each time we play.

Sep 2011:  Rating changed from a 9 to 10.  Still really like this game, and think that it's probably the best of its class.  There seems to be enough different ways to win that it really shouldn't get stale for a while.   Would love to see some more expansions for this that don't necessarily complicate the game, but maybe replace or add to the basic buildings.  

Dec 2011:  My favorite game right now!

I thought I didn't like this game because I tried the iOS app and found it uninteresting. Wow, have I been missing out all these years. The app is a terrible way to learn this game, as the whole game is predicated on being able to clearly read all the building cards (which is incredibly hard to do on a phone). 

This is a very interesting, refreshingly different game from Uwe's other worker placement games. I like that it's not nearly as punishing, with far more choices on your turn than in, say, Agricola. There is very little blocking, but the game feels different every time because of the timing of the building cards. Good times.

It's good, but a tad on the long side.  I assume play will speed up somewhat over time.  Squatting on buildings is fun, and it's a bit difficult to wrap your head around what you should be doing at first.

My only complaint is the special cards.. you won't see many of them actually played, and the 12 extra almost seem unneeded.  Except I'm a completionist... and I'm a bit annoyed that they aren't really accessible here in the US.

Update:  Who cares about the special cards?  The Short game is the way to go.  Lots of fun.. it's the way I'll play it almost exclusively.. saving the long game for a once in a while thing.

Fantastic game. Every turn has a meaningful decision to make. Turns are usually short. Short term goals are balanced with long term strategies. Very tactical, which is the way that I like games. The choices are tough because there are so many good things available every turn. The only bad part is that the game can get a little too long, specially with inexperienced players as they learn what all the buildings do.

Really really good game. All about being efficient. Even though I was last in a 5p game, and I suspect the fourth and fifth players may get one less turn (?), I won and doubled everyone else's scores. Probably because everyone had too much food and I managed to get the right buildings/engine going. There is some luck in who gets to buy the special buildings first when they come up but you can always plan for it if needed and I feel they are seldom game-changing as you can always use other people's buildings (mostly). 

Rating likely to settle around 8.5-9.5 though it may just get a 10 with enough plays.

Ignore the comments that this is too similar to Agricola.  Other than the worker placement mechanic, the game feels completely different.

Can't recommend strongly enough.

RATING: 8
Terrific fun! The solo game is ok, but the 2p game is fantastic. Its similar to Agricola in feel and tension, but there's a much longer building track. There's definitely a learning curve to this game too -- you have to know the buildings, and you have to think both tactically (what resources do I need now) and strategically (what do I want to do in the next round or two). You have very limited actions and need to think very hard about what to do with them. My wife and I enjoyed this immensely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Obviously derives from the same roots but, so far, I'm inclined to like it more than I did Agricola (although I'm not sure if it's actually a better game) as it offers more options as time goes on, whereas Agricola feels like the opposite.  Agricola provides more options each round, but there are less and less available to you as you use up your actions.  The difference then may be that Le Harve feels more expansive than restrictive, which for me is a good thing.

Played this one again recently and liked it quite a bit, so up the rating goes again. I think 4 players might be the sweet spot; you get to use all the buildings, and the pace improves a bit, as each player's turn is a bit shorter but you have more options. Definitely not a game for the overly contemplative, as it's a touch too long to start with, but it's not too bad. Play the short game the first time out.

It's true that the endgame is all about Steel and Coke. But the nice thing about Le Havre is that there are a lot of ways to get there in the early and middle game, and quite a few special buildings can change things up in interesting ways (in general, the specials that are targeted at the mid to late game are far more interesting and game-altering than the ones targeted for the early game, which has a lot of variety already, to the point that I'd consider editing the deck).

---

This is still a game I'm torn on. It's fun and interesting, but like Agricola, the variability is less than it seems. Also, while playing the short game is an appealing option to bring the playtime under control, you also lose the flavor of the special buildings, which are a key element in giving the game some variety and a little edge.

All in all, it definitely feels like it's not all there, and the length is very problematic. I still like it; but it's not a game that's ever going to come out a ton.
---
My general feeling on Le Havre is:
- The sweet spot is probably 3 or 4 players;
- The "full" game doesn't add a lot over the "short" game, and probably isn't worth the extra 45-60 minutes or so it takes to play. The full game gets a bit repetitive.

In general, I think Le Havre is the better and more elegant design when compared to Agricola, but Agricola is way more thematic and has the better nebulous "fun factor". I wish the food situation was just a little tighter in Le Havre, to tighten up the pacing a bit and keep the players under pressure, especially in light of the relative painlessness of loans.

I definitely feel the balance here isn't quite right. You can't win without Coke/Steel, and loans are definitely not nearly punishing enough.
---
As my enthusiasm for Agricola has been fading a touch, and as I've been ramping up on Le Havre, I actually feel like Le Havre feels like the more solid, if somewhat less flavorful, game, so it might outlast Agricola. On the other hand, it is a bit long. Not sure on the ultimate verdict yet, but I like it so far.
---
Hey, this was pretty fun. I ordered it with some reservations, since Mr Rosenberg isn't hugely reliable and my enthusiasm for Agricola was cooling a bit. But Le Havre was fun - like Agricola, it's in the "like Caylus but doesn't suck" category. I don't know if it will ultimately hold as much interest as Agricola, as the theme gets very little traction, and it feels like it might get a bit repetitive, but I'm glad I took the chance and picked it up.

I'd recommend taking their advice about 5 players to heart and playing Le Havre with 4 or fewer (2 worked well) your first few times out.

You can definitely see the influence that Caylus had on this game, but in the end I was much less excited about Le Havre.  It just seemed like it took an awful long time to develop anything, which bored me a bit.  Buy this to turn into that, now get this so I have some energy to turn this other thing into something else so I can buy a building which allows me to.... bla bla bla.  In the end, I thought it was pretty decent, but nothing ground breaking or innovative.  I think in Agricola's case, the theme is really what made it fun, and Le Havre really lacks that element that makes it fun.  More of the same cube pushing that ATers always complain about, except it's chit pushing in this case and not extremely exciting chit pushing at that.

Updated 5/26/10.  

I've played this game quite a bit now, primarily 2-player, and I think it's time that I acknowledge that I've been letting the game slide on Agricola's coattails for too long.  Le Havre is a very good game, with a design that I admire, but it is not a particularly "fun" game, and I suspect that it needs a dedicated group of regulars to really shine.      

Caveat: I have one 3-player game and zero 4+ player games under my belt.  I actually think the two-player game has more tension as you can anticipate your opponent's needs better and jostle/block/screw more effectively.  Also, the added actions per turn allow for a little more engine-building goodness before the harvest.  I'm open to playing with 3+ again though to get a better feel for the game. 

As a simple overview, Le Havre is a game where you get resources to build buildings that produce more resources or better resources, or that convert resources into upgraded resources...all of which is a long process to buy or build ships that you use to export your resources for profit. 

Le Havre appears to be an engine-building game, but unlike, say, Race for the Galaxy, you are building an engine that is available to everyone (at a minor cost).  I used to love that the buildings are open to all players.  Over time, I've grown disappointed, though, as almost every building gets built every game.  Thus, it doesn't really allow for specialization, like an engine-building game ought to.  So it lacks a little oomph.

Some people have complained that the game lacks replay value because some items (steel and coke) are more desirable than others.  I haven't encountered this issue, and the two-player game especially allows players flexibility to adapt on the fly and try unusual strategies.  Subtle things like randomly distributing the harbor tiles every game also help prevent the "standard opening" problem of games like Puerto Rico.  That said, I'm not particularly good at games of this sort.  My typical scores in the long game are in the 220s to 250s, where expert players say that 300 should be the target. 

Other concerns: (1) No catch-up mechanic that I've discovered.  This isn't a game with a runaway leader problem exactly (everyone can use all the buildings), but disparate skill levels can ruin the game because there is no advantage to being behind.  (2) Time, hence value.  With setup and cleanup, this game just takes so long and has so many rules that I'm not sure it will hit the table with many of my friends.  The more I play with my few experienced friends, however, the bigger problem Concern #1 presents. (3) Fun.  Right now, I'm loving trying to "solve" the game, but the activity of playing is not always particularly exciting/enjoyable.  The long game especially can drag.  (4) AP.  Don't say I didn't warn you!

On notes (2) and (3) above, I waffle on whether I prefer the short game or the long game.  On the one hand, the first few rounds of the standard version are essentially just collecting resources and maybe building a building or two.  On the other hand, the long version introduces special buildings, which definitely helps keep the game from getting stale.  Perhaps more importantly, it has a sense of engine-building and specialization that is missing in the short version.  Right now, I'm leaning back toward the long game (but it is LONG).

I do think that the resource tiles are unnecessarily fiddly (and I love fiddly games).  I finally got some storage boxes, and it helps, but still... 

The verdict:

Le Havre is one of the better games I've played.  It's well-constructed, well-designed, and very interesting.  It's also more accessible to us economically-challenged players than, say, Power Grid or Imperial.  Still, there's something that nags at me.  I feel as though I'm supposed to like it more than I actually like it.  I guess that's another way of saying Concern #3 above is a pretty big concern.  Only additional plays will tell whether the rating holds up for me personally, but as of today, it's a fading 8.

Fun game but mind-numbingly long. I played this at a game store and in the time it took for us to finish one game, gamers at another table played four other games.

I enjoy games that offer interesting choices, but when a game offers [b]40[/b] choices... even the speediest player can't help but suffer from AP.

Another solid economic, goods-conversion Rosenburg Euro. The game does have a nice escalation as players add buildings to their tableau during the course of the game. Le Havre is also much more forgiving than some other Rosenburg games, like Agricola, when it comes to feeding your workers. The game did feel a bit too sandbox-y for my taste as there is so many things to do. The game also does run a bit long at higher player counts. Definitely a 2 or 3 player game in my book. Nevertheless, it's a solid game for fans of Uwe.

We got Agricola which was nice and now we get this which is so much better in my opinion. Both great games but I prefer this game of get stuff to build stuff and gain points. Sometimes you have to process raw materials in the built buildings to earn the better points on the cards. If you do this in other people's buildings then you have to pay them for the privelege. Loved It. 13 Plays. Think I've played this more alone than with other folk now. It seems a long explain and has lost it's shine for me now.

Uwe Rosenberg does a great job implementing the shipping / manufacturing theme of Le Havre - I like building "economic engines", so this game is right up my alley.  I love the variety of buildings and the ability to sell buildings and ships at any time.  I especially like how strategic investment in buildings that other players want to use can provide one with a source of income, in addition to saving one from having to pay entry fees.  The worker placement aspect works well and the ability to continuously block a particular building at the expense of not being able to do anything except take goods or buy / sell seems balanced.  The only thing that might be a bit off is the scaling of the food payment required at the end of each round.  Oh, and fiddling with the hundreds of tiny tiles can be somewhat annoying.  Still, one of my favourite games!

6/8/2017 Still in my top 5 and the App is just fantastic and makes me appreciate the board game that much more. As time goes by the only thing let to ponder is when this game will get the Deluxe treatment (Akin to PR) with "Even More" buildings.

I thought the "short" game was borderline too long, at close to 3 hours with 4 players. Maybe 2-3 is the sweet spot. With 4, 1 player always goes just once in the round, which can be a killer. I found this game infinitely more difficult than Agricola. I spent the last few turns scrambling for food. Food also seems really out of place thematically. Who exactly are you feeding?
The debt rules are also really funky, and athematic. I know it's a game, but why have any theme if nothing makes sense. 
That said, I did like the gameplay and see no reason the short game can't stand on its own. Looking forward to playing with lower player numbers. 

Update: way too convoluted, and theme fails so badly that all of the gears are showing. Playing the long game or any form of the game with more than 3 is slow torture.

Great game! One of my favorite of all time - I basically like everything about it.

It is such a hard game to master as there are always sooo many things you want to do, but you can only do one measly thing (or more if you want to buy/sell buildings), and that is extremely frustrating - in a good way! 
I guess this is one of Uwe's characteristics as it also plays a big part in Agricola and At The Gates Of Loyang - I must say that I really like frustrating elements (which can also be found in good games like In The Year Of The Dragon etc.)

I guess you need to plan a little ahead and have some sort of strategy in Le Havre, but in our first game we got along fine without knowing the buildings, which I guess will make it an even better game in the future when we get to know them (update: yes, it is an even better game now!). 

Ships seem to be important and it's probably very hard to win without owning a single ship, but if everybody knows that, I guess there is no problem. And even if you build a ship or two or three you sure aren't going to win just because of that! There is so much going on all the time and you need to make some very important decisions each turn - it's just lovely!

My only concern is the (strategic) replayability; yes, there is definitely some variety, but most games tend to be about getting a lot of coke and steel and ship those goods. It's hard to win without doing that, at least that's my experience after playing Le Havre ~20 times.
Also, I don't like that getting a loan (or several) is not that bad; I think the penalty for getting those should be increased.

I guess we have to compare it to Agricola, another one of Uwe's games, and my personal favorite, like many do... However, to me, Le Havre honestly didn't remind me of Agricola at all except for the facts that ressources accumulate until somebody grabs them and that you need to have enough food at the end of a round - and that is where the (lovely) frustrations and your planning come into play! 

It takes more time to play compared to other games (2-2.5 hours with 3 players, though I've finished a 2 player game in just a bit more than 1 hour), but the good thing is that there is not a lot of downtime between turns, at least in the first half of the game. 
You basically move your ship and grab some goods or place your worker, and it's the latter which can be a tough decision as to where to place him, especially during the end game when there are so many options. Overall, though, the gameplay has been really smooth in my gamegroup. 

I will probably only play it with 2 or 3; the reason is that with 4 or 5, you only get one turn in some rounds which I think can be pretty brutal and hard to plan around. Also, there are so many other great games for 4-5 players which will hit the table instead of Le Havre.

All in all, Le Havre is a fantastic game which I'm sure I will be playing a lot in the future!

RATING: 4
More fun than Agricola as players can develop in any way they like rather than having to work towards the same well-rounded but ultimately inefficient farm. Timing is everything, particularly towards the end. The downside is that as more and more buildings become available, players with AP may slow the game down to a crawl and it's a long game already. Familiarity with the cards (or just the ability to see the minute symbols on them from across the table) would surely help with planning.

I really liking the interaction among players in this one. This is a game with lots of tough decisions without being overly complex, either take goods are visit a building. I like how the buildings come out and how players interact with those buildings. The replay in this game is awesome and the game can be played with a short version, or long version. The game does play a bit longer but the turns are surprisingly quick. I may give this a 10 if solo play was better.

Love this game - almost as much as Agricola, for many of the same reasons. Despite this, it is different enough to warrant owning both.

My only criticism is the variety between game plays. We hardly ever use the special buildings, and that is all that changes. I fear that after I play this enough, I may start to get bored with it. Hopefully some future expansion will come that will not just introduce new special buildings.

One other plus is that it is less stressful than Agricola, while still have a risk reward system.

It's one of those games where 3 hours later you look at your watch and expect only an hour to have passed.  The game moves along at a nice zippy pace leaving you with only one or two actions to do per round - so it's good that there are 20 rounds to get your goals accomplished.  It feels like Agricola in that you have build your point scoring machine while still having to worry about feeding your people, which can hinder your plans for most of the game.  However, it does feel less punishing and doesn't force you to dip into every area of the game to have a competitive score, which is a welcome change.  Even though I still prefer Agricola, the pace and ease to explain the rules make this one worth trying out.

Rated 7 after one play. But admittedly, that's a bit difficult, as this game requires multiple plays for a fair rating. 

A good friend/fellow gamer kept good-naturedly hounding me to play this game. "I hadn't played Le Havre?!" Nope, largely because I knew this mega-resource 2+ hour conversion game would take some time, and I was probably lazy. Now that I've played it once, I can guess it won't be my favorite, but it's not awful.

Things going against it are the play length and the fact that there's a bit of solitaire play going on. Plus, I tend to enjoy games that offer a harsh system instead of a "playground" of options. 

However, things going for it are that the resource conversion options are actually fairly thematic. If felt different to pump out fish or bread vs. coal or iron. Although a first play left me ignorant to the various buildings that later emerged, the game offers a nice story arc. And lastly, I dig the fact that on your turn you're basically gobbling resources or choosing a building. The only drawback is the dizzying array of choices (though I'm sure that gets better with familiarity). 

Bottom line -- I'd play this again and see if my opinion improves with familiarity.

Update: Check that initial rating. Bump it up to an 8. After playing it the night before, I'm still thinking about it and possible strategies. I'd like to try this as a three player game.

Update: OK, so I played a three player game, and this drops to a 6, where I think it will stay. Between the plays, I played a couple of games of Agricola and Homesteaders. Both are resource heavy games, and both I ultimately like better. Homesteaders is the closest comparison, with a number of resources, buildings with different abilities, and expanding options. However, Homesteaders offers an auction that is more engaging, and it plays in half the time.

Not good to play with more than 3 players.  Wood is far more important than the others in order to build ship.  But the shipping line is too slow to delivery the items.  Hard to prevent from getting loans for tons of feeding requirements.  Keeping all grains and cattle in my backyard waiting for turning them into meat and bread.  But finally they are all stuck in my inventory or given to workers  during feeding phase.  Too busy to look around the buildings from different players.  Sometimes the buildings are never used but just for gaining score.  Just my comments only.

Any game that is good solo and multiplayer is a versitile gem worth having. However the variety of Agricola is just not there for the solo game. As a multiplayer though it has a little more class than agricola. The ability to use other players buildings makes this interesting every time.

RATING: 6
(6-4-10; initial impression after first play) What this game does, it does very well: it provides a very intricate and robust exercise in resource conversion. It does not feel tight by any means, but that is not necessarily a negative. The vast tableau of building options is quite overwhelming and, besides what appears to be a late-game run for the big VP converters, there isn't a ton of competition for buildings. The build-up of the resources on the offer spots becomes an embarrasment of riches, and the temptation to chase the big piles needs to be fought. This is not to say it is a loose game. It just allows for a incredible amount of creativity to build a VP engine. Unfortunately, efficiency engines just not being my thing, this will likely never be a favorite. Regardless of the level of interaction that might be achieved by serious players, I can't imagine this game moving too far beyond an exercise in playing more against the game than against other players. And for a game that can take a considerable amount of time, I don't see jumping at the opportunity to play this too much. 

One issue that I found iritating on the first play was the very little opportunity to make money off buildings. As the scale of the game grows, the payments to use building seem paltry. Moreover, it felt like some of the buildings are really only there for the VPs. Of course, there are probably good uses for just about all of them that I just didn't get on my first play. Not surprising.

Provisional rating based on 1 play. It was excellent, and seemed to open up a world of possibility. Future plays will decide. I can't see it moving downward, but upward mobility is possible. Very excited to play again. 

2nd play. Stays at an 8. It's a deep deep game. The mechanics are great and it plays very smoothly. I just don't know quite what to make of it yet. I thought I took on a lot of debt, but managed to pay it off rather quickly. So maybe I didn't push it far enough? It seems like there are great extremes in here, but I haven't found them yet. Very much looking forward to play #3 to see what else I can figure out.  

Trade interest extremely low. Don't feel like I should move on from it, but will trade for certain highly desired items. 

Traded away. In the end, it was just more work than I cared for, without the type of reward I am looking for. It's a great game, but its not my game.

Sure, there's strategy involved and a lot of decisions to make (particularly as more buildings come into play), but interaction is largely non-existant - you can't even reasonably deny people from resources like in similar games, for gods sake. Everyone continually loops round a straight 'track' with different resources on each spot, and only the player whose turn it currently is can decide to take the resources there or not. The closest you'll get to interaction is buying a good building first, or blocking others from using a building while you're in it.

In addition, the game is absoloutely painful if anyone suffers from AP, even with only three players. Mind you, even if everyone takes their turns fairly quick it still goes on for far too long, with lame ducks potentially forced to sit through an excruciating 1 to 1 1/2 hours for the end to finally come. At least, say, Race for the Galaxy has the decency to end quickly when one or more people are in 'lame duck' situations.

:tobacco: :) :D :D :) :what: So I've long maintained that I prefer Le Havre to Agricola, but I'm forced to rethink a little bit. The acid test: I have the iOS versions of both, and even allowing for the fact that iAgricola is marginally quicker and more polished visually than Le iHavre, and even allowing for the fact that Agricola's the new hotness for me the play stats tell a story: over a hundred games on the farm vs. maybe one in the harbor. Them numbers don't lie. One-nil to the 'Gric. Top 10 adjusted accordingly. 
Regardless of the relative merits of the two, and the inevitable urge to compare them, I would definitely say that (dis)liking one does not imply (dis)liking the other. Obviously, I like both, but they are different experiences.

Agricola is a leaky boat in a small but choppy lake that a snake has just gotten into; you know exactly where the shore is but you've got a lot of bailing and snake rasslin' to do before you get to shore. Le Havre is a sturdy vessel in a calm blue ocean with no land in sight, no map, and a busted GPS; you pretty much have to commit to a course of action and hope like hell you're going in the right direction.

[UPDATE: I have subsequently started picking up games of iOS Le Havre (and a face-to-face game with the actual bits) after a long period of neglect (and burning myself out with the aforementioned hundred-plus games of Agricola) and reminded myself of why I like it, though Agricola still shines a bit brighter. But both are nines for me, solidly, and which one I play depends on mood more than a head-to-head comparison where one comes solidly on top.]

RATING: 3
More and more I'm learning that I like games where on my turn, I make decisions that I hope will encourage my opponents to make decisions that are in my interest too. Agricola has a small amount of this because differentiation is so strongly rewarded: action selections are a kind of bid ("stay away from this path and we will both profit"). I didn't see any evidence of this in Le Havre, which doesn't make it a bad game, but it does help make it one I'm not really interested in these days.

Other things in Le Havre that make it lousy for me include the unreal amount of information and lookahead that players need to process to play well (our 4-handed game was at least as computationally demanding as 5p Agricola), the dumb, tedious refilling of resource spaces every turn (also bad in Agricola but more annoying here because it happens 140 times instead of 14, literally an order of magnitude more even if each restocking here is only a couple of chits), but above all else the art.

Le Havre has such bad interface design that it makes Agricola look like Go. The game is an absolute mess on the table. The cards have lovely Where's Waldo art on them but print important information in tiny, hard-to-read font in colors that are not always that different from the background. The icons for resources are barely OK when they're right in front of me and are certainly not OK at any distance. The difference good presentation makes, especially in a 'hard' (information-heavy) game like this, can be huge.

RATING: 8
Good solid game, very meaty for all of you who love heavier games.

In the end I decided to trade this game. For me:
1. It was just too long (especially for newer players and people who I would play boardgames with) 
2. I always am a bit miffed with Chore-like mechanisms. This has a "feed your people" mechanism in it, which is good design but for me it is a limiting factor - almost like a job or some work that must be done you HAVE to feed your guys otherwise you lose. That, to me, is more like a job than a fun thing to do. 

BUT, I rated this game an 8 - these two points are moot and they are my personal experience only. The game as a whole - is a pretty awesome game. You should definately play it a - it is balanced to perfection and make sure you make the most of the special building cards :)

We can't decided if this game or Agricola has a harder strategy.  The turns are simpler in Le Havre, but the interaction of the goods is much more complicated.  

It's really funny when Christine gets upset that she's not winning, and then wins.

The theme does not work as well as my other Rosenburg favorites but the game mechanics are sublime. This slow, inexorable climb from tiny beginnings to cresting with massive cache grabs and transactions achieves a wonderful mercantile growth arc during the course of the game. Despite the theme, the satisfaction of growth and accomplishment shines through in play.

One play so far.  Interesting, but unforgiving.  It will be a puzzle figuring out the best/efficient strategies.  Unfortunately, I think it is too long and too prone to knowing the cards to be something I introduce often.

Played again 3-player and the game is infinitely better in this format.  Instead of one player being punished with only 1 turn per round, everybody has 2 turns in a round and the starting player for the round gets a "bonus" round.  The flow is much better with this slight change to the 7-turn round.

Own, for .99, on iPad, not the board game.  I'm still trying to understand how it all works (even with the lengthy tutorial in the app).  It seems fun, but maybe a little heavier than I am used to.  I'll give it more plays with time and update this if the rating changes, and/or if I actually buy the physical game.  Wish there was an "I have the app" status to checkmark.

Update 4-8-2016 to 7.5, I traded Village away for Le Havre, the actual game, and I enjoy it.  It is fun but seems a little long.  I think next time I will go the "shorter" game route.

I have not yet taught it to my kids so after one physical learning game, which I gave up on after "getting it" about 6 rounds in, I played the iPad version several more times (though never to completion).

It's fun, I like it, but it just feels long.  With more plays I think the rating will increase, but it's just hard to tell at this time.  I really, really want to love this one...

I like the way the mechanisms of the game link together, and the flow of the game if very enjoyable as far as speed of play. The cards also inject a good amount of variability without getting crazy (like these games that keep producing endless expansion decks) although maybe that's coming.

For some reason this one fell a bit flat with the local group, so my chances to play are somewhat limited.

Quite enjoyable. Somewhat more freedom than agricola but still a very tight game where every action is absolutely crucial. Definitely some "dominant" strategies but they are fairly well balanced against one another I think. Also some "standard" type openings but the game quickly opens up from there. Overall quite good and I think will be worth 10+ plays in the long run for me.

Le Havre is yet another take on the worker placement game, though it emphasizes that element a lot less than its older sibling Agricola. Like Agricola, it's rather difficult to explain quickly though. Suffice to say that each round there are 7 player turns. When a player's turn comes up, they add some resources to the available spaces, and can then do two things: 1) take resources from one of the available resource spaces without placing or moving their only worker. 2) Place or move their worker to an open building spot. Buildings starts out seeded in a limited fashion in town and can be later built by players. They do the usual worker placement stuff: make basic resources which can be refined into more advanced stuff for some trouble, some of which can be sold for VPs directly (in this game via the purchasable ships with the use of shipping lines or via some VP creation shops) and some of which can be used to put up better buildings which score a load of VPs ala Puerto Rico but which also have in-game uses. Like Agricola, this game has a food pressure element. Unlike Agricola, there are no significant random elements that are not shared by the players. The buildings that are available for sale are sort of randomized, but the order they will come out in is known. This appeals to me.

This game is like Caylus in that players are sometimes tempted to spend too much time looking at what the buildings actually do versus how much they're worth. A major reason why you want to put up anything, at least for the first part of the game, is because it is giving you a very good VP return on your chit investment. The coins and food you have coming in when people use them, like Caylus, is a sideshow. The ability to use your own for free is certainly more powerful than in Caylus, but paying attention to the VP value should still be a high priority. That said, there are certain combos that can be very useful to have (i.e.: buildings that feed off of having certain symbols, easy access to a favoured terminus building or any pairing of buildings that helps refine base materials into finished goods at one spot and then sell it at the next) and keeping that in mind can also be useful...this is a definite plus over Caylus where I think the building ability really is almost pure fluff most of the time.

The main flow of the game seems to be build up stuff with an eye on putting up one or two buildings, use those to create a critical mass of something, and then use that something to either cash in or put up valuable buildings and/or ships. You don't need to own all of the buildings that you plan to use regularly, but it definitely helps because of the lack of continual entry fees which can really make otherwise useful buildings unalluring, especially when you're relying on loans to cover end of round costs.

Overall, I think this game is a good take on the worker placement genre, though it's more loosely in that genre than most that I would slap the label on. I like it quite a bit more than Agricola (my #2 game in this style), and that has made me drop my rating for that game a point. One thing that is challenging here is that it has the opposite tension of Agricola, and it seems to always catch me when I play: the temptation to try and do too many things at once. The game constantly presents you with seeming gifts, but if you take them all, you'll never have enough time to do anything. Unlike Agricola, figuring out one or two good ways to produce VPs in this game is crucial, and deviating from that single-mindedness will slow you down and leave you eating the dust of the person who is staying on task more effectively. It's very important that you have a use for all of the chits you're gathering...I see many new players left with extra crap at the end of the game and they are forced to just use the Bridge over the Seine to get rid of it all. Avoid the temptation, find a strategy and stick with it and you should be rewarded.

In terms of length, this game is considerably longer than Agricola, at least if one plays the full game. I can see why some people like the short game, because it eliminates a few of the silly early turns, but the players in the long game seem to develop a larger collection of buildings, and the overall story arc is more full and interesting. I would be reluctant to play the short game at this point, though the long game is definitely in the over 2 hour range, which some people will find too much for a game of this type.

Upsides: interesting variety of ways to approach it. No randomness outside of the setup phase and special buildings, which are, for the most part, usable by anyone anyway.

Downsides: analyzable as a result. The kind of game that encourages study, and where those who have studied will mop up those who aren't as knowledgeable. At least it's not on BSW, which will likely keep people further down the learning curve, thankfully.

The bottom line: this will likely appeal more to the hardcore Euro crowd who dislikes randomness and who is annoyed by some of those elements in Agricola. It is not as accessible though, and will be very unforgiving of player skill disparity. Like Caylus, it is probably a little too long for what it is. I like it more than Agricola currently by a fair margin: I like the shared random cards of Havre vs. the personalized random cards of Agricola and I also like the scoring system here that doesn't reward spreading out into every area every game like Agricola does. 

Repeat play also seems to confirm what I initially suspected, this game gets better with additional play. Part of this is because you can become more familiar with the buildings, the other part is simply having a better feel for what you can do with the different things you're collecting and how to manage your stuff. One initial impulse that players have is to actually try and keep up with the feeding perfectly at all times, and that, overall, seems to be a mistake as well-timed loans are often worth much more than they cost and are the quickest way to accrue large piles of stuff. In general, AP seems to be decrease with experience as well, as it is easier to evaluate what the pile of chits that you've collected should be turned into. Solid work by Rosenberg though, definitely one of the best of 2008. It also scales down extremely well and is a particularly excellent 2 player game. The extra actions you get at the lower scale actually make me favour it more at the 2-3 scale. The game is also shorter while giving each player more actions.

Resource management game with lots of difficult choices (as is true with the best types of these games).  Escalating food requirements in each round keeps the pressure up.  Have played with 2, 3, and 4 players (and solo), never with 5.  The "sweet spot" seems to be with either 2 or 3 players.

I find this game interesting to play, yet can be highly frustrating at the same time.  I sometimes think that the "Harbor Watch" special building should be a regular building, perhaps even with three players.

WOW! I love this game. Its a different vibe than Agricola (I miss the cards) but also has similar concepts.

A building and shipping game in its core, it has very deep strategies and very little, if any, luck. If you didn't like Agricola only because of the randomness the cards added, this is the game for you. It is a bit more of a "gamer's game" than Agricola, and if you like Agricola you should like this game as well.

Excellent game! I prefer it to the basic Agricola because it is more flexible. There is more than victory path and there is more flexibility in pursuing certain victory path. I have not given Le Havre 10 because, firstly, some of the special buildings are too situational. The buildings are one of the few elements that keep the game fresh but too often they have minimal impact on the gameplay. Secondly, I find the theme of Le Havre somewhat strange and counterintuitive. Why do I have to feed my workforce at the certain point of time? This makes sense in Agricola (harvest represents time from autumn to spring) but not in Le Havre. Why does grain multiply in my warehouse? Why does a single grain token multiply but not a single cattle token? Surely the cattle marker does not stand for just one animal given the scale of harbour business? etc However, these issues are really minor gripes.

Wow. Very pleasantly surprised. Only because I like it much more than Agricola. This almost feels Knizia-like in its math progressions. This hit all the right buttons for me, starting with the great bits, and great rules. I love how turns are so simple. And you can sort of see what's coming up, and make some plans, but the thing you might want could be blocked by someone going there first, but there are plenty of options usually. I love how you don't really need to understand the cards to play the first game. So it's almost trivially simple to explain and get into. There's a strong temptations to get "stuff". In my two games so far, both times I've ended with tons of extra resources. Seems like learning how to fix that would be a good thing. We played with 3 players, which just from the feel it seems the best number. The 3 hour playing time is well exagerated, if people are focussed. This is NOT Through The Ages long.

Played a shortened two player and solo game. And gosh it is hard! But the art looks wonderful, and it's fun to play. Just have to get a bit more familiar with all the buildings. And just like in Agricola you haven't got enough turns haha. Great can't wait to start doing the full game.

Got in a couple of more short games and we are definitely improving.

Must say the full game is even more fun. There is more time and it allows for more strategies to be used. But still not enough time. I still love this game. And hope for more games like this one.

Even in 2013 I still love this game. Nothing better than resource management.

It's interesting to read through the low-rated comments for this game. Many do not truly understand what kind of class Le Havre belongs to, so their remark becomes just as artificial and constructed as the game is.

Le Havre is, at its heart, [i]resource conversion[/i]. Pick up one resource, transform it into another using simple rules (and possibly another resource); then spend that converted resource on something else. In Le Havre you have two options: another resource or points + privately owned (but publically usable) resource conversion rules. There is little snowballing; it is not an economic engine; it is not worker placement (because only one resource conversion action can be blocked per player). Where is the challenge in this conversion process: managing blockages and shortages caused by other players (for example contention at a resource conversion rule to turn iron into steel, or contention to decide to go for that rule or the stack of fish to avoid a penalty at the end of the round), and squeezing more points out of your conversion process than your opponent. Yes, resource conversion blocking does have a similar feel to being excluded in a worker placement game; but it's a side effect in Le Havre, not the main intent. The main idea is to simply come up with a conversion path which works better than that of an opponent. Making the issue difficult is that the path is not really decided upon prior to the game's start: it evolves along with the actions of the players. The trick is in recognising tactical opportunity more than in developing strategic paths save very obvious ones.

It is then clear why there is so much debate on which of the two (actually, three) 'harvest trilogy' games is 'best'. Many would not even consider Loyang, even shun it, but it deserves a spot still the same. Agricola isn't about resource conversion but worker placement, although it does share the resource [i]taking[/i] as well as the breaking effect of food on the player's own little empire. Agricola's strong point is in recognising synergies of a [i]personal[/i] set of cards which allow the player to 'work around' the limitations of the shared worker placement actions. Then Loyang: a simple resource conversion game, but makes resources privately held in addition to featuring no brake; instead the players are simply required to perform the absolute best they can. Action cards are drawn from and bartered against a common pool, and become privately held for a short time; there is with the exception of one action no limit on how many actions a player can take in his own turn. So which is best? For me, Loyang. The braking effect of Agricola and Le Havre feels annoyingly artificial, introduced just to give players pause about the balance of their actions. You don't get rewarded for exceeding the game's demands here: in Loyang, on the other hand, you [i]are[/i]... Because, quite simply, you'll do better as a whole! Loyang is also the simplest to set up and explain, featuring a modest deck of action cards. Yes, there is a disadvantage too: ultimately, less replayability.

In any case back to Le Havre. Personally, I think that it is mostly the game's length that kills it for me. There really is too little interesting stuff to do, and too much battle against artificial emotionless food numbers, to fill the length of time it takes to completion. Le Havre is all about becoming frightfully good at pushing lots of buttons operating complex machinery: one of my least favourite ways of being entertained. I want to creatively out-think my opponents, and that's not something that happens here. The game is simply too tactical in nature... And although such titles have a place too in my collection, they should definitely have a shorter playing time.

What I also find an issue already is the game's presentation. It is annoying to peer at others' tableau of cards trying to read what the cards do. You do remember a part of what is in front of players after a while; but sometimes you realise that you're playing in too complex a fashion because this-and-that card would aid you considerably. I gather it's even worse in Le Havre's successor, Ora & Labora. It does not make me want to go out and play that game, to be honest.

The problem is players need a food engine, but the best food engines are difficult to obtain. So rather than building useful building players are spending time scrambling for food. Problem two: I'd prefer the good to be cards that I hold or wooden bits that feel good than cardboard chits far too many to track. Problem three: Mistakes are difficult to recover from.

My rating for the game reflects the fact that I tend to steer away from fiddly games.  And this one, with all it's little bits certainly qualifies.  While I like the game, it falls into another game category that I tend to stay away from: games where your ability to play is really enhanced by knowing what the various cards do.  For you to play effectively and even have a chance to win, you must pay close attention to what buildings other players have built and, even more importantly, you need to know how and when to take advantage of those buildings.  Maybe if I played this game frequently I would care, but seeing as the likelihood of that happening is low, this game is one I will pass on.

RATING: 9
I like a game where at it's core has very simple choices. This really fits that bill and since the complexity comes slowly (as you add buildings) it makes for what I consider a great game. I wish the text was a little larger and it was a little shorter. Although I can't see anyway you could make it shorter and the chits are small, so goes the text.

Le Havre is a mainstay in my apartment as a go-to for game nights. I usually get beaten by my friends who are more experienced in strategy board games. Even when I know I'm bound to lose, it's a fun game with a scoring system where it's just satisfying to try to beat personal bests.

Sometimes the rounds seem a little predetermined, but there are many ways to utilize your strategy to yield the most effective results.

Le Havre is simply an awesome game - especially with the integrated Le Grande Hameau!!!  I like the game with 3 or 4 players best.  This is another heavy thinker Euro style game with amazing replayability.  The build up of the available town buildings creates a cool build up dynamic and forces players to really think about timing issues and best build up courses of action.  This is also a game that grows on you after five to ten plays as you want to keep coming back for more and more.  I love the game play mechanisms and the tightness of the game - "if only I had one more turn or one more move" - the game keeps you on edge constantly with very little downtime!!! Le Havre has made my list of Top 20 euro style games of all time.

Same crap, collect things, upgrade those things, feed some workers, harvest, repeat. This thing isn't exciting, it's boring. How many of these things can this guy crank out?

Is this man capability of anything else?
Pick a theme buy one game, you got all you need.

The other cash cow, pull out a small mechanism, slap 2 players on the box, phone it in.

There are reviewer who go into rants, major ones, when they see repeated themes, Egyptian, Mediterranean trading, but have no problems with basically the same core mechanism with only the player count changed and a different theme glued on.

What's up with that?

9.10.11 Excited to try this one out. Looks like a fun version of Agricola. One reason I'm excited is this game rewards you for specializing while Agricola requires you to do a little bit of everything. I saw another user describe it as Le Harve rewards you for actions while Agricola requires you to take actions and punishes you if you don't do the right ones.

Like:

-The exponential gain of wealth throughout the course of the game.
-Multiple paths to victory.
-The length of the game fits the weight of the game very well.
-The board and cards are brilliantly designed to make playing the game intuitive.

Don't Like:

-When my unruly stack of cow chits scatter all over the place.  Read: the little cardboard goods are a pain.
-There is not a ton of variance from one game to another.  Once you have established your wealth (mid game?) you can run with a similar strategy every time if you wanted to.

Engrossing game, with interesting interlocking paths of how-to-use-resources. I'm immensely glad that rules for a short game were included; I feel like it'll be much more manageable time-wise (and fun) once we have a non-trivial number of the short games under our belt. Even the short version can easily run too long if players don't take turns promptly. 

My current rating is for the short game - the longer game may boost it a bit, as I suspect the depth-to-time ratio will be better.

EDIT: I'm now tired of the short game. I still enjoy the longer one, but rarely find it worth breaking out given the length.

Think about a resource collection and management game, on the vein of Caylus-on-steroids, add to it a lot of different resources, card building, ships, and you got it.
If there is something to blame on the game, it's the length of it (the full game). With 5 players it took more then 3.5 hours to complete it. But you have the possibility to play the shorter version , so I believe this is the best resource management game out there today.

Another euro where knowledge of all the cards (buildings/ships in this case) and their relative values is a prerequisite to any sort of strategy.  That in itself is annoying, but it's especially annoying here because each game of Le Havre takes hours, so getting that knowledge is a big time investment.  

UPDATE: Now that Ora et Labora exists, I don't feel the need to ever really play this. 

iOS Version:
I'd rate it an 8. The option of requesting hints helps you learn the ropes of the game, and the fact that there's AI players means you can finally enjoy playing in 20 minutes instead of 3 hours.  Downsides include draining your battery and subpar AI players.

After playing Agricola I was pretty sceptic about this game. Turns out I like Le Havre a lot more than Agricola. Most mechanics make sense (theme-wise) and there's more interaction - it's even possible to be a bit of a jerk to fellow players. 
However, it's not a game I must have.

RATING: 10
A seemingly wide open game which can frustrate the first-time player into wondering what to do. The game offers several paths to accumulating money and I like the exponential growth of it towards the end. The fixed number of actions provides a framework for playing the game and also induces a rhythmn to game play. I like it two and three player and avoid higher player counts. It can take long to play with new players, but the experience is great. There's enough player interaction (blocking, mostly) to cause your best laid plans to fall behind. An excellent game for an afternoon.

The suffocating hardships of Agricola are not to be found here, but rather the players are just trying to choose the best options out of many good ones. The theme does come through somehow - "I'm just a poor boy with 5 francs and a piece of coal in my pocket" - but in the end building a farm in Agricola is much more immersive. That said, Le Havre is a good game that I recommend to people interested in heavy, positive eurogames.

Rating based on solo play only, which is rather boring. There is practically no randomness and there are way too many options, which make it seem more like work instead of a game.

Part of Uwe Rosenberg's harvest trilogy. I own and enjoy Agricola (and Caverna), but haven't played The Gates of Loyang yet. Have only played Le Havre once and enjoyed it quite a bit. Would like to play again soon and might buy/trade this one into my collection.

There are a lot of different paths to take in the game.  I liked being able to choose your path.  It seemed like it all funneled down to one property at the end, though...that's the only thing that keeps me from wanting to play it a lot more.

The length of this game is what kills it for me.  It's fun for the first part, but then it just keeps going, and going, and going...

Fortunately, I have found that the two player game is a bazillion times better than a three player game.  It plays in about 1.5 hours, and doesn't feel like a total grind.  Moves can't be blocked indefinitely, so you can pick a strategy and go for it.

There's a lot going on Le Havre; possibly too much. I like that there are many different resources that can be used in a variety of ways to achieve your goals.  The game is long, though... far too long for the amount of fun you'll have.  Also, I just don't understand how the mechanic of "feeding" fits in with the game.  Mechanically it works but it just doesn't fit the theme and simply serves as some sort of outside force you have to deal with while trying to build up your cash and goods.

Ultimately it fixes some of my issues with Agricola but introduces new ones.  I'll certainly play the game but I doubt I'll ever recommend playing it.

I liked this a lot at first and preferred it to Agricola, due to its lack of what I saw as the card based luck factor in the Gric. Over time, however, I found that that I grew tired of it for the same reason: basically, a lack of variety.  Even though each game of Le Havre isn't the same, it *feels* the same to me, and the turns feel repetitive and fiddly.  I thought getting the expansion buildings might help, but they don't come up enough to make a big difference. In the end, it's ok, but I have no desire to play anytime soon...I think Uwe's other games, including Agricola, are simply deeper and more satisfying.

Le Havre is a game of construction and development in which players compete to achieve massive gains over an era spanning 60-70 years. You can become an industrial baron, a shipping magnate, a freshly minted aristocrat running Titanic-era luxury liners, or anything in between. You start out with a little cash and a small stock of coal to use as energy, and from there it’s a matter of which resources you grab and what you do with them. The one constant in Le Havre is abundant opportunity. The challenge is making the most of it. 
The first of a family of games and has expansions

RATING: 6
A very adequate follow-up to Agricola.  This game isn't nearly as good as Agricola, but it's about the same depth and has enough different rules and concepts going on that people will like it.  It'd be interesting to see how well (or not well) this game would've done were it *not* the Agricola follow-up...  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Very similar to Agricola regarding its mechanics (same designer), altough, in here, there is not so much stress about feeding one´s population.
The game flows according to its theme and with some nice and logical ideias. In spite of beeing a crucial and important element in the game, the building tiles require some previous knowledge of their features, so that one can really enjoy the game, as reverse to Agricola, where those tiles are less and more easy to perceive. Besides, the mechanics behind the tiles unlock is ingenious but also not so easy to get at first plays.
In Le Havre, a player has usually just two or three options to do on his turn, but they are all almost always good options, the trick beeing to pick the one that is just slight better than the others. This is a nice ideia because it allows all players to develop their "companies" without sudden shortage of goods, like in other games of this kind.
Overall, i think this game drops just a litle behing Agricola, on account of the relative difficulty in perceiving the tiles.

Un juego cuya mecánica se explica en 10 minutos, y que proporciona a los jugadores una cantidad de caminos hacia la victoria inimaginable. Esencialmente se trata de un juego de gestión de recursos, se juega varias rondas (dependiendo del nº de jugadores), cada ronda son 7 turnos, y cada turno lo juega un sólo jugador, al final de la ronda hay que gastar una cantidad fija de comida/dinero que va siendo mayor a medida que avanza la partida. Los jugadores se verán obligados a "gastar" turnos en conseguir comida, y "utilizar" el resto de turnos en mejorar su posición en la partida consiguiendo dinero y/o edificios que son los que dan la victoria. Aquel jugador que sea capaz de jugar más turnos dedicados a su "economía" o que los utilice con mejor criterio será el que gane la partida. Un juego apto para no jugones, y genial para los jugones ... el pero ... prepara 3 horas para jugarlo ;)

RATING: 8
Huge number of choices each turn, which (like Agricola), escalates each turn.  One of the best resource collection and engine-building games I've played. So many different paths to pursue here for VPs. Truly an economic game with some worker payment (food) thrown in to keep players honest.  

Lots of opportunities for AP, but quite a rewarding game.  Edges out Agricola in both gameplay and setup/maintenance.

Definitely needs some containers in which to place all the resource tokens. Otherwise, the board becomes a mess during game play. 

I'm happy to find that the short version of this game is almost as fun as the full game (just miss out on the Special Buildings), and it's nice to have that as a very playable option in half the time. 

Edit 3/11/16: I'm starting to get a little burned out on this now. I feel like I've explored it enough after 25 plays. Less interested in playing it, although I still find it a fun game. Just lowering my rating a bit.

A well designed game of resource management and conversion. Good quality cards and cardboard with functional art style fitting the theme. Slightly randomized building offer gives each game a bit of a different flavor without drastically changing game play. A good mix of strategy and tactics.

Fiddly to manage with the small chits moving to and from the supply board, offer, and player areas. Game is rather long though.

RATING: 10
In a way, this reminds me of Roads & Boats.  You build up an infrastructure, which other players can use, with a variety of resources which can be converted into superior forms.  It can also be played solo. 

Edit:  After a few more plays, I've upped my rating from an 8 to a 9, and I've only played it solo.  I'd really like to play it with others someday.  (Since writing this, I have played multi-player.  After doing so I raised my score to a 10).

There are some really brilliant and innovative design elements going on here.  First, I love how each resource has an improved version, and you just flip the chit to indicate this.  Second, I like how buildings can be bought with money, or built with resources.  The back of the cards contain information that makes set-up a breeze.  I also find it refreshing that money = victory points.  

This game has been occupying my thoughts in a way that no other game has for quite a while.  So far the best solo score I have achieved is 335.

An excellent game and a fairly epic one, especially with the amount of setup required.

We made a custom board so all buildings (which we mark with old Risk pieces to show ownership) can be placed collectively in the center of the table. Makes seeing/reading/comparing the buildings much easier.

RATING: 9
- Number of games played: at the time of writing I have played 6 2-player games

- Gameplay: 4/4. Le havre is a very intense worker placement game that will burn your brain to ashes. Player interaction comes in the form of blocking the opponent from performing his preferred move and by being first at grabbing the best resource stockpiles and buying and using the best buildings. In case you love Agricola, I think you absolutely need to give Le Havre a try. Surprisingly, Le Havre is not Argricola with merely a different theme pasted onto it; it really has a different feel to it. Personally I like it even more than Agricola, because of two things. First, you get enough time to accomplish what you were planning to. Secondly, every turn you need to choose between several good alternatives.

- Absence of luck: 4/4. There are a few random elements in the game, all at the time of set up: the order of the resource replenishment, the starting player, the order of the buildings and the selection of the available buildings built by the town. However, I can't see how they might determine the winner.

- Duration: 2/4. With 2 players a game can be played in 2.5 to 3.5 hours, which is long, but it certainly doesn't feel long when playing. It is just long enough to allow the players to finish their plans.

- Theme and looks: 4/4. Le Havre is good looking and the harbor theme is well integrated. It lacks the cute meeples like in Agricola, but I don't see how they would have been able to fit everything in the box.

- Set up/clean up time: 3/4. I'd say it takes 10 minutes to set up and 10 to clean up for a single person, so with experienced players all giving a helping hand, it can be done in 2 times 5 minutes.

- Learning curve and documentation: 3/4. Really easy to learn, with not too much tiny rules to remember. Everything is quite straightforward and the rule book is clear and even contains a sample game.

- Like: rewarding gameplay, luck free, perfect 2 player game, nice theme, highly competitive, enough player interaction, suffictient variation

- Dislike: longish

Le Havre is much more forgiving than Agricola, the game to which it is most frequently, if dubiously, compared. You can borrow if you fall short of food. (In fact, doing so is a viable strategy, at least for a few rounds.) Also, if another player snatches the resource you're interested in, you probably can use a building to get it instead, and, if a building is unavailable, there'll be plenty of other useful resources to choose from.

What a great game when it comes to all the choices you have during play. While it can start a little slow and limited, it quickly ramps up and you always want to do everything in one turn. It's  another one of those winners in that the basic gameplay is very simple, but the sheer amount of avenues and strategies you can take seem endless. So far, no games I've played have been alike, largely depending on the style of play from the players. Interaction is light but just enough to keep you interested, along the lines of Puerto Rico or Dominion.

[2011-07-21 Rating: n.a. -> 9.5]

Le Havre is just great. The game itself is dead easy to explain: Each round, after adding some resources to the map, you can either take one pile of resources or you can use one of the available building actions. In addition, you can also buy and sell buildings or ships. And when a round is over, you have to feed your workers. Money is as good as actual food for this purpose and it's even better to own a ship as it will give you some food automatically.

Repeat this procedure for a set number of rounds after which every player counts his money and the richest player wins.

While this short description outlines the rules of Le Havre, it doesn't even give you the slightest idea of the fun you can have while playing this gem. It doesn't mention the narrative arc of Le Havre where in the beginning you start with nearly nothing. Your choices what to do are very limited and focus around the resources you'd like to take. Somehow you manage to start your business and suddenly it's more about the building's action and the ships you need so desperately. In the end, you're hopefully not struggeling anymore but trying to earn the most cash possible with each of your actions. Best of all, this all happens in an "open world" setting. As this games offers a lot of possible strategies, there is a lot to experiment with.

But all this fun comes with a prize. First, the game is long. A four player games lasts about three hours. I do enjoy this experience but I know that it can be tough to find people to join you on this ride. 
Another thing is the complexity of the game. In my first games, I didn't have the slighest idea how to play this one. You are facing a plethora of options and it's completely up to you to evaluate them. This can be overwhelming. I took the time to discover Le Havre using the excellent Java version that is available [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/42763/jlehavre-1-26]here[/url]. But I know, not everyone wants to invest that much into a game. Although, this is one of the games that's totally worth the effort. If you like complex economic games, give Le Havre a try.

Un gros jeu pour joueurs, au matériel superbe et au gameplay très simple et fluide pour une profondeur tactique et stratégique maximale !

La multitude des possibilités de marquer des points rend ivre de plaisir mais au final, c'est la frustration de ne pas pouvoir faire tout ce qu'on veut qui pousse chacun à programmer minutieusement chacune de ses actions, tout en s'assurant d'empêcher les adversaires de mettre en oeuvre leurs plans.

Les règles sont d'une simplicité enfantine ce qui permet de le proposer à des joueurs occasionnels. En revanche, la maîtrise des combinaisons de cartes viendra progressivement après plusieurs parties.

Je trouve que le jeu révèle tout son potentiel avec les règles longues et à 3-4 joueurs.A 2 joueurs, c'est bien aussi, mais à 5 ça devient le bazar.

Le Havre est à posséder absolument !

Plaisir enfin retrouvé sur iOS iPhone et iPad, d'autant plus qu'aucun site en ligne ne le propose pour l'instant.

RATING: 10
Downgraded from a 10 because it bothers me a little that  more of the special buildings don't come into play. Which begs the question, if there were no special buildings at all, would I rate it a 10? Probably. But there ARE special buildings.

EDIT: It's great that there are so many special buildings. I'm just not playing this game enough. (Every other night = enough.) Re-upgraded to a 10.

EDIT: LH varies greatly across player counts. My rating of 10 is for 2p. 

Ratings by player count:
1p= 6 (Feels more like practice for the game than a game. I don't really like solo play in general though.)
2p= 10 (You know what your opponent must do; they know what you must do. Massive tension as you plan turns ahead.)
3p= 7 (Nothing gained by the addition of a 3rd player except downtime. The ability to plan ahead is greatly diminished. Offense is no longer a factor: if you directly mess with one player, you and that player will fall behind.)
4p= 5 (Ridiculously chaotic. A shadow of the 2p game.)
5p= 1 (unplayable)


Must try David Jones' 'No Shipping' variant:

"Setup your game as normal with the following changes:

1) Remove the shipping line from the standard buildings and replace it with the football stadium. Shuffle and and deal the three building piles as normal.

2) From the special buildings deck, remove the following:

Baguette Shop (03)
Clothing Industry (05)
Diner (16)
Forest Hut (10)
Furniture Factory (26)
Patisserie (19)
Steakhouse (32)
Tavern (28)

Leather Industry (21)
Brick Manufacturer (34)

3) Create a "fourth" building pile as follows: Put the Leather Ind and Brick Mfgr on the bottom of the pile randomly. Shuffle the other eight special buildings and place them on top. You should "fan" the row as you do the others so that you can see which buildings are due.

Rule changes:

1) At the end of the round, if the city is going to build a normal building, it ALWAYS builds the top card from the fourth building pile. If the city builds a special building, take it from the remaining special deck as you would in a normal game.

2) Just as with standard buildings, the top building of the fourth pile can be purchased at any time on your turn."

EDIT: I've now played the No Shipping variant a couple of times and it works every bit as well as the standard rules. Such a great addition to one of my favorite games!

RATING: 10
Not as heavy and cumbersome as I thought it would be after having spent half an hour getting the rules explained to me and looking at the cluttered board. Actually it's quite an elegant game as it takes the best parts from several of the other heavy Euros. Take something and convert it into something more valuable and then do something with it. Nothing new here. I like the fact that turns go really quick and that you only have one action per round. Not as AP prone as Agricola for example. 

Negative parts include the long playing time. It took us 2.5 hours to finish a short 3-player game. I dread to even think of how long a full game will take.

All in all a game I'll gladly play at least one more time. The jury is still out.

Update: This game gets better with each play. After having played the full game I'll never go back to basics again. 

Update 2: Better and better, now a 10 rating even. To me LH > O&L > Agricola.

Update 3: Finally managed to get a decent score in this game, 230 points in a 3-player game.

RATING: 9
This is the kind of heav game that makes you glad you play games.  Caylus + Agricola.  Working to build power buildings that anyone can use and then taking actions that others can't then take themselves.  Yummy.  However, Agricola has many of the same points, and also adds more replayability with the multitude of cards.  So this game has to lose a point in comparison.

Update 8-9: This deserves this point back.  Agricola's variability is all private.  You have the coolness of the cards, but nobody knows.  In Harv, the random order is pretty cool, and the special buildings are pretty cool (when not broken), but their being in the open makes the interaction make up for the lack of sheer quantity in Gric.  Gric is still more fun because you also have a little player mat farm, but this is a 9.

Avoid the "simple/quick rules" unless you just want to run through the mechanics.  They don't give the game enough depth to really warrant using.

I do like the full game.  Early on, the game goes by quickly as you acquire resources.  But by mid-game, once many buidlings have been built...the game presents a lot of decisions.  This game rewards a precise, narrow focus unlike Agricola where you want to do a little bit of everything. Unlike many worker placement games, this one can be a bit overwhelming as there are so many cards/buildings to view, analyze, and choose between.  As I've become more familar with the buildings this has become easier, but be prepared for a big learning curve. I'm not sure about the variability of this game.  The goal seems to be to setup for shipping high value goods or purchasing luxury liners.  Need food?  No worries..take loans to do cover that.  It will conserve your actions.  The special cards are a must, but do they really change the game?  The ones that have come out in our game rarely have much of an impact.  Football stadium being a notable exception.

Order through Lookout Games. Got confirmation e-mail on 11/03/2008. Sent on 11/06/08. Received on 12/13/08.

Le Havre is an interesting variant on the worker placement genre that I quite enjoy. The decisions are interesting and challenging, and I really like how it "feels" like a port is being built out as the game progresses. It is not quite the thematic tie-in that Agricola has, but it is still a nice experience. The single action per turn and the ability to buy buildings without spending actions adds some nice twists to the strategic potential of the game, and I still feel like I am learning things about the game 4-5 plays in. The Special cards are interesting. A lot of them seem to open entirely new strategic dimensions, but it seems like a shame that they aren’t just "there" to be played like the other buildings. I understand that the primary reason for this is based on the timing of particularly buildings emerging. Just throwing Special cards into the three Building Proposals piles would prevent crucial buildings from ever emerging, but it would be nice if there was more of an ability to build strategies around which special abilities are available as opposed to just taking advantage of the ones that become available. I suppose that adds a nice, little tactical element though. 

Ora et Labora is strictly superior to Le Havre, and has replaced it in my collection.

this game can take over 4 hours
it is very in-depth and it changes every time you play it since there is so much to do and there is no way that you can possibly get everything done in the time permitted.
is very similar to other games like Puerto Rico and Agricola but over does it a little bit. Some of the buildings become useless and cumbersome to the game.

Players are running a French harbour, trying to amass wealth.  Players on their turn seed the play area with a few goods, then take a "main" action - either pick up goods or place their worker piece to action a space.  Then players are allowed to build/purchase buildings.  Repeat that for a couple of hours, feeding your (who?) at intervals along the way.  Most cash and purchases wins.  Simple to play, but disguised by a rulebook that makes you chase important concepts throughout, rather than presenting it logically.  Game play rapidly bogs down as more buildings become available (allow plenty of table space), but this should free up with experience.  Lots of Caylus in this, as you try to set up a victory point conveyor belt.  Fun solo variant, but watch the setup bug for the buildings.  Lovely art, tons of counters.  Solid effort.

RATING: 9
Excellent worker placement and resource management game.  At the most basic level, a player can either collect resources or do something with them each turn.  Much of the challenge is efficiently alternating and sequencing these two options.  The entire game is a multi-step process of gathering resources, upgrading them, and/or using them.  Each player must do this over and over again, many times during the course of the game.  At the same time, players must be prepared for the upkeep phase each round.

Despite the fact that there isn't a whole lot of variation to this general pattern from one game to the next, replayability doesn't seem to suffer.  The game incorporates several features to keep things somewhat interesting: the order in which resources accumulate, the order in which the standard building cards are dealt and who ends up with them, the special building cards that appear, and of course the actions of the players.  All of these elements lend enough variation to keep the game challenging and hold the players' attention.

The game has a very definite and deliberate progression, and staying on top of it is the key to winning.  It takes a few plays to understand how this works.  I am happy with the short game, but I have played the long game as well.

There are some neat things going on here, but this isn't very much fun or clever. It was a moreso a chore of scrambling to feed a growing population. Most of your precious actions go to unglamorous stuff like butchering cattle. The interactions here are also minimal; if someone is parked on the action you need to do then you must do something else (a la Caylus). Otherwise it's pretty much cube farming with 20+ goods.

Also the greater issue is that decisions feel  obvious and inconsequential. This is unlike Puerto Rico, where a very small menu of choices plays faster and also has greater impact.

Seriously dense point-engine game, similar to Agricola but more linear.  Huge replay value due to "Special Buildings" and differing configurations for number of players.  Even has a challenging Solitaire capability!

Highly recommended for people who like these sorts of games.

I think out of Agricola, Gates of Loyang and this, Le Havre might still be my favorite Uwe game.  All three games have similair mechanics to them, but there is just something more forgiving in Le Havre that makes it appealing for me.  Again, it's one of those games that is incredibly simple to learn and play, but extremely in depth and rewarding to discover once you decide your path and follow it to it's end game.

This is the most exquisitely engineered game I have encountered.  From the precisely measured game sequence for each player count down to the helpful tips on the backs of the cards, this game was clearly underwent exhaustive development and tuning.

I think I like Le Havre a little more than Agricola, largely because the game gives me more of a feeling of opportunity than desperation.  However, this game is surely at its heart a grinding exercise in optimization, and the fundamental soullessness at its core will likely keep me from ever loving it.  However, I can still enjoy it quite a bit. 

My favorite feature is the way that the special buildings give each game its own set of scoring potentials, so that you need to be agile in your strategy.

Big opportunity cost game.  I love it!  My favorite Rosenberg, some important worker placement but mostly THE GOODS.

"Do I smoke my fish now? Seems safe.  Almost next round, and then I'll have 3 actions to do what I actually want." 
"Pleaaaase don't move your worker onto that wharf.  Unless you mean to upgrade it.  Wait, you have no brick. I am boned."
"Good lord that's a lot of wood.  I really want that wood.  I would have to take 2 more loans at the end of the round, but someday I will thank myself for taking 12 wood right now."

If you enjoy saying these type of things to yourself for 3 or so hours, buy this game immediately.  This is definitely a Rosenberg game but it is a welcome departure from Agricola / Caverna while still keeping many of the interesting mechanics and feeling very polished.

The good:
- THE GOODS!  Interesting upgrade chains for goods, a variety of goods, makes all actions feel useful in some way.
- Various paths to victory, the road less traveled can many times be rewarding.
- Scales interestingly from 1 - 5 players, almost feels like a different game from 2-3 just with the number of turns present.

The bad:
- With enough plays I could see a victory formula emerging that players rush towards, limiting strategy exploration.
-  "Spreadsheet-ness" may turn some off, lots of calculations and possible AP.

Game features plenty of tough decisions, but does a great job of balancing actions and allowing players to diversify their strategies.  The order the buildings come out really makes each game quite unique.  I haven't played a lot of full games yet due to the length, but hope to find a few gamers keen to give it a few tries as the bonus buildings are really interesting.

I also like that even new players can do quite well, as long as you give a word here and there on optimal actions.

About 20 of my Le Havre plays have been on the iOS implementation.  Very satisfying with somewhat challenging AI.

Simple yet complex! Your only going to do one of two potential main actions on your turn but there is so much to consider and plan that once you think you know what your doing you may end up doing something entirely different.

After carverna came out, this dropped to 4th favorite in the Uwe rankings.  It does a lot right, but still manages to irritate me.  

This is one of those games with tons of available actions, and no time to do it all.  How long will you let the offers build up before grabbing them?  Do you want to try and build a building now, or wait till you can get more advanced things?  There are so many choices, you have serious potential for AP.  There's also the Uwe standard benchmarks, where you have to pony up resources at specified times.  

I like the way it has basic buildings that are always present, and special buildings that are available game to game.  I just think that the balance is off, with tons of basic ones coming out in pre-scripted orders and only a few specials.  This means that there might be some cool interactions, but the game is going to be dominated by the same relatively boring set of combinations.  You're always going to have a shipyard, but probably not a brick factory or sandwich shop.  

Other than that, there isn't much attraction to the game.  It becomes an exercise in churning resources around, converting them from type to type, and cashing them in for points.  It's not terrible, but Agricola has the cards over it, and Ora has the landscape building and placement challenge.  It may see some more play, but I won't be advocating it.

Similar to Agricola in that the precious currency of the game is the limited number of turns you can spend. Deciding how best to convert turns into combos, and then combos into points, is similar. Unlike Agricola, I prefer players not starting with random cards private to their engine.

This one may go up or down.  The ending of the first game I played left me feeling like I didn't understand the mechanisms at all.  I dislike when it "feels" like you're doing okay, only to end up utterly crushed.  I'm not sure if it's a mechanical thing, or just a learning thing at this point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't think it'll replace Agricola, its a bit more calculation heavy since everything is out in the open and there are more types of transactions that can be performed to build your economy. Certainly more wide open - you don't feel as constrained . I found it felt like some mix of Agricola and Brass, with some Caylus thrown in. That said, I did like it, though I'm sure some people will find it too complicated and dry.
 
Despite the confusing rule book, its not that complicated in practice:
On your turn you put out 2 types of resources (of which there is a around 8-10 basic resources, and that number of upgraded resources).
Then you have a chance to pickup resources, or buy/build a building (similar to caylus - you also get to charge a fixed rent to use it), or place your single worker on a building to take advantage of its ability.

The trick is combining your actions to meet your goals. That makes your turns a little static, as you've essentially planned them out way in advance. For example - I wanted to build a steel ship. That meant the next 5 turns had to be spent:
-getting iron
-getting coal
-converting coal to coke
-converting iron to steel using the coke
-spending the steel and coke to buy a steel ship
 
There are always multiple ways to do things - so unless two other players were competing at the same time in the same order... it seemed tough to really get put off track - at least in the 4 player game.

Finally got my hands on this thanks to my friend Adam so I could see what all the fuss was about.  While a tremendously fascinating game, I think it suffers the same problem that games like New York 1901 have in that your success has a bit of dependency on where you sit at the table.  However, unlike that game, there is such a wide decision tree once the game opens up that the issue is mostly negligible towards its conclusion, but holy crap will you ever feel it in the first few turns.

That aside, this is a game that I would play again - multiple times, even - but not one that I would introduce into my library.  The underlying gameplay is so mathematical that I would only have a very select few people that I would invite to the table to play it with.  That in no way is an admonishment against Le Havre - I just know my friends and you can't give them this kind of opportunity to sit there and work it out or you might as well just watch a movie while they take their turn.  As the game goes on, your options widen even further, so you can imagine the impact.

Like those friends, I like Le Havre.  I like it a lot, even.  I just wouldn't want it to move in with me.

It's all about them buildings. Find an engine and go with it, but like any Rosenberg game, make sure you can feed your people at the end of each round. There's a lot of good tension with how to spend your limited actions each turn/round.

I enjoy the game quite a bit (though less than Agricola), however it can get same-y after awhile so I try to space my plays of it out.

Also, I've only ever played with two and I have no desire to ever try it with more.

UPDATE: After some time, the flaws in Le Havre have started to get to me and I feel like this is one of my least favorite Rosenbergs.

We really enjoyed this one. The theme doesn't draw you in as strongly as in Agricola, but I really like the flow of the game and the choices available to you -- it feels like there are more options available to you in Le Havre than in Agricola without the clunkiness of Ag's occupation and minor improvement cards.

On the other hand, Le Havre doesn't draw you in as much as Agricola because of the theme. The whole farming theme has more of a draw that buying and smoking fish, but maybe with more plays, Le Havre will generate more interest.

This game is very interesting.  The designer states it's a combination of Caylus (making buildings and then using them for actions) & Agricola (accumulating resources, harvest and feeding).  Uwe has also tried to make it similar to Agricola in that it plays 1 - 5 players and there is a lot of variation game to game through the order of the building cards and the 6 special buildings in the game.  Le Havre is unfortunately like Agricola in that it also has a lot of bits that are constantly being moved around but also trying to see what buildings each player has is another chore.  The game also doesn't scale well with the number of players the game supports.  I find the two player game is too harsh to the players with food requirements and the five players would take far too long to get through.  Le Havre is in the minority of games that plays best with three which is good. I think Le Havre is a decent game, but Ora et Labora is pretty much Le Havre 2.0, rendering the original obsolete.

iOS, against AI

The more I play this, the less I understand the attraction. Like, where is the fun, man? This is a point salad with a theme stapled on, and an exceptionally expensive one, given URs penchant for cramming as much stuff into a box as possible (unless you bought the digital version, which is also expensive, just ). 

The quality of the product is above reproach, but the underlying logic of the game fails to satisfy. Perhaps the fun is in other people playing along?

RATING: 6
The start is always pretty exciting and fun, but gets more tedious as it goes on. In the end, you don't feel that satisfied, as often you have some regrets because the end came so quick, though the game is too long?!?

Still a good game and willing to play occasionally. Ugly art...

SOLD IT!

Too much going on with all your options spread into other player's play area. I guess I'm not a fan of a game where (if I've not played it very often), I need to keep squinting to see across the table at what others have for me to use.

Also it seemed to play waaay to long for my tastes.

That being said, having played it again, I do like resource engine games with simple turn actions.

RATING: 7
Well designed game. But much more complex than Agricola. There is more interaction between the player, which I enjoyed. At the end it became rather difficult to make my decision.

Agricola seems to me more easy to understand and play. Althougth I miss the interaction between the players.

Great game.  Almost perfect information.  With 99% of the information known, it makes it easy to feel like you can make plans and control your own game.  There seems to be a variaty of decent options in order to gain points.

Very much like Agricola, but your actions don't feel anywhere near as bad.  You always get to do something productive, instead of bad or worse in Agricola, it's typically good or better choices.  Really no diffeance, but it makes the game feel like your constantly doing well, instead of in Agricola where you always feel like your sucking wind.

RATING: 8
2-3 players seems ideal for this game, although it is fun with more.  The rules are simple, but strategy is complex; expect your first game to be a learning game, and to want to go back and make different decisions the second game.  It's long, but I've never had a problem with long games.  This game has a quality I like in a game, which is to examine the structure of the game, and derive a strategy based on it, and then attempt to execute/adjust along the way.

This game takes a lot of what I don't like about Agricola and really minimizes it. Namely, what I don't like about Agricola is that about 75% of your decisions are pretty forced. You need food. You need more family members. It takes a lot of work to get to those places. Le Havre has requirements you get to, but the way you get there feels much more open, especially because of the introduction of currency. My only qualm is the length. It's a long one.

Well designed game and I can see what the excitement/interest is all about.  This is similar in some ways to Agricola but it seems to me after one play to be even more fiddly and has the potential to take a very long time.  There are too many things to keep track of for me to rate this higher.  There are also a few quirky things about it such as under-powered cards that detract from the experience.

I am still having difficulty at this time determining who is currently winning a game (4 plays now).  I really enjoy the game, and seem to have a knack for it as I have been doing well.  The multiple options to victory is very nicely done.  I have shipped my way to victory, built my way to victory, and have played a game with only 1 wooden boat.

It's a lot more straightforward and therefore probably easier to grasp than Agricola. But it's a lot more dry and not as fun as Agricola. I guess here the theme is less engaging and the gameplay is more repetitive. Doesn't seem to be as many levers for players to operate.

C says: "More of Agricola, although the end doesn't come as quickly. In other words, there is more time to enjoy your buildings/resources and do some fun things with them. Good production quality, but not many wooden pieces. Can lead to analysis paralysis. Steep learning curve, so you can't teach this one to new players and expect them to do well first time around. Best with 2-4."  
Tom says: "Don't play with 4 or more, only 2-3" - he also suggests you can do more good things than Agricola, and have fun with what you build.

I won on my first game, the game is ok but I'm not convinced.

RATING: 7
While there is an element of worker placement here, the main thrust is by far in identifying efficient conversion paths (regardless of who owns the points along the path) and hitting them more than your opponents. What made the game so opaque for me is that the value of things – and therefore the direction to go – is not certain till midway through the game. 

You spend the first part of the game just collecting things, buying a building here or there, but nothing too grand going on, and this can give a sense of floundering. But then as the game develops you identify a path for how to make some money and/or satisfy your food needs. I find this especially true with the special buildings as they offer some pretty specialized paths.

Resource conversion games aren't in my wheelhouse but if I were to recommend only one, it would be Le Havre.

I understand why this is considered a good game. Mechanically, you can see there's a solid design process behind it. However, it's incredibly long and repetitive, especially with four or five players. The fact that you have to keep track of building cards placed in front of other playes all over the table makes the situation confused sometimes. Also, feeding your workers is a pain; the most efficient solution to this problem seems to be building ships... amd I hate games where you can do a lot of things, but one of those things is essentially mandatory. Also, I think that the theme is not really there at some points: if I am a town developer or whatever, why the hell am I harvesting grain and herding cows?!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After my first play, I rated this at 8.75.  After subsequent plays, I've placed this at a 10.  The depth of strategy is better than any "euro" I can think of.  You NEED to be thinking and playing several moves past your current turn to be able to have a hope of a win.  

Single player is more of a practice mode.  Two and three seem to be best.  Four and five are not at all recommended.

Finally played it. I was worried that I wouldn't like it much because Agricola was the same designer, but then again he also did Bohnanza and At the Gates of Loyang which I do like. I liked Le Havre quite a bit. There is quite a bit of advance planning needed for some buildings, and some things you want to do can take several turns to set up, increasing the chance that your opponents will snatch what you want first. However, there is much less competition for buildings and spaces than Agricola. I can't see it coming out very often, but with more advanced players it is quite a joy.

I was never drawn to Le Havre because the shipping theme is a little dull for my tastes, but having played it now I am seeing why it is so highly regarded. The game mechanics are terrific!

Me gusta la gestión de recursos, y Le Havre tiene muchos disntitos tipos de recursos que se consiguen de diversas formas.

Si no te gusta calentarte la cabeza mantente alejad@ de este juego, tienes que ir por delante de la partida si quieres tener posibilidades de victoria.

A single worker that you move each turn?  Okay.  Lots and lots of resources, most two-sided so you can upgrade them to be more valuable?

RATING: 8
I'm struggling to rate this one, as I cannot decide if it is a work of genius or broken.  The fundamentals of the game are fantastic: move your boat, add items to the offer and then take 1 action.  It is so simple and easy to teach but contains phenomenal depth.  This is in part due to the random selection of special buildings that will become available over the course of the game, along with the changing order of the standard buildings.  The components are excellent and although the rule book has a few quirks it is well written and illustrated for the most part.

However, there are 2 fairly large elephants in the room: the issue of ignoring one of the key mechanics in the game, hunger, by abusing the loan system, and the power of the shipping coke strategy.  With these 2 aspects in place seasoned players will strip the game down to the same experience every time it is played.  Ignore food, take loans and then build towards shipping coke.  This can also mean that new players who are not aware of this strategy will be destroyed, meaning they may be reluctant to play again.  For the first few games I got a rule wrong whereby everyone was paying 1 interest of each loan they had, which seem natural and somewhat preferable to what is in place by default.

It seems a shame that such a multifaceted game can be reduced to a few key decisions due to the perception of there being only one correct way to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My experience so far:

Fun, but long.  Also, very little player interaction.   After 3 hours of play, nobody know who is winning and usually the game is won by only a few points.  Has absolutely none of the tension and intensity of the masterpiece Agricola.   Still fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I certainly preferred Le Havre to Agricola, I felt much less frustrated by being blocked, and felt there were many more choices open to me. My first play, and the mechanisms are simple enough, so it all hangs on knowing the buildings/ships and how to exploit them efficiently. Which is always a mark down in my book, since the experienced player automatically has the advantage. If you like this sort of game, you will like Le Havre. Not really my cup of tea, but I'd certainly prefer player this to other such games.

My favorite heavy game.  The initial choice every turn seems so simple:  enter a building or grab an offer.  But these choices open up a rich complexity of options.

A Brilliant game.

2011: My first two plays left me a little dizzy and unsure of myself.

Plays #3-15: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
May 2014: Having re-discovered the joy of playing Agricola, I've been looking into Rosenberg's other games, and been wondering if I'd like Ora & Labora. My main concern is the main mechanic: resource conversion. So I played Le Havre again to see if my opinion of the mechanic has improved. Well...it hasn't. Yet. But I have a feeling it will. I think the key with complex conversion games is getting a handle on all the parts. Until you do, you're just dizzy and lost. Just spitballing here, but I see a ceiling of 8 for this, and maybe 9 for Ora et Labora.

Play #16: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
Mid-May 2014: Up to an 8 as I see what the special buildings really add, and start to get a handle on the game. Taught this to three 6th grade students, and they LOVED it. (Short game.) I was shocked as I assumed this was too brainy/mathy. I'm still of the opinion this will stay at an 8 for me, and still feel Ora & Labora is the one I want.

Plays 17-19: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
NOV 2014: Still a lot of fun, and I'm discovering more styles to play the game with. Last one was wood denial and wooden ships, then ignoring food while setting up an Industrial engine with two Special Buildings. Really fun. Kevin is really enjoying this one.

Best solo scores:
282 using Fish Restaurant for $, then late game Smelter for steel rush
260 using Football Stadium and Fur Industry

As a curious sidenote, Le Havre fell out of the top 10 rankings at approximately 10:30am PST on June 1, 2014.

Played the short game with 4 and took us 4 hours.  I like the game better than Agricola, but it better speed up or we'll never play the full game.  Unlike Agricola, there are many choices of things to do each round.  Food & money are really tight.

Several of us like Le Havre better than Agricola, but oddly enough some of like it because we think it is more in depth, while others like it because they think it is lighter.  Personally, I think Agricola the lighter game.

A beautifully crafted game which never lets wonder to far away from the action because your next turn is seconds away.  Every now and then you can get caught up in a decision loop as the options are so plentiful.  Wonderful game which I can't wait to play more of.

Thematically I think this game pales in comparison to Agricola.  I still like it quite a bit and I doubt I'd turn down a game of it.  It can feel like a bit of a grind and there isn't enough variation in start conditions and strategies, at least not in our play groups.

Tried to play this once and got turned off after taking 20 minutes to punch everything out and then spend even more times trying to set up with (imo) unclear rules. I will give this another shot when I visit Nick (maybe). Game probably would be best taught by another player than the rulebook

RATING: 8
Pros
-Very straight forward euro game, simple actions but enough choices and strategy required
-Theme is appropriate (even if somewhat dry - but that's taste dependent)
-Players can choose between full or shorter game length
-Special buildings and design of how standard buildings appear add lots of replayability
-Can be played solo or up to 5 players

Cons
-Rulebook was poorly organized. Every paragraph referenced another page or rule that will later be described. Main offender was that it didn't differentiate between buying and building until the last page.
-Loans are counter intuitively desirable
-Adding resources to offering each turn can be tiresome
-Idea of needing boats to ship is hard to teach newer players (my opinion) - has been argued that there aren't as many viable end game strategies

Other
-I wonder if they could've added alternate turn tiles (the circular ones that dictate what resources to add to the offering each turn).

RATING: 6
Clean concept, but 16 resources, money, food, energy, buildings and 20 serialised turns make this extremely long and AP-prone (plus you need to keep feeding your people). Play with 3p, no more.

There seems to be a lot of depth with timing the purchase and sale of buildings and exploiting loans.

I prefer Homesteaders for my resource management in a shorter playtime, but the cash manipulation in Le Havre seems significantly deeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's not that Le Havre's decision tree is so deep - it's so damn WIDE.  In that respect first games take forever, but once you get over that hump things really start to pick up and the game just shines.  There are so many avenues to pursue.

I love that in this game you get to create an engine and really crank on it for a while vs. the usual where the game ends just as you're getting it built. It's surprising how much just the little variations in building order can totally change the game and the special buildings are just enough to spice things up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great game, in the same style as Agricola but still different.  For me it's easier tactics wise. 

My wife prefers Le Havre above Agricola because there a less choices to be made with this game.  Also the goal (money, ships, cards) is easier to keep in mind. And a lot more points are scored !

RATING: 9
Build your economy in tiny little increments with lots of resources to work with and many little buildings and systems you can leverage / manipulate while trying to keep up with having to feed your people.  

It has a wonderfully balanced system with so very many things you can/want/need to do, but never enough actions. Managing those actions and developing a linear path to victory is the key to this game. 

Love, love, love the scope of the economy. Love the balance and design. But wish I was better at micromanagement and that it wasn't quite so long!

This is a very good game - not quite as intriguing as Agricola in my opinion, but with more strategic depth.  It's a longer game, and one in which the time it takes for each turn grows the longer the game goes on since there are many times more choices in the last several rounds than in the first few.

Disappointing after the hype.  Really should have been just a card game (perhaps with a slack handful of resource counters thrown in).  The game is challenging, but often I feel more like I am playing against the game machine rather than other players.  I can see some interest as a solitaire; however there are other games that do this better when there are multiple players.  I need to play more to see if anything improves; so far I'm finding it better with four than with three but considerably longer.

Awesome game which improves on Agricola on every level. Multitude of upgradeable resources, varied buildings, and (a specialty of Uwe Rosenberg) the constant shortage of time in accomplishing your strategy.
Lively game board and a naval theme which fits the mechanics.
Great with 2 players; make sure you've got 3 hours to spare.
If you enjoy economic worker placement games with LOTS OF RESOURCES AND BUILDINGS, it simply doesn't get better than this.

I think the engine is a little better than Agricola, if only because you don't necessarily have to get a bit of everything. However, it seems to run longer than its predecessor (even in a short game) and you lose a bit in term of interactivity and variability: the buildings will always be the same, roughly in the same order. So there's probably less replay value here. Still, Le Havre remain a very good game thanks to the well-tuned mechanics that clearly allow multiple roads to victory.

RATING: 9
First I have to say that I prefer this than its older brother Agricola. Why? Probably because of the thematic, probably because in LH, as the game progress,  players must improve the resources in order to build more complex buildings... The only problem that I found in LH is that if it is played with 5 players, the game could be too much long and heavy to carry on till the end. In fact, I think that the better number of players for this game is 3 (but it also works very good with 2 players).

As good as Puerto Rico but more complex and harrowing (in the geekier sense of the word), better and prettier than almost all games of the "managment resources" family. One of my favorite games ever!

Its components are beautifully designed, its mechanics are complex but simple at a time, and the sensation of fatigue and anguish near the end of each round makes this game an authentic challenge and a real future planning exercise.

What else can I say: an awesome piece of gaming-art, and an undoubted MUST HAVE for all strategic board game lovers!!! Get it or repent of your bad decision!!!

Easily the best economic game I've ever played, beats out Puerto Rico in my opinion.  There are many resources, buildings and variable game situations, but the game is so easy to pick up and understand.  Very well designed and very fun building up the town over the course of the game and reaping the rewards.  Don't play with more than 3 players though, as your action count will tank and wait time will explode.

At times, Le Havre feels more like a puzzle than a game as players try to optimise their resources in order to have made the most money at the end of the game.

Of course, it's an interactive puzzle. During the game players build or buy shops, factories and the like which provide certain actions. You can also use other players' buildings but usually have to pay a fee when you do. Additionally, only one player can occupy a building at any given time so it's quite possible to block other players, at least for a while.

Making the best out of your resources is quite a challenge. In addition to just maximising your profit you also need to feed your work force, and since there are only 7 actions per turn you can never do everything you would like to.

A great game. After owning Agricola, this is the second game I have in my possession of Uwe Rosenberg. When you play Agricola and Le Havre it is obvious that they were designed by the same person. Mainly these two games use the same kind of gameplay. However each game has it's own specifics and both games can therefore be played without getting bored.

Like Agricola the options within Le Havre are numerous. You can get commodities, use these well, choose from different sorts and types of actions and plan your strategy real carefully.

Interesting is the option to use buildings which are build by you opponents or building which were build 'by the game' (sometimes against compensation). This feature isn't present in Agricola.

The game can easily be played with two, three or four persons, however we almost always play with two players (because we think it takes to long to play with more).

Received in mail 4/29/09 from Boards & Bits, along with my second copy of Small World. Because of Small World, it might be a while before I get this one to the table.
First play - 5/18/09. 4 of us learning it. Game started at 7:30, ended at 9:30. We all were scrambling at the end to feed our people. Really liked it. Anxious to play it again. 

Temporary Rating - 9. I seldom rate a game after only 2 plays, but this one is exceptional. It might make it to one of my rare "10's" with more plays. I don't see it dropping any time soon.

Word of advice - this is a game of efficiency. In a 3-player game you get exactly 28 turns + 1 final action. In a 4 or 5 player game you get only 21 turns plus an extra action. Thus, you need to make the best use of your few turns. However, you can always buy & sell as often as you want w/o it counting as an action. Thus, if you can get extra Francs you can get more accomplished on a turn.

Similar to Agricola but with a more interesting theme. The only real drawback is the extremely complicated and long setup.

Le Havre is one smart economic game.  There is this initial freedom to try different paths to victory.  I feel like the special powers of each building usually matches perfectly to their real-world counterparts.  As well, paying to operate building effects feels very natural in an economic sense, and thus Le Havre thematically works well, as far as Euros can.  One can get bogged down by the decision making that has to go on, and a 4-player game goes on for a rather long time.  If there is one thing today that keeps me from loving this game as much as I did when it came out, it's the sheer amount of open information. Players can easily get lost in the mini-maxing. And well-seasoned players pretty much spend the whole game employing standard combinations, and their game becomes more about good timing than freedom and creative play.  Thus, the game can become too calculating and even boring with those who just "go through the motions" (where again, all the tension lies with timing).  Le Havre is  a game that could lose its fresh appeal if played too often, but it's an excellent Euro to go back to occasionally.

This is a totally awesome game. I've had this thing for probably 7 years and finally played it on 11NOV2017. Wow! Just totally fun. 

What I don't like about the game. 
- It doesn't have a solo with win conditions; only a beat your own score
- I've read where you can game the game using using Le Havre: Le Grand Hameau expansion deck, but assuming you don't use that deck for solo play, then it's probably a little more fair. Knocked it down a couple notches due to solo play
- The game makes me feel restrained from resources, which gives me the squirms, and I'm not sure I like that. 

What I like about the game:
- The rules are top notch
- The icons and information on cards and the board really helped to make the game easy to get into.
- The components are top notch, great boards, and cards shuffle nicely
- The game plays really smooth, and while the other person is thinking about their turn, you can be doing yours
- I love the building aspect of it and the way you can combine purchased buildings to make a bit of an engine

On my first play of Le Havre I was won over by what seemed an interesting evolution of the worker placement game and at the depth the game appeared to offer. 

 In reality, I feel this game is a meticulous exercise in efficiency and demands too much time for what the game really offers.  There are a ton of micro decisions one must make over and over again, which aren't always interesting or seemingly helpful,and not to mention repetitive.

  Agricola could be knocked for the same but it is shorter in gameplay,the theme is much richer and each decision truly feels it has an impact. 

 Le Havre also seems to have a turn order timing issue, which can really make the drafting mechanism much more profitable to some than others - much more so than in Agricola.  

I also felt that it took at least three or four moves to do a "real" action [something games like Bombay get slammed for(which only lasts 30min)], and with the limited turns in the game, plus the time investment it just compounds all the other things I find faulty. 

 Will I play again? Yes, but I don't feel compelled to. Plus I don't really see the depth in the play.  Le Havre is part of the catalyst (Brass is another) for my turning back the clock to much less convoluted designs and wanting to play games that have real depth and less moving pieces.  I miss the old Euro designs.

Superb worker placement/resource processing game.  I don't play it much anymore due to time constraints but I still find myself wanting to get it to the table. I grew up near barge canals in France so the theme carries a personal nostalgia.  After learning about some of Uwe's background, I'm beginning to feel a kinship for many of his thematic settings.  We're on the same wavelength in that department.

Le Havre is probably the heaviest game I have at this time and although I have a physical copy, I've only played the iOS version so far. Incredibly tight game where every single decision is meaningful and important, but where the 'good' moves and 'great' moves aren't always instantly obvious. I would love to play this multiple times with a consistent group so that we could all learn and improve together, as having experience in the game seems like it would give an incredible leg up while teaching. Aside from the time it takes to play, this is one of my favourite games at this time.

This game makes me wonder whether online tools like BSW are changing how designers create games.  This game seems like it would be much better played on a computer interface than with an actual board.  There is a lot of housekeeping piece movement, and there is no great way to keep track of all the visual information on various cards that land in front of each player.  Perhaps when surface computing technology becomes ubiquitous I will play this more.

This is a great game, not quite as masterful as Agricola I think, but with more strategy. It's a long game, and each turn becomes longer as the game goes on since there are more choices in the latter rounds than in the earlier rounds.

RATING: 7
Based on solo plays on the PC version.
At first overhelming and impossible to do anything. After several plays - more and more enjoyable and cutthroat. Creating an ideal route of managing tons of resources is intrigueing and fun, but at times it feels like more like a chore than game. Anyhow it's still quite oddly charming.
I'm not shure if I'd have a chance to play it often, but it's definitely a very good euro. The microturns system is as simple as briliant. I like it.

Among economic games I do prefer Brass over both Caylus and Havre.

This is a brain burner.  Always fried after playing.  There is a great level of subtle strategies and mechanics that make this a serious game. Little bit of luck with turning over of new town buildings but not enough to be a game changer.  We hate games of luck or dice :( I would say this is not a game for beginner or casual players. I would rank the game at a higher strategy level than BGG. There can be a lot of player interaction by blocking and acquiring buildings. We like to play it from time to time but not our favorite.  Great serious game though. P.S.- we do find the resource management board cluttered and fidgity though which is frustrating at times.

Only one play, but didn't really pull me in.  Seemed like the timing of actions was a bit chaotic.  You really need to anticipate what's coming up, what it's function is, and what it costs, make sure you have the right stuff to build it, and it better be before someone else snags it.  Shipping seems to be a pretty good path as well, but you need boats, and an open wharf, or a lot of money.  Just seemed a little overly structured for the decisions to be made.

One 3-player game only. And I'm hesitant to play with more, given the potential for downtime. But initial impressions are good.

Update: Suspicions proved correct. The increased chaos and playtime with 4-players means I will probably decline any more games of Le Havre with more than three.

Update: Much like with its sister game, Agricola, the solo optimization engine in these sorts of games just doesn't get my motor running anymore.

RATING: 8
It is billed as a cross between Agricola and Caylus and you can certainly see the resemblence.  Fairly heavy as befits the comparison, looking good after first couple of games, but length of play may be a factor if people are going to dither.

After several 4p and 3p games - only its length is counting against - the building interactions, multiple paths engines, all make it a great game. For our group this plays the same length as Caylus, but I would far rather play Le Havre

I can see the brilliance of it, but it doesn't call out to me the way his other games do.  I don't get a rush building ships or converting fish to smoked fish the same way I do when I convert things in Ora et Labora.  I also don't like the feeding workers in this game.  If I'm running a port and paying my workers, can't they get their own dang food?  It just doesn't quite fit.  If it weren't for his other games I would rate this much higher, but I can get the same fix elsewhere in a more palatable fashion.
I flip between OeL and this as my favorite Uwe game almost on a daly basis.

[b]Le Havre[/b] [i]Uwe Rosemberg 2008[/i] 
Along with Caylus this is in my humble opinion the best euro game design in the market, with almost no flaws and a lot of ellegance. Le Havre has many different tactical options and variations, and many paths to the victory, more that other games in its genre like Agricola or Puerto Rico. Very well tested, easy to teach and hard to master: this game is just excellent. I recommend it strongly for two to four players. For five players the downtime and lenght is a bit too much for my taste. Superb game and along with expanded Agricola the best Rosemberg´s design up to date. By the way, both games are different enough to share room in your shelves.

I love this game.  My only problem is the length and finding people to play it (this feels like a theme for me).  I think it's a very hard game to score well in during your first couple of plays.

The nice thing about this game, vs. Agricola, is that you don't feel like you're just getting beat up if you're not winning.  The food pressure is much less, and you can always just take loans.

I wish there were multiple strategies in this game besides "ship iron" and constantly work those avenues.  I sort of envision the game as being a little better if someone could realistically deviate from that.  Much more though, I think the game is about who can do that strategy the best and most efficiently.

Either way though, it's an awesome game, and I would recommend this game even at the full MSRP.  Le Grand Hameau adds some nice flavor, and at some level, I wish it added more.  If I can get enough people to play it to the point of understanding the game, I'd like to toy around with removing some more standard buildings and replacing with some more special buildings.

I will say - 5 players, as the box suggests, is not really an option.  2 to 3 is what that game was made for.  4 would get pretty ugly too I think.

The Mrs. and I absolutely love this game (though I have yet to beat her). Though it is definitely not for everyone, the game establishes a very simple yet deep economic system of building/buying buildings and collecting/processing/shipping goods.

Caylus done right.  More options, more variety, more planning ahead, more permanence to your moves, more of a progression from the beginning to the middle to the end game.

Le Havre's biggest achievement is in perfecting the "microturn" concept to an extent that hardly seems possible for a game of this depth and complexity. Nearly everything that happens in the game is sewn simply and seamlessly into each individual bite-sized player turn: resource growth, changes to available actions, choice of action, effects of action. The only extra regulation happens in the painless harvest phase after every seven player turns. Pay a few food, maybe grab a cow or a wheat, flip a card, and you're immediately back into the player actions.

I would play Le Havre more often if it were a bit shorter, and if it allowed for a wider array of long-term strategies. The late stages of the game are especially predictable, and can feel somewhat tedious.

I've tried the solo game a few times recently, with scores of 315, 398, and 418.  The last game was with a bad setup - Colliery on the very bottom of one of the building stacks, and no special buildings that were usable.  I now feel like I've mastered the solo game, but fortunately the strategies are very different and more dynamic in the real multiplayer game.  [Note that the Marketplace has been changed, in the solo game only, to only allow 4 goods maximum.]

The people I play Le Havre with feel exhausted when it is over. It is hard, without 10-15 plays under your belt, to analyze the myriad options and decide what the best move is. This would get better with many plays, but as the game plays best with 2-3 it is hard for me to teach enough people to get anyone to play that many times.

The food upkeep seems scaled back when compared to Agricola, but it can be a beast here as well and makes a non-boat strategy daunting (especially at first).

I love the special buildings but wish they had more impact on the game. Definitely not as fun as the variety offered by Agricola's Occupation and Minor Improvement decks. I think I like Le Havre more, but the constantly changing strategy offered by the variety of Agricola's cards keeps the ratings for the closer than they would be otherwise.

RATING: 9
This was much better than I expected. Sure there are many things going on in this game, but still it doesn’t feel convoluted. Instead it feels open in that you have so many options each turn that it can be hard at times to choose. That doesn’t mean that I feel that all options are the same, but instead lead you to different tracks of your strategy. This is not bland like most of the worker placement game; this economic game is a rich gaming experience. If you don’t like fiddly games with lots of conversion of goods this might not fit your taste, but for me it’s sublime.

I have played the game with any numbers of players and liked it best as a three player game, but it works well with two and four too. The solo game is mostly for learning the rules as the game’s dynamic changes as there is no tension in the game. Five player games are a little long so I suggest the shortened version for that, but generally it works better than I imagined.

The third game took 5 hours, but I was playing with a Dr who needed to read everything.  I still had a great time even though it took so long.  In the game I played; Brick, Wharf and most other means to progress were near the bottom.  It became a game of scarcity until things finely broke open.   I think the randomness of the building placement makes the game different every time. It seemed like a completely different game from the first two.

RATING: 8.5
Le Havre is fantastic. It's simply an awesome game. A classic design that is simple to learn with few rules but incredible depth. However, Le Havre is a bit unique. First, I have little desire to own it. That's because as great as the game is, it feels a bit more like a resource conversion simulation (i.e. math problem), then it does a game. The pros are that every game plays out differently as you never know when you are going to be facing the agonizing chocie of taking resources, or using a building action. It's not like you can say going into the game, "I'm going for a wood to charcoal strategy tonight", like you can in some games. Every decision is critical and you have to be on point all game long. But that also gives the game a bit of a clinical and antiseptic feel. Plus, it's fatiguing to play. There is a bit of "fun" factor missing for me. As a result, it's a game I need to be in the mood for and a game that I can see hitting the table occasionally, instead of being a go-to staple. I think the game is wonderful...in small doses. I want to rate this higher based on pure design excellence. I just can't.

RATING: 6
A little disappointed. Long for what if offers, with some real usability problems in the way cards are laid out -- I found myself craning and squinting a lot to see the build cost of cards on the other side of the board. Looks a bit of a mess as you play, too, with those resource piles in the center of the board. The endgame reminded me just a little of Civilization (in a bad way) as everyone tries to maximize that very last build. For the effort I think I'd rather play Agricola twice, but if I'd never seen Agricola I'd probably think more of Le Harve. In the end it may not be fair for marking this game down because it isn't as good as Agricola, as the same can be said of nearly every other game, as well. Will play again but won't agitate for it.

Le Havre is a very good worker placement game where you try to have the most money at the end of the game.
At your turn, you can take goods at one of the dock or use one of the available buiding to improve goods, sell goods, build your own building or ship.
At the end of the week, you need to feed your workers.
A game last several weeks.  At the end of the game, you add the value of your buildings and ships to your cash, the player who has the most money wins.

RATING: 9.5
 If it works great with 2-players, and varies enough from game to game, it could become my favorite game.
Intense, engaging and quite fun and satisfying. There are so many paths you can choose from game to game, and there are tough choices to make turn to turn. 
Every game is like a fluid puzzle, where you're trying to get your town up and running, buying buildings, feeding people, shipping goods, building ships. There's never enough turns to get everything you want done, so you have to choose where you're going to suffer and where you're going to thrive. The difficulty is working all these plans around the plans of your opponents. Dealing with all this is fun because your opponents have to deal with all your moves too. All buildings are open, and special abilities are there for all to see. Because the building order changes from game to game it's a different experience each time. It's a puzzle I'd like to get to the table more often. There's a lot of replay value here for me.

Played twice both times with 3 and the full game. I really like the way you put your little empire together in this game. I had a lovely cattle to meat, wheat to bread, bread and meat sold for money at the baguet shop, thing going last game. Kind of feels like you are building a toy village. Aug 09

*UPDATE* Upto 5 plays and enjoying the game with both 2 and 3 players. It would take forever with more than 3! At 3 hours it is bordering on being a grind, kind of like a tough day at the office. The iPad reduces the fiddle and has helped me to appreciate the game. I am actually still unsure of how much I enjoy playing. I'll leave it at an 8 for now. July 2012

Played in the "fast" mode. 

After the harrowing experience of playing this iron maiden of a game, I felt utterly exhausted. 

In the end you have too many things to do and not enough actions for the half of what you ought to do just to survive. In theory this would make for an enticing experience where you have to make always the BEST move every time you play.

The fact is, and I discovered this by playing the game, that there is a fine line between games that give you difficult choices, and this one where you're barely able to keep afloat. The former is fun, the latter is stressful and it is a long frustrating experience you are going for. 

I don't know you, but I prefer to reserve stress and fatigue to a job, not to a game. 

On the other hand you cannot admire enough this implacable vice that crushes you slowly and inexorably.

Awesome game! My girl loves this kind of games and after 10 minutes of playing she exclaimed, "Wow, there are a LOT of choices here!"  :)  Well, there you go. The game is simple, move your boat, fill some resources, take an action. That's it. But... yeah, BIG "but". 

There's so much you can or could do, but you need to plan it right otherwise, you won't be able to do things that you should've done when you could've. And if you don't make the right choice you have to think hard to figure out what to do when you woudn't have done it in a first place. Great game. We played the short version and even though it took us over an hour, it seemed to go fast. Almost too fast, as the 7 actions go quickly. 

I think this has become one of my favorite games thus far, along other games of course.  :)

RATING: 4
I can see why other people like this one, but it is just not for me. It has many similarities to Agricola, which can be both good and bad.

Generally, it is a resource optimization game. Every turn you are increasing your capacity in something just a little bit more, so that you can buy just a little bit more, so that you can produce just a little bit more, and so on. Rinse and repeat. 

That would be fine if it finished in about an hour and a half, but doing this for three hours just killed it for me. It didn't help that I made a poor decision on my first turn that hindered me the rest of the game, but I don't think that is all that soured me on it.

This is a very good game. It does seem a little long, but it holds your interest as you are always planning ahead.

Only beaten by Agricola and a few other games. Really good, worth buying.
The design seems simple, but the amount of thought you have to put into your decisions after a few turns is incredible! The fact that those decisions early in the game will determine what course and how successful you will be later in the game is great! So if you made a mistake early in the game, it won't be the fault of the dice nor some random card, but only your own.

Really, really buy this one. You cannot go by this one, you need to at least play it a dozen times in your life.

RATING: 6
Heavy-weight economic game with strong emphasis on optimizing supply and production chains.  This one really requires a player to have a long term strategy.  Which resources do I need?  When do I need them?  Which steps are required to get there?  

Furthermore this game is unforgivable: make the right mistake at the wrong time and your entire development will be severly screwed.  Interaction is low, optimization and analysis-paralysis potential is high.  Compared to it's brother Agricola, Le Havre is definitely more complex, has less luck and is far more strategic.  But it is also far more complicated in terms of inter-game-dependencies and it feels rather technical.  

All in all this not really for me.  I like complex games but this is too stressful and lacks the nice thematic touch of Agricola.  And I really cannot imagine playing it with slow players.  So: Clever game but no more than 7.5 out of 10.  Sorry, Uwe.

[Rating based on digital version for iOS]  

There's something mechanically that doesn't quite click for me with this one.  I like the buildings and the rental fee mechanics.  I like the resource collection and upgrade system (although maybe there could be a few less resources).  I like that there are a set number of turns so the game doesn't drag out.  Maybe what I don't like is the worker feeding phase.  It doesn't flow as well with the game as in Agricola and feels more frustrating than stressful.  

I think I need a few more plays under my belt and I may reassess the game.

EDIT/UPDATE: I've now played several times, and with more players... the game just doesn't get old, and leaves all players (even -- or ESPECIALLY -- the losers) with a feeling of "Wait, I want a rematch... what if I just did that one move differently?"   You always feel like your fate is your own, and was in your hands the entire time (even if it means -- which it does -- that you have to vary your tactics and your plans and adapt to what is best when your turn arrives.)

I stick by my 9 rating for 2-player game because it is just too easy to buy and to enter buildings, and to avoid using other people's buildings. That is not the case in a 3 or 4 player game, so in the case of 3-4 players, this game is basically the most balanced, perfect game I have ever played. This is now my favorite 3-player game, hands down, and probably my favorite for 4 players, as well.

PS. The iOS version is quite nice. I bought the original boxed version (well worth it, esp. with free expansion deck included), and then bought the iOS app to take on the road and for camping trip. Well worth the $5.


ORIGINAL REVIEW: Great game. My wife isn't into most games, but I love them and don't have many gaming buddies to play with, so we're always on the lookout for a game that will be "just right" even for 2-players (but also playable with other amounts of players.)  Not such an easy-task.

Le Havre is a great game. The rules provide enough complexity to really make you think, plan ahead, use some psychology, and consider multiple strategies... yet they are simple enough to quickly grasp and not bog down the game mechanics.

Even though the "harbor" theme is very similar to other agricultural-style games (Agricola, Seeland, etc.) we really like the theme more than the farming ones. Something about boats just feels more fun than farming does, and the artwork is just colorful and whimsical enough to enforce that breezy feeling.

Components are great (even coming with ziplock bags for easy organization! I love German eurogames) and the rule-book is better than most I have read (perfectly organized and arranged so that it made sense the first time -- good examples, clarifications, and very little need to refer to it later)

I have only played 2-player, so I can comment on the + and - of that:

+ Turn pacing is fantastically balanced. Doesn't take too long to wait for your turn (and, being a eurogame with almost zero luck involved, you can take the time to really plan out Plan A and Plan B strategies when your turn comes.) Allows enough time to think and feel like you are really making some weighty choices that turn -- which you are; every decision counts. But the nice thing is, no single early decision is going to ruin your chances later in the game. You always feel like you are in the running and have a chance to catch up (or fall behind), although late-game choice become very, very critical.

- The "entry fee" to use buildings seems like it would be great to become a real estate baron, but with 2 players there were almost always alternate sources to get goods and materials, and the fact that people can pay less food than gold means the entry fees amount to almost nothing. That's a shame, because I feel it could be one of the most strategic and interesting aspects of the game.

- It seems a little ridiculous that you pay the same interest every turn regardless of how many loans you have. It means that if you are going to carry one loan, you might as well carry a dozen. I started buying up many properties and thus was consistently short on food; no problem, just take out another loan!  I had 5 or 6 loans for most of the game (buying up everything in sight in the meantime), while my opponent was almost debt-free... and yet I ended up winning by a significant amount at the end of the game.  I think we might establish a house rule to pay ONE PER LOAN every time interest is due.

- Feels like it would be a better game with 3 or 4 players. Most games feel like they were really designed for the magic "4 player" number, and some seem like they were designed for 2 with extras being added as an afterthought. This one is different, because I really feel like 3 PLAYERS might be the magic number, but I won't know until I try.  Competing for buildings to enter isn't very difficult with 2 players, but would be a lot more strategic and psychological with 3 or 4. 

It's not a PERFECT game (and I think it will play very different -- but just as balanced or moreso -- with more players) but it is a FUN game and we will definitely play again soon. We might add a few house tweaks to the rules (maybe for entry fees or loans) but I'll need to play a few more times to see if that's necessary.

Makes your head hurt, but in a good way. Long, but time flies. Complex, but everything clicks soon.
So it's very good--but very good despite hurdles is still only a qualified excellence. Time will tell.
[EDIT] And it seems to have told me that Le Havre is too long and repetitive for its own good. There appears to be one dominant strategy, that of shipping coke, so every ~3 hour game feels the same. 
As for solo, I'm not sure how it compares to Agricola. Agricola works solo largely because of the cards, whereas the only variability in Le Havre is in the order of the buildings and which specials come up. I doubt that will be enough to hold interest.

Since many ppl call it the better or gamer's version of Agricola, I wasn't that excited, as I don't like Agricola. I played it by now and I really don't see why ppl call it that way. This is a completely different game, including the feeling of it and it's much better, too. Still, I don't need the game right now, but I may buy it some day.

I played it as a 4 player game only and I guess it's much better with 3 or 2 players. That said, my rating may go up, if I will play it with less ppl anytime soon.

Played again many years later and I seem to be fed up with this kind of games. All you do is taking wares and convert them or build a building with them, which nets you points. It's just a struggle for food with like 15 different currencies...

Sure, it's not bad per se, but one of the best games? No and never. Other games that convert things into points are less fiddly and get ignored without a reason.

Way too fiddly and more on the boring side of gaming.

UPDATE:  Another full game with 4 (3 new).  I took nearly 4 hours, but I still enjoyed every minute of it.  

I've played 2 full games and 1 short game, and it is an instant 10 for me.  I like it much more than Agricola, and want to play it more than any other game right now.  If it works well as a 2-player game, and varies enough from game to game, it could become my favorite game.

Lots of tension, lots of difficult choices, and a lot of balls to keep in the air.  Nice planning for end game points, and there always seems to be a back up plan.  Very small incremental turns, but long term strategy (always seem to have 3 or 4 plans at once) and the opportunity for big plays.

The three player game seemed to be much tougher than the 4 player version.

Early cows seem to be a necessity, and by far the most efficient means of getting food when the Abattoir comes out.

I like that you can invest your money in certain buildings (the $4 start building for example) that have no entry fee, but increase your bonuses for other buildings at the expense of liquidity.

Excellent game and a sure buy for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent engine-building, worker placement, resource management game that takes mechanics introduced by Rosenberg in Agricola and refines them beautifully.  It's this elegant synergy that makes Le Havre, for me, a much better gaming experience than Agricola.  

There are variable (seemingly endless) paths and strategies to success, which rewards flexible thinking and pre-planning. Le Havre, for this reason, is slightly more forgiving. Not to say that a misstep or miscalculation won't cost you victory, but in Le Havre a less than ideal play won't bury you in the first 20 minutes and leave you watching everyone else break away and excel for the remaining 2.5 hours of the game.  

It can get bogged down with analysis paralysis - but there is a speed curve during the 20 rounds of the game, and it moves more quickly with experienced or repeat players.

What initially looked like a confusing mess at Essen has, after some organizing and a couple dozen games, turned into an incredible game.  

The decisions are often tough, the player interaction is fairly high for a euro (via blocking or taking goods based on your opponents' needs), and time is not bad (less than an hour for two experienced players).

The more I've played the better it's become.  Highly recommended.

Essen 2008 release
Preordered from Lookout in the post-Essen preorder drive.

2 plays 2&3player. Well if laying around in the evening thinking about how to improve on a game is a sign of a good game then this game must be very good. I spent all night thinking about how we should have done to avoid the sort of anti-climax at the end where we both ended up with piles of things we couldn't use because we had no more things to build or no energy to use to ship it with.
The second game (with 3) came out much more favourably as more buildings helps out with end game. For 3 the only thing against the game is that it's too long - 3h is not something we'll play on a too regular basis.

RATING: 7
I don't like that this game's final winning score is over 200 -- but now that I know that, maybe I'll play better with that goal in mind.

The absolute key to this game is efficiency of your actions.  You should get huge piles (like 10 chits) of raw materials (e.g. clay, coal, iron) and then convert a whole pile in one fell swoop (e.g. to bricks, coke, steel).  Another key is to get ships as soon as possible, because they will help you pay for the food that you owe at the end of every turn.  You shouldn't have to be scrounging for fish by the end of the game... ships should supply most or all of your needs.

In the middle of my first game, I exclaimed, "This is like Caylus -- except you ONLY HAVE ONE WORKER! ARGH!!"  

I first played a 2-player game, and it was enjoyable.  Since you get either 3 or 4 actions per round with 2 players, then you have a real chance to plan a turn out.  However, there were so many actions I wanted to accomplish, and if I took one (say, mining for coal in the colliery), then the next step (say, turning coal to coke in the cokery) was often blocked by my opponent's worker (on purpose).  I thought this would be harder to deal with in a 3- to 5-player game, where you get fewer actions, but it might be okay because more buildings come out, so there are more options available.

I started by trying to feed my people entirely without taking loans.  But building a money and food engine isn't enough -- you sometimes need to skimp on food to get some important building materials.  The key thing to remember is that not matter HOW MANY LOANS you take, you only pay ONE FRANC PER TURN (not 1 Franc per loan) in interest!  So take lots of loans (like 5-10), but pay them back at the end else it will cost you many points.

For most of the game, wood is critical for building buildings and powering refineries, so taking wood (and starving other players of it) is a great step.  Clay is also important, and later, all big buildings are built with brick, so building the brickyard is a good idea.  Obviously, don't forget ships -- iron ships go a long way to help you feed your people as well as to provide efficient shipping (3 energy for three goods).

But mainly, it's important to set up an efficient economic engine and stick with it.  So, get the Colliery and the Cokery, and other things that people (and you) will want to take because they're so efficient to use.

Need to play many more times to get the hang of it... I never seem to learn my lesson, and end up playing defensively and with too much attention to not starving rather than paying attention to efficiency.

I like Le Havre a lot. It's like a less hideously annoying Caylus with actual different win strategies. It has a lot more replay value than Caylus as well. The only complaint I have about it is that it can run a little long. Great game on the whole.

Le Havre dares to go where most boardgames never dare. Ships, the collection and manufacturing of goods, and colourful wooden pieces shaped like stuff.

All in all, a good game. Screwing a player out of using their own building is fun.

I love how the special buildings change the available strategies.  Someone needs to lift that off Le Havre and plug it into Puerto Rico.  Add some zombies and it's an 11/10.

After lots of play I am dowgrading this a little bit.  Without the additional buildings of the extension, I would have downgraded even more, because even though Le Havre is a very good game, it feels samey after a while. 

I've played le Havre quite a bit now, thanks to the IPad there is no setup time and without the fiddlyness, you can have a 2-players game in less than an hour; it's a fun game but it's too samey after a while.

This is my favorite of the Harvest Trilogy - why? I love games which promote creativity and openness (which is why I love Kramer). Where Agricola and Gates of the Loyang provide strong game tension via needing to feed your family and satisfying your customers, Le Havre provides multiple paths to victory AND the space to explore them. Granted, like Agricola and Gates of the Loyang, there is also a narrative that needs to at very least be heeded (e.g., you need to start "parental planning" early in Agricola). In Le Havre, this could be the meta-narrative of naval and production progress - it usually does not pay to be a "harbour hero" (i.e., a player who acts tough and thinks that they can get away with not building a boat in a game about a harbour). However, one does not necessarily need to stay on track (e.g., you don't have to get into the mid-to-late game coke/steel engine building) but it is worth doing a little mental math to make sure that your breaking from meta-narrative is profitable.

My favorite break from narrative was the time in which instead of being a harbour master, I retired from that profession roughly mid-game to focus on my love of pisciculture (and marketing). Yes, I started a zoo, which I stocked with fish caught through the fishery and even displayed some livestock I had acquired along the way. The demand on the zoos was so great that I had opened an Entrepos - an early Pets Are Us if you will. While other players were stoking coals, I was showcasing aquariums. AND IT PAID.

RATING: 4
Guess this is simply not my type of game. Feels very long and repetitive, and hard to find any long term strategy. No matter what you do, there are a lot of good choices, but primary focus throughout the game seems to be building ships, which makes the progression so predictable.

Maybe I need to play it a few times more (I have 3 plays), but how this game can be in BGG top ten, is beyond me. There is either a lack of depth or I am missing something. I play games to have a good time, and there seems to be no FUN in this game - it just makes me want to go back to my economic games and train games. 

I will try a few times more and hope to be able to increase the rating.

Damn fine game.  Long term planning, subtle but effective screwage of other players, the ability to make you deviate from your plan when something too good to pass up comes along.

My son and I really enjoy Le Havre.  My wife would consider it an "okay" game.  I think she finds the 3+ hours it takes to play a little long.  And 3+ hours might be a little long, but it definitely does not feel that long during the game.

I think the game has a smooth flow to it, and there are always a lot of choices.  It is similar to Agricola in that obtaining food is always a big priority -- and that other players can interfere with your plans to obtain said food (or other resources).  However, with Le Havre, there are more options to obtain food and more choices in regards to resources and building projects.

My guess is that if you enjoy Agricola, you will enjoy Le Havre, but it is possible you will like Le Havre even if you are not an Agricola fan.  I am big on Agricola, but I actually enjoy Le Havre even more, as the mechanics are different and there are more purchasing choices.

You truly feel that you are creating your own system in this game, your own economy with clever paths to wealth and victory no one has ever thought of before.

I mean, you will smell that smoked fish from the smokehouse and get your hands dirty in the clay mound. And it will be worth it.

This is a good game, possibly a great game, but my enthusiasm for the broad careful choices that make up the game is tempered by the fact that the game goes about an hour longer than it needs to.  If these mechanics were captured in a game closer in length to Agricola, I would enjoy them equally.  As it stands, I think Agricola is slightly better bang for the time commitment.

RATING: 7
An interesting game, and very definitely the kinder & gentler sibling of Agricola, Le Havre is less of a "fight to struggle for points while surviving" contest, and more of a "increase wealth potential while gathering food" game. 

On a first, solo shortened 2-player game, it starts at a 7, but because it truly is kinder & gentler than Agricola, it may climb less high but get more plays, especially with family members.

Definitely a keeper, and a nice game, less dry than often reviewed, but still a management/growth game like it's agricultural older brother.

Stellar economic game. A lot different than Agricola and Loyang. Uwe knocked it out of the park with the harvest trilogy. I think this is my favorite of the bunch. The game progresses much more rapidly and dynamically than Uwe's other games and it's something that keeps me interested throughout. This is a winding game with lots to sink your teeth into

Best with 2-3

RATING: 3
(12/16/2008) Initial play. From the same designer as Agricola, Le Havre borrows a number of mechanics and slips on a modern theme. Basically a gather resources, upgrade resources, build or buy buildings/ships, and generate income/victory points game. Le Havre feels more sequential, since you only have one worker, versus the two or more family members in Agricola, which feels more like random-access, and multi-tasking. The theme definitely works, where one gets the feel of moving from colonial to industrial revolution to modern times. With three, it seemed to go fast, with little downtime, but our first game still took four hours. I suspect it will be longer with five. It is yet another fidgety game with lots of small counters, like Agricola, but fun nevertheless--maybe a different kind of fun. In Agricola, you're trying to survive, while in Le Havre, you feel like an entrepreneur/businessman just starting out at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Neat game, can't wait to try it again. Initial rating: "8".

Update (4/22/09): I shudder now every time Le Havre and Agricola come out--a brain-burning, frustrating pair of games that I can't seem to get my head around from the same designer. Great games for sure, but I dislike playing them, because they are not relaxing for me--I'm stressed out at the end of each. Power Grid has the same kind of stress, but it makes sense; Le Havre doesn't "click" with me. Maybe a couple more tries...

Update (06/18/10): There are people in my gaming group that love this game. I avoid it like the plague. Hold a gun to my head and I will play, reluctantly and disgruntled. Downing to a "6".

Update (08/06/10): Someone held a gun to my head, so I played (just kidding, but I did not want to be the party-pooper), and I did okay. I think I realize why I don't like this game, as there are a ton of buildings to figure out, each with a special ability that supposedly makes life easier. The food situation in this game starts as a slow simmer, but becomes a rapid boil, where if food production hasn't been established early, then you're wasting actions on gathering/producing. This is the part I still don't get, but I am willing to try.

Update (08/14/10) 5 plays: I am playing better, where in a 3P game scored 200, but a newbie scored 219, and the veteran scored 245. I concentrated, and did well, in building a majority of the buildings, but got destroyed in steel production, shipping, and luxury ships. I am convinced that I dislike this game, because of the way it makes me feel at the end. I still don't get it.

Update (11/12/10) 6 plays: Tried it again after a hiatus of three months, and I did not enjoy myself. I was completely lost with an ever increasing decision tree (which I don't like), based on more buildings (and options) being built, and their associated complex interactions. I didn't enjoy the fact that a player sat on a building that I needed for half the game. I could never grasp the concept that I can pick up resources AND buy a building, or even to sell a building to get money to do something else. Then there was the ever present feeling of dread of being slowly simmered to death (the relentless increase in feeding). I am simply not clicking with this game, and I am no longer interested in investing anymore time in trying to figure it out; I'm done with this game. Dropping it to a '3'.

ショートゲームだと窮屈なままゲームが終わるのでフルゲームがおすすめ。
勝つための戦略がたくさんあるが、そのどれもがぼやけているのでやりこみがいがある。また、アグリコラと違い直接的な絡みが多いところも良い。

二人プレイは絡みが少なく味気ないかと思ったがそんなことは全くなかった。造船所や製鋼所というキーカードが1枚しかないので、ある程度慣れたプレイヤー同士であれば、互いを牽制しながら白熱の展開を楽しめる。全く違う戦術をとったが、僅差で勝負がついた。デザイナーの調整のたまものであろう。

This game is a sandbox, where you and up to 4 other players compete to exploit every business oppertunity handed to you. The game reminds me somewhat of Puerto rico, in the sense that you are forced to adjust your plan according to what your fellow players are doing, and that your final score depend heavily on your last end moves. However, there is much greater sense of freedom than in Puerto Rico, and also a greater replayablilty as each game uses 6 Special Buildings that alter the business enviroment in Le Havre profoundly. The game comes with 25 Special Building and the 6 cards are drawn randomly, making each game unique. Get it, play it, it's a wonderful box of pure money-making fun!
Oh, and one more thing - don't be intimidated by taking a couple of loans! It's really not that bad!

Meh. I kinda like the idea of the "micro-turns" in theory but in practice I don't know if it really made any kind of difference to anything. The game took a very long time with just three players. Both loans and the food mechanism seemed weird to me. (Who am I paying all that food to? Why don't loans work in anything resembling a real world way?)

Starts out pretty simple but balloons to an extraordinary number of options by the end.

Doesn't seem like the payment for using other people's buildings is enough, especially since it means they can block the owner from using it indefinitely.

The overwhelming importance of ships wasn't made clear to me by the Explainers but I don't blame the game for that. Still annoying to play a game for 3 hours and realize 1.5 hours in that my lack of ship acquisition meant I had little chance of winning.

Felt enough like Agricola that I would probably just play that instead, since it is a shorter game.

Nice design.  Lots of things to think about with many viable strategies.  A dynamic game that changes from play to play.

Not as complicated as Agricola, but carried a lot of the same feel.  The trick isn't to build an engine that gives you an income of this or that, but rather to take what the game offers most efficiently.

A bit confusing until you've played it a couple of times. This game gets tougher as it progresses as there are so many options for using your person token or your ship supply opportunities.

Another worker placement game, but unlike Agricola there's no cute theme to draw you in, just the job of optimising a very limited number of moves while gathering sufficient food to feed your workers. This really is a game of ruthless action efficiency. At 2-2.5 hours it's a bit long for what feels like a pretty dry game, but of its type its the best there is outside of the Splotter catalogue. It's perhaps a shame that a winning score is so dependent on coke and steel, a wider range of viable strategies would make for a stronger game, also food shortage isn't the threat that it is in Agricola as loans are cancellable with the right building. Less luck dependent than Agricola, but Agricola is just more fun.

Quite heavy, it is similar to Agricola mostly in the level of detail that it is willing to deal with--only it goes even further--Building things often requires energy as well.  I've always liked the mechanism in Caylus whereby you must pay others to use their buildings; that's here as well, but once again, Le Havre adds a level of complexity by varying the prices. It also adds an interesting river mechanism which controls what goods recover each term--perhaps the cleverest part of the game. So, it ends up feeling very different from either of these games.  There's a lot going on--at first it seemed like too much, especially since it is hard to see all the cards and you basically just have to remember them (surely there is a better way they could have done this?). 

Shipping line is VERY strong, especially in the two player game I played.  With more players, there are more ways to make money.  But I don't know if you can ignore it and win.

After 6 plays I finally managed not to come in last! uh.. so I suck. yes.

Great game.  Certain points in the game can go slow because it can be hard for players to make a decision.  The is because there are often several viable options a player can pick for his action.

Overall, a bit long but still one of my favorites.

A good, solid game that will take several plays to appreciate all the possibilities.  The Special buildings should ensure that no two games are exactly the same.  The basic game mechanisms are easy to grasp and follow, leaving lots of time to concentrate on maximising your score, and also mean that it's an easy game to come back to after a while and not have to re-learn - it's a bit like riding a bike.

Initial impressions are good, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a Caylus-like effect happen on BGG - you'll either love it or loathe it and the ratings could rise rapidly to a peak before slowly sinking back into the pack.

Supera algunos fallos de diseño de Agricola (pocas maneras de ganar y cierre de ellas entre jugadores, tiempo elevado en reposición de recursos, azar en el reparto de cartas)con MUCHAS maneras de ganar y reduciendo el nivel de aleatoreidad y la sensación de "se acaba cuando la cosa funciona". Gana en profundidad y duración. Buena mecánica la cantidad de acciones que se pueden hacer con las mercancías: comerlas, procesarlas, embarcarlas, venderlas, quemarlas y conseguir energía...Contras: poco innovador (¿otro más de colocar trabajadores como Caylus?), repetitivo (turno tras turno haces siempre lo mismo),tiende al A/P. (+30 partidas en solitario)

[ENG]

It overcomes Agricola desing´s worst fails (few ways to win, lot of time wasted replacing resources, luck when the cards are dealed). Le Havre has A LOT of paths to victory, the luck has been reduced and the "it ends when it´s working" feeling doesn´t exist. LH Needs more time and has more gamer´s weight. I do love the different ways you can use the resources: processing it, eating, shipping, selling, burning them to earn energy... The main CONS are: not very innovative (it seems another worker placement game), a bit repetitive (turn after turn you´re doing the same) AP+.

(+30 games in solo mode)

Le Havre is a heavy resource management game, but its mechanics are easy to understand.  It's fun to see how your engine evolves, but gameplay can feel repetitive after a few rounds.  Similar to every other Uwe Rosenberg game in that you construct buildings that help you convert resources into other resources.

RATING: 9.5
totally awesome. buildings come out gradualy only 3 available at any one time. as soon as one is built another becomes available, you can build buildings paying the construction cost or buy buildings with gold. every round you can gain resources (neat mechanic) or go use a building. and in addition you can buy and sell buildings you own. Some buildings have a cost to use and some buildings have bonuses during the game or at game end. by grabbing low hanging fruit and using it efficiently and planning ahead. This game ticks all my boxes. better than Agricola for me as the group shares in the cards that add the random element. the different game everytime makes it more appealing than say caylus.

RATING: 6
I came at Uwe's Big Three completely out of order (Ora et Labora, then Agricola, then Le Havre) so it was interesting to see how each game's related to the others, but ultimately Le Havre was too much like O&L and not enough like Agricola for my tastes.  The game just takes too long without enough variety, and the very linear progression does not appeal to me - it feels too much like a grind as opposed to Agricola's "holy crap I need to do 20 things and I only have time to do 5" intensity.  I do prefer Le Havre to O&L as I think the complexity got just a little out of hand in the latter case, but given the choice I would go for Agricola over Le Havre every time.

Suggest: Enthusiastic, it's hard to get it to the table now...

Almost same comments as [thing=31260][/thing]. Very immersive experience. Suffers the intrinsic flaws of geek games(heavy rules, long game time, ...). Amount of cards are still reasonable comparing to Agricola, so it's more toward minimalism (w.r.t. Agricola), which I like.

Some balance issues(Coal is too dominating.)

First played July 4th, 2012. Takes a while to play (significantly longer each additional person). Good skill luck balance. Heavy on the rules, works best with experienced player leading the way. Lost of options and mechanics on you way to build your victory points. Finding time to play this may be difficult to do based on the fun factor. I'd recommend giving it a try for 2-3 player games unless you have lots of time.

Le Havre is a heavy duty worker placement Euro.  There are many different resources, many buildings that can be built and subsequently used by players.  There is virtually no luck in this game.  As play proceeds, players are presented with a progressively richer array of choices for their one action on their turn.  Le Havre takes a longer time to play(3.5-4 hours) than most of my other favorite Euro games (~2 hours)  Plays best with 3 players.  Le Havre is also a very good 2 player game.  The game can get unmanageable at 4 or 5 players because each player can put their worker on and use other players' buildings.  So trying to scan the whole table at four or five different players' buildings is only recommended if every player knows the game well.  I do love this game.  It is very well designed.  However, the fact that it is such a heavy game and takes a long time to complete makes it relatively harder to get to the table than most of my other games, thus negatively impacting my personal rating of this otherwise outstanding, excellent game.

The gameplay of Le Havre fits in this awkward spot between Agricola and Ora & Labora. I'd rather play O&L if I wanted to do goods conversions to the max, and I'd rather play Agricola if I wanted to build improvements and buildings against a harvest. I should play it again though; Le Havre is less a bad game and more an unnecessary one.

EDIT: So many people pick this as their choice of Rosenberg euro, I'm reconsidering if I like this one secretly more than I gave it credit before.

One of those "perfect" board games that seems to nail everything about the Euro genre that it possibly could.  Well, almost.  I guess there's not a huge amount of player interaction, but honestly it doesn't matter very much as the game is all about min/maxing and player interaction would just get in the way.

A fantastic game that can be tailored to work with lots of different group sizes.

Only played one 2 player and the rest solo plays so don't have much to go on here. I'd like to think that everything that Bear Trap had to say about this game is true. I like the idea of it, but not sure I play it very well; I can't quite find that rhythm or timing thing that it's important to this game. I think game may need more variation in the special building aspect. A guy like Bear Trap had played over 35 games and still had not seen some of the special buildings come into play. Might need to put 9 buildings in and reveal three so that it is more likely that building can enter game when it is useful so that it becomes a real viable option in game play.

It is longer but that doesn't bother me a bit; after all - I have played over two dozen games of Through the Ages.
Wonderful replayability.  How buildings come out and which special buidlings come out greatly changes game play.
Game mechanics appear simple but yet there are such wonderful little subtle things and soo much depth to strategy.
A must have for most gamers.
Beware of playing with those subject to AP.

RATING: 10
Le Havre is a truly great game. The theme of building up the town of Le Havre, as new advancements in production become available, is wonderfully fluid and allows quite an intuitive connection with the heavy resource conversion strategies that make up the game's core. I like how players are competing to build up their own stake in the town, and by having ownership of the various businesses, the game both pits players against one another while making it necessary to collaborate. It creates a game climate in which everything has such a seamless synergy that it is almost zen-like in exploring the flow of the game. 

The game is also quite brilliant in how it achieves such a dense, satisfying game experience while being incredibly easy to play. Playing the game itself could not be more simple: take a pile of resources, or utilize one of the businesses. A simple choice which over the course of the game blossoms into a myriad of options as the available businesses become more sophisticated. I'm confident that this game could be played by anyone, while being incredibly difficult to master its progression. That to me makes for a perfect game experience: accessibility married with a high skill ceiling. 

Some have said that it lacks variability in gameplay, but I disagree. The businesses that are built will for the most part be the same each game, yes. But the variation comes from the timing of when each business becomes available for use and the availability of resources. In my plays this has meant very diverse paths that each game's trajectory follows. Another way to say it is that while the game's "destination" is largely the same each time, the journey to get there is never quite the same. And the journey is where the strategy and the tactics of playing the game are contained. 

I really love this game.

Le Havre really appeals to me. It is very much a gamer's game, with many decision points, a requirement for planning and the tension of trying to optimise your play with a restricted number of turns. Players interact in a number of different ways, so it is important to keep track of what the others are doing and it helps to anticipate what they may do. The random ordering of the building cards and selection of special building cards makes each play different and obliges you to alter your tactics, if not your strategy.

A bit too long, the components need exactly the right kind of table to be functional, dreadfully low on interaction.  This game will not replace Agricola in the hearts of gamers.  It has its charms, but its still unclear to me why I would want to play this over Agricola or Caylus -- and I think Caylus runs too long.  The downtime can be painful, and I play in a group that is known for speed of play.

Have only played the iOS implementation, but I enjoy the game a lot. I was worried about replayability, but moving to the full game instead of the short fixed that issue - it may come up again once I've seen each of the special buildings a few times, but for now I'm comfortable with it. Unlike BSG or Fury of Dracula, though, I often need some time away from the game before I want to dive in again.

I became bored of the end game, which is focused on amassing coke and shipping it. The problem is that in a three player game, this route cannot be fully blocked since there are three buildings required in this strategy. I have been testing my own variants to relieve the end game repetitiveness. I love the early game though.

Update after 50+ plays:
Now playing the game without any variants.

Complex, typical 'gamers' game': collect resources, build buildings, use resources, transform resources into others, use these transformed resources to build subsequent buildings which can in turn transform other reources etc etc etc...  

I like this mix very much.

My only gripe is that buildings are not balanced - some are used very often, some - sporadically and some - almost never.  It also narrows the choice of possible paths to follow.  Not good...

[solo mode works, but is not as exciting as in Agricola, pity]

EDIT: 5-player game is bad. Too much is going on and you can't monitor all the other players' moves/strategies. And interaction is VERY important in this game - so I would like to have everything under close scrutiny, which is not possible with 5 players..
I'll be avoiding 5-player games of Le Havre in the future...

Excellent followup to AG, really solid just a little long and slightly fiddly. Uwe cements himself as a designer to watch with 2 in a row. 

Basically a resource management worker placement game of efficiency where you need somewhat of a food engine and you need to be buying buildings for points and small bonuses for when people use them. Some big buildings and ships need to be planned for which are bigger points and potential bonus points. 

You do see both AG and a little Caylus here just as Uwe says, a very nice game and a good mix of strategy and tactics that with building ownership also sees a little interaction. Without knowing the buildings strategy is limited but once you know them these can be planned for, chalk up the first game for learning. 

The game bogs down in later rounds as so many actions become available and the potential decision tree becomes massive but more play should speed this up from the beginning time frame of 1 hour per player, meaning 5 players is out, 4 is pushing it, 3 probably best just for the time until more familiar then 4 will be a great tight game (after 2 games at least).  

I really don't find this much heavier than AG, just longer and it is not a complex game either, very straightforward, its just that there is a fair amount of actions to choose from in the later part of the game and there is a lot of forward thinking needed to beat good players, so it is pretty damn meaty yes.  Another plus, pretty much zero luck and perfect information.

Rating might go up somewhat when playtime decreases and strategy increases.  

[u]Update:[/u] 8.25 => 7.5 Not sure why but I am finding this to be more like work than fun and I don't think I've ever made that complaint before. I absolutely hate trying to look around the table to see everyones cards (usually have to stand which is ridiculous), these should have been smaller tiles with icons no doubt about it but then the Caylus resemblence would have been a little too much. Lastly, this game possibly brings out the worst AP in me yet, usually I can keep my turns to a decent time but the analysis once so many buildings are in play can really bog someone down. I also find a frustration here that I usually love (AG, ITYOTD, etc) but this time is becoming aggravating, it seems it is very easy to just be one step behind, ie one resource behind what you need to do. So while this creates great angst it is frustrating the shit out of me. I normally like this kind of torture in the right amounts, here it seems to be a big part of the game where the building you really wanted and planned for gets snapped up one turn ahead of you because you needed food or something else or the building you need to use is being blocked and it stalls your whole plan, the blocking is especially annoying here because someone does not have to move at any given time and can sit there indefinitely. At this point I think I need a break from the game, could be a permanent one as there are so many games I would rather play but I will likely come back to this and hopefully when I'm fully awake! 

Edit - I have been thinking about this one lately and the depth the game offers after a long rest and want to play again. The number of buildings and abilities really does require you to know them to be competitive though.

Tried it solo because I got to the game club earlier than my friends and it seemed worth learning. It was a lot of fun as a solo game, but it seems like the more players the less good it would be. At the max 5 players 60% of rounds you'd get a single action before the harvest, and the other 40% you'd get two. I know that the feeding requirements are severely lessened at more players, but it still seems like it would be really unfun to do so little. I could see this being ok at 2 and maybe not terrible at 3, but it seems pretty much ideal as a single player experience, which isn't something I'm really that into. Still a solid game in that context.

The game itself is pretty simple, every time it's your turn you can either pick up a pile of resources or activate a building, which generally either lets you build a building or convert some resources into other resources. It seems like the steel is very powerful though since it can be sold for like 12 points, so in a multiplayer game I can see it coming down to who can most often use the steel producing and selling buildings.

The obvious comparison is to Agricola, given that they share a designer and publisher, not to mention having to feed your people.  In Agricola you always feel like you're having to continually scramble to make your commitments, not to mention having to continually revise your plans when people take your key actions.  In Le Havre, however, it feels much more leisurely - you don't feel like you have to scramble to get to feed your people, and as a consequence you feel like you can take a bit longer view.  I actually like the compression and tension of Agricola slightly better, but this is still an excellent game.

You know how they make sequels to movies and then everyone debates over whether they're as good as the original? This is the sequel to Agricola. I happen to think it's dull, endless, and lacking in replayability. Others think it's amazing. Some people liked Godfather III too.

RATING: 5.7
This is very good though very long too. It can seem as if you're just treading water at times or even falling behind the curve if you can't devise a system of some sort, but that's the fun/challenge of it.

*UPDATE* In the end, though the game seemed good I was never interested in bring it to the table, even when it was requested. Good but not that fun to me, the length made it a chore.  So I traded it away.

Enjoyed my first play of this tremendously.  Played with 4.  I don't think I'd want to try this with 5, but it looks like it would work quite well with 3 or 4.   It runs a bit long, but as a wargamer, I look at a 3.5-4 hour game in a little different light than the typical Euro gamer.  I'm really looking forward to playing this one again.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game with a lot of depth, unlike other top games this one has a best strategy (if there is no competition). 

The solo game is an interesting puzzle, but there is no incentive to do anything other than ship coke/steel unless the right special buildings come out. 

2/3p is where the game gets interesting, you no longer get free reign on coke/steel, and now have to explore different ways of efficiently scoring points. Also more harvests means more grain and cows in the game, making those strategies more viable.

I don't think I want to play this 4/5 player, since it increases the chance of getting blocked, you only get to do 1/2 actions between each harvest, and the number of rounds doesn't increase linearly with 4 and 5 players (I assume to keep game time down). So the number of actions that each player gets to do in the whole game goes down with more players.

No of Actions with different player counts:
1p: 49
2p: 49
3p: 42
4p: 35
5p: 28

Ignoring 4/5 player, my only criticism is how few special buildings come out, some of which are incredibly underwhelming (espcially given how few come out), there are of course fan made variants that try to fix this.

Absorbing environment with many more options than Agricola, yet not enough conflict--with a bazillion actions to choose from, chances are nobody's in your way.

I like the build-up of goods, how goods can be converted and how cash works. Ships seem "bolted on."

The rules are elegant enough and stay out of your way most of the time. But expect your first game to be an overload. So many buildings and an exponential amount of combinations and paths. The game can drag at times if the players aren't ready to take their turns -- since the turn order never changes, there are few excuses not to be.

For me, I guess, this is a thick steak. Meaty, reasonably tasty and satisfying, but not memorable.

EDIT: Played again. More comfortable play, but still too mathy for me. Not enough anticipation or intuition for me, just pure income building. Also, I was third to act in a 3 player game and felt my choice of good was lame (other two took the wood and clay, leaving practically nothing.)

EDIT 2: Have had no interest in playing this since the last edit. Downgrading to 5.

EDIT 3: OK, I downloaded the app for the iPad and have played about 30 games and have beaten it at 3, 4 and 5p at the hardest AI level. I get the game now and I like it. Upgrading to 7.5.  The "warnings" above still apply--there is a big overload for your first few games and you may feel like you wasted a few hours. Once you get the feel for everything that's there, it's a well-designed game. There is conflict, if subtle.

Too mathy, not enough confrontation. The ultimate in building your economic momentum, but just not that much fun. Great for ten years ago, slightly above average now.

RATING: 7
This is a very pure Euro.  Every turn some additional stuff (fish, iron, etc) piles up on the warf and you get to grab some of it.  Or you can put your rep on a building that you or someone else owns to do something useful, including building more buildings, using the resources that you've collected from the wharf or from a building.  In this manner you maximize your end game points, building up an engine.  It's fun to collect the goodies and build up your collection of buildings.  There are certain paths to victory that you can follow.  There aren't really grand strategies.  It's a very tactical game.  And there isn't really a potential for interesting synergies or new combos.  It's really a game of making the best choice each turn, with a certain amount of trying to guess what the other players are up to avoid getting blocked or to block someone else (only one rep can be in a building at a time).  It's not like Agricola though as each rep stays in the building until moved to a new one so if the player chose to grab resources at the wharf it'll remain on the building, so there's not as much maneuvering since it's not guaranteed that a player will open up a building each turn even if they clearly intend to do something else soon.  It's a cerebral game rather than a tense game.  I'm willing to play it but it's not something I'd suggest on my own.  There is an app version of it which is very well done and playing the computer doesn't seem terribly different from playing humans.

RATING: 7
Le Havre features a pretty straightforward set of Euro-style rules, but manages to offer tremendous replay value with it's different paths to victory and little bits of randomization in the setup. It features some really tough decisions, frequently tempting players with multiple interesting options. My only complaints are the difficultly in sensing which players are doing well (in some games this is fun but in Le Havre it is a bit frustrating) and the fairly slow pace the game can hit (I'm not sure if I'd ever want to play it with 4 or 5 players). All in all, it's a solid Euro that I recommend (especially for those looking for something great for small groups).

I like how I have to plan my moves and it's interesting to look at the different buildings to place my worker. But I prefer more interaction between players.

I respect the game concept, but it gets samey considering the dominant strategy and the bulk of buildings not changing from game to game.

This is a puzzle.
Rules are easier to teach than Agricola, no text on the cards, iconography is self-explaining, much more option.
Scales perfectly for 1,2,3 players.
4 players is not recommended, because the games takes too long, food-pressure is high.

RATING: N/A
No rating as we managed to play only about 60% of a 4-player game.  First impressions were positive and I was impressed with the options that the resources and cards presented.  Blocking actually came into play more than I thought, as I would often look to an action I wanted and another player was there - but there are usually lots of other choices for your action.  Future planning is important.

Unofficial rating: 8.5

RATING: 7
A brain burning game.  Lots of hard choices.  More differences than similarities to Agricola.  I personally prefer Agricola(on the lower half of my top ten).  In Agricola everything you do more or less makes sense from the first play.  For example, if you make a larger family you need more food.  Or an Occupation is a job you take on that provides benefits.  Le Havre loses this a bit.  Food is again a constant struggle, but it isn't clear why.  In your first play you gather resources to start the game, but it isn't immediately obvious what the point is until later in the game when buildings clarify the purpose.  Finally, the shipping theme doesn't work for me as well as the farming theme.  In summary, a very very good game that has obvious connections to Agricola, but in my mind falls short of BGG's current champ.

Lots of little things to remember and a little bit fiddley... but I have to agree with others and say I like it more than Agricola (though that's not hard, Argricola was over hyped).  My first and only play so far was with 4 players and a full game and so it took around 5 hours... would probably say to only play short game with 4 unless all players have at least two plays and never play with 5 players.  Interestingly I came in 2nd thinking I had really screwed myself needing to take 6 or 7 loans (all outstanding at the same time which works best for loans since interest is a fixed amount regardless of number of loans)... the winner had taken zero loans.

update: played with 3 players 2nd time at it (and about a year between the plays) against a very experienced player and one 1st timer... I won by 20 or 30 by building buildings and 3 ships... did only one shipment of 10 goods to pay off my 5 remaining loans.

After playing Agricola, buying it and playing it more, I tried other Uwe Roseberg games too. When Caverna came out and I played it (and enjoyed it), but I realised it was Le Harve I was most interested in. It feels quite different playing with different numbers of people, and it feels like there's a variety of paths to take too (even if there's only been one game so far that felt like it was really flying, with early steel).

Marvellous game, but very long! Interesting and deep. It very much feels like the offspring of Agricola, with a bit of Caylus thrown in.

Somewhat more a gamer's game than Agricola and not quite as thematic. It does escalate nicely, though, and while the early turns might see you content if you can scrape together a couple of fish in your turn, the endgame will see you building churches and bridges, and you will be selling shiploads of manufactured goods for big $.

So far, I am very impressed. My only fear is that the playing time might result in it not being played as much as it deserves... (Of course, one could always play the short game instead). I think I prefer this with no more than 3 players.

Initial Rating : 8.0 (May 2012)

So far, I have liked every game from designer Uwe Rosemberg and Le Havre was no exception. I still love Agricola, but Le Havre has the potential to surpass it, if only I could play it more times :(. 

For me, the theme is very boring. I would have never played it if it wasn’t for its high rating here on BGG. But when I played it I loved it. This is the kind of game I like. It is a very involved game in which you have to think deeply and carefully about your moves. If I though Agricola had difficult choices, Le Havre IS WORST as you have only 1 ACTION each turn (It is indeed A worker placement game :D). The decisions are agonizingly hard and I love that. The playtime is long but as I’m thinking constantly about my moves, I don´t mind as much. I would like to try it as a 3 player game to avoid an excessive downtime but will play with any number of players.

This is a gamer´s game, not recommended to casual or family gamers as it takes a long time to play, it has hard decisions and the rules are not as easy to teach as in Agricola.

I feel the game is a lot harder than Agricola and I can´t wait to play it again, I suspect that the rating will go up with more plays. This is one of the games I really wish to explore further. A winner in my book.

After more plays, I continue to love Le Havre, still I was wrong about it surpassing  Agricola, which is THE king of the worker placement games for me. Both games are very good and now Le Havre is a must have for me.

It is best with 3 players.

An incredible game with very tough decisions.  one of my favourite things about Le Havre is that the rules are incredibly easy to learn but the decisions are very complex.  I find this offers a great balance between being able to pick it up quickly but requiring multiple plays to achieve mastery.

RATING: 10
This game is pure resource porn.  Seriously, eight different resources, all of which can be refined?  I suppose I need to thank Hanno and Uwe for one thing; after playing Le Havre I'll never need to buy Roads and Boats.  All of the crazy resource conversions are there without the more tedious logistics, and though I'll happily play the Splotter game, I'll probably always want to play Le Havre more.  Even if I break down and buy this game eventually that fact might still save me fifty dollars.

It seems as though replayability is one of Uwe Rosenberg's strengths, with the myriad different special buildings and variable resource refresh setups.

The game feels like it just narrowly avoids being a march through the same few tedious strategies.  Timing and efficient use of the special buildings can be key to really high scores.  If I have three, or even four, I'll nearly always suggest Le Havre.

- Considering the game's size and depth, teaching is relatively easy.
- Setup and tear-down is a little painful, recommend using containers with lids vs. baggies.

The mechanic works well with each player alternating on the supply tiles.

The big question is, which is better. Hmmm...

Traded for two reasons:

(1) It's coming out for the iPad, and since it's a longer game, it's going to get played much more often that way instead of at the table.

(2) Ora et Labora is pretty similar, different enough it would make sense to own both, but given Ora's shorter play time (and lower amount of fiddle), it's going to get played more often.

That being said, it really is a great game, deserving a spot in the BGG top 20, at least.

The most difficult part about this game, the first time you play it, is the set up (way easier, even incredibly cool, when you understand it). With a variable set up based on the number of players the game set up is different on every player count. 
The actions you take each turn is so simple.... move your ship and add two supplies to the dock. Then take one major action; take all the goods of one type, or move your single worker to a building (card ) and follow it's description. From these two actions the game evolves into an amazing sense of escalation and complexity. From such simple beginnings of taking a few goods and struggling to aquire enough food; to huge moves at the end of the game buying luxury liners. 
From having a few common building to owning a huge industry is very satisfying. 
What's so cool throughout the game is every building is available for use by anyone, even the ones your oponents own (although you may have to pay them an entry fee to use them), the only building(s) that you can't use are the ones already occupied by other workers. 
I can't wait to play this game again!!! A must play keeper!!!

What stands out for me in this game is the unique gameplay: players only take one action per turn. However, actions often use a building which another player owns so the active player must pay the other player to use it. This nicely means there is a lot of player interaction and part of the game can be about getting the building that other players will need to use.
Also love the conversion of goods into other goods which also all feels pretty logical and so is easy to remember, e.g. use fish and fuel in the smokehouse to get smoked fish.
Combine with art by the same guy who did Agricola (same game designer, too!) and we're onto a winner. Love it.

Agricola is a good game, but I'm one that can play it every few months and be satisfied; no 2-3 times in one day for me!

Le Havre, though.....[b]that[/b] I could play over and over again.  I find Le Havre to be more accessible, more forgiving and the theme more interesting than Agricola.  I've read several people saying the opposite, though, so take it with a grain of salt.  You can tell that Agricola and Le Havre are related, much in the same way that Tikal, Mexica and Java are related.

I've played it with 1, 2, 3 & 4 and enjoyed all of them immensely, though they each had their own flavor.

The amount of strategy and planning in Le Havre is almost overwhelming. There are so many choices and buildings you don't know where to start. However, once you get the hang of it the game is a blast to play! No luck here, strategy is your best friend.

RATING: 9
Different enough from Agricola and Caylus to stand separately from those great games and not diminish in comparison. It borrows the action development of Caylus and the immediate vs. long term decision making of Agricola, but the object of Le Havre focuses solely on the act of making the most money, which gives it a very different feel than the "balanced development" the others focus on. 

Strategy is heavily influenced by the changing order in which buildings become available from game to game and the choice of "special buildings" that are available. Future small expansions that change this mix of buildings could provide tremendous variety and staying power. The game can feel a little repetitive at times and I wouldn't exactly say that the game feels "fresh" following on the heels of Agricola, but it is an excellent, strategically rich game nonetheless. If you enjoy Agricola or Caylus, there's an excellent chance you'll enjoy this too.

Este juego es realmente bueno, se merece estar en el Top10 de la BGG.

Tiene mecánicas similares a Agricola (Cosecha, procesado de materiales,...) pero es un juego muy distinto, quizá incluso mejor.

En cada turno puedes conseguir materiales ó usar un edificio, y ademas puedes comprar/vender edificios y/o barcos y también pagar prestamos anteriores. Los edificios y los barcos te darán puntos al final de la partida. Los materiales no te darán nada al final pero los necesitas para poder construir nuevos edificios y barcos, tambien para alimentar a tu gente. Los barcos y algunos edificios te ayudarán a alimentarlos también.

No necesitas construir un edificio para usarlo, siempre puedes pagarle comida y/o dinero a su propietario para usarlo. A veces es una buena manera de bloquear el edificio de un rival, porque solo un jugador puede estar en un edificio.

This game is really good, it really deserves its place inside the BGG Top10.

It has mechanics similar to Agricola (Harvest, material processing,..) but it is a very different game, maybe even better.

Each turn you can get materials or use a building, and additionally you can buy/sell buildings and/or ships and also pay a previous loan. Buildings and ships will give you points at the end of the game. Materials will give you nothing at the end but you need them in order to build new buildings and ships, also to feed your people. Ships and some buildings will help you to feed them too.

Since you don't need to build a building to use it, you can always pay food and/or money to its owner for using it. Sometimes it is a good way to block an opponent's building because only one player can be at a building.[/color]

The game is a great design and one that I feel is superior to Agricola.  I prefer to play with 3 players max.  Seems like things drag on too long with 4 and more players.  As much as I admire the design, I usually find myself seeing what other games might hit the table rather than jump into a game with four or more.

This is a game I snagged in the fall 2008, played alot for the first month or so but now it just seems to be gathering dust on the shelf.  Why?  Not sure, but I think it's a bit of the Through the Ages factor, i.e., the short version of the game is way too unbalanced, but playing the longer version takes way too long, particularly if playing with a full table of 4-5 players.  Also, if you make a mistake and get behind early, the game is somewhat unforgiving.  On the positive side, though, there are multiple ways to victory, and when I did play the game more often, liked it better than Agricola.  However, I feel both LeHavre and Agricola, like Caylus, are all way overrated here on BGG.

Lots of similarities to Agricola here but its just more fun.  Does not require such a tediously long string of actions to do anything.  Its worker-placement, but with just one worker, which is a great idea when there would be all sorts of temptations to have multiple workers.  I really like how the 'market' works with the ships bringing the basic stuff in.  On the down side, I don't like how some of the buildings work thematically - for example, how come when you smoke fish you get the smoked fish PLUS money?  Where does the money come from?  Also, when you smoke fish, how does a fish which provides one food suddenly provides TWO food after it is smoked?  Weird.

The rules are really quite simple and straightforward, the turn is very easy with only one action plus buy/sell as many as you can/want.  For your action take some goods or use a building.  Not much more to the rules than that - loads of bits and loads of buildings.  It's the type of game I want to play again, it's got nice bits and plays fairly long.  It's a gamers game and I loved every minute of it.

In my experience this game is the master generator of AP.  Players that normally play a game decisively, will still suffer from AP and players who normally have bad AP will make this game last way too long...six hours...which is how long my last game was and hence why I sold my copy....yuck.

I like long games, I don't like long downtime.  This game is ok with 3 people who know what they are doing and promise to limit the AP, but otherwise forget about it.  
I have played this about 20 times and after the first five the fun wares thin.
Bought it again after playing the app 1,000 times and will only play it with 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 10
Rating Upgraded to a 9 after 6 plays (2/18/09). Upgraded again to a 10 after a remarkable 7th play (2/25/09).  

Le Havre embodies the joyous union of Abundance, Free Play, and Planning. The game gives you eight commodities that can be refined into more valuable resources, shipped for profit, used for construction, or burned for energy. And the stuff just piles up. You have to maintain your workforce at the end of each round, which provides just enough of a spur to keep your planning razor sharp. The game is a contest of ingenuity. It's about knowing when to lay claim to a stockpile of resources, how to turn them to advantage, and when to pause and interfere with the plans of another player. Like Glory to Rome, this is a game that pounds into the home stretch. No other game quite captures the spirit of productivity as well as Le Havre. 

Advice to prospective players/buyers: Play with three the first time. Heed this advice. Also, going in you should know that the system here is open-ended enough to confound new players. I love Le Havre, but on my first play I gave it a mystified 7 rating. I don't think I really "got it" until my fourth play.

I like this game. My gaming buddies don't, calling it a "spreadsheet" game. There are perhaps too many bits to fiddle with in real life (having very small resource tokens that are one thing on one side and another thing on the other is a pain in the a**), so this is likely better as an on-line or pass-and-play computer app.

Played Solo a few times now and the game is deserving of at least an 8.  I really want to play with more people but have concerns for length.  I think this game begs for AP more than any other game I have played before.  Looking for the most optimum play can be difficult with so many possible actions.

Update: Bummer, I played a 3 player game and it took 4 hours to play. Mind you our group is not overly AP prone and typically we play games quicker than what the game box suggests.  The game just went on and on and really left a bad taste in my mouth.  In and off itself it’s a good game, but the time to play vs payout is just too steep.  We could have played 2 four player games of Caylus in the same amount of time it took us to play 1 3 player game of Le Havre.  I don’t see us shaving much time off either.  The guys I played with caught on really quick.  I will gladly play it again, but it just doesn’t stand a chance for table time when compared to our other options.

After first play this might be better than Agricola and I enjoy Agricola.

This game is broken. Great idea. I love the idea of buying buildings and using them to change iron into steel and then shipping it for a profit which is exactly what a friend of mine did with lots of the resources. I beat her in a 4 player game by simply sitting back and buying lots of buildings for their points. This is all I would do in future to win the game. Boring. The building values need to be halved to stop this from happening.
Also, takes a long time to play.

After several plays I found myself thinking about it frequently.  The amount of choice near endgame is overwhelming.

My favorite of the Uwe Rosenberg games.  The theme isn't quite as rich as his other games but, unlike some of the others, I feel like there are more options.  Where in the other games I'm trying to find the one or two things that will move me forward, in Le Havre I'm trying to narrow down which of many good options I want most.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far I've only played the basic game, so my rating is subject to change.

I'm extremely wary of the play time and try to exercise caution, as a long, drawn-out game is sure to sink Le Havre's prospects for long term play.  In general, it's easy to get people to try it, as I've taught Agricola to many people, most of whom have enjoyed it.  And in a way this game is simpler to teach.  But the game must be played quickly, as anywhere over 2 hours would simply be too much for me.  

The theme is much less compelling here than in Agricola, but it also seems like there is the potential for more strategic long-range planning.  There seems to be a nice amount of options while still forcing you to keep on your toes to meet your food needs.  So a worthy follow-up, but not yet as good as Agricola.  We'll see how it goes.

This game has the distinction of being the 900th game that I have rated here on BGG.

Absolutely brilliant 'heavy' eurogame. My favorite euro right now. I fell in love with it after 5 minutes of playing. It has a significant learning curve and a lot of strategies to explore. It is utterly strategic on the one side and on the other side the special buildings make every play different. And taking into account that there are 30+ special buildings in the game and only 5 are used each time, the game doesn't get boring after many plays and you always discover something new.

I had some concerns about Le Havre: the necessity of counting backwards from the end, the swinginess of the last stages, and the difficulty of gauging correct or incorrect plays. But in the end, I'm won over by the richness of the gameplay and the attention to detail found in the design and presentation. I'm only bothered a little by the wild range of usefulness among the special buildings. Playable from 1 and up, although you'll probably want 3-4 for best results.

2014-11-16 - Very strong 8 after two two-player games. One short, one full length.

2015-09-20 - 8->7 - It's a good game and I like to play it but it quite rarely hits the table for some reason. I think I prefer Tzolk'in or Terra Mystica when it comes to a little heavier euro game. Le Havre sometimes lasts a bit long and can be punishing when you will not take care of food in the early stage of the game which can lead to tiring play.

2015-09-28 - 7->7,5 - Quite suprisingly I played with three players today and I prefer it with 3 than with 2. It has more interesting choices and more cool buildings. However our game took 2,5 hours with quite fast players. So it is something around a maximum time limit for me and for this particular game. I would prefer if it was a little bit shorter, but it is a solid game and I like it.

2015-10-19 - 7.5->7 - Back to 7. It's just a little bit too long and it's the main reason I don't want to play it as often.

I always am up for a game of Le Havre (although usually with 2-3 players). The use of one worker is very unique and even though it seems like you can't get much done with one worker, by the end of the game you're flooded with resources.

Every turn there are many options presented to you, there seems to always be an array of good options. Want a whole stack of clay? Done. Want to make your cattle into tons meat and leather? Sure!

The variable board state that depends on the order the cards come out (and the special buildings), really keeps each game different and lets players experiment with different strategies from game to game. I love seeing all the new combos of actions people chain together or use buildings in ways I never thought to.

感想：
1. 出奇地係好易學的GAME
2. 特別建築牌的隨機抽取影響很大，因為每場GAME大約出現6張，但其能力對於場上的影響不小，要如何處理這個變數對玩家是考驗，但同時對於重口味的玩家可能認為不可取。
3. 傳統的德式，基本上沒有主題性可言。玩完的記憶中，除了有木船、鐵船、鋼船，遊輪，和越食越多飯的工人外，也就沒有其他了。
4. 網上曾經見過有網友評價說此作是設定比較花時間，但實際玩來又沒有太大感覺，可能玩家本身的收納有很大程度的影響。
5. 不過永遠記得朋友一路一路說，點解D工人要食咁多飯的！！

Uwe's best or 2nd best game next to Ora et Labora which I sadly don't own and haven't played enough. This game is a blast with so many choices yet such a simple game. I've seen great combos being utterly destroyed by those 6 special buildings so surely no 2 games are the same.

Surprised to find myself liking this so much, as my initial impression was that it was "more" Agricola. However, the Caylus elements actually make it much heavier and often more interesting.  I particularly enjoy the interactions of upgraded goods, especially how they have so many different functions: building materials, food, trade goods, and even fuel (my favorite innovation from this game, especially how wood can be used as fuel or for building).

The luxury liners seem swingy, though, so it might take more plays to see how they actually work in games with experienced players.  I also wish that shipping played a larger role -- for instance, having another shipping card available -- for both thematic and strategic reasons.  Or maybe I was just miffed I got blocked out of the shipping center in the last few turns when I really wanted to put my fleet to use unloading unused grain and cattle.

One other minor criticism: this game took MUCH longer than expected.  I think it took us about four or five hours with three people.  That's a very long game, even for the first playthrough.

Overall, I really liked Le Havre and I think I'll be angling for a copy in the near future.  I'd love to get more plays in, although with the complexity and length I'm not sure how often I'd be able to get a group together.

RATING: 5
Update after more solo play.  The solo game doesn't provide much challenge, as there's no competition for the ships, buildings or goods.  I'm not sure I like the game enough to bring it out at my limited face to face gaming time, as there are many games that I enjoy more.  Also, setup takes a while as there are many goods and cards to place on the board.

Initial rating based on solo play.  Interesting game, I can see where having more players would be better.

I like building economic engines, and you can see that there are several combinations and paths to victory.  Not as many fussy bits and card combinations as Agricola, and I like the theme more.  My rating could go up with more multi-player games.

RATING: 5
I've played this a couple of times now and have yet to appreciate it.  There do not seem to be any apparent strategies other than to simply get enough food to feed your folks and then buy as many buildings as you can. I realize that I am probably missing much of the subtle interaction of the various components.  However,  I am never crazy about a game that I have already invested over 7 hours in and have yet to understand or enjoy.

Such a great 2 player game (haven't tried it with other player counts yet) I can't recommend this enough. Lots of good choices to make every turn.

The three-player goes much faster and is much better (though my four-player games had newbies).  I like this much better than Agricola.  It seems "tighter", "cleaner", more manageable, easier to get a handle on.  I like the artwork a lot better too.  After playing Agricola I was thinking about buying it.  Now, after three plays, I will buy Le Havre.  I've upgraded my rating from an eight to a nine.  Is a ten next?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Absolute freedom compared to Agricola. Fluid and clever gameplay. I really like that the group's play dictates the gameplay directly. If the group is highly skilled Le Havre's buildings will be all available during midgame and it's all about scoring later on. 

Upate:
What sets Agricola apart from Le Havre is the integration of the theme. While Agricola is lovely and you really care for your farm, Le Havre is more abstract and the "caring" concept is strictly abstract as worker feeding is just a mechanic and not realized during game play.

Update:
I now love the theme and its integration. It absolutely rocks. But I highly recommend to use some boxes on the board for the ressources. It enhances the experience significantly! Otherwise there's only one small problem: cokery and steel ships are too dominating in the end game.

Many people I know love it more than Agricola.  The core game I like better, but I am currently only rating it below Agricola due to Agricola's content in the box.

Too much, too long, lots of fiddling with the game bits.  

5 years later and I have played this again (#4 total).  I've raised my rating from 5 to 6.  It is a good game.  But not a great fit for me.

The constant attention to moving the boats and setting out the tokens gets old.

The game grows and grows.  Seeing and remembering all the options becomes more difficult as the game develops.

The focus of attention is not the game board, but the cards in front of all of the players.  I prefer a game where I can concentrate on the board, rather than searching for the information scattered across the table.

None of my criticisms are necessarily bad dings.  They are just indications why this game misses my sweet spot.

Love/Hate feeling about this game.  Always loved the way resource collection worked in the game in combination with the buildings and such.  Not a big fan of either the way the boat moves along the track nor the boat mechanic as well.  Understand the need for both in the way the game was designed but just didn't find the game as fun after awhile.  Ora et labora and games like that have simply held up much better to multiple plays.

Le Havre is growing on me now that I've now played nine games and have had the chance to try various strategies (some of which were successful and some downright disastrous). There does seem to be sufficient variance in strategy depending on how the buildings stack up in the proposal piles. My rating has now gone up from 8 to 8.5 and we'll see if this trend continues.

First play was okay, didn't do to badly, 2nd in 5 player game.  For those who say you shouldn't play your first game with more than 3, I might disagree.  It depends on your competitiveness and ability to make quick decisions.  There were two of us that were first timers and the game only took about 2.5 hours.  I like it so far but need more plays to really give it a fair rating.  This game has two many choices for most novices, must admit that short game would be better for newcomers unless they are heavy gamers.  Like Agricola and Caylus both much better.

To me Le Havre is a solid game that offers a lot of choices to its players, much like many of Uwe's other games, but is one that is just outclassed by OeL and suffers because of it. If I was short on time I'd play this over OeL, given that it seems to play quicker, but otherwise there isn't too much that it brings to the table that differentiates itself in a unique way that I wouldn't just prefer to play OeL.

[6.5/10]
A dry optimalisation game with very few (optimal) paths to victory and non-existent theme.

I like the synergies between buildings and general complexity but hate how the worker placement mechanic was implemented. It's a strongly deficit-driven game which can lead to feeling frusrated and unfulfilled.
The hunger mechanism is also quite restrictive, narrowing possible paths to victory even further.

2017-11-23
[6.5/10]
I got really accustomed to hunger and constant deficit mechanisms playing games like Agricola. I thought that with Agricola being one of my favourites I could re-visit Le Havre and raise my rating.

Sadly my verdinct stands. In different form mind you (and passed with a much wider boardgamer perspective this time around), but my inability to like this game hasn't changed much.

Reiterating:
+ Lots of choices, each game can be different. A true euro-sandbox.
- A dry optimalisation with overabundance of options.
- The most chaotic and paralysis prone game I own. Having 25+ buildings spread in different orientation around the table doesn't help.

To sum up - my brain doesn't seem to work well with Le Havre. My scores are just below average which I consider bad. Even a 2 year break doesn't justify this.
Perhaps I'm just not smart enough and this is what frustrates me, but I tend to score quite high in other medium-heavy games, so it's not the best line of defense for Le Havre.

Maybe in 2 more years...

Lots of tension, difficult choices, and multiple options make this follow up to Agicola a big success for me. Some randomness is injected via Special Buildings and the order of the Standard Buildings, but mostly a perfect information game that plays great with 2, 3 and 4 (I think 5 is too many). I like the progression from food consumption being the focus in the early game moving mid way through the game to a vp focus and a big finish. Although each round is set up with small incremental turns (with 4 players, every 4th round you only get 1 action), there are several good options for long term strategy. Can be long (especially for 4) but if each action can be cut to around 1 min each, it does not wear out its welcome.

Excellent economic strategy game with lots of possible actions and high replayability. Make sure to build a few ships! Nice story arc. During the first plays, it is annoyingly difficult to get a good overview of the different buildings in front of the other players, although this improves when you start to know the buildings and their characteristics with more plays. Definitely a learning curve! **** Played the short version once. The long version is better, although you still lack actions to do everything you want to do.

[size=12][b]Top 100 board games list[/b][/size]

[size=12][b]Why I like Le Havre:[/b][/size]
+ I like how the fishing theme integrates with a few of the mechanics to make the game more intuitive.
+ The game has high replayability with the variable normal card deck set-up and the special building's deck.
+ The game allows for meaningful decisions.
+ The game is easier to teach than most games with a similar weight due to the limited number of decisions a player can make on their turn. In other words, I coped with the complexity of the game. I have also taught this game to a non-gamer and they did alright. 
+ There is little downtime between turns in a two player game. The "feed your people" phase at the end of each round also keeps things interesting over the games long duration. I have hence made an exception for the duration. 

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Le Havre:[/b][/size]
/ The game board is a bit small so fitting the goods tokens on their allocated space is somewhat difficult. I instead placing paper cupcake holders on the resource spots and storing the appropriate resources inside. 
/ The game is missing player boards. Somebody on BGG, fortunately, addressed this issue. 
/ I am concerned that the strategies for the game will get repetitive after a lot of plays.

I have played the whole harvest trilogy and this one is my favorite.  Even with the expansion, there are just some special buildings I never see.  

Still I like the idea of I have a bunch of great moves instead of Agricola's  "limited" moves.

Added stackable bead containers and makes set up MUCH faster.  

Put this up to 10, as I don't think I have ever turned down a game of Le Havre.

Very good game but trouble getting to play it. It is easier than Agricola in the sense that it's more of an open environment. The "harvest" pressure is much less. At the same time, the openess makes it harder to learn and figure out what to do so new players can be overwhelmed quickly.

RATING: 9
Resource management at its best. Lots of resource gathering, lots of interaction, lots of buying things. Place a worker piece on a building to use its ability or gather resources from a central pool. Taking a specific resource denies others of that resource. Resources are used to convert into victory points, buy buildings (which provide victory points and further abilities) or feeding your people. The only downside of the game is that towards the end there is a lot of counting required in order to find the best way to accumulate the maximum victory points, but some people like that in a game.

Nothing terrible wrong in here, but it's too long compared to what you get; I mean you could use the same time playing better games. More interaction and competition between players might boost the game a bit, I think. Still have to give some credit for Le Havre, because there is a very little downtime!

RATING: N/A
In Le Havre, a player’s turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.

A good Rosenberg game.  Interesting mechanics, good tactical play, decent strategy, theme works & is ambient.  On the downside, it's looonnng and your turn can't come up soon enough.  It's best played with 3 I guess.  You get to act more often and that limits the length.   I'd say you can expect a good 1h per player in the game...

I like this more than either Agricola and Caylus.  I fondly refer to this as "AgriCaylus". ;)  It has some similarities in resource management and making buildings and sequential bidding.

RATING: 6
Playing the full game made for a very long game.  Most of the time, the time seemed to fly by fairly quickly.  You are basically trying to be the highest valued merchant by either constructing (or buying) buildings (although buying a building is generally not the most cost efficient method and often may be a waste) or shipping goods out via the shipping line which is also dependent on the number of ships and their capacity.  While you are seeking to gather resources to build these buildings, you also must harvest enough food to feed your company AND acquire enough energy to power the higher level buildings.  For those prone to AI, the vast number of options as the game deepens in the later rounds may cause this game to last even longer.  After a couple plays, this game is continuing to grow on me and I've upped it from a 7 to 8 to 9.  I really like it as a two player game as well.

A game from the Agricola school of, "If you want to pick your nose, start producing boogers 25 turns in advance and hope that the index finger is available when you're done" design, which I find tedious.

I used to rate this a 10. I love the resource-chaining and how you grow from a very small enterprise, one step at a time, to being able to ship huge loads of steel worth mega points.

Unfortunately I've since reduced that ranking from 10 to 9 because shipping coke and steel feels SO dominant that I've never even bothered with any of the other fun things in the game. Cattle are just kind of there as an afterthought.

Game probably needed a balancing tweak or two to make it terrific.

Still, its one of my favorite games.

We have been huge fans of [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=39683][/thing].  In fact, Agricola is one of our favorite games and we've gotten in over a hundred plays.  Despite that, we had avoided getting [thing=35677][/thing] for a while since we were intimidated by its increased complexity and game length.  Still, after a long time of trying many light-to-medium weight games, my wife said she wanted something more "meaty" instead.  Luckily, we ended up finally getting a copy from our Secret Santa.  Thanks Secret Santa!

We gave it a spin and we immediately enjoyed it.  We were wrong to wait so long to try it!  Each turn is fairly simple---add some more resources and then either take resources or use a building action.  However, the sheer number of resources makes the game interesting.  There are building resources, energy resources, food resources, with many of the resources having values in all of the above, and they can all be upgraded.  Building actions give you special abilities.  There are a lot of interacting factors involved.  Unlike Agricola, where you feel like you're barely making out until the very end, Le Havre lets you cut loose.  By the middle of the game, you should have a decent engine going and then it's time to prime it and let it run.  What Le Havre loses in tension from Agricola it makes up for in possibilities.  What's so addictive is that it feels like there are many different paths to victory that you can try out---do you try for lots of ships?  Ship lots of goods?  Build a lot of buildings?  Perhaps some strategies will become more obvious with more plays, but for now we're enjoying playing in the sandlot

At first, we were afraid that Le Havre would lack the variety of Agricola with its Improvement and Occupation cards, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.  The semi-random order of the buildings as well as the resources can subtly bend each game and make the outcome surprisingly different.  Even things like the special buildings can dramatically change your strategy.  We haven't felt like having this much to explore in a game in a long time.

At this point, I think we can say that we're huge fans of Uwe Rosenberg's games.  For some reason, his style really resonates with us.  All of the games work very well for two players, so they're all games that we will enjoy for a while.  Agricola scratches the "tense" itch, while Le Havre scratches the "possibilities" itch.  Both are great.

RATING: 9
I wasn't able to stop thinking about this game ever since I played it at BGG Con Spring.  It was my most memorable play. So I bought it of course.

I love this game.  The funnest thing about it is that you feel like you're picking, each turn, between many good--and several great--options.  The game progresses with you being able to do more and more with a single turn.  I also like that each turn you are just picking one thing--it feels much simpler that way.

Love the replayability straight out of the box with all the special buildings, and how the standard buildings will also never come out the same way twice, which means the whole landscape of the economy will be different every game.

The round cards seem a bit ridiculous...would have been way simpler to have one double-sided card for each of the player counts, and that card tells you on each round what comes out, and the ships are separate cards.  Granted, their method used as few cards as possible to get the desired result which is kind of neat...but ultimately feels like a needless complication in learning the game.  Works great once you understand it so this is a quibble only.

Personally I like the art, although it's no Laukat game.  The art is kind of simple; uses straight black lines filled in with solid pastel colors, and the buildings are drawn at not quite a bird's eye view but at an angle. 

The handling of loans is interesting.  I won a game after taking out lots of loans.  Counter-intuitive.  Now I see why they don't allow you to take out a loan unless the game requires you to pay and you can't...seems a little weird that the best course of action could be to purposefully not feed your people so that you have to take out a loan so that you have extra money so that you can buy the thing that you otherwise couldn't have bought because you can't just take out a loan when you want to.  Very weird indeed.  Another quibble.

Too fiddly for what it offers.  you need to sort out the cards for different player's count.  

Brought the iPad version and found it quite enjoyable (without the fiddleness).  Definitely electronic better than physical.

Also I found the game boil down to limited way of victory.  (which is getting steel ship and shipping them).

Don't know why it has such a high ranking in BGG

My rating is due to electronic version only.  If physical a mere 6.5

WOW! Great economic engine game. Really flows well and moves quickly. I expect to play this dozens of more times.

Totally fun economic engine game! So far playing 'seat of pants', and not overthinking things. Stay tuned.


The rules make the game longer than needed.
Issues: 7 turns, 'free' space. What is this fetish over the term 'Free'? In this case this means an Empty or Unnoccupied space. A "Free" space is one for which there is no Fee. The example, read in its entirety, made this clear. At least I didn't have to suffer any [i]fey Whilsts[/i].

This game never ceases to be fun.  I've played it at least 90-100 times by now, and that's saying something for a 2.5/3.0 hour game [edit: games take more like 2 hours these days].  Somehow manages to feel fresh every time, always a new opportunity, a new combination of available resources and buildings, something new to try.  Unlike many other games, there is a wealth of GOOD choices to make on a turn.  Very often you have to decide between making three excellent moves.  Have played almost exclusively with two players, playing with three feels like a different (and exciting) game entirely.

This game replaced Agricola for me.  I like games where I have options and different strategies available to me.  This is a great sandbox game to try out different strategies based on the order of the buildings available.  With enough plays I can see certain strategies winning over others but for casual play I like trying the different possibilities.

Game length is a big factor.  A game can take 3 hours.

I'm going to hate this game.

I'll hate it so much that I'll buy the German edition so I can play it before an English release. I might even hate it so much that I do full color paste-ups.

I KNOW I will hate it enough to buy the English edition as well.

Update:

It's Agricola's cousin Sally; the HOT cousin. She likes you, and you'l love her right back.

The actions are buildings, and while there are some centralized actions, the majority are spread between the players as they "build" them. It can be a bit tougher to know what your options are at a glance, but there are MORE options, MORE synergy, and MORE avenues to victory. There are also more bits in this one than Agricola.

Play time is relatively the same, though I think the learning curve longer.

Update Update:

Ewe is 2 for 2. Amazing. Fantastic, multipathed system. I'm enjoying this one just as much as Agricola.

i love buildings things and little economies.  this game is pretty fun, but im starting to wish there were more options.  for example, fish is not very valuable long term, and often theres nothing you can do about it.  this game steers you away from specialization and monopolizing one area to win the game.  unless you specialize in coke.

RATING: 7
Before playing thought it might be too similar to Agricola, but now that I have a couple of plays, I can see that was wrong.  Very good game, that starts out with only a few decisions, collecting resources without much purpose to having way too many things you want to do and time running out.  Strangely, that is an effect I feel despite the play time, which has been in excess of 4 hours both times (3 player), though we do tend to play slow.  Lots of play in this one and I want to play it again, once I have caught up on sleep.

What is it about Le Havre?  The game simply casts a spell over me.  It's weird... it's not like I care about the theme.  The art is good/cute, but nothing special.  It doesn't look especially pretty sitting on the table, with its messy piles of chits.  It's not even like I especially care about resource management as a mechanic or style of play.  The play itself tends to feel a little repetitive, though I haven't yet played so many games to render that conclusion.  And yet strategically, the game spreads out in all directions; its breadth is marvelous.  And because of that, there's always a good direction to go.  The pace can be slack sometimes, but it just hits the sweet spot in terms of how far I like/need to plan ahead.  This game makes me swoon.

It took me three plays of Agricola to come to terms with what all the fuss was about, and even then, I felt it was highly over-rated.  Not so of Le Havre, after three turns I was hooked, and I think of these two somewhat similar games, Le Havre is by far the superior.  Looooooooong game, the only reason I don't rate it higher.  But it is a game that I barely notice the time passing bye... unlike something like Advanced Civ, the long play time of Le Havre is WORTH the investment in terms of the amount of "action" you get back for time put in.

Another Uwe gem.  Resources accumulate each round at the harbor and on your turn you can take resources or place your one worker on one of the buildings.  You also freely buy buildings if you have the money.  At the end of each round you need to feed your workers and it goes up steadily throughout the game.  You can mitigate this by buying ships.  

Many different ways to win with different industries, shipping, special cards.  I really like all game Uwe so this is a must own game.

The target to shoot for is those buildings and ships. Sometimes you can get sidetracked and what you need gets swiped. It's generally cheaper to build than buy. I like this a little better than its cousin Agricola.

[i]Le Havre[/i] was supposed to be a solid winner given the success of [i]Agricola[/i], but it very nearly turned into a big disappointment. In our first game (just the two of us), my wife hated it. And I mean "hated". She said popping bubble wrap was more enjoyable. Fortunately I convinced her to try it with one of the other couples in our group and she enjoyed it more as a four player game, but I still think she enjoyed organizing the bead box we got for it more than she does playing it. For me, [i]Le Havre[/i] has topped [i]Agricola[/i]. [i]Agricola[/i] is about getting a food engine working and then getting a little of everything, [i]Le Havre[/i] is about getting a food engine going and then specializing in something. Finding that something is the interesting part.

This is not agricola - it feels very different.  While it shares some elements, it is not the same.

There are many possibilities to get buildings and ships that interact with one another, with no one clear path for which to compete.  

You need a mix of points from buildings and points from shipping, or goods that produce $ with special buildings (6 random are selected, so will vary each game).

I am interested in playing this more to explore those strategies (or see what others might come up with...)

Agricola is definitely worth buying first.

Seems like a heavier AGRICOLA (which is already a heavier PUERTO RICO). I don't have the group of dedicated gamers necessary to engage this game with any regularity worth purchasing. 

TV says that this plays great as a 2 player game. One of his favorites. 

Seems to be a longer game than AGRICOLA.

Vs. Agricola as a solo game: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/470218/le-havre-or-agricola-better-solo-game
Vs. Agricola in game length: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/508744/game-length-and-comparison-to-agricola-and-pr

BOTTOM LINE: Get through PR and Notre Dame first. THEN try Agricola. THEN perhaps try this. NB: We still need to play more Stone Age.

One review on Amazon said: "Feeding your people is a tremendous upkeep cost. The way the game is balanced, you must spend about half of your actions feeding your people. That means that on some turns, all you are doing is placing workers to get food so you don't incur the punishments for not feeding your people. This aspect of the game is entirely too tedious. There are plenty of other worker placement games that do not have such a ridiculous upkeep. Take "Pillars of the Earth" or "Kingsburg". Neither of them has an upkeep cost like Le Havre. If the food upkeep in Le Havre is such a wonderful idea, would Kingsburg or Pillars of the Earth be better if a food upkeep cost was added to these games in aa future expansion? I think not."

I did read somewhere that this game could be played fairly quickly with 2 players. Perhaps as quickly as the 2 player Le Havre Inland Port. 

This may be with trying!!

5/2009 Very good impressions after first play. It's been named Agricolas successor.  Granted, there are some similarities, but LeHavre is a much better put together game.  There's lot's of fiddly parts but it all seems thought through and fits well together.  Further plays are necessary.

I really don't like Rosenberg's games, and this is probably the worst one.  
The game rolls on like a juggernaught following exactly the same pattern every time and players have a fixed path down which they travel as efficiently as possible. There are many choices, but they all come down to save a penny here, gain a point there. Never have I felt so much like the game was playing me, rather than the other way around

In the same trilogy as Agricola, but I prefer this one so much more.  The theme works well and all of the mechanics seem to be fairly intuitive after you understand the initial gameplay.  It runs longer than Agricola, but it's just a much better experience than its predecessor.  (PS - I hate Agricola)

This is a great engine-builder, and I really enjoy playing it, although it's length means it doesn't often get to the table. I love how simple it is to teach and play, and turns can go very quickly for the most part; there will be times where a player needs to work out what to do and spend a while thinking, but on the flip-side, this often results in having several turns planned out.

The game is very long due to lack of actions per turn when playing with 5 players, however the game itself is very deep and satisfying. I really like the ability to block actions by remaining on a building and taking goods. A better all around game than Agricola, but more complex to teach and learn.

Rating is solely based on playing the iOS version on a phone. Have yet to play the hard copy.

Unorginal (but well crafted) resource management game, with a lot of correlated parts (goods, buildings, need for food, need for VPs, etc.).

+Puertico Rico on steroïds.
.A building and shipping game in its core, it has very deep strategies and no luck. If you didn't like Agricola only because of the randomness the cards added, this is the game for you.
.It's an  upgrade from Puerto Rico because you can not only build but also sell buildings. The economic chain is much more worked out. Every game is different because of the unique mix of the 3 proposal building stacks who differs every game. The ability of taking loans is very challenging ; how many loans can you afford ?
.steep learning curve ; you must have a good understanding of every building.
.best playable with 3.

- 
game is very long with  4 players. 
with 5 gamers the strategical scope diminishes (only tactical decisions) and game is too long.
less variability in strategical decisions in comparison with agricola but far more possibilities when you compare with puerto rico

Awesome game; one of my favorites.  Have only played in iOS but playing it on my iPAD has made me want to purchase the actual game.  What is brilliant about this game is the player turns are SO simple - on your turn you either pick an available resource, or you build or buy something. That's it.  But yet the strategy is enormous, and more and more of it gets revealed the more you play it.  You may thing there's not much to it, but the REALLY is. There's also the Agricola/Stone Age-type tension involved where you have to feed your family while building things so it requires a delicate balance of growing and maintaining.  
Cool theme too, it just works.

This game is fun, but I lowered my opinion of it for a while when Uwe Rosenberg geek-mailed everyone who rated it a "10" asking for votes in some German game competition. (And since I like it much better than Agricola, I felt compelled to lower that too. I never felt compelled to raise Agricola back up again.) I like Le Havre much better than Agricola. The rules are a bit difficult to decipher, but well worth the effort. Once you learn it, it takes about 3 hours for a four player (long) game, but turns are quick and it's actually fun. The short game isn't worth playing, because you don't get time to develop a strategy. Finding players for the long game became too difficult.

I just don't see the joy in these Eurogames that all have the same damn mechanics that feel limiting for the duration of the game. Each of these games (Puerto Rico, Agricola) all have the same feel, almost the same damn mechanics and all leave you feeling frustrated and unsatisfied even if you win. These games presume to be more than they are, more in depth, but they are simply constricted decision making. If there were a little more resolution of action, strategy, decision-making in these games, then they'd live up to their hype.

Fun euro.  Lots of options at any given point, though it doesn't seem as completely overwhelming as O&L (although it is close).  Enjoy this much more than O&L; I don't think either will come close to topping Agricola.

The long game can drag out at the end.  The short game is actually nicer, because it doesn't drag out, plus the beginning is faster because you start with more resources.  We now just add some special buildings into the short game--the best of both worlds!

I wish the food requirements weren't quite so harsh, but at the same time, I wonder if that isn't part of what makes this game so great. You have to be thinking about the end as soon as you begin, and there's always more you want to do than you can possibly complete. I've heard that the game is scripted because you have to ship to win, but that's not true. Building an engine of buildings and exploiting them is a viable winning strategy.

Played two "short" games so far.  Both came in at over four hours with 3 experienced gamers.  I get the feeling that there is an optimal path through this game and that removes the sense of lots of different strategies for me.  And at four hours a game it's difficult to get excited about playing because if somebody has figured the optimal route then the weaker players have no chance. Having said that, I did enjoy the two games and would definitely play again, time allowing.

A great eurogame, maybe a step better than Agricola.
The turn structure is fixed but each turn you'll have to make hard choices on what to do: harvest goods, use a building or build a building or a ship.
I like the way the goods can have several uses: money, food, energy, construction, wealth...
I've seen on pictures that the cardboad version uses a lot of space; I have the iOS version and it's perfect.

Tough game. This is NOT a game that you can coast through! It's intense and requires long-term planning. At best, Le Havre is a little dry. At worst, it's purely mathematical. Either way, it's still a solid game that consistently rewards the best player. 

Update: 2/10/17

Played this again today. It's long but it's still really solid. Good stuff!

RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair

So Le Havre is basically the same as all the other resource management/worker placement games, but with lots more resources, roles and rules? Okay, it adds depth, but I'm struggling to see why you'd play this over Puerto Rico or Agricola.

Game plays swimmingly with 2. Beautiful art and superb mechanics. A favorite of me and my wife. End game is a bit disappointing as it always seems to turn into a race to ship coke and steel, however it is an exhilarating race.

RATING: 8
Played a couple of times vs my girlfriend, never with more than 2 players. A fun and easy to learn game. It lacks different kinds of actions in my opinion. For example in Agricola you can sow, plow, build fences, stables, rooms etc. In this game all you do is collect resources and either turn them into something else or build boats or buildings.

Simple but fun! I'd like to try out a 3-player game some day, I'm sure it'll get more competitive that way.

I _LOVE_ this for 2 or 3 players.  I have not played with 4 or 5 but I don't think my typical group will enjoy it as much due to the greater time between plays and fewer plays per round.  Being able to take loans and pay them back (vs Agricola beggar cards) and the food-for-money exchange enables less of the "how am I going to feed" scare and more room for strategy in my opinion.

Possibly a little long for some people, but as we've played more it has gotten to moving along quite quickly.

Delightful economic puzzle. While there are a lot of moving parts, it isn't really a complicated game - collect resources to turn into other resources to buy buildings which produce other resources, etc. 

It has the perfect amount of interaction for a Euro - there's quite a bit of blocking and taking something lucrative before someone else, but there isn't the outright screwage which makes deep planning futile.

Also, while the puzzle is theoretically the same in every game, how other players take things and which building cards happen to come up make each game completely different. Definitely one you'll be thinking about after you play, which I can't say about many games.

Le Havre is bit heavier (ughh, but yes.. really) and bit less replayable than Agricola (only couple of randomized cards per game), but is worth the effort and looks as great. The theme is pretty immersive, and surprisingly enjoyable. Sure, farming is more obvious and interesting, but managing shipyards is kinda cool too, especially with this kind of artwork. It's not a cube pusher. I don't want to play often, but when I do I enjoy it.

A highly compelling game. I wasn't a fan of Agricola at all, but I really liked this one. We hugely messed up the rules during our first play, but still had a great time going through and learning it. I'm expecting that this game will be the king of the "euro engine" games for me and I simply cannot wait to play again. This left my whole game group thinking hard as they walked out the door; everyone had Le Havre fever.

Egy nagyon igényesen kivitelezett magyarított verziót volt szerencsém kipróbálni, ennek ellenére maga a játék az utóbbi idők legrosszabb játékélményét nyújtotta. Első (rövidített szabályok szerint játszott) játék, tehát nyilván nem vágtam a helyes stratégiát. Nem vettem hajót a játék elején, csak épületeket, bízva benne, hogy azt majd kajáért/pénzért használják a többiek + én ingyen használhatom őket + a játék végén pontot hoznak. Ezután kb. a játék közepétől arról szólt minden köröm, hogy a körönkénti nyavalyás 2 akciómból (3 fős játék) valahogy kihozzam az egyre magasabb értékű kör végi kajáltatást. Az utolsó 2 körben ez minden igyekezetem ellenére nem sikerült, fel kellett vennem egy halom kölcsönt, ami hozott 35 mínusz pontot a játék végén... Ebből az jött le nekem, hogy a játék első felében nagyrészt fix a stratégia, muszáj hajót venni, enélkül kilátástalan az ember helyzete. Mondhat bárki bármit, ha egy játékban az elején ilyen szinten be lehet ragadni, akkor az nem egy jól megtervezett játék. Ha nincs B terv, amivel ki lehet kecmeregni a rossz pozícióból, akkor az nem játék (= szórakozás), hanem szenvedés; lásd a Catant, ahol a kezdeti pozíciók elfoglalása a kulcs, ha ezt elcseszi az ember és a dobások sem jönnek ki jól, akkor nincs B terv, csak min. 1,5 óra bosszúság és szenvedés. Még mindíg nem találtam a Stone Age-nél szórakoztatóbb és jobb worker placement játékot.

A very long Euro (plan for 3+ hours, especially if you play the long form), but chill and mellow in feeling. I like building boats.

I really like the micro-actions, where you need multiple actions to accomplish something. However, the game seems to have a king making factor that leaves a bad taste (in the 3rd game one player just decided to help another player, and that turned into a considerable swing). Moreover, ships seems to be way too powerful...

After one play, it seems that getting coal, converting it to coke, then selling is the best play. But, once everyone knows this it can likely be slowed down or blocked, making the fight for other sources of points in the interim more important. My gut feel is that this is likely best with three. Eager to play again.

In our second play, the coal producing building, coal-to-coke converter and shipping line all came out late. This changed the game such that constructing buildings was a stronger strategy as well as using a special building that converted an iron and three meat to 16 (or maybe it was 18) bucks.

It appears that between the varied special buildings and the order of appearance of the standard buildings there will be plenty of variability from game to game, even if certain strategies are generally best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I prefer this game with 3 players over any other player count. Kind of long for what it is, I'm usually ready for the game to end right about when it is starting to wrap up. I really like the turn structure, and the somewhat variable tech tree is amazing. Le Havre has some really great mechanics working for it and is a big inspiration for me.

01/16/10 Played a three-player "short" game. Enjoyable overall, but having to worry about food 80% of the time is a drag. What I don't get theme-wise is what this increased demand per turn represents, as we have no "workers" per se. If we did, and we gradually got more, I could understand the steady increase of this food tax. As it is, it seems to be an artificial constraint to keep players from spending all their resources/time on constructing buildings.
It seemed many of the buildings didn't surface in a three-player game. That put more constraints on us. I see this game is rated best with three. So I wonder about that.
10/03/10 Played another three-player "short" game. A very different affair, as we built all the available buildings. 05/01/11 Another three-player "short" game. 09/17/11 Ditto. 11/17/12 Ditto. 02/26/13 Ditto. Strangely this outing all buildings were built by the end of turn ten, making the last two turns quite anticlimactic. 12/12/15 Played another three-player "short" game (#6). I have still not played the long game. And I'm not sure I want to, as I find two hours of the short game plenty.

Better than Agricola. Competes with Indonesia and Brass (same gameslot). Rating based on one play. More likely to rise to '9' than stay '8'. I look for further plays soon.

Update: Rating raised to '9' after a two player game. 

Update August 2009: Very close to '10' rating. The game just refuses to wear off.

A far, far, far better game than Agricola.  In fact, what Agricola should have been in the first place.  The cards and the actions are the same for everybody, it's just a matter of which order you will execute yours.

It's also a more calculatory game, so if it's not your cup of tea, stay away.

I found the interactions between the players to be quite strategic and very decisive in the game.  The cards offer a variety not equaled in Agricola too.

All in all, a very involving game with tons of choices....difficult choices.  

After playing this, I see Agricola going down in my ratings.  It's still more beginner friendly in the family version flavor than Le Havre though.

A cruel game, I think. The economics are very tight, almost to the point of being restrictive. That's not to say it's not good - it's just a lot meaner than I expected.

Heavier on the brain than Agricola, but less fun: to me it's a bit more multiplayer solitaire, since you're more busy working out how to get to all the possible goals than in Agricola.

But it has some of the same pros as Agricola: Nice buildup of tension through each round, planning stuff and the need to constantly adapt, etc.

So far I have played Le Havre 6 times in almost 6 years. Agricola got on the table 37 times in those years. Says enough.

Still a nice game, but there are so many better games out there that I wonder why this is rated so high.

NL: Pittiger spel dan Agricola van dezelfde maker. Ondanks een aantal vergelijkbare spelprincipes toch een totaal ander spel.

RATING: 5
The reviews for this game have been very good on the Geek, but it really doesn't appeal to me.  I'll probably revisit this score as we play it more, but for now, I feel like I'm playing mechanics, rather than a game.  Since anyone can use a building regardless of who built it, I feel like the entire game simply involves buying victory points based on an arbitrary selection of goods and acquiring food for an increasing number of invisible workers.  This just doesn't represent compelling gameplay for me.  I also feel that it's too long; I usually get bored about 80% of the way through the game, and I'm just happy for it to end.  The short game is much better in this respect, but I feel it changes the overall feel of the game since you start with far more resources and food seems to be less important.  Perhaps I just need to play it more.

You will need one play (at least) to get the basic feel for any strategy, but you will have a lot of fun in the process.  Lots of great choices.  It didn't seem like churning through work to find the fun.  The play is actually rather quick once you get the hang of things.

Like it better than Ora en Labora (or whatever its called) and Agricola, but the feeding action at the end of each round makes no sense at all.  Tough having to keep track of what your opponent's have as buildings with such small text.  Takes a bit longer to play.

RATING: 8
I like many of the mechanics. I really like the way you can buy buildings, and the fact that people NEED those buildings. But I have a problem with the fact that the entire game is building to a single big transaction in the end. You spend the game building your engine, earning money, getting food, converting this to that and that to this, buying ships, all in one big attempt to make one huge shipment of whatever final good you decided to convert to at the end. Up to this point you are cash strapped the entire time.

This is the ultimate economic engine game.  There's a ton of variability from game to game, a plethora of viable strategies and even though careful planning is well-rewarded it somehow doesn't drag A/P wise as much as one would expect.  

I really like the tactical play in this one too.  You can play on other players buildings for a small fee (near the end of the game the options are endless).  Unlike other engine games the tactical play and flexibility allows for a mid-game comeback.  So you're not stuck half-way through with a crappy engine knowing that the stronger players are just getting stronger and will eventually defeat you.  

A brainy exercise for sure and certainly not for everyone.  The toughest thing about the first play is figuring out how to feed yourself without wasting too many actions.  Once you figure that out the rest of the game opens up.

Another Rosenberg hit.  Euro-tacular conversion of raw goods (eight resources) into finished products and capital improvements using different upgrade paths.  Enjoyable and equal to the Agricola hit, without necessarily too much overlap (could easily own Le Havre and Agricola both).  Works nicely with two players, although unequal experience in the game would be a disadvantage (to the noob).  Single player works well and is a hit.

RATING: 8.5
hmm, that was interesting.  each turn seemed to have a lot to chew on and trying to come up with a decent food engine was interesting.  i like the way repeat plays are different as the availability of the building is randomized into three piles.  the plethora of special buildings and only using a few of them each game is neat.

i want to get a couple more 3 player games in.  i do not think a 4 or 5 player game would be anything other than frustrating as at least one player is only getting one action each round.   in a game like this, that seems really tough to do.

***** UPDATE AUG 2009 *****

I continue to enjoy this.  Not sure that I fully grasp (or like?) the loan aspect.  I think paying 1 interest for every 2 loans (rounded up) might work to prevent a massive loan outtake.

I really want to play 3 player.

***** UPDATE OCT 2009 *****

I still enjoy this, but think it is going to settle into the 8-9 range.  2-3 players is still a really good game that I will enjoy from time-to-time, but I believe that this will fall short of "Brett's Hall of Fame".  I still do not really like way loans work and think that there should be a bit more of an interest factor.  I also think that the way scoring really ramps up in the latter rounds is annoying to me, but that is probably just me.  Keep in mind that these are really minor nitpicks and I do like Le Havre and encourage everyone to give it a go.

Dry logistical exercise with an especially strong metaphor. Unlike Agricola, the scoring system actually fits the metaphor; like Agricola... well, everything else. So this is an improvement, but not enough that I would rate it any differently. I don't mind the relative lack of interaction; there's enough, and I'm sure it's deeper than a few plays against the lowest level on the iPad will reveal. Well done, just not especially exciting.

I lost very badly at this game the first time I played it. I want to play it again. Always a sign of a good game.

Second play update: came in dead last again! Focused on building ships and taking the dock. I think sitting to the right of the strongest player is a definite disadvantage. I was regularly blocked by them from doing what I'd consider to the the strongest move.

Anyway, it's still fun for me, I wish it played a little faster but that's board gaming for ya.

Nates copy.  Lots of great stuff going on here.  Multiple paths to win, little downtime, feeling of build up to the end, etc.  Downside is length of game play.

The last 5 turns or so are where things really get tough.

Ugh. Playing this game made me feel like I was being punished.  Severely.  I don't know why I hate this game, considering how much I enjoy Agricola.  Maybe because in Agricola I am trying to build a farm to feed my family.  In Le Havre, you collect junk to build something that lets you turn your junk into other junk that lets you build something else.  It seemed pointless to me.  

If I were really into resource-gathering-economic-min/maxing-spread-sheet-grinds perhaps I would enjoy it more.  But I'm not so I won't.

I own the iOS version, but I will pass on ever wanting to own this as a physical copy. I wanted to really like it, but I find it dull and dry, and the theme is uninteresting. It feels like spreadsheets, working on accouting and taxes. I realize the artwork and components are decent and the concepts/mechanics fine, but the "fun" factor is just not there.

As such, for me, that would make it perhaps the most overrated game on the BGG that I've come across. 

I know there's a fair amount of people who like it---just not me.

RATING: 9.25
Played two shortened games and two long games.  This game is very similar to Agricola in that players compete to collect resources, which are then converted (by buildings) into better resources, which are then used to get victory points (which are actually just straight money) through a variety of mechanisms.  But, as always, there's conflict: only one player can use a building at a time, and there's a limited number of items you can purchase with resources that get you victory points, leading to much competition.  

This is a long, involved game that gets its fangs into you.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the games, though it's clear that the game takes multiple plays to really get a feel for.  

There are tons of things to balance on each turn: you need to acquire resources, you need to get food (which is either resources or modified resources), you need to use buildings to modify resources, you need to use buildings to buy things (other buildings or ships), and you need to watch what everyone else is doing.  And you only get one action each turn.  

One thing I love about the game is that it's entirely balanced play-wise: players start with the same resources, there are no rule-breaking cards people can obtain that only apply to them, and anyone can use any building, even if it was built by another player.  Yet there is enough variability to make the game worth replaying: the game changes greatly with the number of players (as the number of actions each player will get changes), the order the buildings come out in is somewhat randomized, and the order the resources come out in is randomized.  

And even things like running out of food isn't _too_ painful, as players can take out "loans" which can be repaid without much monetary penalty (or even forgiven, if the right building is out).  The game does have its unforgiving elements, though; as with Agricola if a player doesn't get a food-engine up and running, they'll be in a downward spiral by the end of the game.  

I started by playing two of the "short" games; in these games the food required at the end of each turn ramped up extremely quickly, and thus the game felt like a frantic rush to get food (which didn't let players have enough time to use most of the buildings or get the high-point-value items).  

The long game is a VERY different game, and I think it's _far_ superior.  Players start out with far fewer resources than in the short game, and the food requirements ramp up slower (so its easier to get a food engine up).  The long game lets players develop a variety of strategies, and the game progresses beautifully (and has distinct beginning, middle, and end phases).  

I can't wait to play more!

I originally gave this an 8.25, then a 9, and it's now a 9.25, with the only consideration that it's a long game (3 hours for a 3 or a 5 player long game) and thus can only be broken out when there's enough time.

RATING: 7.5
Does not replace Agricola and Agricola does not make le Havre obsolete.

In Le Havre you can buy the available action spots (the buildings) or build/buy new ones.

It is a bit frustating to learn: at the start it is hard to estimate the relative value of a recourse or to know what building is a good one to build/buy and after a few rounds you loose the complete overview especially in a 4 player game with a lot of buildings all over the place in my case. I think it is better to learn the game with 2 players just because of the simple fact that there are less buildings in play. Besides that a first play that takes 3 hours and 20 min of pure playing time is a bit too much :).

To fully enjoy this you need to know at least all the private buildings.

BUT I am going to play this again: the mechanics are cool, it looks nice and I like the positive interaction: come to my awesome building, just pay me some food and use it!

Played it now three times: my brain still hurts

Le Havre nos obliga a jugar a varios turnos vista,  sin olvidar que al final de la ronda debemos realizar un pago de alimentos (o francos) y que este aumenta de forma escandalosa según avanza la partida. El bloqueo de edificios, una mala gestion de los productos, la dureza del resto de jugadores y por supuesto tener barcos, nos permitirá generar riqueza o provocará arrastrar deudas hasta el final.

I think with more plays this could contend to be my second favorite Rosenberg game after Agricola or possibly even eclipse that game as my favorite. The depth of the decision space which derives from the simplest of mechanisms is fantastic. My biggest concern about this game is that it possibly suffers from having a couple of overly dominant strategies, but I have yet to experience that in my limited plays.

Agricola-alapokon nyugvó termelős-gazdálkodós-erőforrás menedzsmentes, olykor agyégetős (de még épphogy nem nagyon), klasszikus euro.

Akinek az Agricola tetszett, ebben sem fog csalódni, akinek nem, az meg inkább hagyja ezt is. Nem hiába Rosenberg tervezte mindkettőt.

Kivitelezése, minősége is kb. Agricola-szintű, azaz teljesen rendben van, sok száz jelölővel, biszbasszal, többféle kártyapaklival.

Ha nem lett volna a parasztszimulátor, erre mondanám, hogy klasszik. Így viszont kicsit olyan "újabb-bőr-a-rókáról" érzésem van. A játék egész jó, de talán túlzás egy háztartásba Agricola és Le Havre is. Pont elég az egyik (ettől még mondjuk megtartom mindkettőt, aztán majd kiderül, mi lesz a sorsa).

Ja, és van szóló (1-játékos) mód is.

Agricola meets Caylus. I've only played solo and I think I like it better than Agricola, which is saying a lot.

Update: WOW!!!! If there is a better economic game (for me) I'm not aware of it. Given the play time to fun ratio, presently, I would actually rather play Le Havre solitaire than most other games multi-player. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration... but... just... wow.

One of the things I love about Le Havre that I wasn't expecting - just the cool tactile nature of those little tiles. It works on a visceral level - your little stacks of resources - it absolutely adds to the enjoyment in a way that Agricola doesn't really do.

It has the same feeling as Agricola, where for the first 2/3 of the game I feel like I'm behind and everything is a mess, then it comes together at the end and I'm scrambling to get as much money as possible before the game ends.

Played today at RinCon... four hours of my life I will never get back. I am really disappointed because after the 'Gric, I had high hopes for this one, but in the end it did not deliver. Convoluted rules, marred further by the horrendous grammar in the rulebook, a mish-mash of game mechanics (think Gric + Caylus) that made things more complicated, less intuitive, and more tedious, and decisions that just failed to ever feel meaningful. I had a hard time giving a crap about anything I myself, or any of my opponents did, and in the end, I just felt like the whole experience was a drag. Collect some tokens, turn the tokens over, turn the tokens in, collect some more tokens, rinse repeat. Hey look, I have some more tokens. Hey look, I am trading in more tokens for other tokens. Hey look, I am trading in those tokens. Yup here I go collecting more tokens. At its heart, that is Le Havre. A pointless exercise in token manipulation and wood fondling. I hate this game so much that I want to punch it in the face.

Amusingly enough. Today (6/1/09) I received this email from the designer, Uwe Rosenberg:

[q]Hi Matthew!
Thank you for you criticism. I think we have to control Melissa.
Best wishes, Uwe [/q]

Which makes me feel bad about the strong language I used above. Still, I don't disagree with it. 

I will say this: I think Uwe is definitely one of my favorite Euro game designers - Bohnanza gets a TON of play around here, and I really enjoy Agricola. If you want to play a great game, check out one of those.

Like Agricola, I never thought I would play this as it seemed fiddly, economic, and thick. Having enjoyed Agricola so much, I gave this a try and I'm very glad I did. I've only played it with 2 and I think that may be the ideal venue. Le Havre is engrossing, fast-moving, and interesting  from start to finish. The game kind of takes off on you. I like games when I still feel like a beginner after a dozen or so plays, knowing that there are multiple paths to victory yet to be discovered. It is just a tad long so I don't often have the time to play, but if I have a free 2 hours and want a deep game, this is it!

Really didn't like this at first, but iOS implementation is growing on me. It addresses some of Agricola's shortcomings: variability is in the buildings available to all rather than individual hands of cards, and it seems possible to focus rather than being forced to do a little of everything every time. The buildings system here is similar enough to Caylus that I pretty much don't see ever playing the latter again, though it's annoying that the Special Buildings are randomly revealed through out the game. In addition, I'm not sure this is anymore "strategic" than Agricola, as you can't really plan much till the goods are revealed, and even then you have to react to the random buildings and choices of other players, it seems more a game of mid-range tactics, putting together mini-plans you hope to pull off over a few rounds. It's quick on iOS (25 minutes for short game, 45 for long), where it's a pleasant puzzler to pass the time, but I'm pretty sure I'd need my arm twisted to play this for 2.5 hours face-to-face.

RATING: 9.7
I love Le Havre with 2-3 players.  It's easy to teach and has deep, engaging strategic and tactical gameplay. It is tight and interactive throughout and it feels more open-ended than Agricola or Macao (the other 2 games I've rated above 9).  If you get small square storage cups for the resource bits, the game is easy to setup and not at all fiddly.  The only downside is that I don't like it with more than 3 players.

This is a game similar to agricola where you collect resources through rounds while building and optimizing resource management. There is high replayability, but the game is a bit heavy/long with >3 players.

My first experience with this game was a five player game that seemed to last forever. I didn't like the long play time and I didn't like how player's tokens could remain on a building for multiple turns to block other players from using that building.

Fortunately, I played that game again with three players and had a great time with it.  My daughter and son-in-law love this game.  The three of us played it over and over to the point we had to take a break from it.

Prior to playing this game we were playing Agricola over and over.  So we went from obsessing about one Uwe Rosenberg game to another.  Agricola is more family friendly while Le Havre seems a bit more strategic.

My favourite Rosenberg design has players strategically grabbing resources from the dock to allow them to purchase buildings, and using each others buildings to further their goals, locking others out until you decide to relinquish that spot. It's smooth and challenging, exciting and well paced.

This is the epitome of resource management for me.  The mechanics are the smoothest of any I've played. This is my rating of the game as a 2- or 3- player game; it would have to be lower with more just because it takes so much time.  The thrill dies before the game ends with that many players.

A brilliant game that is just heavy enough without feeling like there is too much micromanagement. Blends the good bits of games such as Caylus plus, Roads and Boats and Agricola.  

A few tiny nits I have against against Le Havre:
- it becomes progressively more difficult during the game to see who has what building in play, although this problem does reduce with familiarity with the standard building card set;
- downtime is an issue if players (like me) are a bit prone to analysis paralysis, and the effect is cumulative with each such player (this is the main reason that I can't give a 10 rating); 
- the game length is long at around 150min+ for 3 players with 4+ players pushing this out to 180+ minutes; 
- its tough on newbs. The strategies and tactics for successful play won't become evident until about the third or fourth play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As a 3 player game (i have yet to play other versions) this plays extremely well. The action is quick and there is plenty to think about.
Despite the obvious comparison with Agricola, I much prefer this game as it removes the uneven random element of the Agricola cards which can unbalance the game.
Recommended.

An excellent economy game. I'm VERY bad at it, but I still really enjoy playing it, it's surprisingly simple and elegant. This may have something to do with the fact that I've played only the iOS version, which is a very smooth port (pun intended), beautifully made and thus (probably) much quicker. Best with 2-3 players, more than that lasts too long. I'd probably enjoy it much more with the actual board...

Le Havre is for me King of the heavy euro games. Materials-buildings-combos-wooden cubes/disks etc. Euro heaven.
It plays better with 3 I think, due to the longlasting playing time of a 4player game. Too many different paths to take, to many decisions to make. Every game is different from the last one.
I still prefer this to Agricola, which I find a little meaningless...

My favorite Uwe game so far. Very pretty and straightforward, with deep tactics. The only problem is that because of all the different buildings, you need to play it with the same people, so you discover the full potential of the cards, an then play the game to its limits.

RATING: 9
A real masterpiece. Le Havre is deep and thinky with remarkably simple rules and mechanics. The variability with the cards, player counts, and the long and short versions of gameplay provide a ton of range for the game. The player count can change the overall feel of each session. The short version is great for a quicker experience and really helps to learn the game. It allows people to play a more casual, quicker game when starting, but expands into something incredibly deeper in the full version.

A game with no rhyme or reason as to why you're doing anything. Gather resources, turn them into other resources, and make money out of it all. Why? Because the game tells you to. Oh, and if you don't feed your people, you suffer. Rosenburg 101.

A very nice surprise. Best game from Essen so far.
I was afraide that it was another Agricola, but no. Much better game than its successor. An intelligent application of Caylus style with one or two innovate mechanics. 
I like Agricola, I think it is a great game, but this one is more difficult, more challenging and without all the luck gap between players in the beginning of the game.
This one is for sure a gamers game.

1) I had play it twice and enjoy it a lot. 

First time play with 5 players (two of them with a lot of AP) 3h30

2) 2nd play - 4 players - less than 2h30.
It plays best with 4 players.


3) 3rd & 4th play - solo Play - 45 to 60 minutes for game.

4)Really love this game. It became one of mine top 10.

5) After a 2 players short game: I prefer the full game but this one was enough to take my rating to a 9.

This one took 60 minutes long with explanation.

6) A 3 player full game. This game is awessome.
full play - 2h30 hours with one first timer.

7) Solo play max score - 313 points

Liked this very much on plays so far. They have been relatively few though (despite making all that fimo stuff, and player mats etc.!)

Has gone down well when we played, but other games have been favoured above this. Perhaps because the strategy seems quite complex to get a hook onto, and the gameplay is quite long.

Here you have one goal: to go after ships or else you won't win the game competing with someone who buys at least one ship. so you just have one goal. Try another game of Uwe. Comparing le havre to Agricola or caverna... At least you have far more goals and possibilities than le havre. No replayability at all. 5 plays of this game and they are all the same.

At first, I made the inevitable comparison to Agricola, being another Uwe game with feeding and harvesting and all. But after a few more plays, I now feel it is a much improved version of Caylus (which I consider average at best). It's become my 2nd favorite game ever and by far my favorite with worker placement. Screw the setup and scalability issues. They're second nature to me now.

RATING: 9
Well I think Le Havre has done it. It's surpassed Agricola and Dominion to become my absolute favorite game.

My god, the fun you can have with all those different resources! It takes the best parts from Agricola, and the only part from Caylus that I liked (owning buildings that others can pay you to use) and combined them into an absolute masterpiece! I am so excited to play this over and over again.

It's flaws - a bit too long, not for me, but for people who I'm trying to teach it to. Going along with that, everyone I've shown it to so far either doesn't like it at all, or seems to like it a little, but prefers Agricola. My theory is that if they played another game or two, they'd see that this is the clearly superior game, but at it's length, I'm not sure that some of them will give it another try. Still, a definite 10. Beautiful game!

UPDATE: Hmm... not as replayable as I thought it would be? I still love it, but it just doesn't belong with my other 10s anymore!

RATING: 9.6
Very absorbing, many possible strategies but hard to feel in control of the game due to difficult choices. Love it.

Important to try to get cash early, to buy buildings and ships with. Remember you can sell buildings too. Buying a building (rather than building it) means you can be first to use it. You want 3 ships by mid-late game if possible.

This game just keeps getting better, with any player number.

Rating could change, but at 3-player count, this is the most satisfying of all of the Uwe games that I have played.  Produces that classic "4 things you need to do, you can do 1 of them" feeling; the resource accumulation mechanic is soo organic; the pacing out of turns (2-2-3) on top of the ratcheting up of individual rounds (b/c of the food issue) provides wonderful crunch; minimal icon-learning and ultimately a very simple ruleset... Needs players who are into engines and resource conversion, but man, what a design!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In La Havre, France, one is accumulating goods and livestock to earn Francs. There are a fixed number of rounds, and 7 turns per round. (In a three player game, there are 18 rounds). On a player's turn, they either collect goods, build, or go into a building to take that action. Optionally, they may purchase buidings, if they wish to do so. Buildings are seeded in three columns, and you can only buy the lowest numbered building in a column first, before being able to get at the rest of the buildings. At the end of each round, one has to pay food or Francs, and there may be a harvest where players may gain a maximum of one grain (from one grain) and one cattle (from two cattle). Food requirements can be reduced by owning ships.

Like Caylus, if you use someone else's building you have to pay them a fee. A small number of special buildings are randomly mixed in to make each game different. 

The mechanics are simple, and the game is very tense. It's a good game, with lots of choices on how to optimize your economy. Near the end, everyone wants to get the same goods or the same action, so it gets tricky trying to do everything you want.   I am fully engaged each time I play.  

There is only one drawback, though. If you want to play succesfully, you must use loans. In fact, loans are overpowered, and the designer has given a house rule to make attempt to balance the loans: you pay 2 francs if you have X or more loans, where X is the number of players in the game. I'm surprised there hasn't been much discussion about loans at all. Sure, you can argue that everyone takes loans, but that takes away one option of trying to play the game without loans. I haven't played this game as often as I like, but knowing that loans are the only way to go has slightly turned me off.

I absolutely love Uwe Rosenberg's designs, including the on-the-surface-similar Ora et Labora, but I could not get in to this at all when I owned it, despite trying multiple times.

I guess everyone has a game that is probably good, but they just didn't like AT ALL.

There are 4 players in our game group where, if any 3 of whom are the set of players, this is frequently the game. It's best at 3, acceptable at 2, and at 4+ I'd rather play something else. It's not that the game is flawed at higher counts; it's not. But it does slow down quite a lot in our experience.

I keep telling myself I'll play without taking a heavy loan strategy some day. Doesn't seem to happen.

If nothing else a good reminder that love cannot be planned in advance and is not decided by tick-boxes on a piece of paper. In theory, Le Havre has everything I most love and look for in games: economic theme, strong production element, resource management, card driven. I love Agricola and Power Grid both games you hear in connection to Le Havre. But the fact remains I dislike Le Havre-immensly. It is too fiddly, an element I dislike a lot but can forgive if other elements are in place, it is looong - which is fine if it would be more strategic and less tactical, but it is not: it is very tactics-driven which feels put of place with the theme. I hate how you have little visual oversight of your opponents cards, I don't want to memorize all cards, esp. in a game that feels like pulling teeth.

This is one of my favorite goods conversion Euros, but I have to keep it in mind not to play this in the future with more than 3 players. It's a deep, open-ended game, but it doesn't gain much from having additional players, such there's so little interaction. The limited number of actions initially disguises the degree to which you're able to build something that feels substantial by the end of the game.

I like this better than Agricola. It's a bit fiddly and I don't like games where I have to scan the entire table for my options each turn, but the fact that I had only one action each turn mitigated this problem. I look forward to more plays and anticipate my rating going up.

Superb resource management game. It offers many different paths to victory. Really exciting and fun to play. It takes the best of Caylus and Agricola, bettering both of them. It manages to be original even using known mechanics.

A masterpiece. 

UPDATE 7th Nov 2012
I still consider it a wonderful game, but I moved down the rating to 9 because I like more "Ora et labora" that gives a similar experience, but which I like much more.

UPDATE October 2015
Rating lowered to 8. I prefer Fields of Arle, and also Ora et Labora and Caverna. This should be reflected in my ratings.

RATING: 8
Rating after one play.  There is a lot of engine potential here, and it feels like there is always something you should be doing.  That, coupled with snappy turns, makes the game feel much shorter than the actual playing time.

That said, it seems like there is a premium put on knowing what later buildings are coming up when and positioning yourself to be able to snag them as soon as they do.  That's not bad, perse, but I would hate to find out that good play amongst experienced players might necessarily hinge on that.
----update----
After more consideration (and not based on any more plays) I suspect the concerns expressed above are going to turn out to be fairly minimal, and the sheer quantity of currencies and things to do with them do make for a very compelling game experience.  But is it fun? 

---update---
Another game in the books.  Definitely interesting.  Definitely moves at a nice pace, but it is difficult to justify the time sink with the amount of fun.  As an efficiency activity it is worthy.  And there is no doubt that the game plays well.  But I can't see wanting to play it more than a half-dozen times a year because of the length.

Rating will fluctuate between 7 and 8.  I'd still like to play it with 3.

---update---
A couple more games and this one is settling in on 8.  I'm still not good at it, but the game remains compelling.  Still, the learning curve is steep so getting more casual players to play this with me will be a challenge.

And I STILL need to play again with 3.

---update---
Five games in and I'm starting to figure this one out.  Also, played with 2 - really fun!

A combination of Caylus & Agricola, which are two games in my favourites list. I love worker placement games and this one is special as I dont feel the heaviness of the game. Another factor is that the game always changes dependant on the initial setup, the drawn special buildings and the number of players.

A good Euro game.  Lots of options and you are constantly forced to reevaluate your plans.  That said, the constant need for food to feed your workers is frustrating.  It certainly feels like you cannot play how you want because you are constantly worrying about food.

I love this game.  You are looking to pick up goods and buy/build properties during the course of the game.  If you have a building people want to use they pay you to use it, it is free for you.  End of the game you count your points and your buildings because they are worth points as well.

Really great game, but it really does take quite a long time, and I have only played the short version!

After one play this was not fun. There were things that could be better but you needed to play a few times to get the planning worked out. The turn order mechanic looks very interactive (I thought I was to load and unload with it) but really is just for theme the game takes place off the board. You are just trying to build an engine for the end of game.

It's very tense game. If you will play wrong, you will have to spent most of your movements to get food. But if you already know how to play its fantastic. A lot of hard decisions, which action/resources to pick as you can do one thing in your turn.

RATING: 7
When we first played Le Havre, we made the mistake of a 5p game.  Note to Future Players: DON'T DO THAT.  ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR FIRST GAME.

Then, years later, we looked past the scar tissue and we played with 2-4p.  Completely different game.  Night and bloody day.  It still feels a little more like "work" than "play" but at least it finally feels like play.  It's a tight resource management and efficiency engine workout and if you like this kind of thing it's more of it.  Its sweet spot is definitely 3p.

What this game desperately needs is a Strategy Guide: a full-blown document that explains to the newbie the benefits and disadvantages of the myriad of options available to them.  The "Where do I get money?" insert helps.  It's not enough.

The easy flow of this game, reminiscent of that of Puerto Rico, is its greatest virtue. The subtle variations from game to game in terms of order of building and resource availability are a further mark of gifted design. 

Yet the lack of strategic variety keeps it from true greatness: every player must amass ships, construct buildings, and sell goods, with players' strategic focus differing only in their relative emphases on these goals. For what it is, the game also runs a bit long for my taste.

Good, but intolerably slooooowwww with 5 players, it is clearly too many for this game. With 3 players it has a lot less downtime, and it is much more enjoyable. Nothing really new in this one, but at least unlike Agricola it is balanced and it is a well put-together worker placement game. It does not have the same tension as Agricola though. Maybe because of the multitude of options, and no matter what your opponents do, you can do something that is efficient. Need to learn what lots of different buildings do before you can think about strategies. Need a dedicated group and the game may start to shine. My rating is for 2 or 3 players, for 5p it would be a 3, for 4p a 7

RATING: 9
After several solo plays (2 short version, the rest full version), it is apparent that the economic engine is finely tuned.  When you start a game with 5 money (Francs) and 1 coal (net worth of 7) and end up with a net worth of 283 in 7 turns, the power to make money is there.

This game is the best one I've seen at imitating a production market.  The incorporation of loans not only adds to the game itself, but enhances that feeling (it takes money to make money).  I absolutely love the feeling of starting with almost nothing and through your decision making process, work your way to wealth.

If you are looking for quick results, this is not your game.  It gathers momentum as it progresses.  It is so rewarding to make 70+ Francs over the last three turns when you were struggling to make 3 for so long!

I was worried about finding a "Solution" to the solitaire version.  No fear - the mix of Special Buildings (you only use 6 and see 3 per game) along with the order that goods arrive in the harbor really does create a different challenge each time.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I need variety in my gaming experience
-> While rewarding, it is a mental exercise - I need a break occasionally

Another classic worker-placement game. I prefer Le Havre to Agricola due to less food pressure, less blocking and more building options. You feel like you are growing something rather than trying to keep up with feeding all the time.

There is a little bit less combo goodness because the buildings have mostly obvious pathways, but being available to everyone removes potential imbalances.

Blocking is close to non-existent; perhaps this is why I like it best among "classic" worker-placement games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good worker placement game. What you have to do is pretty straightforward, you just need to figure out what a good path to use is. After one play it seems that you need to have decent food production, but getting ships is good, since it'll give you more actions that don't need to be spent getting food. Steel is very important, so start planning for that early. That means energy, coal -> coke, and iron. Seems like there is s fair amount going on, would like to play again.

2nd play: You need to get boats. Really. They are important. Not vital, but darned important. You can ship much stuff and it reduces your food needs.

First impression (3 players) : I really like the game but I'm afraid about the length of the game. Only played once with superslow players but that was a looong game. If I would play a game with newbies again I would use quick-setup for the first game. I'm looking forward for the next game in hopes that it will be (much) faster as then this would be a gem game.

I nearly stopped reading the rules right there in the opening paragraph because of the mechanism of paying to the owner of a building gives so strong Caylus vibes.

Luckily the payment is not that important a part of the game, and there are original elements included as well. A player turn is very simple, so there's surprisingly little downtime, even though the game is very long and decisions have long-lasting consequences. 

The best part of the game is that there's an omnipresent tickling turn angst, which is created by having very few turns per player and by always having to plan at least four or five turns ahead. Apart from that, I would not recommend the game to anyone else than hardcore production engine optimization freaks.

With five players, avoid at all costs.

A great game that is more balanced than Agricola.  

My one slight complaint would be that various strategies are made worse by changing the number of players and it seems with 5 players that the boat/shipping strategy never really comes into play.  

However, a well done game overall.

A small deduction for lower-quality components.  Not terribly bad, but not terribly good.  Everything is a touch on the flimsy side, and the cards/board are DEFINITELY too small even for people with fine eyesight.

Well worth playing, especially if you like Agricola.

Heavy engine efficiency game.  With most games of this type I feel that the game ends just as you're getting going, in Le Havre it feels like there is an added layer, which drags the game out. Moves at a deft pace whilst playing, but perhaps takes a little too long for the amount of fun it provides. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Uno dei più bei giochi in circolazione.
C'è chi lo definisce il fratello brutto di Agricola, chi al contrario il fratello bello.
Personalmente vedo la parentela ma non lo considero così simile, tutt'altro; in Agricola c'è più interazione, Le Havre si caratterizza per l'asimmetria del turno di gioco.

Infatti visto che in un turno ci sono 7 (numero primo) fasi a prescindere dal numero di giocatori (da 1 a 5) c'è chi giocherà più fasi e chi meno.

Difetti? E' un gioco molto lungo, e la durata aumenta di 30' per giocatore. Evitate i pensatori, specie per partite in 5!
Pregi? Semplice da giocare ma con strategie profonde e spesso a lunga scadenza. Come per Porto Rico strade diverse portano alla vittoria, l'importante è non farsi ingolosire dal voler far tutto.

Se devo esprimere la mia opinione lo preferisco ad Agricola!
Da giocare e rigiocare.

Long, hard work with unclear objectives that are too hierarchical to be called 'multiple routes to victory'. Cluttered cards, a central mechanism that doesn't turn over or interact well enough, and cartoony graphics that don't befit the theme.

While it has the pedigree of Agricola and the inspiration of both it and Caylus, I feel the game is most similar to Roads & Boats, just without all the road building. You collect resources and convert those resource to better resources so that you can exchange them for victory points (money). The game is fairly simple and turns move along at a brisk clip, so there is virtually zero down time with a small number of players (with more, there can be a little).

I was having great hopes for Le Havre game before buying it. Because I saw that it has lots of different resources can be used in game. Lots of resources remembers me Sid Meier's Colonization game. And I spent lots of my childhood with that game. After my first game, I was a bit dissapointed. Game ended in three hours and I was feeling a bit tired after game. These were negative points for Le Havre. Also I felt like it has lots of rules, but actually I was wrong. It seems like a complex game but it is not that complex actually. I can see that after my second and third games. Game is cool, but even after you get used to game it can make you a bit tired when game ends. When it is your turn you can do lots of decisions. It's like Chess or Caylus in that view, there are lots of ways player can select. All are good, problem is which one is best. After fourth game I become sure this game is not a bad or medium game. It is very powerfull. Clever and experienced player wins 95%. If you are weak you have nearly no winning change. I like that kind of games. But my opponents give up playing with me after some time. They get bored after consequent loses with huge score differences. Game has both fixed buildings and special buildings. And included buildings changes according to number players. Special buildings and very good designed building queues make every game different. In some games you get shortage from food in some games there become lots of good X. Every game is different. Thats very important design point. Congratulations Uwe Rosenberg. You made really cool game. If you like strategy games buy it.

A really good game - build an economic engine and let it run. The cards are clear and rules reasonably easy to pick-up, but the complex choices generated are extraordinary. The table does get crowded, and players need to be seated where they can see everything - this can be hard to manage with more people. Seems to be best at ~3 people.

Very nice and well designed game. Food shortage keeps you constantly on the edge, but everybody still manages to grow sooner or later. 
In order to play well you know to know the buildings and the ships quite well.
I do not like the random extra buildings, which I would prefer to be not secret in order to develop a strategy.
Too many calculations at some points of the game.

After some plays winning strategy seems to be always very similar.

This is my favorite in Uwe Rosenberg's harvest trilogy.  There is some stress to making a recurring payment (in this case, feeding), but there are expanding choices as the game continues.

I just cannot get into this or any other worker placement game. I get very little theme and it essentially feels like I'm playing a spreadsheet.

[b]Le Havre[/b] was traded away for Fields of Arle . 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I still actually really like Le Havre, but it was extremely difficult to get to the table and I got offered a great trade. The play time and table space was a major factor in how few times Le Havre got played. I only mention this because I think Le Havre is an excellent design by Uwe, but I like some of his other games more (Agricola, At the Gates of Loyang and Glass Road) and they all play much quicker (usually an hour or less if it's a 2p game).

Since I am not a collector I don't feel the need to own every game created by one of my favorite designers so Le Havre left my collection. There wasn't ever a time that I would choose Le Havre over one of the other Uwe games I own. All that said I'd happily play this again, I still think it's a very good game.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Lots of decisions to make/paths to take to try and be successful in this game.
- Variability among the buildings which leads to multiple strategies you can pursue.
- Resource conversion: I know this may seem like work to some, but I love this in games (Glass Road is another favorite of mine).
- I really like the artwork and the components are top notch.
- Plays really well with 2.[/i]

Good concept, not a family-game, due to the fact you have to take even more in consideration, in comparison with Agricola. Somehow (played is up till now alone and with two) we come to the idea you don't need that much rounds. Most probably it ain't that much fun when playing with 5, 'cause yoy need to wait to long and in several rounds you only can take one action.
Saving materials and then suddenly build (and/or buy)two buildings at once, gives a lot of advantage ; esp when the second on the prop.pile, laying underneath another, has a high value.
Is it really worth putting energy in leather ? SEE forum openend.

Learnt and played my first game of Le Havre. Though the game ended prematurely, I was already having a great deal of fun already.

2009/08/27
Played a few solo games on computer. Damn this game is hard! Still fun, but feeling it's a little mechanical now.

2009/08/30
Played a 4er tonight. The game ended prematurely cuz there wasn't enough time. Nevertheless I had a lot of fun; even my girl friend started to like it after initially feeling bored with it.
I also had a lot of fun playing solo game for the past few days. I like this game a lot but the game time is just too GOD DAMN LONG!!! It'd be very hard for me to find appropriate chances to play this game face to face. That is the only reason it's not getting a 10 from me.

A bit too heavy for my tastes, and I normally like heavy Euros (Indonesia, Brass, Starcraft). I don't usually like worker placement games all that much. The thing I dislike most is the massive decision tree with about 15 kinds of resources that all do different things, and about a million buildings to pick from. Le Havre is simple (either gain resources or use a building) but not elegant.

Sometimes I feel that this is the game I was looking for. A pleasure to play, even the solo version. It looks like you are really building and collecting and processing, etc. Some people says it is too long, but I think it is too short for so many things you do when playing.

One of my favourite games. Always fun. Though those 300+ scores are yet to come. Lots of options, strategies and possibilities. And what's best, nearly every one of them is good one and has potential to win the game.

This was a 9 for a long time, but I simply couldn't figure out anything that could be improved, so I saw no reason to not to raise the rating to 10.

Great game with an insane amount of possibilities per turn.  The theme is very strong, much like agricola, and gives you the opportunity to build a very efficient engine by midgame.  I am not a huge fan of the 2-3+ hour game play, but this is a very sound game that I would like to play more.

Looking Forward to playing this Game more and by more I mean a lot more. I understand why this game gets so much love as it is truly a great FUN Euro.

RATING: 8
Clearly a quality game. It offers the perennial choice between taking resources or building. And between those, do you take resources that helps you stay alive (food) but can't help you build, or resources that help you build buildings. And if you build, do you build something that helps you feed (ships) or to progress your VP engine. 

There's the added charm of making all buildings available to all players, if they pay a fee to the owner. It's about doing things more efficiently than the other players through your resource takes, using your own buildings more than the others (to limit fees, so it is important what you build) and getting an efficient food engine going without sacrificing tempo. 

There is an issue with downtime with more players as there's a LOT of options to explore on a turn. And players on their turns may take your options so your strategy is continually changing. Causing more downtime. This lessens with experience. Which is a good thing because there's a lot to explore here and a lot to like.

RATING: 10
I love this game.  If you love tight and tense Eurogames, you will appreciate this too. I only play it as a 2-player game.  Some say it is best at that player count.  I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I can imagine it being a different, albeit fun, experience as a 3-player game.  Judging by how the turns and rounds work though, it would be hard for me to see this being best at 4 or 5 players.  But like I said, I haven't tried that yet.

This game is absolutely awesome. It is very deep. Unlike Agricola (with hidden cards and combos), in Le Havre you have everything on the table so you can plan ahead.

It plays nice with 2 and 3. I don't recommend it with 4 unless very experienced and patient players.

Finally I played this gem. The game is less complex than "Agricola" but a game lasts much longer. Have to play this again and again :) Looking forward to it.
Update: I now own the iphone version and can train this everywhere. A very good game. Still "Agricola" feels more thematic.
Update: This game continues to shine. I don't doubt it's longevity anymore. The mechanics are top notch and the decisions are as nailbiting as in its first days.

At the start, the options are limited, but by the end, there are so many options, you can spend a lot of time thinking it through. Another one of those games where by the end, you may just wish it was over already. But the game is well thought out at there are many roads to victory and a lot of strategy. Worth a try if you are into the heavy strategy games. Just be sure to know what you are getting into. With the right group, it can be very good.

I can appreciate the design of the game.  I do feel, however, that the game runs about 30 minutes longer than it should.  There is a lot going on in this game and I am not sure if I have the desire to want to keep up with it all.  There are too many goods and too many ways to convert them and too many cards scattered all over the table.  Uwe Rosenberg's big box games are just not my cup of tea.

Gioco molto complesso ma anche molto interessante. Come per Agricola, il sospetto che Rosenberg metta sempre molta carne al fuoco (un sacco di risorse, carte a sfare) per mascherare i limiti effettivi del gioco c'è.

Le Havre feels a little like Agricola's "big brother"--you're constantly trying to acquire and upgrade your resources in various ways while being under severe time pressure.  While the need to feed every round is decreased because you can take not-very-expensive loans, the end of the game will sneak up on you and curtail your grand plans.  The complex tree of converting resources is much deeper than Agricola in that there are many more different types of resources, and getting the end stages takes many more steps.  The buildings in Le Havre are (mostly) the same from game to game, providing an experience with a lot less variability, and helping to solidify various strategies.  This is a game where you really have to know what buildings are available and which buildings will be coming soon to be able to plan and do well--new players don't have much of a chance versus experienced ones.  I do enjoy this game quite a bit, but to some extent it has been replaced for me by the newer Ora et Labora.

RATING: 7
A very solid game but it's never grabbed a hold of me like Uwe's other games. The randomness of the buildings and the surplus of goods is fun, but I feel like some strategies are better than others. The special buildings allow for more variety though and including in the expansion leads to a TON of special building options each game. Food isn't quite as punishing in this one, but you do need to keep up with it if you want to do well. I'm unsure of how this plays with more than 3 since I have yet to do it, but I am intrigued since the final round of a 5 player game requires only 6 food (!).

The biggest drawback for me is the damn filling of the goods every turn. It's not difficult, it's just fiddly and annoying after a while. Especially when some turns last only a few seconds and you're already grabbing for goods.

I find between this and Ora et Labora, I'd rather play Ora instead. Still, it's nice to have the option.

RATING: 9.8
Probably one of the best resource management games. It breaks the typical "5 resources" by providing 16 different resources in the game! Typical gameplay is broken in two phases, where players are initially constrained by the limited resources, trying to set their infrastructures up and subsequently constrained by time, trying to earn as much money as possible in a few turns.

RATING: 7.5
TRY Jun/09.  Early impression was that this was an 8+, and that was from a 2-player short game.

3er game (short), and still wondering if charcoal has any reasonable use.  Feels underpowered compared to other options.

Played another part-game of a long 2er.  Am getting less thrilled as the game feels much the same over & over.  Not very random, other than what the other players may do.  Rating has dropped significantly, as I'd rather commit the time to playing many other games instead.

Keen to try with 4 - probably the short version.  Not keen to play with less than 3 again.

July/09: Played long solo twice (201, 266).  I quite liked this option, but I find the scoring is heavily dependant on which special cards come up.

I'm not a big expert on strategy games; besides having played some pc strategy games, I've started in board gaming with Catan, Republic of Rome, Civilization card game (the one that came with Civilization Chronicles (apart from Risk etc.) so Le Havre is my first jump into a deep Economic board game.

It gets better everytime I played, and also my friends are enjoying it a lot. I also love the Special buildings that really forces you to change strategies taken on previous plays. Plenty of options, very open, and very balanced.

Le Havre has deffinately gotten me into the Strategy board game (just adquired a few other because of the great experience Le Havre has been).

Like agricola only more manageable. Still too many things to pick from every turn. My comment about Agricola stands for this game as well, that a computer or video game implementation would be vastly superior. 

Update: implementation complete. This one actually holds up much better under scrutiny than Agricola did. Games are varied enough just by changing the building order, and the variety of special buildings really helps as well.

Heavy efficiency game. Heavier than Agricola and at least as heavy as Caylus, the game that inspired both. This is actually much closer to Caylus than Mr. Rosenberg's previous effort. There are a lot of resources to be collected, refined and then used to build buildings, which allow new actions to be performed, or ships, which allow goods to be exchanged for money. In the end, the richest man wins. 

The number of options available grows exponentially, as players build buildings, there are a lot of different ways to achieve one's goals and almost zero luck.

Solo mode is actually very interesting. 

I think this can be a real classic. Not so appealing to non gamers as Agricola, but a real challenge for those who like these types of games. 

Rating may go up.

Three plays: 2 and 3 players shortened version. Solo full game.

Le Havre looks crazy complicated upon first look and especially upon first setup, with all the sorting and stacking and whatnot. But when the game starts rolling, it is pretty straightforward - the gameplay that is. The timing and the strategy department will burn some cortical fat.

It looks good, it plays good; it is easy to play and difficult to master. The ownership of buildings adds a nice layer of interaction. The only real downside is playing time. It's on the long side. Apart from that - another winner from Hr Boll - sorry Hr Rosenberg.

After one game, the Jury is still out. It seemed like a pretty good game, but we had a couple of rules wrong that made it feel broken. I think fixing those will make it a lot better. At least I hope they do.

My wife and I both are looking forward to playing it with the fixes though.

Update: Wow, fixing our rule mistakes made the game a lot more fun. It was much tighter. We still made one mistake and ended the game one round too early. I also miscalculated at the end and it allowed my wife to pull out a win. This second play brought the game up from a seven to a 8 though and I can see it climbing higher with more games. The 2 hour play time is a bit long, so I do not see it getting played as much as I would like, but the two hour play time coupled with solid game play makes me want to come back to it.

I think that when it is all said and done this will pass Loyang and rival Agricola for me.

This is not for me. We played a 3 player game (short version) and about half way through I was bored with what I was doing. Where I usually can get lost in a game where I'm building something to the extent that I'll try my best, but won't really care all that much about my final score, this just doesn't grab my attention at all. Lowered my rating a lot, because I don't want to play again. I still think that it's a good game, it's just no fun to me at all.

Good game, took a long time (3,5 hours). First couple of turns were a bit confusing, it took some time to figure out what everything did and why you'd want it.

I love games where the rules and types of actions you can do on your turn are quite simple, but the long-term strategy is deep and short-term tactical desicions can be tough. I also like the scope and the escalation in the game. Component-wise: I actually like the double-sided carboard chits (although the player-aids on BGG are a must to keep them organized). I also appreciate that there is both a long and short game. Unfortunately, my partner dislikes most games with a heavy resource conversion component, so this one is less likely to see the table than I would prefer (At the Gates of Loyang is her favorite of the harvest triology).

It's too long, I think. I mean, I like long games, when the game tells a story... (Twilight Imperium, Battlestar Galactica and War of the Ring come to mind) I guess there's a story of a town here, it's just not fascinating enough. 

I still enjoy playing Le Havre, and the length is the only reason I don´t rate it an 8.

The solo game is surprisingly good.

This is easily my favorite game by Uwe Rosenberg. I love the theme. It feels like you always have quite a few options without it being overwhelming, unlike games like Caverna. It's a game you can play with relative newcomers or people who don't play boardgames as much. Always willing to play.

I own the IOS version of this game. I am glad that I get to try this game for $1. This is a worker placement game that has many rules that will probably require more plays to get it down. So far after one play I can already tell it is too heavy for my taste. The theme doesn't help either. Building ships? For a euro that can have theme pasted on, they chose one that I am not so interested in. Agricola? Sure, I think once or twice in my childhood I have wanted to be a farmer. There is a strange sense of tranquility when I play Harvest Moon. However, I have never dreamed of being a dock master trying to build ships. The theme of this game could really be anything when that many complicated mechanics are involved. The mechanics do make sense, mind you, but too much math in the conversions of materials.

The next heavy game that I have enjoyed is Yedo. In that game even though my brain was burned but at least I felt like a Lord of Ninja clan in feudal Japan.

RATING: 6
Too much cardboard shuffling for my taste. Game play involves a lot of getting something to get something else to convert it to still something else to buy something which then gets upgraded to allow the purchase of something really big which then becomes points. In that way, it feels over-wrought. A lot of Euros are that way - some people love that. I don't.

Really a slick system.  Lots of decisions to make, and while you occasionally have to fret over what your opponents are doing, there are so many options available that even a slow or bad turn is never really stagnant.  It moves like lightning, keeping everyone engaged.  I'll have to see if the replay value holds up to the standard of Agricola, but with the Special Buildings and the slight reordering of the other buildings, I imagine it holds up.

Rating based on solo and 2-player games.

It's quite enjoyable, once the rules are learned. The game actually plays very smoothly and fast but it has a steep learning curve.. This game has no luck at all so basically the players are puzzle solving to get the highest scores. Normally I don't like the type of games that once you 'get it', you're most likely to win every game you play. This one intrigues me... theme? perhaps... It's a hyped, puzzle-solving, game that I will play until I 'get it'. The game supports solo play, which is a big plus.

RATING: 8.5
Like the mechanics more then from Agricola, but the theme is really paste on (harvest phase in a harbour??);Also: Agricola is better solo then Le Havre. What is the minus of this game however that is that while playing time decreases with the number of players in Agricola, here it says almost the same (and it will take you a while :s). So in the Harvest-trilogy, I like Agricola the most, then At the Gates of Loyang and Le Havre comes 3rd because of it's long playing time.

Doesn't have the same "tension" as Agricola, but feels very similar. The difference being an abundance of everything after the first few turns-- having many solid actions available after the 2nd or 3rd round. 

Unfortunately, incredibly fiddly, as well as long. The sprint-slash-crunch at the end feels bloated, and the turn structure (with very frequent feeding phases) make plans feel disjointed sometimes. 

Still though, lots of depth and a lot of options here. It's totally solid.

Agricola but with more going on. Of course, part ot the impressiveness fades having played Agricola which is quite similar in mechanics.
Its funny that people talk of "strategy" when other players are constantly taking actions dependant on everyone else's luck: will you get the necessary wood to build X building before someone else takes the only copy? If another player build's X building, what remains of your strategy? If the other players always take key resources before you, will you be able to do more with your dwindling money stash?
I own the App version and I can only thank the lord since set up time must be even longer than Agricola and there are many rules/board adjustments to take into account at every turn for every player. Games are also pretty long and tend to resemble each other after 4-5 games (hence all the expansions).
Seem to spend way too much time feeding your workers in games with four players and not enough gathering resources and building. I rather pay 4$ for the app than 60$ for the boardgame. Better value.

RATING: 9
For a game with so few actions per turn, this is a bit of a brain burner. Calculating what to get done in time while others are messing up with your choices seems like a lot of complex decision-making. Pretty interesting, and attempting to figure out what the buildings is a driving force for multiple plays.

I just love the elegance of this game. Your goal is to get VP via the construction of buildings and the selling of both raw materials and (by preference) processed goods.

The rules are as simple as it gets. In your turn, you either take the available unit of one type good from the market or move your worker piece to a building and do what it says. That's it.  

And yet, your options are huge. It's all about the buildings and what they allow you to do. And the special buildings - of which only five out of a deck of 35 get into play in each session - give you almost limitless replayability.

A master piece!

Pretty heavy resource management game where the players build up their businesses in the harbor city Le Havre. Players acquire resources and build up their tableaus of buildings. These buildings can then be used by all players by paying a fee to the owner.

The most striking thing about the game is the sheer number of actions the players take during the game. Every single action is small, gaining resources or using a building, so even what feels like a fairly short term goal can easily stretch over five to ten actions. This is especially noticeable toward the end of the game where the players have to get everything together just so to get their goods shipped. Managing those most precious resources, actions and building access, is the hardest part of this game.

The game also has a feeding mechanism somewhat like Agricola but not nearly as punishing as you can take low interest loans to cover lack of food.

This is a challenging game that take a few plays to get to know. It might be a good idea to get to know the game by playing the shortened variant a couple of times first, just to get a feel for the game.

This is a loose, bloated, sprawling game with over-thought, over-loaded design. It could have been a decent game perhaps if the number of cards and the number of resources were about half as many.  Games are supposed to be fun to play not torture. Lots of redundant supposedly "options" exist which don't add to the game, but make it a chore. 

Each player will end up owning several building cards. On your turn you have to constantly look around the table and try to read the text/symbols on the cards to see which ones you may need to use, plus other building cards or ship cards that you may want to buy or build. Also check to see if the building card that let's you perform your intended move is available. This is tiring. A lot of the cards will sit there and never be used. The last couple of rounds it gets more chaotic and one or two players can get lucky to score big and others end up with lots of wasted resourced.

There are lots of better, tight, elegant resource management games, including Puerto Rico, Caylus, Stone Age, and many others.

Even coarser than Agricola. Played once using the shortened version which ran almost 2 hours for 4 players. Good, but fell a bit short of Agricola, which I think is coarse enough. It felt like the game was too short and the strategic options too limited, which might be a result of playing the short game. Would love to play again with the full rules.

Edit: It took a while to understand the game, which is mostly learned by experience. Le Havre is one of my favourite games, and my favourite in the resource optimization genre.

Edit: Coal/coke strategy is dominant. Once all players know this, the game is still good, but it makes the game pretty hard to be worth investing its 3 hours in with new players.

OK Economic Engine game.  Disappointing after the huge amount of hype.  The long game goes about 30% too long.  The short game seems a bit better.  Not as "tight" as Agricola, where your board seems to come together all at the last minute.  Feeding also seems less urgent since you can pay it off with currency.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Rating after 1 play - 2 player game. Although the theme and mechanics are not as brilliantly unified as Agricola; Le Havre's mechanics are easier to explain/understand and, perhaps counter to expectations, it offers a greater variety of difficult choices and interesting opportunities. Far less friendly to the casual gamer yet with a similar but more forgiving feeding scheme. The first game, which at 2.5-4 (or more) hours is no small investment and must be considered as such, an investment, as the progression of buildings and their use will not be clear until (perhaps) several plays. This game seems to reward selective specialization where Agricola punishes it. Not since Agricola have I had such anxiety over difficult decisions; however, in Le Havre I felt that way every turn!

Obviously Agricola is an easy starting place for comparisons to this game. Le Havre is the superior game for serious gamers and my preference. Agricola is a very good game for leading casual gamers down the path to more serious games. As such I don't think Le Havre's popularity will overtake Agricola. There is definitely a place for both in my collection.

RATING: 7
[floatleft][ImageID=392682][/floatleft]Le Havre is the best game in the Uwe Rosenberg's harvest trilogy. Where Agricola seems confining, Le Havre feels open ended. Le Havre is the most grueling game of the harvest trilogy with ever increasing feeding requirements. The tension of survival is palpable. 

The design of Le Havre is to use resources to construct buildings for points and more resources. Because of the design structure I am concerned about replayability of Le Harve. I am worried that after multiple plays the game plays will start to feel similar. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well designed game, but there are a few points that bothered me:

1. It's too long. Just when I started to think the game was almost over, I looked at the deck and realized we were only 1/2 way.

2. The number of cards grows during the game, so that each round seems to take longer and longer as players try to maximze. 

3. Worker placement with just one worker. 

On the plus side, there are a lot of decisions to make, and the building deck is big enough to keep things interesting from game to game. 

I'll give this another chance. it's possible that the building mix that came up was a dud.

Great game, but at 2-3 hours, I thin it runs a bit too long. Other than the special buildings, it's pretty similar each game. A great game with good mechanics, but after 10 games, I think I prefer Agricola more because it's quicker and has more variety.

the game is perfectly fine. It's mostly turning resources into other resources like we've now seen in many games. The graphic design is somewhat poor in that the central board has a lot of wasted space and the colors are garish. The troublesome part is that the game's big draw for me is that players can buy these building cards, which add worker placement spots, but give the owner of the building some benefit when it's used. This is a mechanism I enjoy, and am drawn to in many other games, but in Le Havre it seems especially hard to tell what the buildings do from across the table. 

There's also a strange design decision where each player gets an uneven number of turns each round. By the end of the game it all works out to even turns, but when preparing for a feeding phase, you sometimes have enough actions and sometimes you don't. It just feels uncomfortable.

I would play this again in theory, if someone felt strongly that they wanted to play it, but I don't think I need to own it.

My favorite of the harvest trilogy.  It feels much  more "open" than Agricola - so many choices.  It's not a choice between good and bad, it's a choice between good and optimal.

Le Havre is another game of gathering and spending multiple resources, but with the added complication of multiple ways to convert resources into one another. This type of fiddly optimisation game (like Caylus) doesn't appeal to me much and I felt like it went on at least 50% longer than it really needed to. There's not much elegant or organic about this design, it relies on lots of cards with slightly tedious effects to achieve replayability rather than subtleties of player ineraction. I'm sure the second play would be much better but I doubt I'll prioritise that as a use of my gaming time.

This is tough to rate. I really enjoy some of the aspects of the game, but there are several annoyances that really drive this one lower than it should be. First, you really don't get to accomplish much each turn, which feels like you are just slowly grinding away. Second, the game takes waaaayyyy too long. Gonna give it a few more plays and then adjust my rating accordingly.

Edit. Upped rating a bit after a couple of more plays. This game is a rare sort that is much better with fewer players. I actually prefer this as a two player game. More people = lengthier game with more down time. I think it is a pretty keen game with multiple paths to victory. 

Components are nice, but I wish the chits were not so fiddly. 

Updated rating again. I like this the more I play it.  Still too fiddly, and takes longer to finish a game than I would like, but otherwise excellent!

Agricola on steroids. No, not really. More a derivative refinement. The buildings act like round cards and there is a much more dynamic tree of choices (plans for buildings which, once built, everyone can use - Caylus like). Interesting design element is the asymetrical action points. Each round in a 3 player has one player getting 3 actions and the other two 2 actions. The extra action works its way around.

I've only played Le Havre a couple of times at the time of writing this, but I've enjoyed it. I really like how there's always something that you need to do to stay in the game, and it really encourages you to have a long-term (but flexible) strategy. The game always keeps you absorbed, and once you get the hang of the mechanics a turn can be played through very quickly (with the right people, of course). My only complaint is how fiddly the game can be: too many little counters. But it's a very minor complaint.

A standard number of steps between harvest rounds means the game scales poorly with the number of players.
Looks like the game revolves around learning the valuable building combinations - how to get out scrabbling for food. Building the economic engine so you can cash in later - much later. Every action seems very incremental.
Since everyone has the same penalties there is no mechanism to restrain the leader helping those in the rear catch up.

Ultimately I found the game to be repetitious and tedious. One that I can pass.

Created by the same person who gave us Agricola, this is in the line of that game, and in my opinion, more enjoyable than Agricola. Unlike Agricola, all the player have the same setup and cards are available to all. The race is tight to feed your population while trying to develop at the same time. The choices each turn increases and it become realy hard to maximize you moves. So the learning curve of that game is realy steep. the rules are realy simple and easy to explain. The time duration of the game can be a turn off as it tend to increase significatively with the number of player. This is also the kind of game where players will get AP. So if your playing with people who tend to be proned to AP, the game will seem long and boring. 

Créé par la même personne qui nous a donné Agricola, ce jeu est dans la même lignée. Par contre, contrairement à Agricola, tous les joueurs ont le même arrangement de départ et les cartes sont disponibles pour tous les joueurs. La course est serrée afin de nourir sa population tout en développant en même temps. Les choix augmentent à chaque tour et il devient difficile de maximiser ses coups. La courbe d'apprentissage est donc longue. Les règles sont claires et faciles à expliquer. Un point négatif est le temps de jeu qui augmente significativement avec le nombre de joueurs. La Paralysie Analytique peut également être un facteur dans ce jeu. Si vous jouer avec des joueurs qui sont réputés être des adeptes de PA, alors le jeu vous semblera long et ennuyeux.

UPDATE: I've played the game a bunch of times on the iOS app now. Don't enjoy it nearly as much without people sitting at the table with you. It's a much less interesting game... basically a mathy type puzzle once you take away the players. I won't downgrade the rating for that... but makes me less interested in the game.

Have the iOS app and that's the only way I have played. Really enjoying this one and would love to play in real life someday.

Update: I now own a copy and have gotten it to the table a few times, and it's a real pleasure at 3-4 players. It's a bit longer than some of Uwe's others, but it's great fun. 

I don't think it's quite as great as some of his others though--the strategy is there but unfortunately seems to be pretty centered around getting Coke and Steel with other routes not that valid or possible. That's not a huge issue--Agricola is a fantastic game but everyone has to fight for family growth--but for some reason Le Havre feels like a game that entices you by all these options when really only a small minority of the paths are really useful.

What on earth am I [i]doing[/i] in this game? Am I a mayor? A dock owner? A shipping magnate? Who are these workers and why do I need to feed them? 

I get that this takes the potential card imbalance problem of Agricola and makes the special powers available as common buildings, but that introduces more problems than it fixes for me. So rather than pay attention to just the few cards in my hand that synergize, I need to instead memorize the components before I can play well? That's hardly an improvement. Neither is the fact that many of the buildings will be facing away from me, upside down, during the course of play. Also not ideal. 

But finally, what really killed it for me was the game resources were too abundant for me to care about them; if instead of taking a shitload of wheat I can take a shitload of fish, where's the tension? Agricola was interesting because navigating scarcity is difficult and promotes a sensitivity to wastefulness; navigating abundance is simply annoying. It's component bukkake.

Pros:

[1] Very low luck factor
[2] Seems to have the same heaviness and depth of Caylus, but the theme is far better implemented in this one, and the rules are much easier to digest.

Cons:

[1] It's still another worker placement/economic engine game. Really nothing innovative.

[2] It is way, way too long considering how repetitive and mechanical it is. Compare this to Puerto Rico: In that game you're doing lots of different things and in a different order. In Le Havre, there are much less things to do: either get resources or do a special action. Then some special event (harvest) happens on a very regular basis.

[3] Very, very prone to AP. There is *a lot* of information to digest during your turn. Every special building is face up for inspection. However, not every building is available for purchase (the building cards are laid out in three face-up columns; only the top card of each column is available, so AP-prone players will spend lots of time simply trying to figure out how to get cards buried down in a column.

Worse, because it's a worker placement game, players can prevent opponents from doing a particular action by doing the action first. So if some opponent does that to you *and* you weren't prepared, you'll have to totally rethink your strategy.

Every time I play Le Havre, I like it more.  The same designer created Agricola, and the two games share a number of themes.  The ever-growing supply piles and the constant need for food drive both games, but I find that I much prefer Le Havre.  I really enjoy the building mechanic and the ability to visit other players' buildings for a price.  The lone shortcoming to this game is its incredible length.  Every game we've played has taken 3 hours to complete, which is stretching it for our group.  We like to play multiple games in an evening, and Le Havre has the tendency to absorb an entire night.  In fairness, I don't think we've played a game yet in which we weren't teaching a new player, but even with the length, I still greatly enjoy this game.

The upside:
- Lots of options to go for.
- The fact that in any given of your turn there's always good actions you can take.
- It simple to explain: "On your turn take one pile of resources or a building action".
- Can be played solo.
- It's fun trying to put all those diferent resources you're getting into something lucrative.

The downside:
- I think some resources suffer from lack of love because they don't get picked/used as much as the others.
- Trying to keep up with all the buildings you can use( if everyone gets 8 or something, you can imagine...)

Well, let me just say I really respect the design of this game. I had a good time. But here is where the rubber meets the road. I'm giving this one a 7 because if someone wanted to play this game I would be happy to. But, I will more than likely put this one up for trade because I don't think I would ever look on my shelf and choose this one over about 20-30 of my other games. It is just a bit too long for what it is. It's pretty tedious as you continue to put the resources in the offers and feed your people every three or four actions. It's just a bit repetitive, and I felt like I was working instead of playing a game. I say all of this a bit aggressively, but honestly it was fun and I could see through multiple plays you could grow in your strategy, but my wife didn't like it, and I won't be reaching for it on the shelf, so why keep it? Glad I got to play this classic though. I could see many loving this one, so give it a try.

Brilliant design and I love how the games scales to different no's of players and shortened versions. Best with 2-3 players because of game length but doesn't really feel like a long game because its quite involving. I like the way the game develops with acquiring more advanced goods, building and ships.

Bought as a replacement for Agricola (which I'd got frustrated with). I'm pleased with my decision as I definitely rate this as the better game.

There are always so many attractive options that you always seem spoiled for choice. As such it is just about impossible to have a turn where you think you didn't achieve much. You always get a good deal at something. It's great to watch the playspace expand and for options to grow as the game develops and I welcome the fact that the function of the buildings is all so intuitive.

Its a shame it takes quite so long to play as this will stop it getting played more. That prevents me from rating it any higher.

This is an extremely well done game. Kristen really likes it, I really like it. The mechanics are interesting but we fear a lack of cards (in the two player game) may make it stale over time and only a few actual strategies are presenting themselves.

**Keep in mind I've only played solo two player games on the digital edition.  I don't own a hard copy of the game.

The game was really fun at first; I'm a big fan of town building games.  However, this one quickly died out.  There's definitely a meta-strategy that you can employ to win nearly every game.  There's one for player one and another for player two and they work every time.  

Like I said, I've never played with 3 or more players so hopefully the larger games have more replayability, but after a strong first impression I was slowly let down by this game.  I'll still play if the people in the group want to.  I just won't suggest to play it.

Primera partida a tres, nos gusto a los tres a pesar de las diferencias de puntos finales.El que mas puntuo fue 118 puntos y el que menos 11. Al principio se hace muy ameno porque no tienes muchas opciones y en las ultimas rondas, tienes tantas opciones diferentes por la cantidad de cartas desplegadas que se ralentiza bastante el juego, buscas por la mesa el combo de cartas que te permite hacer lo que quieres.

Muy agobiante, andas ronda tras ronda preocupado por la comida,en esta segunda partida jugada a dos hemos estado arrastrando prestamos durante toda la partida y en todo momento angustiados por no llegar a pagar la comida en la fase de fin de ronda. Muy buena sensación, es un quemacerebros.

It's hard not to compare Le Havre to Agricola.  They are from the same designer, the art style is the same right down the the artist's extreme attention to details.  Each player owns their own little factory town, or rather their own block in a larger factory shipping town.  The game starts with having few options available (yet there are more options than at the beginning of Agricola) and expands to having tons of options.  The actions are fairly simple: put out the specified supply tokens and then either take one type of supply tokens or enter a building and do an action.  But there are a ton of different ways to go about getting the food you need while you build up a complex of buildings. It is very unlike Agricola.

The only aspect of Agricola that I missed was the feeling of satisfaction as I looked at my farm.  But the game play of Le Havre itself was so much more enjoyable that I am willing to give up that small point.  

I like that there are a ton of options and that it's really difficult to get shut out of useful actions/items.  If you want to go into the wharf to build a ship but someone is already there, you can take a big stack of fish or whatever.  There are always useful things to do so you never feel helpless.

First play was very smooth.  I think this game was much easier to learn than Agricola, and much more enjoyable.  The little bit of randomness in Le Havre is for everyone to see and plan for, not like Agricola where each player has their own card draw.  I also really like how the interaction is a bit more direct in Le Havre (not much more, but a bit) as players not only have to try to plan what other players will need for resources, but have to plan to have food/francs to enter each other's buildings.  I can see myself enjoying this game more after more plays!

RATING: 6
Awesome game concept.  Flavors of Agricola, but with more of a Bazaar implementation than Caylus.  Game length is much too long, and may suffer the same painful downtime with higher player counts that afflict Vinci.  Based on my plays, I'd recommend this with 2 or 3.  (3 is probably ideal, but 2 is preferable to 4).  If only this game was shorter and had more variables (like Agricola) . . .

Bought this game blind based on Agricola pedigree -- Le Havre shares some mechanics, but is a much heavier game with a more complex economic system.  It surprised me how the goods management started to feel similar to Roads and Boats in sheer complexity, sans the transport network fiddliness.  The time commitment feels a little long for what the game is, but turns are very fast and you're always kept thinking.

It is a fantastic heavy economic/worker placement game from Uwe Rosenberg. The second in the so-called harvest trilogy. And on heavy I really mean it. The constant evaluation of your options vs. your opponents' options as well as finding an early solution to feed your workers are critical. The struggle to build critical buildings in a way where you benefit from it first makes it a very tense chess-like puzzle. The more than 30 buildings and the somewhat random starting position of these makes every game slightly different. The special buildings can lend each game a different angle, and utilizing these options is very important. 
Another big dilemma is the instinctive lure of opportunism of a good big stack of wood or fish vs. long-term planning. 
I also like how the game evolves from the early resource collection to mid-game resource conversion to late game shipping. 
Like the hidden (??) social commentary (??) of waste produced by modern econimies. 
But: AP prone and I would never recommend this game for more than three players. Also, sometimes its weight is its own enemy: there are ocasions, when you feel just too damn tired to start such a game.
I also like the app, that makes the administration so less fiddly.
Update #1: It's fantastic how you are still learning nuances after 10 games. Usually nobody cares about Charcoal Kiln, but yesterday in a two-player game I refused to build the Cokery, grabbed the big pile of woods and covered my energy needs from that, all the while my opponent struggled to get the energy needed for operating the Steelworks.

I think this is a good game. Really, I do, but like a lot of other Rosenberg titles, I personally think Le Havre feels samey very quickly. The mechanics are sound, and that first play is tight and exciting, but every subsequent play is a bit boring and predictable. I still give it a favorable score for being built on solid bones. I just think I've seen all Le Havre has to offer.

Turns go quickly but the game as a whole feels kind of long. Rules are simple but there are a few dozen cards, each granting different abilities, and these can be hard to keep track of.

I have only played 3 games of LeHavre, so I have  not finally decided if I like it as much as Rosenberg's other harvest games Agricola and Ora&Labora (definetely much more than Loyang). To me, LeHavre is a stream-lined and more focused version of Ora&Labora (strange to say this about a predecessor), with less complex product conversions. But I am not sure, if LeHavre is as deep as these two and offer that much replayability.

With two players it is really tactical (do you have to take wood now or is it still there in your next turn? Can you get the ressources for a ship before your opponent does?) I really enjoy the shift in gameplay: You begin with getting enough food for your workers and this gets even harder as they need more every round. But after you get some ships and made a huge batch of bread or beef, you focus more on getting steel (either for ships or to ship it).

I often heard the following phrase, but I agree: In your turn you always have several very good options and you just try to pick the best. Even though I am sometimes AP prone, I was not overwhelmed by these options at all. Playing LeHavre feels more light hearted than Agricola, since you accomplish something every turn and you are not forced to do a certain thing.

A robust economic game with a broad strategic horizons, and a great narrative arc. From plucking up small piles of resources, to acquiring more and more buildings and ships, to sending off richly-laden ships - each stage of the game flows naturally and builds drama. This is an efficiency game, but an effiency game that can reward flexibility, rather than the cramped puzzle format of other efficiency-engine games (I'm looking at your Agricola). Components are also top-notch.

I need to play this a few more times, at which point it is likely to be promoted or demoted significantly. The reason is that there is a substantial learning curve in memorizing the large number of options in the game.
The game has 3 currencies and (if I counted them right) 14 commodities, though it remains at heart a victory points optimisation euro. The problem I have is deciding if that additional complexity adds anything.
I also have some doubts that the game doesn't involve a relatively straighforward set of optimisation decisions. This is partly because the game disguises the long range progress.
It is certainly thinky rather than fun, and in an odd way (though the games have nothing in common rule-wise) it reminded me much more of Civilization than its Euro cousins in feel. 
I retain an open mind but I'm inclined to think that this falls into the category of in-elegant and could have been produced with a much narrower range of components but all the same essential ideas.

Awesome game. Heavily drawing on your ability to make long-term strategies, but punishes you for sticking too hard to it. There is no easy way to win in this game. Has no chance factor, which makes a victory so much more rewarding and a loss so much more humbling than in any other game. It's a man's game. 
I like it, even though I lose most of the times.

My wife got this for Christmas quite a few years ago (2013 I think, but it may have been 2012), and despite both of us liking most of Uwe's other games, for some reason we never got round to trying this until we played a 2p game today (May 1st 2016!). And it's a shame it took us so long, because we both really liked the game - it has a fair bit in common with Agricola and (in particular) Ora et Labora, but I think I prefer it to O&L (it's much more streamlined, and turns fly by, barring the occasional boutt of AP caused by the huge number of options later in the game). I'm not sure it's better than Agricola or Caverna, because of the huge replayability of the former and the insane amount of options and strategies in the latter, but I don't rule this out either. I can see this one getting quite a lot of play in the future.

I think, at least with 2 players, this is a stronger game than Through the Ages. Many different mechanics but somewhat feels similar (or at least scratches the same itch) but flows much better. Feels like it plays faster than its actual playing time.

I'm a big fan of board games with everyday / non-fantasy themes and Le Havre is easily one of my favorites.  Collecting and converting resources to increase their values always feels rewarding.  Having to balance investing resources to expand my business while holding funds in reserve to pay my dock workers always creates a nice amount of tension for me.

My eyes light up any time I see this game hit the table; will enjoy for a long time to come.

Mainly bought because of it's supposed similarities to other good games, but I do think this one stands on its own. Played twice, once with 3p and once with 4p. Although both work well, I do think it works better with 3 players, as you have more influence on the game and more actions and time to implement your strategy...

Although the number of Special Buildings make for a dfferent game every time, I feel replayability might not be as good as I had hoped for.

UPDATE: Played multiple times (about 10x), but has stood on the shelf for the last two years...

DEC 2008: Very nice game. Shares Agricola's variablility due to the plethora of cards of which only a small subset are used each game. Even though it uses action mechanisms similar to that of Agricola, the play feels different. The use of the buildings by all players makes the game feel a little more interactive. With a large number of resources and their upgrades, there are an enormous number of viable strategies for each game. Production and art is stellar. I need a few more plays but it might even be better than the Gric.

i LOVE the painful decisions u get each turn. i LOVE the face u only do ONE thing on ur turn. 

i DISLIKE that this game takes 4+ hrs with 4 people.i DISLIKE the complete absence of theme. i DISLIKE the lack of a sense of achievement at the end.

if there was a game with the same choice intensity that played in 2-2.5 hrs i would play it a LOT.

if there was a game that took 4 hours and had as painful decisions but that had a map and fighting and a sense of epicness i would play it a LOT

played a few times 2pl (2-2.5hrs full game, 1h15 short) and it works really well both full and short

rating after 8plays - 9 - i just love the choices this presents and i prefer it to agricola - no other gane that i know of forces u to evaluate differing amounts of resources like this one does

update - turns out we were playing the loans rule wrong - we played 1 coin per loan come interest time - so tried it the proper way and HATED IT - it took all the wonderful feeding stress out the game - u just took lots of loans and u realise that once the food tension is removed there's not a lot left - won't play this way again and i recommend others dont

First play of full game w/ 3 players ran long.  Subsequent plays of the short game were about the right length.  I think this game should be enjoyed as the short game until players are familiar with all the buildings.  Then add the long game for more depth.  (I still have a hard time thinking of this game for 4 or 5 players).  An interesting game of getting goods and converting them to other goods and VPs.  2 or 3 works best I think as it allows for a couple of plays before the end round.  4-5 works also, but is just longer for the same stuff.  WIll play with more (and enjoy it), but prefer the shorter games.

RATING: 9
The rules themselves are fairly simple. The strategy is really deep though. There are so many choices in this game. It lets you do some really cool things that are hard to see. Selling some of your buildings to get an important one or taking out loans (and repaying them later) to focus on buying buildings.

The temptation in this game is awesome. There are so many GOOD choices that you will get frustrated because you can't take them all. It's very difficult to find the "best" choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game is ok, but it is more complex, fiddley, and mathy than I like.  It has depth, but at the cost of a huge number of arbitrary rules that must be remembered.  It feels like every balance tweak game with an entirely new mechanic, and the end result is a game that functions by brute force not cleverness, elegance, or precision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
*EDIT (03/11/09): I have real concerns about two things.  First, the way loans and interest work make no sense whatsoever from a theme point of view, which annoys me badly.  It is becoming clear that actions spent just to feed and avoid a loan are losers.  Second, as you might expect from an engine-building game, there's VERY little capacity to catch up to a leader, which in a game this length often means 1 1/2 to 2 hours spent playing for second (or just trying to avoid last).  It would be nice if some of the "late game" cards such as the steel production cards were not put together in such a way that only those already doing great can use them.  Still, for me, more fun than Agricola.*

I feel very little need to play Agricola now that Le Havre is here.  Both are probably a little long, but I don't consider that an ender in a "main event" sort of game.  I still struggle with analysis paralysis (as do some others in my group), but it never seems to get aggravating.  I don't want to play a big game like this all the time, but I still find myself amenable when others bring this one up.

Would like a copy of my own so Marissa and I could play 2-player.

Tenía muy pocos edificos pero mucho cash (85f en cash), tenía 2 barcos. Fantástico juego!

Interesting pleasing core system, but way too long and fiddly for me, I think, and it requires too much specific knowledge of all the buildings to play it competently and rapidly. I found myself continually having to refresh my memory about what building produces what resource which I need to do what again?

It reminded me of why I got sick of programming - too much time learning very specific functions and libraries, not enough general principles. If that makes sense to anyone but me. :)

I admire it but didn't like it as much as I wanted to, ultimately.

Only played this game twice, but it just didn't really appeal to us. It seems like there is a dominant strategy that is guaranteed to give you a ton of points, so the game ends up being a race to see who can do that dominant strategy the best.  We should probably give this game another chance at some point, but for now we are not really interested.

Might just be the most enjoyable game I own. This game won't be the most complex game you ever play, but it sure will be fun. Players act as industrialists, purchasing buildings and ships and accumulating goods such as bread, smoked fish, clay bricks, leather & steel that can be shipped for profit. Works extremely well with two players. I'm super happy to have this game in my collection.

I played this once and was bored the whole time. I seemed to just focus too much on getting food and resources that I couldn't actually focus on getting things that helped you win. I'll play it again to see if the game improves with more plays like some games do (Race for the Galaxy), but I'm not rushing out to try it again.

I like long games, but only when the game feels like it's progressing and I feel as though I'm progressing. I don't think I came out much better than I was when I started and it was very disappointing. I expected a lot from this game when I played it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game, but lacks the theme of building something like Agricola has, which can really draw in non-gamers.  You just end up with a long line of building  cards and a stack of money to count.  The most interesting aspect is seeing what special buildings come out and how you can best take advantage of them, but the player who gets to go first just after a special came up has a big advantage, unless they get screwed by a bad one (they're all pretty good, but some are not so good if they come out too late in the game). I've only played 2 players, so I'm sure there's a lot of game still left for me to experience, but I think I would always vote to play Agricola over this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update 01-19-11: Changed my rating from a 5.5 to a 6 based on a 2-Player game (the standard, long game). The repetition didn't bother me as much and certainly the pacing was quicker.

I think my problem with the first game was that I spent so long getting a food engine going that the rest of the game was passing me by. Towards the end I was counting ship/harvest cards to figure out how much time I had left to score points.

My rating will likely go up with repeated plays. I think it will be a while before I would want to attempt it with 4 or 5 players.

-----

One play. Three-player. I felt the repetition here. I don't mind long games that engage me but the type of management required here had me looking at how many cards were left in the 'ship' deck quite often. This type of game needs to be shorter and I'd like to try the short(er) game option.

Certainly not a bad game and I would play again (with 2 or 3 players).

This game is among one of my favorites. In this game you are investors building buildings and ships to ship goods in order to make the most money. The game has a unique worker placement aspect where players use each other's buildings to improve their goods and make them more valuable for shipping or for building more valuable building in the port town.  This Gaame is so much fun.

Pros: fairly simple game play but with deep heavy decisions that get more and more difficult as the game goes on.Fun theme. No harsh worker placement. 

Cons: long playing time. Game may take a while to setup.

Does it have a lot of chits? Yes.  Does it give you a bad case of analysis paralysis? Yes.  Is it easy to get lost on what you were trying to accomplish? Yes.  However, I am able to overlook its annoying qualities because the gameplay is fantastic.  There is no denying it anymore, I am a fan of a game designer - Uwe Rosenberg.

For me, a completely different experience from Agricola, but I'm sure there is no coincidence why I rank them both so high.

--Dec2008-- Arrived from Germany!  Thanks, Hanno.
--Jan2009-- First play:  long, subtle, brain-melting.  Possibly too long for regular plays.  But the mechanics are really quite lovely for all that.  I really enjoyed the mechanics, and would love to play again.  I expect to revise the rating up with further play.

Wow: it's long.  Yet, strangely perhaps, it's not too long.  Let me pick on _Caylus_ again:  every time I've played, I begrudge the time that's passed - if the game takes 2 hours to play, I feel I've got in an hour (or so) of gaming goodness, and been forced to watch some machinery grind for another hour.  On the other hand _Le Havre_ (so far, at least) seems to provide the full complement of game fun in the time allotted.

One of the Harvest Triology. The background is set at the industrial age at Le Havre where you build and visit different buildings to make money. Compared to its cousin Agricola, Le Havre is more delightful. While Agricola is about feeding your family, Le Havre is about developing and getting rich. It's the age of capitalism, buddy, you can even eat your money! And, guess what, the victory condition is money, too! How convenient!

In Le Havre players collect resources and use various buildings to develop them into advanced (and more valuable) resources all of which can be used to build buildings where different activities like developing resources can be done. This is the next big game from Uwe Rosenberg after Agricola and at least in my books this is a better one. The game is exactly the kind of game I enjoy playing. Maximising opportunities within a certain longer strategy and figuring out good combos of actions you can do. The only fault is that it takes quite a long time to play. It doesn't matter to me personally but it's hard to find people willing to spend the time to invest enough time for a game.

I originally played Le Havre back when the game came out, and liked it alright. It felt a bit slow and a little long for me at the time, and it was right about when my enjoyment of euros was starting to wane.

Recently I got the game in a trade, and for whatever reason I find myself appreciating it once more. It's a very challenging game, with a lot of small decisions that add up over the whole stretch of the game. I like the level of luck here too, as it shifts when the same buildings come out from game to game. Perhaps most satisfying, the scope of the game ramps up really well. The players start with just a little bit of money and a lump of coal, and by the end they are shipping boatloads of goods all over the place. With 3 people it's hard to do better in this genre.

There are still a couple of downsides. It's on the long side, especially for this weight class. The closest comparison here is probably to Caylus, another solid game that is probably too long to really play a whole bunch. It also is punishing to inexperienced players, meaning that a single group that plays over and over again will get the most out of it. 

In the end, there are about forty hojillion heavy Euros that dwell in the same space as Le Havre, but for whatever reason it has managed to hold its own over several years. I still prefer Agricola, but Le Havre is a great game in its own right.

Just so much better than Agricola.

The sameish mechanics take advantage of what I liked about Agricola, but the addition of a (to me) more interesting theme, and a much more forgiving game makes it more engaging. No longer are some actions just plain better and able to be spammed and blocked (I'm looking at you, family growth), and the special buildings are far less game changing than some of the Agricola cards, but still provide enough uniqueness to make each game slightly different. 

Generally, what's good is if something is hard, it's hard for all the players rather than the luck of the draw meaning one player is screwed whilst the other's rock.

A little too dry. Did not enjoy the theme. The gameplay was fun, I enjoyed the variety of tiles to place your workers, and the increasing piles of goods that encouraged you to take something you would otherwise pass on. Feeding your people was tense.

It is a great and very sophisticated game.  There was way to much information to digest on the first play.  All the different building to buy and use was overwhelming but did leave me wanting more.

Second play better than the first.  Got the loan rule correct which improved play.  Costing all the actions you have avaliable is very subtle and hard to do but overall I like it very much.

Being forced to 'feed' a growing population that do nothing for you makes this game slow, dry and lacking in theme. It feels like work, not fun. If a player gets behind early in the game, they are forced into a long and dull evening of trying to survive. It may be a clever design, but for the above reasons, we traded this game away.

RATING: 10
Intense, engaging and quite fun and satisfying putting it all together. This will reward future plays. Although there are certainly similarities with Agricola, it's thematically and mechanically unique enough to own as well. There are so many paths you can choose from game to game, and there are tough choices to make turn to turn. Best game I can think of for three players. I'd recommend new players start with the short game - it should get them back wanting more.

Every game is like a fluid puzzle, where you're trying to get your town up and running, buying buildings, feeding people, shipping goods, building ships. There's never enough turns to get everything you want done, so you have to choose where you're going to suffer and where you're going to thrive. The difficulty is working all these plans around the plans of your opponents. Dealing with all this is fun because your opponents have to deal with all your shenanigans too. That's where it's similar to Agricola. Everywhere else it feels like a different experience entirely. All buildings are open and special abilities are there for all to see. Because the building order changes from game to game it's a different experience each time. It's a puzzle I'd like to get to the table more often so I can really explore strategies. There's a lot of replay value here for me.

Yet another Euro in which players get resources in order to exchange them later to get better tools or victory points.  The difference is that this time it is longer than average and its mechanics may seem repetitive after a while.  Nevertheless, it is true also that the game gives some interesting strategical decisions about timing and where to invest during play.  Another case of unjustified buzz, this one motivated by the prior success of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260]Agricola[/url][/i], from the same designer.

My first Uwe Rosenberg game, and one I will return to from time to time with great fondness. Incredibly well-designed, though tends to get a little samey with repeated play due to the steel shipping strat being so strong. More prone to AP than Agricola, due to there being so many options in mid-to-late game. Truly only suitable for 2-3 players, which is why I don't own it yet.

I like this game, but not having enough plays of it under my belt yet I am still in that frustrating phase where I do not know at a glance what all the buildings do. I suspect that this one may become more of a favorite as I get to know it better.

Update: After more plays and having a better sense of the buildings, this is turning out to be a great game!

RATING: N/A
It took me too long to get a chance to play this, but when I finally did, I liked it a lot. 

The game is very open with all the action choices, but not so open that you can't plan and decide. I really like the fact that the actions are so simple, but also very complex: take some resources or use a building. That's it. But it takes a lot to really decide what to do. After a good few thoughtful minutes, it's somewhat funny to just take the fish, for example. "What? You sat there for 5 minutes, and after all that, you are just taking the fish?!" But a lot of strategy went into taking those fish, planning that included future turns, too.

The way the buildings are purchased and used and potentially sold back is interesting and unique. If you own the building, you use it for no direct cost. If you build a building, you get the cost displayed as points at the end of the game. If someone is using your building, you can't use it, too. but you can sell it back, which means it is available to use again. Cool stuff going on that creates complex effects.

This one is ranked high for a reason. Great game!

Az első játék közben felváltva kavarogtak bennem az imádat és az utálat érzések. Nagyon utáltam, mert a közepe felé jöttem rá, hogy mi a helyes taktika, nagyon megszerettem mert az óriási szabadság egyben korlát is, hogy mennyire találod meg az éppen neked legjobban jövedelmező lépést. Hosszú, igen hosszú a játék de tartalmas, nincsenek holtidőszakok, nem zavart. Talán az első játék lesz ahol kipróbálom a egyszemélyes verziót, mert jókat olvastam róla. Abszolút más mint az Agricola, nem összehasonlítható a kettő játék. A grafika egyedi, nem kiemelkedő de mégis passzol a játékhoz. Mentes minden fölösleges szélsőségtől.

This is a good game.  It takes a couple of plays to get some of the more important strategy points.  One downside of the game, from my POV, is that rarity of shipyards given their importance in the game for food production and shipping.  If someone plants his token on the shipyard, the other players can be blocked out, which I think throws the game off a bit.  Still, this game is a lot of fun and I am always up for it if I have the time.

The mechanic is so deceptively simple yet rich, rich, rich.  Owning/building the buildings will usually return your investment in the long-term while saving you entry fees (and force them on other players) in the short-term.  There's no true multi-worker-placement, but there are plenty of 'feeding' obligations and a million ways to accomplish your goals.  If gaming is really all about making painful choices, this game has a bright future for my tastes.

My favorite game of all time. The mechanics are perfect. The only complaints I have are incredibly minor, but here they are:

There are a lot of little fiddly chits and it would be really nice if the game came with a way to keep them nice and organized on the board instead of having you just pile them onto small spaces.

Also, the game should not have 5 player rules. I'm sorry, but it just shouldn't. 4 player is CRAZY long, but I want to do it anyway just to see all the buildings. But a version in which you almost always have a single turn per round? No thanks.

The other half of Agricola, this essentially does the "buildings and shipping" side.  Again it's fiddly in terms of bookkeeping, but very well constructed in terms of mechanics.  
On the whole I suspect I would rather play this than A, but it probably won't have the same sort of longevity as certain aspects become rote.  

edit: and so it proves.  In fact, I have rerated A (up) because of this - there are too many annoying aspects here for it to shine as it should, and the immersion isn't nearly as strong.  Still a perfectly decent game though.  Has fallen into the same trap as Caylus for me.

There are a lot of really cool things about this game.

With five players -- two of us playing for the first time -- it took just over three hours, and that didn't feel too long for the amount of decisions made along the way. My playing felt reactive, in that it was difficult to plan more than a turn or two ahead and actually get to follow through on the intended plan; either I'd get blocked, or some unanticipated opportunity or more desperate need would arise first.

I was confused initially by the subtlety of buying buildings, building buildings, using a building, and just squatting in a previously-used building. This amounted to some poor decisions early on, where I didn't get much benefit out of my selections.

While I enjoyed playing this one far more than I did Agricola, it did share some of the opacity in scoring. Even though the value of things is more apparent here, it's hard to tell how well one's opponents are doing comparatively, and hence all five scores out the end turned out to feel like a surprise. That means it's hard to know if you played well until it's over, and all the small successes and seemingly good choices along the way can still come to naught.

Having said that, I'd play again, preferably with four players.

One of my favorites.  Anyone who wants to play will always find me as a willing participant.  Three players is definitely the sweet spot on this one.  I can't imagine playing a five player game of this unless you have 4 hours set aside.  Lots of tough choices to make, but none of them are bad.  You don't feel like you are getting jipped if you HAVE to take the fish offer.  I like the dynamic of some turns you will get 3 actions and sometimes you will get 2 and must plan appropriately.  It's cool how if you build a building, someone else can still use it, but they might have to pay you a fee to do so.  You can block, but you can't use the same building twice in a row, so if you block a building by leaving your worker there, it prevents you from using that particular building for another turn.  There are so many cool little nuances that you only really appreciate after a couple of plays.  It's outstanding and worthy of its high rating on here.

After further plays of this, I have to say that it can be a little samey and I have downgraded it.  It would rank behind Agricola at this point and possibly be on the chopping block.

tons of action possibilities but thankfully as the game progresses many of the actions become obviously less useful, so this prevents excessive analysis paralysis.  This is (so far) the king of resource management / building games.  Somewhat flawed due to the dominance of the coal/steel strategy toward the endgame, but I still like this better than Ora et Labora since it has some randomness in game setup whereas O&L does not.

RATING: 2
The game that made me realise we're not in the same hobby after all. And that recommendation forums suck. 

It's an optimisation exercise in which the number of options increase as you go along - there's so much stuff to do! Yet every choice is the same as every other choice with net result being driven to AP and apathy by the sheer number of irrelevant choices. It's like grocery shopping the game - this canned tuna or the other, this brand of olive oil or one of 20 others, or maybe margarine? So not only you're doing solitarish optimisation, you're also overburdened by choices nobody cares about. And once in a while, staring at your shopping list, you occasionally bump into another shopping trolley. Are we having fun yet? 

In Agricola you make a strategic choice about the food engine and you have to stick to it to reap profit - so you're both risking that it will work, plus it takes about half of your actions away, meaning your brain can focus on other stuff of some importance. 

Le Havre in a way is a forbearer of victory point salads and Caverna - games that think choices, no matter how irrelevant, are a good thing. Nope, they're the way consumers in today's capitalism are paralysed and taken advantage of. 

It's a game I can execute for a rate of 12 eur per hour. Look - this is work, not leisure time. The game works because you work.

Wow, after my first learning (and unfinished) game I'm really amazed. I didn't have extremely high expectations, I thought it will be less enjoyable than Agricola (longer time, higher complexity). My first impression is I like this better than Agricola, they are actually completely different games (I was a bit worried they will be too similar) and where Agricola feels limited in the choices, Le Havre feels abundant.
2010-06 - first game with more than 2p, actually a very long 4p game, all the other players played for the first time, all of them liked the game very much, there was no boredom during the 4 hours of play (including setup and rules explanation).

RATING: 6
Played twice with 3P. Le Havre is, by all accounts, a very strong design. The game is mainly about tracing the most efficient path to crank out the necessary resources, which are eventually shipped or used to construct buildings. Its expansive resource network contains various resources, each serving a niche role in the game.  

There are plenty of positive aspects here. The game gradually grows as wharfs get modernised and buildings built. Those who enjoy a game with strong strategy will be pleased as there are only minute amounts of luck involved, yet the arrangement of buildings guarantees that each game will feel different enough.

Despite all that though, it comes down to a matter of my preference in games. Constantly calculating the value of moves and converting resources are not my favourite activities in a game, and while I'll gladly participate in it for a 90-minute game, continuously doing so in a 3-hour long game stretches the concept of fun a little thin for me. And as the decision tree invariably grows along with the number of available buildings, downtime can become a pressing issue.

OK, I'm actually interested in trying this at least once more, although the playing time is a huge deterrence. (I have also purposefully avoided any comparisons to [thing=31260][/thing] as they have little in common, aside from being designed by the same person.)

[2 plays] 1st comments: This stands a chance to improve its rating to a 7 or an 8, but it would have to shine much brighter than the first play, and that isn't at all certain. Contrary to some other people's opinions, I found this denser, less thematic, more punishing, and far less pure "fun" factor than Agricola. I didn't enjoy the game beating up on me, I didn't like the cramped little board covered up so that you couldn't enjoy the already sparse artwork, I didn't find the mechanics that interesting, or the iconography helpful to understanding.

I didn't play smartly, so I will give it a chance again definitely.

Update after 2nd play:
Still like the theme and mechanics of Agricola much better, but I now have a better understanding and some respect for the design of this game. For me though, it just lacks a personality compared to Agricola.

My final thoughts on le havre 
Overall very good game, I would not play with 5. Maybe 4 but 3 is best. 
The components are ok,  The tiles are small, bigger tiles would have been better, better money quality would be nice. Someone can easily make a mistake or cheat by flipping tiles over.
The game is a little on the long side, maybe 14-15 round would have been good. 
I like that there is a lot of for you to do, many good choices. 
Now that I know how the game works I can have better strategy for the next game. (must focus on food, ships, iron and energy late in the game and buy good buildings) 
Outside our group my friends would never play this game, so this is not a game I would buy, but I would play agaom. overall I give it 8.5 out of 10.

IOS IPAD version

17/03/2013 Bit of a brain meltdown trying to get all the strategies of this one... Not sure at the moment, but willing to persevere for now.

UPDATE 14/04/2014

Not played this for nearly a year now, which probably tells you all you need to know on my feelings with this one...

If I had to rate this, it would be a 3 or 4 max!

This is best game of 2008, in my opinion.  Being somewhat of a Caylus zealot, I set the bar rather high when it comes to worker placement games, but Le Havre manages to deliver enough fresh elements well that I have become quite a fan of the game.

Very long. Very complicated. Players need to memorize cards to find out working combos. Its also unforgiving, which is not itself bad, but in this game it does not quite help because the game takes too long to play a few times just to get the hang on it.
Theme seems strangely implemented. Some elements are obviously carried over from Agricola and feel out of place (you have to feed your workers? Grain and cattle can be harvested?? You pay food to use ressources???)
I can see how this game would sit well with a group who does not mind long games, who likes complex analysis, who has no problem with inconsistent themes, and who plays often enough to really study the game. A game for *hardcore* Eurogamers. Thus not for me. For me it takes all the things that I did not like in Agricola and makes them even worse. On the positive side, Le Havre has made me like Agricola better than before - now I know that all the things I find slightly annoying could have been much much worse.

RATING: 8
It's an enjoyable game with a lot of strategy. It can be a bit long with more players, but I don't think it feels really long. It doesn't seem to drag to me. There always seems like there are great options available but determining the best one is part of the fun. I think it's pretty easy to learn too.

Le havre is an excellent game - with a shelf life.

A year into owning it, I don't see myself playing this very often in future. Certain strategies (coke/cows/bread shipping) are definitely dominant, and sadly the special buildings and other products do not provide a viable alternative for scoring winning amounts of VP.

That said, the plays we have gotten out of it have made it more than worth the purchase cost, and this is still something we break out occasionally as a two player or three player game.  

Update: We've recently started playing this again, using the variant where you have two specials built already at the start - its a small change, but it gives a chance of pursuing new strategies and for us, it's gotten the game to the table again :).

Maybe it's the buildings or the feeling that you can accomplish what you want before the game ends, but this game outclasses Agricola. If I get this, it may make said game expendable.

I like this a little more than Agricola because the goal is to accumulate money as opposed to creating a diverse farm.  I think the feeding mechanism plays out better as well which allows you to focus more on the economic issue, rather than spending half your turn trying to figure out your food mechanism.

Még egy top játékot kipipálhattam a Le Havre kipróbálásával. Sok véleményt olvastam róla, de ezektől teljesen függetlenítve magam ültem le játszani 2 másik játékossal. A rövidített változatot választottuk és nem túl gondolkodós 12 forduló alatt is sikerült a szabálykönyvben leírt két órát egy féllel megtoldanunk és a negyed-fél órás szabályismertetés után 3 óra alatt lejátszanunk a játékot. Azt kell mondanom a Le Havre-nak úgy néz ki ez az egyetlen hátránya az irgalmatlan hosszúsága. Bele se merek gondolni meddig tarthat egy öt fős, profi változat gondolkodós társaságban. A témája, kidolgozottsága jobban bejött, mint a szerző másik játéka, az Agricola esetében. A szabály meglepően egyszerű, a játékosok köreik elején a 8 alapanyagból 6-ból, plusz a pénzből választhatnak, amelyből körönként egy egyszerű metódus alapján mindig kétfajta töltődik eggyel. A játékos egy adott alapanyag vagy a pénz kiválasztásával mindet elviszi, ami addig ott töltődött, ahogy az Agricolában is van. Ezen túl épületeket vehetünk vagy építhetünk, amelyek használata számunkra ingyenes, játékostársaink számára bizonyos árért cserébe vehető igénybe. A játék hosszát főleg a fordulók adják, ugyanis minden körben a sok választható épület akciói közül mindössze egyet választhatunk, így tulajdonképpen annyira nem is félelmetes maga a játék gondolkodós része. Persze rengeteg a lehetőség, főleg, ha minden lehetséges épület leépült, de nagyon könnyen kizárható elég sok akció. A játékban lényegében nem sok út vezethet a győzelemhez, de az utak a sok alapanyag és az abból képezhető nyersanyagok miatt azért részeiben eltérnek. A sok forduló egyértelműen azért lett kitalálva, hogy minél kiegyenlítettebb legyen a játék. De én abszolút el tudom fogadni azt a véleményt, hogy ez már sok. Én kibírtam, sőt kimondottan élveztem is a játékot, bár a felénél úgy éreztem nem lesz esélyem a rossz helyzetemen lényegesen javítani, ez nem volt így. Jobb játékkal, akár vesztes helyzet is megfordítható a sok forduló alatt. Jó játék a Le Havre, igazából nagyon jó, komoly játékosoknak nagyon ajánlott, nem véletlen a pozíciója a BGG-n, talán meg is érdemli. Azonban a hossza miatt sokszor nem valószínű, hogy előkerül a legtöbb helyen. A játékot tulajdonképpen hibátlannak érzem mechanizmusok szempontjából, nagyon tetszik, hogy összesen 1 akciója van mindenkinek a körében, így 9 pontot érne a játék. 1 pont mínusz a hossza miatt.

[2013-04-15]
Végre sikerült egy teljes verziót játszanom a játékkal. Így már bőven van lehetőség különböző dolgokat megvalósítani, több utat kipróbálni. Továbbra is nagyon jó játéknak tartom, de a hossza miatt nem gyakran tud előkerülni.

[2017-08-28]
Végre kipróbálhattam 5-en a teljes verziót. A szabály 3 és fél órára saccolja így a játékidőt és meglepő módon bele is fértünk ebbe még úgy is, hogy két újoncunk volt és gondolkodtunk bőven. Ahogy korábban írtam, a teljesen reménytelen helyzet is javítható a sok forduló miatt, most is igaz volt. Másik játékos körében már lehet előre tervezni melyik akciót akarjuk választani, így rövidíthető a holtidő. Bátran ajánlom 5-en is. Emelek is a ponton.

This is the right amount of inspiration... As much as Le Havre is derivative of its predecessor [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing], it still shines on its own merits. Great resource management and engine building game.

I wish Uwe stopped replicating his own ideas at this point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really appreciate that Le Havre has a short and long form. Most of what gets cut out of the short form is a slow buildup of resources in the opening turns. The additional buildings available in the long form are fun, though. And the long form tends to give you a more satisfying final round or two where you're finally done scrambling for food and can really use the economic engine you've built for points. Both versions are worth playing, depending on time available.

RATING: 8
First Roseberg game we played.  The genius of this game is the flow of play - everything happens so naturally. even though it would be considered a heavy Euro, I feel we merely skimmed the rulebook (which is only a couple of pages long) before our first full run-through, after which we had a good handle on the mechanics.  Everything you need to know about what does what is on the relevant cards or components so there is no need to return to the rulebook.  VERY Well designed!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked this game, but there were SO MANY choices and so much to keep track of, I couldn't keep playing. It suffers from that problem where everyone playing needs to be equally versed in the buildings and costs, to maximize decisions. If you don't constantly think about every possible move, you're sunk. Traded.

If you like drafting and dealing with a bunch different cards with a ton of information on each one, then you might get some joy out of this.  In addition to having to know the true value of all the buildings (and all the buildings coming up), you need to learn how to get out of the food death spiral.  It seems that there is a big learning curve on this one.  

I think if you played this quite a bit it would become more rewarding.  You would know how everything works together, creating valuable combos, you would know how getting one building will aid in getting some other building later in the game, etc.  You would also know how to move away from wasting every single turn trying to feed.

Sometimes there aren't any worthwhile moves to make, often times there aren't any exciting ones.  The switch from cubes to chits gives the impression that there is more theme, but what you are actually doing with these themed items is rather dry and uninteresting. 

It is an engine game, so once you get behind the curve it is pretty tough to catch up, but this is exacerbated by the fact that all players must pay out the same amount every turn, so the players that are ahead aren't hit nearly as hard by the turn penalties as those that are behind.  That said, I can see being fascinated by the puzzle to get yourself out of the hole you start in and want to come back to the game to play more efficiently.

But that just is it.  It really is more a worky exercise in efficiency than anything fun to me. Really though, if this wasn't just a pure drafting game I might be more interested in playing this again (sometimes there is just nothing worthwhile to draft and others have great fortune in timing) as I can see playing with the engine could be fun.  

I am a little risk averse now though because at hour one I realized I was going to be spending another two hours solely in a mindless subsistence mode watching the other two players move ahead, actually making decisions on their turns. 

If I'm going to spend three plus hours on a game, I'd rather play something deeper and more rewarding and less processional like 18AL or just play Caylus and Agricola (the two better versions of this) back to back and have a much better time.

This game is a blast. 

Not only is the theme really unique and interesting, but the production value and artwork is really good too.  Though there are a lot of pieces, if you throw everything into a Plano tackle box it isn't a really big deal.

Your actions are limited, so you have to make them count. Planning wayyyyy ahead is a major part of the game.  And you have to make sure to have enough food at the end of each round.

This results in some really intense game play as you scramble to squeeze in your strategy into your actions and make them count!

Each game session is very different, even if you plan on executing the exact same strategy.  The unpredictability really keeps you on your toes. Every turn counts!

Much like in Agricola, I also appreciate that each game of Le Havre will be a little different because not all the cards are used in every game and this adds a bit of diversity to the strategies required.

my first true love.  considering the wealth of meaty decisions offered every turn, le havre is impressively simple to learn.  once you learn to read the language on the buildings there's not much to it.  take some stuff on offer or enter a building and do what's on the card.  such a clean design and i quite enjoy the inviting clever artwork.

I quite enjoyed playing this game solo. It took me about an hour to set up and learn the rules but going forward I think I could teach this one pretty quickly. Seems like 3 might be the optimal number for this game but its going to take upwards of 3 hours. Fun hybrid of Agricola and Caylus. I like the fact that there are only 36 buildings and 5 types of ships. Not as steep a learning curve as Agricola and cuts down on the randomness as you always know what cards are coming out in the standard deck. Makes for more planning. I also like how you can switch from taking resources to leveraging a building in town or owned. My one point of confusion was around build vs. buy. [Edit: I played it wrong. Buildings and ships can built OR bought. Looks like I ended up with way more points than I thought!] Looking foward to another pass at this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played the once with 4p, took a while, but was enjoyable. So many options on where and how to play, simple enough concept, either take resources from an ever increasing pool, or use a building (once build or purchased) from yourself or another player to attempt to increase your money pool, with the ultimate aim to sell goods by shipping it. All players were new first time, so probably slowed the game down, but the myriad choices definitely was a brain burner

Has taken over from Power Grid in my view as the crème de la crème of the board game world. This is exactly the kind of game I like: long-ish, meaty, economic without needing an XL spreadsheet to work out what do to (contrast with Container!) and a huge number of different strategies one can pursue. A good selection of buildings which you can build or even buy, the timing of the arrival of which varies with each game - and some random special buildings too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Pretty fun, but there seems to be just one general strategy path with all of the players competing along it. I wish there were more paths to victory, and I wish each given building card were used more often. Other than that, it's a great game! (It has a very different feel to it than Agricola.)

Le Havre is easily my favorite Uwe Rosenberg game. It's a resource management game with no less than 16 resources to manage. Resources can be used to build buildings, as food, as energy or to be sold for money.
Le Havre biggest strenght is it's simple turn structure: either take some resources or use a building. Downtime is kept to an absolute minimum in this game, which is remarkable as it's a very deep game.
Interaction is indirect where you can take stuff another player needs or keep blocking a building to mess up someone's timing.
Like Agricola, there is a need to feed your crew but with Le Havre it's not as restricted. It doesn't warp your gameplay decisions too much. Sure, you have to pay attention to it, but you can still mainly focus on your big plan.
Another great feature is that it offers a short and a long game and for the first time the short game feels challenging in it's own right. Of course, I prefer the long game where there are more building interactions in play, but the short game doesn't feel stripped down at all. It is a good way to learn the game or to play when you don't have time or energy to play the long game.
Be warned, the game is very fiddly and you have to come up with a storage solution. The game wants you to put all resources on the board which makes it a giant mess. I use a big plano box instead.
The game feels very thematic and all the resource conversions make sense. Especially in the long game the interactions get a lot of fun. Yes, I'd like to sell sandwiches with smoked fish or build furniture with wood and leather. All of a sudden the tier 2 resources can become a viable strategy.

RATING: 10
Better than Agricola, although this just means its a great game, but not my #1.  I like the shipping theme a lot more than farming (although I will admit that the theme is thinner in this one), and it's really cool how you can turn resources into finished goods.  The number of actions stays constant, but I think it's slightly less tight than Agricola, making it tense without being frustrating and also avoiding the disappointing feeling you get in Agricola at the end where you feel that you're finally able to get somewhere but too bad the game is over.  I also give it high marks for player interaction, since you use (and block) other players' buildings.  The only downside is that it is a bit on the longer side.

UPDATE: While this game does seem to take quite a while, I do really enjoy it more and more as I feel it's a series of interesting tactical decisions and adaptation of your plan.  This is among my top games at this point.

UPDATE #2: It just continues to get better and better with age and in my opinion, it is Rosenburg's magnum opus.

Too fiddly and too long. Also, it suffers by comparison to Agricola. Le Havre might offer more choices and more depth, but Agricola is deep enough for me. And because there are fewer choices in Agricola, there's more importance and more tension on each one. Everyone has to care about what everyone else is doing. Consequently, Le Havre lacks some of the narrative and sense of accomplishment of its older brother. It's also tedious in the same way as Through the Ages. Fans of one will likely enjoy the other. I need a better reason to play than the challenge of optimization through resource conversion.

After game 3:

* Loans are OK, but more important is to have free food/coins to spend on visiting others.
* Its great to sell all your resources in a sequence of shipments - just make sure you don't end up selling junk.
* Buying the bank for 40 is not worth it.
* Steel (and Coke) is the most important resource. Get it from the start.
* Buy only steel ships - the iron ships are not worth the steel.

After game 2:

Brilliant game. Strategy - get the marketplace + 4 'home' buildings, and start collecting stuff, plus don't bother with food - take loans.

Won the game by shipping loads of stuff, but surprisingly Doron was too close with buying the later, more expensive buildings and ships.

Next time: Get loads of steel.

A great worker placement resource management game! Play time is somewhat long, but you feel engaged the entire time -- it seems to move right along! A little less frustrating than Agricola and some other games, as you can often benefit from several actions (you don't need THAT particular one that the player before you just STOLE from you!!) -- the challenge is in figuring out how to make the most efficient plays.

Better than Agricola, but that isn't saying much. A prototypical Euro -- create an engine that generates good X and eventually you can turn that into good Y and eventually you an turn that into VPs. I found keeping track of the action slots on other player's playing areas tedious to remember.

At first I was afraid, even petrified... but this game is amazing.  I'm hesitant to compare it to Puerto Rico, as Le Havre is vast and unwieldy vs. PR's simple elegance, but I suspect Le Havre will nevertheless eclipse PR as a go-to game amongst my heavier gaming buddies.

Simply stunning design.  Let's see if it holds up over dozens of plays!  This may become another '10' rating...

I usually like games where you're "building your engine" and Le Havre is interesting because the decisions are intriguing but the heart of the game isn't difficult to learn.  I think I like it better than Agricola because the scoring is more intuitive and it's easier to understand (though still difficult to master I'm sure).  Almost rated an eight after initial play, but I'll give it room to grow :)

I really like this game, it is a well-balanced, exciting worker placement game with a decent amount of depth that should bring with it a good amount of strategy.  Unfortunately, there are just so many outstanding worker placement games out there right now that this inevitably gets compared to them and that's where I find the biggest problem with this one.  There isn't enough variety to keep people from "solving" the game (in this case ship steel and coke) and to keep the game exciting through many plays.

But Le Havre is still an excellent game and for the occasional play (especially against newer players who haven't "solved" it and with whom you can try new interesting and fun strategies) I can't help but really enjoy it.

I really wanted to like this more, but I seemed to be missing something in the strategy of this game. I felt like I couldn't get the combos of different actions to chain to my advantage. I hope another play or two will help me decided whether I really like this game or not.

BestWith:3>2>4_not5. Never play with 5. Also Have: 12 Le Havre Special Building Cards (2008). Someone suggested to avoid having the Wind Farm in play.

Notes to Self: Recommendations by others to remove Special Buildings:
Remove from Solo Game, either because the buildings are intended to be interactive, or because they are overpowered in Solo mode: 014 Harbour Watch; 035 Zoo; 041 Pirates' Lair; 043 Dive Bar; 044 Picket Line; 045 Tobacco Factory; 046 Cattle Drive.
Remove generally (any player count) if you find buildings that encourage aggressive tactics annoying: 041 Pirates' Lair; 043 Dive Bar; 046 Cattle Drive.

I love Le Havre.  At first, I felt that it was trying to be another Agricola, but now I realize it's much more.  There are so many choices, and I'm still learning the ins and outs of the game.  This will not be getting old for me any time soon.

Muy buen juego, muy denso y largo, pero de gran elegancia, lo que pasa es que la gran cantidad de opciones puede abrumar a los jugadores menos habituales 

jugado a 2 jugadores y que por cierto funciona muy bien.

A 3 se sufre bastante más, creo que a 4 debe de ser muy angustioso

creo que es mejor a 2 y 3

Played with 4 players
I admit that this is a good game but it takes too much long and it's very repetitive. It's a very deep and strategic game and I like that. I supose that this rate could improve but I have to test it with fewer players. Maybe 3 players.

edit:
Played with 3 players and again with four. This time the pace of the game was much more interesting because players were familiar to the game. It improved a lot. I now know that I prefer this game with 4 players because although we have less actions than with 3, the truth is that the demanding for food is much more balanced allowing players to do different things. 

I still think the game is a bit too repetitive and long but it improved a lot. By now I really think I like to play it and that I should do so more often.

After a few more plays, I really like Le Havre. At first I didn't get it but after playing it with more care I realized that this is a very good game with lots of difficult things to combine as decisions to make: what building to build, when to build or buy, how to get food... always different decisions because the way buildings are organized makes each game a unique game and so does the way players play the game.

More aggressive play happens after players know the game better and best buildings are known. Being the butcher seems to work pretty fine and learning the exact timing of when to take a supply turn or an action turn is a key issue to success. 
I like to play it as a 2 player game too. Maybe it's how it works better because it doesn't have any down time and the number of actions per turn is much more interesting in order to make things workable as a small economy.

A better game than 'Agricola' IMO. Although my son would disagree ;)

Far more options and replayability... and pretty much a perfect 2 player game.

Cracker. Long version, short version, don't care. Just really like playing this one. It feels like Agricola but with options. 

Sainsbury's storage solution will help with set-up times, if not aesthetic values!

RATING: 7
Hmm. Is this the game that's going to make me like Caylus? First impressions not so great - The actions / building connections are not as intuitive as Agricola plus there is loads more of them, AP will be a problem. The actions are simple it's just the possibilities seem limitless. Feels far heavier than the 'Gric and not one i'm likely to try with non-gamers. Quite possible that i'm comparing with Agricola which is unfair.
2nd game impressions  - and like it a lot. Lots of very difficult choices, never quite enough resources, food requirement provides tension. 
The semi-random way the buildings come up gives the game great variety (and challenge) in the game experience - perhaps more so than Agricola.
1 4 Player game to pscore 160 (wharfs did not turn up early). Next 4 players game wharfs built early and top score 237. It's a lomg game but little downtime and feels far quicker than its 3 hour play time. My wife prefers this to Agricola.
The more i play the more i like. Agricola with specialisation and everyone having access to the same special actions. The timing of the wharfs being built combined with the special buildings determines the direction of the game.

Huge variety in the way the game evolves. 

Progressing up the exponential arc of the game feels like tightrope walking - a wobble means you spend a lot of precious time regaining balance. The game requires patience, its very easy to overextend in mid game with what seems a good build, only to find its too early.

Nothing in 2009 or 10 (August) has bettered Le Havre. Ditto July 2011. 

ipad version. Lovely interface AI not great but I enjoy trying out new things against the 'pad.

My favorite game, and the greatest game ever invented.  I would rate this above a 10 if possible.  After many plays, mostly 3-4 players, a few 5, one 2 and several solo, I have come to the conclusion that the game is best with 4.  OK so it isn't my favorite game anymore but it is still in my top 5.  Also I think I like it better with 3 now.

I wondered whether I'd just been caught up in the hype when I bought this.  It stayed on the shelf awhile.  When it finally came down, we were pleasantly surprised.

 I see what the hype is about; but the game is a little bit overwhelming and I have trouble thinking that anybody in my play group would want to play it enough for it to really shine.  Maybe it is because of my first play, but I really do not like not having a market where goods can be traded.  It does take too long to play.  I can see the play time being significantly reduced on future plays, but in order to be even marginally competitive, you need to plan for minimum 4 actions ahead, which takes some time and way to much concentration.

I generally like worker placement type games.  I used to like them more, and I suppose my interest in them is slowly waning.  Le Havre is quite complex in the options you have in what action to take in any given turn which to me is a big plus.  However Im finding that Id rather play one of several other games in my collection before this one, so I cant give it a 9, 8 is a good score as far as I am concerned though, and I very much recommend it.

Awesome worker placement game. Lots of angst trying to get everything you want to do done. Numerous paths to victory, along with a varied card mix makes this a fun and different experience each game. I really like that while feeding your workers is necessary and it's important to get ships or an engine to feed them, the penalty for not having enough now to do so isn't back breaking like it is in Agricola.

Side note - Having storage trays with lids that are shaped to fit on the board during game play make set up and clean up a breeze. Without these, it is tedious.

Uwe Rosenberg has developed several great games but I do like Le Havre most of them. It can be played with every gamer count from 1 to 5 and the down times between your actions are very short. My experience is that good players often have very close games, often only seperated by a handful of points even the final score is well above 250.

After my second play, I don't think it's that good after all. I played the shortened version with two. It was both too long and too short: we played pretty fast, but it took an hour anyway. But it still felt very unsatisfying. Most of the buildings hadn't been used at all, and we were mostly busy getting enough food. Steel and cokes never entered play, not did we manage to ship goods.

I think Le Havre tries to do too much. Lots of different buildings to use, but too little time to explore even a substantial part of them. So even when you play a couple of games of the full version, it's still hard to grasp what might be meaningful strategies.

Despite all its rough edges, sameness and imbalances, I vastly prefer Agricola over Le Havre. Compared with Agricola, Le Havre just feels... redundant. 

--------
One play, not finished. I liked this better than anticipated. The obvious game to compare this with is Agricola, with which it has many similarities. Le Havre is both more gamey and smoother. Individual turns and rounds are over rather quickly, unless you have some serious AP players. Half a game is not remotely enough to see some strategies. Looking forward to my next play.

Initial impression is, that despite its big complexity this is very neatly balanced game. No idea, how Uwe manages to design such complex games with  a bundle of possibilities and still keep the balance... but he did it again! Fine work!
After the first introductory games you should begin to know the ~ 45 building-cards (which are by the way the same in each game - with the exception of special buildings) and go ahead developing a "master plan". No master plan, no victory points. There is quite a lot of end-game strategies and the earlier in the game, you start designing your strategie around one of them, the better! You should have a close look at what the plans of the other players are and adjust your strategy accordingly.
A lot of interaction, nice game mechanics, a huge bundle of strategies to explore, easy access, smooth learning curve = it all sums up to a very big potential for a new star!
Yes - if you really need to, compare it to Agricola. But the strongest reason for comparing is, that both games were designed by Uwe (which is a quality indicator itself). Indeed, both games play very differently and give a unique game-experience, so it is rather hard to compare them. Anyway, if you love Agricola, you will most probably love LeHavre. Because of the good time it gives you and its rewarding of deliberate strategies.

One of my "Must-Buy"s at Essen!

I get what they are trying to do with this game, and it is a logical progression from Agricola, which I enjoy. However... I feel there is too heavy a reliance on the buildings, and too many of those, so many plays would be required to get past the analysis-paralysis phase and to make moves more obvious. It probably doesn't help that I'm playing on my iPhone which has a tiny screen and no humans!

Overall, it just doesn't grab my imagination like Agricola does.

RATING: 6.5
A very good turning stuff into other stuff (and, eventually, points) game with a long enough arc to allow for genuine strategy and strategic variation. There's some fun room for tactical screwage, too.

Newbies should expect to be thrashed by experienced players.

The biggest obstacle to my play is that I think it needs very regular play to really work: it's harder or slower or both unless all players know what every building does and understand how resource requirements change. Since I tend to be a gamer of the "many games, each played infrequently" variety, this is a high obstacle to play.

Also, good as it is, I think it is strictly worse than Ora et Labora, which feels like a more refined version of the same idea: a more elegant resource system, an additional spatial element, and perhaps more balanced strategies. I don't think I would ever choose to play Le Havre instead.

It smells [gameid=31260] but it is a lot better -- at last for me. The game has all the mechanics compressed, more intesive, the gamplay (comparing to Agricola) has been a bit reworked in Caylus style, making Le Havre a lot better game -- more intense, faster, with easier to estimate final result scoring system. Best of the best of the best.

Edit: It stopped returning to table, interest faded away... traded away. Despite this, I still consider this game a real masterpiece.

Difficult and long material-manipulation game.
Strategies are not so clear on first games as you don't know all the buildings and their effects.
But... It's a game with a lot of difficult decisions as you'll usually take 2 actions during a full round and you'd make so many thing that is impossible to calculate at prior.
Last game I won building an impressive stockpile of Coke. Yeeeeee!!!!
It's the natural evolution of Caylus. Owning Building, using Building, paying for using, incremental number of buildings, ecc.

RATING: 7.5
[Lookout Games 08 edition with 12 bonus cards] {Economic; resources-management, variable-building-powers, loans; optimal 2-4p} {Short Game 7, Full Game 8} Le Havre is a nicely designed economic game.  It's thematic and very interactive.  The building mechanic is similar to Caylus; but it's slightly lighter.  It's multifaceted. There are multiple paths of winning: ship building, goods trading/shipping, special building, etc.  Players have to carefully plan in advance due to limited number of actions and resources.  They also have to adjust the plan wisely, esp. with the Special Building cards.  Resources are really tight (similar to Agricola) and players have to use their resources wisely!  Replayability seems good with the various combinations of building cards.

There is down-time between turns; esp. as the game progresses and more buildings become available.  It's quite unforgiving, if a player planned poorly and cannot sustain a good resource income, he's essentially out of the game.  It also feels a bit repetitive - 20 rounds may be too much.  The hidden special buildings could affect the game plan quite much.  It may annoy hardcore players who prefer perfect-information. 

In all, it's a good game but it's too long for 4/5 players.

The illustration is colorful and cute.  I like it.  The production quality is quite good.  Nonetheless, there are some usability problems. Firstly, the dual face of each counter may lead to confusion when a player hits the table, etc.  Secondly, the iconography on the cards is not intuitive enough; I need to refer to the rulebook to understand their meaning.  Thirdly, they should provide an insert to hold the components.

Lastly! my box arrived severely damaged.  The box cover is crumbled heavily and split.  Even the board and markers are crumbled!  I am very sad.

A very interesting brain-burner that has some definite similarities but is distinct enough to be judged on its own worth and not as any sort of copycat or revamp.  Seriously agonizing decisions to be made due to a severe shortage of actions.  Just as in many other games--including Agricola and Through the Ages--there is simply not NEARLY enough time to do what you want, so you have to make due with what you can.  Lots of potential for min/maxing your moves, which makes me wary; that sort of game tends to lead to SEVERE AP problems, the like of which put me off of Caylus to a large extent.  But hopefully people can learn to plan their turns ahead of time--it seems like downtime could become a serious problem otherwise in a many-playered game.  Still, some really neat mechanics going on and a nice, satisfying feeling of having built an economy by the end.  It may be too long for me to want to play often, but I enjoyed my first game of it.

Not very accessable at the beginning. I definitely recommend playing solitaire for starters, then upgrade to 2 and 3 player games.
Starting with 4 or even 5 players is NOT recommended. You absolutely need to familiarize yourself with the game before playing it with that many players.
Playing time (especially downtime) will decrease A LOT with experience.

This rating is based on how much I enjoyed it -- not a criticism of the design.

Le Havre is the kind of game that I no longer have any patience for. Tons of cards with tiny writing laid all over the table. Can you say OPTION OVERLOAD? If this is your thing, and you don't mind asking the fellow on the other side of the table to "please tell me what those twenty cards over there do because I can't read them from here" then this is the game for you.

One play. The game works well and it is a little better than Agrcola and Calyus but not much.  I still have the issue with worker placemnt dis-allowing other players from using the building.  It stops the abilty of long term planning that I like in games.  I do not like the "do the best with what you got" mechanic.  This is better than agricola becasue at least you get something when a person is using your building, but that only makes it slightly better

A hint of Agricola, a sprinking of Caylus. Having tried 3-, 4- & 5-player, I'd prefer 3, since 5 gives you so few actions between harvests. These early plays have lasted quite long, yet didn't seem to drag; the 3-player game, in particular felt snappier than Agricola. The fact that specialisation is rewarded much more than in Agricola is a big plus.

First off, I love any game that is legitimately fun solo.

Second, I can't remember the last game that I wanted to play again as badly after first play(s).

Constant planning (tactics and strategy), variable game play, variable paths to victory, beautiful components, borrows well from Agricola (and many others) while producing several subtle and elegant innovations (love the ships, love the way the building stacks are done, love the buying/building/selling of buildings).

Different feel from Agricola too which was a definite concern going in.  I think I like it better, time will tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Reminds me of a mix between Agricola (for the upkeep cost of food, the resource collecting, and worker placement part) mixed with Caylus (for the building / purchase of buildings and people using those having to pay the owner of the building). Although I don't like it as much as Agricola, mainly due to the near openness of player information, I still think it is a great game.

UPDATE: After playing it a few dozen times the game definitely feels samey. The randomness in the initial distribution, good locations, and special buildings isn't usually enough to make the gameplay varied. Some special buildings can really mix it up, but those feel far and few between. Wish there was more replayability here, but it is still a great game.

NOTE: This review is for solo only!!! Never played multiplayer!
Overall, from my own game experience, plus reading the forums, there doesn't seem to be a lot of variety in what you can do in the solo game. I've played it a few times and found myself constantly scrambling for food and never being able to actually accomplish anything. Having read the forums, I found out my problem was the focus on food. However, most everyone seems to be in general consensus on what the best solo strategy is and now that I know that, the game just seems dead to me. Since I was looking at this largely for solo play, I doubt I'll ever get a copy.

(2010-12-12) I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It looks like a resource euro, but plays similar to a card game (like RftG). 

Update (2016-02-09) With only one worker per player and with buildings having non-accumulating effects, most of the options in the game are really just false choices. This leads to a strict dominance of coal/steel strategies in the endgame. It's not a total loss - there are still tactical choices to be made at any given time - but it sure takes off a lot of the shine off this game. Sold and rating goes down to 6.5

I hate this game, but I do respect it's design.  I can't stand games where you get something, turn it into something else, and then use it.  That's what Le Havre is all about.  So many little pieces and so much fiddliness.  Maybe this one is just too heavy for me, but I found it anything but fun.

RATING: 10
Outstanding worker-placement Euro. The gameplay is extraordinarily simple, you either choose to take goods from an ever increasing supply from the board, or you construct a building with the goods you have already acquired. Each building is unique and once built they provide means for collecting more goods, upgrading goods, or selling goods. Victory points are accumulated through the money you have amassed and the value of the buildings you own. This is such a strategic game and the paths one can take to success are numerous as the number of buildings and options increases greatly throughout the game. The balance of play is flawless, which makes 'Le Havre' one of the finest games ever made.

Excellent game with few turns for so many options.  It makes for a very tight, almost restricting feel.  It took me three rounds to implement turning six iron into six steel and then another three rounds to do what I had planned to do with the steel.  With its lengthiness, it won't hit the table often, but when it does I'll certainly vie for a seat.

Played once.  Wow! That really is superb.  The action-action-feed mechanic is brutal and just keeps ramping up the whole game.  There's lots of options and it's lots of fun to play.  My brain was ready to eat it self by the end of the game.  I believe I like Agricola better because of the slightly softer feeding curve. **UPDATE** one of the first games I'm actually considering not getting because of the length (because other people have it and because I have Agricola).  This is strange, because I generally don't mind long games. Maybe my rating has room to move down? Want to play more! 2009/02/26

I've played the digital (iOS) version only. I easily have over 50 plays on my iPhone.

This game really surprised me. I knew it was a great game, but I wasn't sure if I would like it due to the worker placement component that I tend to shy from and the dryer theme I wasn't super thrilled about. Boy, am I glad I gave it a try. Each turn is based with difficult decisions, that all lead to a different positive outcome. There's no "bad" moves, just some moves are better than others and it's a great puzzle trying to solve which is which. 

The more I play this game, the better it gets. New cards provide a fresh experience, while playing with different numbers of opponents also changes the game and strategy.

Interesting game, clearly descendant of Agricola: you build up an engine by using buildings and try to be 'ready' for the food collection round, much like Agricola.

The differing gameplay comes from the fact that you can buy these buildings instead of only use them. To me, this doesn't make the game better, as it seems to add another layer of unnecessary complexity to the Agricola system. It potentially adds a lot of Analysis Paralysis to the game, though it ups replayability. However, with all its small and big expansions, Agricola has no problems with that either...

As I own both, but Agricola has nicer components and is more family friendly, I can't see this hitting the table a lot.

Wow.  The toy box of Eurogames.  I really have enjoyed my first plays of this.  The food issue is irrelevant by the middle of the game leaving you to ponder the path of how you are gonna get rich.  The piles of chits and ways to use them is mind boggling.  I was surprised by how open wide your options became during the game.  Hopefully my wife will endure through it's length to make it a keeper.  2.5 hours for our first full game.

update : We play this in a little over an hour now.  I see patterns developing but I will purposely force the change by acquiring things I wouldn't usually.  I think this throws my wife off quite a bit.

A hit with the SO. While I enjoy also, reserving final judgment til more plays. Seems like I ran away with the victory in each of our first three games simply by having more ships. A "7" for now.

Update: upgraded to an 8. Am finding a bit more depth here, though I still enjoy Agricola more. This tends to drag a little long for us, and feels more repetitive than what Agricola offers with its wider variety of cards. Wish more special buildings came out in the 2p game (though I also wish there were more 2p occupations in Agricola as well). Still, very good game that is seeing a lot of play right now.

Excellent resource management game, with a variable action limits mechanic.  First person in a turn gets the most action limits, and this first person mechanic moves clockwise so that everyone at the table gets 3 actions in a given turn, if I recall correctly.  Endless variety of ways to win, in regards to how you use your resources.   Simple game, easy to set up but does take a stretch of time to complete, with our group usually setting on about 3 hours to play.  I'd recommend this game if you have the time.

After one play, I am quite enamored with this game. I stayed away for a number of years because I saw comments saying it was too similar to Agricola, and that the building camping aspect was too mean. Wow, what a mistake. This game stands solidly on its own feet. The puzzle is interesting, the resources plentiful, and buildings make great thematic sense - like how cows are turned into meat and hides. Very cool.

I gave to its weight factor a provocatory 5 because it is too complex for its "nature". I felt a kind of stress during the game which I think it is not necessary. It has not original mechanics and could be made better than it is designed. Cards are terrible and could be designed in a better way to improve the feeling of "reading" the game and understanding the best strategy for your moves. This game need to be practised a lot before it can captures you, I think, and in my opinion I have not so much time for it.

Pretty similar worker placement game to all the others that have come out lately. 

I liked the game alright, but I've had no desire to play it again after the initial play.  I think Agricola is still better than this one, because the sheer variety in the card draw makes it that way.  This one has no variety.  It is also very long, more players is more long.  Agricola has the same problem too.

I read the rules and figured I would enjoy it - which I did.  There were lots of agonizing decisions and I was always wishing I had two people to work with instead of just one.

It starts out quick but by the end of the game there are so many buildings out the turns can take a while as you weigh your decision.  This game is optimal at 3 players - I would hesitate to even play with 4.

Repeated plays have lowered it a bit.

Quite complex game. At the end of the first game I tought that I should have planed something in advance to be able to get more victory point at the end.

Because of the complex resource management you always have to plan 4-5 steps in advance.

I would categorize this game as being a "you have to do everything by yourself". Nothing is done for you automatically.

I am quite bad at these complex games so I feel motivated to exercise it more.

Feels like a more complicated version of Caylus. You get resources and spend them to build stuff. Players own stuff they build and when other players place their worker there, the owner usually gets something. Did not find the 3-building-availability a good thing though - this is a game that requires you to play at least once to get a feel over what buildings are in the game, and hence what resources are good to accumulate. Nice idea of flipping resource chits to "process" them.

I really like the diversity and distinctness of the resources in this game -- wood has completely different uses than cattle, etc.  

A few things hold it back for me.  Firstly, the game has the same flow each game;  build buildings early, then transition into getting ships, then get steel and coke, then liquidate everything.  Secondly, the resources are the same for each player in every game (contrast with Agricola where the occupations and improvements give different ways to use resources to each player).  Thirdly, the endgame requires more strict planning than the rest of the game.  You need to know how many actions you have left, and what the best way is to get rid of everything.

I like everything else enough that I happily accept those issues I have!

A tough and slick worker placement game that definitely requires a few plays to fully understand. The available buildings really depend on the number of players and the game feels quite different when playing with two vs three or four.

Update: The learning curve is not as bad as I thought! Especially with a great opponent like V. I had to learn so I can keep up. Lots of choices, needs long term planning and just a bit of reacting to other players' choices. Rating: 9 (which might go up).

Le Havre is at the limit of complexity for me. It is a very good game, it just feels like a lot of work. I hope my enjoyment will increase as I play more games.

I first played [thing=31260][/thing] nearly 10 years ago and it is one of my favorite Euros.  Somehow, I didn't get a chance to play [thing=35677][/thing] until now.  In many ways, Le Havre is a classic [person=10][/person] game.  Worker placement, getting various resources, feeding your people, etc.  There are a few key differences though:

1) You only have one worker.  I really liked the simplicity of this.  Blocking other players has always been one of my lower-ranked qualities of worker placement games, so this mechanic creates less blocking (which I like).  But, you also don't [i]have to[/i] move your worker, so there is still the opportunity to lock down an action if you want to.

2) The resources have basic versions and advanced versions.  Fish become smoked fish, clay becomes brick, etc.  Simple concept that was executed nicely in Le Havre.

3) Turn order varies randomly, but so does the number of actions you get per round.  There are 7 total turns per round and the first player changes, so your number of actions depends on the player count and who the first player is.  We played with 4 and I didn't like the fact that you would on occasion get only 1 action.  But with 2 or 3 players, you would instead on occasion get an extra action.

In my one play I focused on a shipping strategy because that seemed to be the goal of the game.  I felt like I did pretty well, but my opponent that went for a building strategy completely annihilated everyone else.  Also, we got a few minor rules wrong.  Now that I understand the strategy a bit and understand the rules, I need to give this another try (preferably with 2 or 3).  I don't foresee this passing [thing=31260][/thing] for me, but I think it is my second favorite Rosenberg game.

RATING: 7.3
I'm not a big fan of how forgiving this game is, how lacking in direction and how plentiful resources are. It lacks that crunchy, tense feel that I like in a lot of mid to heavy euros. A lot of euros I'm excited about the process, and have a plan of attack or a feel for what I want to do; while I can do that to a degree in Le Havre, I sometimes feel like I am wandering aimlessly through the game. And perhaps that is what makes it accessible to gamers who usually shy away from euros like this. 

Having said that though, there is quite a bit I do like about Le Havre. I like the buildings, the 'feed your people' mechanism which does provide some tension and constraint, and the theme. There are some unique elements to it, and I do enjoy decisions such as when to build buildings and what, and particularly when it is worth sucking it up and using your opponent's buildings. Knowing your opponent will have to use yours is always nice. 

I think Le Havre is a great game, but just doesn't quite hit my buttons like I want it to. But still a joy to play.

The first play was burdened with some mistakes with rules. I can still see there's a rather good game underneath, although it might be a tad too long. We'll see.

Edit: Three plays in and we are still to play the long game. It feels like the shorter game is just the right length and I feel I don't want to bother with the longer one since the game itself doesn't develop into anything, it pretty much stays the same from start to finish.

I know it's an economic game. I recently got to play this against the girlfriend. She actually likes it a lot. While she didn't win (even after making several great choices and causing me to give her the stink eye a few times,) she wants to play it again. Will have to see about getting a 3 player game of this going down the line hopefully.

Like Agricola, I'm not such a huge fan of this game as the geek community at large seems to be. I find that both games lack a certain elegance in the mechanics which is common to really good Euro-games. Of the two, however, I'd pick Le Havre over Agricola every time. If the game didn't take so long I'd like it a lot more, but with so many shorter games that provide an equal or greater amount of fun, I don't think this is ever likely to be in my top 10.

Billed as a cross between Agricola and Caylus, I don't like Le Havre as well as either of those titles. On the plus side, this is very simple to teach and presents players with tons of options and tough decisions. On the downside, the game is a bit too long and a tad fiddly (using cards with tiny symbols that sit in front of the other players is the most blatent example of this). My rating may go up a bit over time, and I think Le Havre may have some staying power, but I don't envision this ever becoming a real favorite or hitting the table on a regular basis. Update: I enjoy Le Havre much better as a two-player game. It's still a bit fiddly, but it moves along at a much better clip and has some real depth with two players. Rating revised upward to 8 based on Le Havre at a two-player affair. With more, I'd rate it lower. Updated update: Rated as a 9 now, but again almost entirely on its strength as a two-player game.

Go is my favorite game , well, Le Havre is the second. I really enjoy playing it. In my opnion is the most elegant eurogame that I 've played. It is both tactical and strategic. Chance is perfectly controlled. It is a challenging game but not has prevented me from starting a lot of people to eurogames. It seems far superior to Agricola that even being good game seems overrated. Le Havre is demanding and every game a different feel without losing its intensity.

Great game. Similar to Agricola yet sufficiently different to have a completely different playing experience. And yet again, my daughter (barely) won with me...

Of course this happened because I lost a lot of concentration when explaining the rules... :)

After a few plays: getting better and better. The amount of possibilities, especially in later rounds is staggering and makes the game superior to "A".

OH, yeah, that's some good gaming. If you enjoy meaty economic games with somewhat low interaction, this is your game. Better than Agricola - more variation between games, more options each turn, less blocking of good things to do. Theme is a little blah and fairly incoherent, although still more interesting to me than an Agricola farmstead.

Playing with others definitely changes the game. So many things to do, so many mouths to feed, but so few actions. This game should work great 2 or 3 player, but 4 might be pushing it. I will not even try it with 5. You get tons of cardboard for your money, a fairly straightforward game with lots of tough decisions to be made. Set up time can be a bit much, but if you get storage containers for the goods, it should be manageable. Player aid/mat is a very nice addition and a great way of sorting the goods. I bought extra Settlers of Catan buildings to be placed on a building that you have built so the building cards can remain in the middle of the table so that everybody can be able to read them and easily access them. It worked really well in the one game played with them. If you're looking for a brain burner, this is an awfully good one.

La Havre is clean, refreshing, substantive, and satisfying.  Instead of being forced to pick the least lousy choice from a short list of bad choices, La Havre gives you a world of options each turn that only grows longer as the game progresses.  Oddly, the result feels lean because it doesn't cramp your style.

Solid to good economic engine game, that misses out on theme. You do stuff but you have no clue as to why and what you resemble in the game. 

Who do you have to supply with food and why? In Agricola that is clear.^Farmer family that has to support itself, but here. I don't know

Still, a game that shows a continous streak or with which you can build a continous streak of buildings by the waterside is something an original Port town boy can't miss out on. 

Update: It's fiddly and the theme is rather vague, but I like it. Upgraded to 8

Tried a solo-variant, which is a complete waste of time to my mind. It's a real bore, I mean really. No tension, no scarcity. That however won't change my mind about how nice this game is with a few contenders.

Racing to be the most successful (i.e. richest) shipping magnate in Le Havre, France. Many paths to take to making the most money (i.e. points), and it's not about scarcity as much as it is about wealth. 

I find the game is a little too long, and after several plays it doesn't quite have the variety of experience I was hoping for.

The length of the game is reduced in the iPad version, and matters less anyway, as you can play asynchronously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
ONE PLAY--SOLO.  Tough to say how I feel about Le Havre yet.  There is a ton more going on in the game than you might gather on the first reading of the rules.  At least my brain sure was swimming.

After a second play, in which 3 of us only got half through in 3 hours, this is a long game.  It takes a long time to get going, and once it gets going, it can become a bit rote.  After all buildings are bought, it is merely a race for shipping and feeding.  

But for some reason, it is a tremendous game in spite of factors that would normally kill a game for me.  Its scope is too large, and there are so many steps to go through to get to where you want to go.  Now, I will readily admit that I suppose real life shipping and dock work is likely much the same way.  But c'mon, this game really makes a player work for what they get.  Is that entertainment?  Is that why we play games?  

The reason to play Le Havre is the sheer challenge of it--to see who can be the most effective businessman.  There are several reasons that I like this game--shared buildings, the accumulating resources, resource management.  And there are several reasons that I hate it--length of game, lack of a compelling theme, mechanicalness of it all.  

But in the end, I find myself thinking about it long after I play.  It is a rare game that can cause that to happen.

FURTHER UPDATE:  Starting to feel a bit rote to me.  Each game plays differently, but man, it can really descend into the depths of the ultra-mechanical.  The last several rounds simply become go-here, convert-this, go-here, convert-this, head to the shipping yard, do it all over again ad nauseum.  It really can become extremely cyclical and, because it takes quite awhile (I don't care who you are, the listed time frames are way out of whack.  They might work for someone who has played this game many many times.  Might.) that is not a good thing.  

I still like it, but I do think that it is overrated, a criticism I had previously only given Race for the Galaxy.  It takes a long time to play.  It can be very very mechanical and soul-less.  

If you like competitive accounting, you will like Le Havre.

Its lineage is obvious, but this is a different animal than Agricola, as it's easier to specialize and (so far) less intense.  I love the overall style of the game, and the greater interactivity.

Despite the many warnings to the contrary, I really liked this with five people, though it does run much longer than most Euros.

This was one of Uwe Rosenbergs first real masterpieces and a follow-up to Agricola. I adore this game and the depth of strategies you can take. If you really want to try out the worker-placement genre, I don't think there's a better place to really get a good feel for the experience. Just be sure to use the starting locations on your first play through! (Don't start with all the locations)

This is another one of those must-own games that is unfortunately hard to find due to its desirability.

This is a very solid game by the designer of Agricola. But it has been a bit of disappointment for me as I hoped it would be as gripping as Agricola. It's hard to pin down why I don't like it as much maybe it just too similar without doing anything unique enough to really grab us. Lots of people love this game and rightly so it an excellent design. If I want to play a Euro this game get's trumped by Agricola as Agricola's expansion's allow allot more variability plus the game is more cut throat than Le Harve. But in time my opinion my change as I exhaust Agricola's charm's and look elsewhere.

Well, for starters, I like this much better than Agricola. There's so much more freedom and opportunity to actually have fun.

I don't really like the continual (and, in this case, increasing) "demand that needs to be met" mechanic Le Havre shares with Agricola. Competition from the other players should provide enough impetus for you to push forward in the game. But, in Le Havre's case, it doesn't detract too much because it is much more easily managed.

Like Agricola, there is a lot going on. You find yourself trying to figure out how many turns you have (7*# of turns/# of players+1) and working out what needs to be done and what would be nice. This can get tiring and unfun if you're not careful. Of course, you can't depend on goods being there or buildings being available, so this isn't too much of an issue. I've only played 2 player. With more players, this will likely be even less of an issue as planning will become more difficult.

Overall, this is pretty enjoyable and I don't see any glaring issues yet. I'm not rating Le Havre yet, but if I did, it would be about a 6.5-7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Long game where the end sneaks up on you.  At the beginning it seems like you have a million actions ahead of you, and then all of a sudden you realize you've only got seven actions left in the game.

Playing with experienced players is a real plus, as the first few games can be excruciatingly long (at least if you're playing with me).  I like two-player, since it's quick(er) and it's your turn so often.  Three seems like it could be good, as well.  The four-player games have taken so long, that I'm not sure I'd want to play with that count again.

13 games in, and it's feeling a little samey (at least in two player games).  Maybe it's just that the two of us are stuck in groupthink, but it seems like there are a fixed number of strategies.  I keep playing this, although I'm not sure why.  Seems like a lot of time for only a little payoff in fun/brainwork.

I ended up trading this, and am not looking to play it again.  It feels like there are several better options out there.

After one 4-player game, the feeding mechanism here feels more brutal and punishing than in any other game I've played yet, but 4 players is supposedly too many, so I'd like to give it another whirl with 2 or 3 players.

Rating after just one play. It was fun, but so are most games to me. This one didn't really offer anything new to the table, though. My three negatives: It took a very long time to play, it didn't seem to matter what I did most of the time as I just played randomly and still finished with a good score, and it's frustrating that you're not building something...just grabbing points. Unlike Agricola where you have a nice little farm at the end, this one just had points. I'd like to give it another try. Maybe the rating will improve with more plays.

Fun game.  I went in expecting Agricola with a twist, but found it's nothing like it.   My wife doesn't enjoy Agricola that much, but will play this game everytime I bring it up.  There's not as much resource stealing in this game, and a lot less tension.  

At it's core, this game is really more about turn optimization, and resource trading.    

I originally rated this game as an 8.5, but after a dozen+ plays, I think this game is up there with Agricola.  I originally wished the pieces were a little more sturdy, but after several gameplays, I can't imagine how messy a full game with wooden pieces would be.

Le Havre is a fantastic game that moves at a good clip, allows for a lot of pre-planning, and offers a variety of strategies. 

The loan system is really neat and, after playing this, I cannot believe we don't see it in many more games. The tableau building and use of other player's buildings is fun. My only gripe is that there are quite a few fiddly bits. The BGG player boards go a long way toward mitigating this issue.

A classic luckless eurogame with a paste on theme. The idea is to reward those who choose the best action(s) each round, making the process progressively more complex as the game continues.

In the end, the game is indeed rewarding the best player, but it's a tedious and tiring procedure. Every round is twice as complex and important as the previous one, and it quickly becomes a matter of mental endurance as much as tactics/strategy. For me it stops being fun after round 10-11 when the options are just overwhelming and average players either succumb to analysis paralysis or ignore (intentionally or not) half+ the actions and thus practically ruin their chances for victory. 

A pity, I expected far more from this particular designer.

Six games now, and my rating continues to climb, up to 9 from an initial 7.  I really am starting to get it and like the way the game offers multiple strategies and lots of little choices along the way.  I just wish it weren't quite so long, as the combination of length and learning curve (I think at least 2 or 3 games are necessary to start really understanding what the options are) make it tough to introduce new players and bring them up to speed.  That said, I've played 3 player games with experienced players in under 2 hours, so the length is less of an issue when you're not dealing with new players.

So...many...choices. So...many...paths to victory! Le Havre is so simple to play, yet so complex. What I mean is that the gameplay is very simple- you either take goods or use a building action. The thing that makes it complex is that there are a bajillion different resources and a bajillion different building actions to be taken. The economy this game creates is insane, and I love it! Very dry though and hard to get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am a sucker for games that have many currencies which must be reduced down to time and available actions.  It is not quite as distilled as Goa does this, but the layers upon layers of depth and the different ways the game unfolds due to the building order.  Two games in, and I much prefer the lower food requirements in the three player games instead of the two player game.  The two player game feels differently but still quite enjoyable.  The progression in this game from early, middle, and end is truly fun.  I love how this game starts out tight, opens up dramatically, and tightens back up at the end.  I need to play this more and soon.

The game seems extra amazing when the special buildings are special.  I do like that they timing of them may result in a blank for a game change as well.  Its pretty awesome.

The mechanics of your turn are simple to execute, but finding the move you want is excruciating.    Easily my favorite "gamer's game."  Six plays in and I still haven't played with 4 or 5.  With 3 this will always be my first choice.

3 games down and it's a good game no doubt about that. I really am not sure why people compare it so closely to Agricola as it doesn't feel like that game at all. Sure you have to feed and that's a fundamental element of each round but that doesn't yield the same game. Le Havre is nowhere near as dynamic of a game as Agricola. The standard buildings are constants whereas your hand of Minors/Occupations changed every game. I like this game it's fun and will continue to play it and develop my thoughts on it as time goes by. 

UPDATE: I've got to play this one several more times and there are just some things about the game that I simply don't enjoy...at all. I find the game tedious, not fun. Choices limited after the one you wanted is gone. I've tried playing it 2, 3, 4 and yes even 5 and am at the point now where I can see that the game is a well developed game and that a lot of people are going to enjoy this experience but for me I find it quite miserable. My above comments show that once I had an understanding I had hope for a fun game but one just never developed for me.

An amazing resource conversion game with loads of agonizing decisions—my gaming partner excels at resource conversion games. We were so engrossed we didn’t realize how long the game took to play—and that’s a positive.

Production quality was okay and the illustrations were pretty good too, though clearly earlier work by Klemens Franz.

Le Havre is Uwe Rosenberg’s much anticipated sequel to Agricola, which gives it the same hurdle that confronted Mammoth Hunters when it was Alea’s sequel to Puerto Rico. Given that obstacle, Le Havre is being surprisingly well received, and with good reason. I played Le Havre twice at BGG.CON, where it was in almost constant play, and believe that I enjoy and will continue to enjoy it significantly more than Agricola. I’ve never been especially enamored with Agricola, which I’ve always thought is good (with the drafting variant), but not great. I think the plethora of Occupation and Minor Improvement cards in Agricola is more of a distraction than anything else, and I feel like the short time span of the game coupled with the incessant harvest demands makes it a frustrating experience of trying to build an engine in artificially cramped quarters. Le Havre on the other hand feels like a more wide open playground, and while there are vaguely similar feeding demands in Le Havre, they’re not as overwhelming or crushing as in Agricola because you can always spend money instead of food, and you can always take a loan for more money. Importantly, loans in Le Havre are not nearly as devastating as Begging cards in Agricola so being unprepared for a harvest or two in Le Havre is not a huge problem. The number of options, turns, resources, and methods for creating victory points in Le Havre are huge, which gives the game its wide open feeling. I did feel like the game overstayed its welcome when playing with 4 inexperienced players, but the game claims to play much quicker with 2 and 3 players, so I’m hopeful that I can pack the tense decision-making of Le Havre into 90 minutes with 3 experienced players. The 2.5 hours that it took was too long for what it offered, but 90 minutes would be dense enough to merit repeated plays to more fully explore this intriguing title.

I love this one. But everyone please, at least try to pronounce it correctly! :) French is absolutely not native to me, so correct me if I'm wrong, but anyway: "Le" is not pronounced "La", its closer to "Luh" as in "Uh-oh") and if you just ignore the "H" and say "avre"you will get a lot closer to the French pronunciation... so it should be more like "Luh Avre"

One of the best games. People compare it with Agricola. It has nothing to do with Agricola. It is better than Agricola. Very simple mechanics and rules that allows you to build an economy from scratch. You need to realize that there is a very finite number of actions that you can take throughout the game, to be able to develop a winning strategy. The game is not long for what it offers. The game is open to all kind of strategies.

Just okay. Could grow on me, as one of the problems seems to be that the stuff you need to do in the endgame requires several steps toward longer-terms goals you better have known were coming. This is not so cool the first time you play.
Intellectually, a reasonably engaging resource-pushing optimization problem.
Thematically really uninteresting. What are we building, a castle? A cathedral? Oh, a port.
Seems to have a lot of down time without much reason to pay attention to other players' turns. Dizzying array of options tends to cause analysis paralysis. Left me wanting another game to play in between my turns. Would be keener to try it again if there were fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game involves significant amount of interaction between players. Players need to have some knowledge of the buildings' effects otherwise he can be in a disadvantage position. Active blocking or first-come first-serve is important in this game. 


There are many possible actions to take as the game progresses when more buildings are being constructed or built by the players. Hence, it is important to prioritise the actions required otherwise one may end up taking sub-optimal actions which does not eventually increase the VP.

Replayability may be limited given that the standard buildings , which make up a significant number, are always the same across each game. The only difference is the special buildings introduced, which are quite limited in number.

Got to play at ConnCON 2010, won my first game! It's not as complicated as the rules make out. Planning ahead to the last move is essential. Make sure you can feed your staff!

Haven't given it enough of a chance to properly rate it, because I don't like it enough after a couple of play-throughs to keep bothering with it. I find in the early rounds of the game that one is moving through thick mud--in particular, one is waiting too long for the wharf to appear. I'm sure there's something I'm missing. But it doesn't matter, I'm annoyed and frustrated and moving on to games that don't make me feel that way.

Later after a few more plays: I tried to like this game, and I'm frustrated that it didn't happen, but we're putting it away. My latest frustration is the queue that forms for the Shipping Line in the last two or three rounds. It shifts from engine-building to waiting in line to redeem your engine, trying to jump the queue. Fun if you jump the queue, aggravating if you get jumped and run out of time. I absolutely think it's me, not the game, and I haven't gotten anywhere near good enough at it to properly evaluate it (not fair to give it a low ranking), but I'm done trying.

In Le Havre, a player’s turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.

After every seven turns, the round ends: players’ cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.

Best uwe rosenberg game.  The escalation is wonderful.  I always have fun playing this.  Not too heavy, not too light.  The most straightfoward of his designs.  I do not miss the spacial element because the turn stuff into other stuff is done so well.  

This is what engine games should be.  They should stop being made by this point.  Uwe already got it right.  Why are eurogames still being made?

Interesting "action selection" game in the same category as Agricola, but definitely different. Much more than in Agricola, you have to put a lot of effort in establishing a system for producing food. The amount of food you need at the end of the turn increases quite fast from beginning to end (independent of the actions you choose). Halfway through the game, there seem to be so many options that my brain started to freeze during my first play. Rules are not difficult to explain, but it definitely takes one or more games to fully understand what you could to to win. In that sense, the learning curve is quite steep: I cannot see a first timer win from someone who played it once or twice before. This might have something to do with the fact that knowing the cards is a real advantage: Mainly because you will know which options will become available later in the game, and also because it can be hard to read the properties of the cards lying in front of other players (which you can also use). So, all in all a very enjoyable game, but there are not many people in my circle of friends with whom I could play this. Agricola is much more accessible.

October 2016: Sold on Geekmarket. I do enjoy this game, but it just didn't see enough play amongst my gaming group, and doesn't offer enough that's different compared to other euro games. You buy different buildings that each convert goods in different ways, and then you can sell those goods for money.

Enjoy this one more than Agricola. Feels very similar to a lot of worker placements though. Will have to play again to figure out where this one sits.

This game has really grown on me.  I love the different strategies in the early and mid game.  The only thing keeping this from rating a 10 is I feel the endgame is relatively prescriptive in that you try to gather a bunch of coal- convert it to coke- then try and ship it all twice in the final rounds.  Still a great economic game and much easier to play than you would think at first glance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although the rule set was quite confusing, the game play for the first turns were quite straightforward after all. The decision tree grows during the game, as new buildings come to play. It wasn't as agonizing as in Agricola, but interesting still. I'm not sure about the end game though, there are quite many possibilities to try and each of them is quite calculable - the end felt a bit too much optimizing excercise for me (after first play at least). Nevertheless definetely an interesting game I hope to try again soon.

I like the fact that it's a randomized setup and that there's a lot of thinking/factors to consider-- I felt that I could take the length of the game, which is weird since I dislike Risk, Agricola, or most other 2-3 hour Euros (also see Dungeon Lords). I feel that if someone's running away with the game, it's hard to slow him down-- but that's also a flaw with most other Euros, so I'm not docking this game for that.

I guess I also like that there's just enough other player interaction-- you're not actively going to screw each other over (I don't like the idea of being knocked out for an hour but not able to leave due to balance), but you do have to pay attention to what others do.

Fantastic follow-up to Agricola - uses a worker-placement mechanism and has harvest round but plays very differently. Cards provide a lot of variability but as cards are available to all players, doesn't have the potential for skewed games via a bad deal. Only drawback is the game length, which can be upwards of 3 hours with 4 rookies, even with the "short" game - but gameplay is so "snappy" (little wait between turns) and the choices so engrossing that time flies. Also doesn't have the "fiddliness" of Agricola as resources are replenished a little at a time and continuously before each player's turn instead of at the end of each round. Love this and hope to play a lot more. I can see Le Havre becoming a "10" with more plays.

A game that really makes you feel like you accomplished something, regardless of whether or not you won.  More like Roads and Boats than Agricola.  More player interaction, too.  Also, more of a puzzle game than a worker placement game.  Fun game.  Somewhat brain burning.  A little too long for everyday play.  Edit: after several plays we have this game at the 1-1/2 hour range (2 player).  Now we can fit it in during the work week.  Great game!

Will probably give us many headaches.

Our first game gave us that drooling, slack-jawed, misty-eyed look that meant we had no idea what to do but we were having fun.

After three games this one bears some resemblance to a non-gaming activity--retirement planning.  The game really seems to be about getting the exponential growth curve started ASAFP.  I'm sort of thinking of the game as three phases.  In the first, you plan to get a ship while feeding yourself.  In the second, you've got a ship or two and are weaning yourself off food.  The third is when you no longer care at all about food and are focused solely on the final score.

The increasing cost to feed feels a lot like inflation.  I also like how some of the paths are reigned in by the limits on the cards.

This one really feels like an 8 right now with the strong potential to climb to a 9 in a few more plays.  I like that the game still feels good with both 2 and 3 players but is still different.  I suppose we'll have to try it with four sometime.

Wow, I'm impressed. The latest reviews I read made me expect a rather dry, longish game.

Lordy, this was a painful experience.  Way, way too complicated and in no way fun.  I love board games, but if the directions are 12 pages long...  I can't understand all the good reviews and awards, but I can see where this type of "game" might appeal to certain folks.  My friend I made a determined effort but eventually gave up.  Wish he hadn't spent so much for it!!

Super crunchy, but super fun.  The art works very well, and gameplay is great.  Definitely more fun with 3/4 players than with 5.  For more players, Caverna is a better choice.  

This one is a bit of a brain-burner that takes a few plays to get to know.  But it's fantastic!  

Buy at least 11 of those little "Dip Bowls" from target for $2 each.  They will make your gaming experience much, much better.

After a single play, I have to say that Le Havre is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, I just didn't find it to be a very engaging one, either. The game seems to go on a bit longer than I would like (a problem I have with a lot of games), and by the mid-game I kept noticeably eyeing the number of remaining turn cards and being surprised that there was so many of them left. 

Despite that, I could see playing the game again some day, but I don't feel a compelling urge to actually purchase the game or seeking it out.

The best parts of Caylus and Agricola are brought together in a very well balanced and exciting game.  

The game does run rather long, but rules for a "shorter game" are included, and they are extremely well balanced.  On the whole, it is about 50% longer and 50% more complex than Agricola.  There are no random setup elements equivalent to the minor improvements and occupations in Agricola, and this really gives the game a lot more balance.

Simplicity and ease of play for new gamers are among the qualities I look for in games that I rate 8+.  If I didn't take those into account, this game would be a 10.

Edit: I played again, a full game this time where the rules were better explained, and I enjoyed it much more! We played the basic/quick game which is *definitely* the way to got for learning the game (just like with Agricola you really want to start with the family game). Big bump in the rating.

Just not my game. As one review said, it makes me want to play other, better games (Shipyard, Caylus, Puerto Rico, Agricola).

I did only get to play the introductory/quick game, and only a half game, so perhaps it gets more interesting as the game goes on. As it was, it seemed like all I was doing was collecting goods and spending goods and occasionally using a building. The game simply seemed very repetitive.

I'm going to attempt the impossible, and evaluate Le Havre first on it's own merits before comparing it to it's hyped predecessor, [gameid=31260]. There's a lot of choices, and I really like the slow buildup of resources. The long playtime, a negative in most games of this type, is surprisingly a strength. It's viable to be opportunistic in the early game to build up large amounts of energy and food reserves that you can exploit later, or you can try to rush out to a quick start. The interplay of buildings and having to pay a player to enter his buildings is a neat idea. This is one of those rarities: a resource gathering euro that doesn't feel dry as all hell.

Now, here's the comparison to Agricola.  More open-ended, and more appealing to me.  Oddly, Le Havre seems to have less emphasis on player blocking than its older counterpart, even though as a game about markets and shipping, there would be more real-life interaction between different companies than there would be in a medieval farming village.

-Mmm, so good. Played two shortened solo games and it's love at first play, can't wait to see what the full multiplayer game provides. And now a third full-game. This some really tight time management and just lots of fun. 
-Such a different experience playing two-player, no surprise I guess, but neat and different.

-The more I play solo, the more options I see available and the more I see how you can refine your strategy to a sharp exacting point, which creates an interesting dynamic to the much more variable 2-player. 
It's such an appealing puzzle piece, and the components and art are so cute and absorbing, it always make me want to come back, but then I lose interest either because the lack of pressure/dynamic in solo or because I can play as much as I want in a short amount of time, so I need to try 2-player some more before I rate. 1/25/14

One three-player game behind, two newbies didn't combine enough points to beat the winner... :)

I was expecting a shorter game, and wasn't very fresh or focused and when the game went on and on, I just wished it to end. I did some "good" moves, but I didn't have a long-time plan, which lead to the situations, where I just had no idea what to do next.

In the game you need to gather resources, build buildings and ships and use the latter two to process resources to better resources or money. There are lots of different resources and different buildings, so it is not very easy for the first timers.

I can see why some people like this game, but these engine building games (at least on this level) are not my favorite games. At least not when they are this long. With some experience, it gets faster of course, but it also gets longer, if there are more players.

I love the narrative arc in Le Havre- you really feel a sense of development as you transition from the early to mid and finally the late game, and each stage has its own unique feel and challenges. The tactical decisions can be excruciating and (despite what some critics say) there is genuinely a breadth of strategies to pursue. The ordering of the building queue and the special cards really cement this game's replayability. 

UPDATE: After ~50 plays the game has begun to feel procedural. While I will always enjoy playing Le Havre, for its length there are now other games that capture my imagination and interest more.

RATING: 7
Engine building/worker placement/ resource management. The game play itself is very simple but the strategy is incredibly deep. I very much prefer this to Rosenberg's other gem Agricola though both are great games. The downfall with this game is playtime. It feels like it drags on longer than it should. Also player count is an issue. It seems 3 players is the sweet spot and I don't know if I would play with anymore or less. Components and art are solid. Great game by a great designer.

Fantastic!  Another great Uwe Rosenberg game, and another in his line of tight resource management games that has an excellent solo version.  My kids aren't ready to be competitive with this yet (they are still trying to figure out the basics of the commodities and conversions), but I'm really happy with how well it plays solo.  I used the iOS version to keep me honest on the first play through, and that worked really well.

The comparisons to Agricola are just, and unjust at the same time.  On the one hand, there's a farming/building aspect to the game, and there's a worker placement aspect to the game; on the other, the tactics are a little less obvious, and the game requires a stronger focus on strategy than its predecessor.  There's an additional screwage factor in the game, too, since a player token on a building means that no one else can get there if you own it, so you can squat on a good building to prevent other players from using it.  Still, doing so will hurt you more in the long run, since you're not taking advantage of your own turns by using other buildings.  The economic engine is wound more tightly, and isn't as easy to grasp, but I think that, with more experience, I would find myself liking it more.  That being said, I would never play this INSTEAD of Agricola, since the two games feel very different.

A little long for what it is. Many things that you want to do but can't. It can be a little frustrating and can move a little slow at times.

I have played this game over 60 times. At least half have been app plays mostly on solo mode.  This is one of the best solo play experiences although I would be using the app for that.  I also prefer this game as a two player game if I don't play solo.  
I love the engine building or rather the resource conversion engine building of this game.  Counting your resources and planning ahead to achieve specific goals of making the most money is really challenging but can pay off if you do it right.  The game feels very sandboxy and that's another reason I love it. There are a ton of opinions for actions and they just keep getting bigger and bigger.

RATING: 8
This is every bit as good as Agricola and at the moment, I think I like it more. The worker placement aspect is toned down and there isn't nearly the variety in card play, but I find the resource conversions to be way more interesting. In Le Havre, you can build an entire supply line instead of being limited to just switching one good directly to another. Many resources have multiple uses and they can be combined any number of ways to further your goals. Admittedly, the small bit of worker placement that carried over from Agricola does function a little strangely. Buying and selling buildings to the town to clear them of workers feels contrived, but I suppose real world concepts like multiple carpenters in one town have been nudged aside in the name of creating an interesting competition for resources.

Le Havre is longer and certainly not as cute as Agricola, but once you get comfortable with the resource chains it feels like a much more open-ended game. The endgame scoring is basically cash on hand (plus properties), which is a much more satisfying goal than the seemingly arbitrary point values awarded to the farms in Agricola. I love Agricola's near endless re-playability, but all things considered, I believe that Le Havre is a better overall game.

Obviously I like this quite a bit from my rating, so I'll start with what I don't like. It's probably the most fiddly game I've ever played, both in terms of having to perpetually move around the bits and nitpicky rules that are easily overlooked. It also seems fairly long, and i don't know that I'd ever want to try this with more than 3. All that said, I like that there are multiple paths to victory here and that it plays fairly differently depending on which way you want to go, something that can't be said about many other Euros.

Also, this game helped me put together a piece of the puzzle in terms of what I personally like and dislike about games - and, in this case, the X factor that often makes some games a 9 for me and others an 8 (on the BGG scale). I was thinking about this compared to Agricola (a 9 for me), and I think they are very, very different games; in fact, were it not for the "Harvest Trilogy" label, I wouldn't have considered them and Loyang to be much more related than Tigris & Euphrates and Ra. Le Havre seemed closer in feel to me to Puerto Rico (an 8 for me) than Agricola, and I realized that what made the difference was the cards you get in Agricola. Because you have a different hand of cards each time in that game, the game state is dramatically different each time, and thus it tests your ability to react to the specific circumstances rather than straight up efficiency at the game. The hidden information about your opponents' hands also means that you're less confident about their next moves and have to rely more on the meta-game. While Le Havre is not Puerto Rico in the sense that there is much more randomness, you still have close to perfect information about your opponent and, while the order of the buildings are randomized, they're still predictable (the special buildings do help this, but they don't change the game as drastically as the occupations and minor improvements in Agricola do). Basically, in Le Havre and PR, I feel like you could make a mathematically optimal move each turn given enough time assuming the other player is also playing optimally, whereas a game like Agricola allows for more divergent strategies and requires a lot more interplay between the players (not just because of the cards, either, but I think that's the main significant difference).

Again, all of that is not much of a negative about Le Havre; I still rate it an 8, and I can definitely see why it's considered a top-tier game and many prefer it to Agricola. For me, personally, I think the things mentioned in the last paragraph take ever-so-slightly away from it and are probably mostly responsible for that lost point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this more than Agricola.  You don't feel like you're just trying to break even.  There's a sense that you can actually accomplish something.  I agree with those who say this is the better game.  Not necessarily because it's more balanced, but because it's more fun.

Excellent economic game of resource manipulation and worker placement. Although made by the same person who did Agricola, this game is very different. The goal of the game is to get points via buildings, ships, and money. There is an escalating aspect to it, as buildings and ships that come out later are worth much more. Goods can be picked up, used for buildings, refined, and even shipped for money. I'd love to play again.

At the moment I prefer this over Agricola. So many choices and optimizing ways to score, a real VPH = Victory Point Heaven. Food consumption is easier in this game and can even be neglected, enough ways to restore this later. Halfway the game I'm glazing over all the cards and try to optimize my moves. I don't succeed well, but sure I like it.

Vastly better 3-5p than 1-2p (rating a 5 for 1-2p). The constraints are tighter, there are fewer false choices, there are reasonably variable different strategic paths. One downside is length: it feels efficient, but no getting around the hours burned. Still, really good for 3+. I especially appreciate the low rules overhead: you pretty much get straight to the action.

For solo or 2p (or really any count, but lower counts are most in need of help), I've been pleased with a variant changing shipping value of coke to 3F (from 5F). This creates broader options than the numbing main path of coal/coke.

[i]I've only played this game with 2 players so far. I have to try it with 3, I think there are more viable strategies with more buildings in play.[/i]

Good game from Uwe Rosenberg. I revisited it after a few years and I like it better than I used to (I'm bumping the rating from 6 to 7). It works really well with 2 players, it has a nice pace to it. I love the simplicity of the core actions and the overall sense of development and progress. There's a lot of crunchy, tough decisions to be made in this game. 

But as much as I enjoy Le Havre I still do have some problems with it. There's something wrong with the loan system, I can't really put my finger on it, but it seems you can abuse it in a weird way. Also, the game might feel a little samey due to the layout of buildings: yes, they appear in different order, but they are those same buildings from game to game so most of the time everything comes down to shipping massive amounts of coke late game - there are probably other paths to victory, but this one seems the most viable (the coal-to-coke conversion is free and unlimited). Fortunately the special buildings inject some variety to the gameplay. And although there are only four of them in the 2P game, they still might impact your long term strategy.

One more thing - replenishing resources before every turn is really fiddly and there's no way around it. 

/update: I think that Ora et Labora might actually replace Le Havre for me as a go-to resource conversion game. It adds a spatial puzzle and removes the feeding aspect (which didn't fit Le Havre at all to be honest, it felt forced and disjointed from the rest of the game). OeL seemed overwhelming to me at first, but I think it's just a deeper experience.

RATING: 7
A solid economic engine game,  but fairly straightforward collect your resources/buy buildings/grind into points.  Add back in the "feed your people" seen in Stone Age/Agricola.

Some nice touches though - the flippable counters allow you to "improve" resources,  and the resupply mechanism means there are some nice tough choices between doing actions and taking resources.

Buildings are a bit of a two-edged sword - it's cool to have variety,  but experience will definitely help with properly planning out the engine.

Got to see the special buildings for the long game, which look cool, but the game as is already runs a touch too long.  I would have rather had more turns cut out while still throwing in fun new buildings.

In all,  a solid economic engine game,  but a very classic Euro design.  

Had a chance to play the long game.  It's definitely lives up to its name - it is a good chunk longer. Not convinced that it adds much - still feels like pretty much the same game.  You start with less and end with more, but that's about it.

The game definitely rewards long term planning - the microturns give the deceptive sense of time when there really isn't much slack.  You should probably look at the buildings and plan what you're going to do and work towards that :P

Some very close games (still can't seem to quite get enough turns :) but even the short game feels too long for what it is.  Or maybe I'm too lazy to do the actual planning ahead (ie reading all the cards)...

Like the artwork. Resource management of the heavy kind. Loads of thing to do but not enough turns to do it in. Felt a bit cumbersome at times and need good eye sight. After playing full game (20 rounds)have rerated up to 9. The number and distribution of cards means that no two games will ever be same and will require diff strategies.

I really like this game.  While it is somewhat long and gamery, the fact that your turns are short and compact means the game constantly moves along with little down time.  Also, the presentation of the game is excellent - it really enhances the fun factor of the game.  

After playing it a second time, I have a couple of minor complaints.  First, it is a bit long.  Second, it is a bit fiddly - lots of chits moving back and forth - it is easy to get confused.

Game tries to be as good as Agricola (which I really like except it's hard to hold nerves because of tension) or Caylus (which I accept as an average game as it's dry, boring but has great ideas and mechanics). But, Le Havre fails seriously to be good. Most of the game is just managing a pool of many types of duplicated resources. Plus, 1 worker "placement" to ~20 buildings.

Brilliant design, but even more brutal than Agricola. 
And the GF keeps trampling me at this one!

That said I will be keeping the board game and try and get it out more in the future. There is just something about playing a board game on a table that cannot be captured in it's digital form.

This is my favorite of the worker placement games.  The biggest Rosenberg innovation is the huge deck of variable effects e.g. in Agricola, the Occupations and Minor Improvements and in Le Havre, the Special Buildings.  This game does it much better than Agricola since you’re less likely to get screwed based on what’s dealt out.  The Special Buildings also have a varying degree of impact game to game, and I really enjoy the imbalance of their effects i.e. some are obviously more powerful or useful than others.   Since Marketplace is such a huge part of the early game, the players have a fair amount of control over the release of these buildings.

De tweede van Uwe Rosenberg in de oogsttrilogie. Absoluut een spel dat vaker op tafel mag komen.

De spelers zijn handelaren in de haven van Le Havre die zoveel mogelijk vermogen proberen te vergaren. De speler met het meeste vermogen wint. De spelers kunnen gebruik maken van het aanbod dat in de haven aanwezig is van natuurlijke grondstoffen als hout, leem en graan. Of ze kunnen een gebouw gebruiken om dit om te zetten naar andere bruikbare materialen als brood, houtskool of baksteen. Ook kunnen ze schepen bouwen en deze gebruiken om goederen te verkopen voor geld. Al met al veel te veel keus en te weinig beurten om het allemaal te doen.

I continue to have some troubles with the design. It always seems like the last turn or two is where people score well over two-thirds of their points. To me, that makes good play or decisions made over the majority of the game somewhat irrelevant.

That said, it is one of my favorite worker placement games.

This game feels like what you'd get if you took Puerto Rico and replaced the role selection part of the game with Agricola.

There is most definitely a good game here, but it's much longer than it really needs to be and much of the complexity seems to be here just for the sake of complexity.

I wouldn't turn down more chances to play it, but given a choice between this and Agricola, PR, or Caylus, I'd much rather player any one of those three.

Incrementally building up your production capacity towards big endgame scoring.  I think that if this game could be played quickly, I might like it better.  That would require that everyone had a good grasp on the capabilities of all the cards.  Unfortunately, I think that would require a lot of plays.  In the mean time, with the players I play with, the game takes too long and its narrative suffers because it takes so long to develop.  There is a lot of down time.  I definitely like Agricola better.

Pre-ordered and purchased at Essen 2008. Fiddly and there's not enough going on for the length of the game. Each game seems to play out similarly despite the random building order and the few special buildings you get each game. There should be a way for more special buildings to be used in the game to shake things up a bit. Gets better with practice.

It is amazing how a game that essentially only has two potential actions that you can perform in a turn (pick up goods or place your worker) can have a weight of 3.8... which is pretty heavy in BGG terms.

In that simplicity belies a very strategic game. I can see why the uninitiated could be overwhelmed but this is a game that you could play countless times and never have the same feel.

Where other games by Uwe Rosenberg could feel overly punishing because other the need to feel your people, Le Havre softens this a bit and doesn't make it feel debilitating if you're unable to in a round or two. In this game you also have many paths to victory or at least many options that you can take during your turn. While someone might have swooped in and taken your "optimal" move, there's generally something else that you can do to help yourself out. Building out your own personal tableau of actions (and points) is appealing... as is swooping in an using your opponents building to perform an action and leaving your worker there so that they can't use that action themselves.

All in all, Le Havre is a great game and one that I think everyone should have in their collection. It's a game that has so much strategy in something that has so few mechanics. It could suffer if a group of people play it with someone new, as that could set a single player up for victory but it's a minor quibble at best.

A game with a rather steep learning curve. Le Havre is an economic game at its core, with multiple ways to earning the money required for victory. These are provided by the numerous standard and couple of randomly chosen special buildings. There buildings can be combined and utilised to produce different types of end-products and money is earned via shipping or selling them. Therein lies the main fun of the game: figuring out the most cost effective way to increase your wealth.

Replayability is provided mainly by the different ways of refilling the resources, and different special buildings chosen. However, given that the number of special buildings chosen per game is only four or five, the main flow of the game does not alter much from game to game. That's the only major brickbat of an otherwise fine economic eurogame.

Not as much like Agricola as I thought it would be... it's just the ever-increasing piles of resources that you can take plus 1 worker to place on an ever-increasing set of buildings (which are the action spaces) with feeding and loans... but instead of a variety of things on a personal spatial layout, it's just all about who has the most money (value) at the end, the decisions on how to get the most out of each turn to get the most money (value) are the whole game... I'm really enjoying the solo game so far... rating will probably increase with more plays and multiplayer...and it did it's a solid favorite now!

I'm underwhelmed by games such as Le Havre and it's sibling Ora et Labora where all your choices feel like good choices. There's no stress, nor any fretting over difficult decisions. Instead everyone has a multitude of great options available and the games feel a bit too light-hearted to me. I prefer the stress of the Harvest phase in Agricola any day!

I used to rank Le Havre a 7, but Ora et Labora does what Le Havre does and better, pushing Le Havre down to a 6 in my mind.

AOP: havy game, more like Caylus than Agricola. It's long but I didn't feel the downtime almost at all. Eager to play more :)

ASP: Maybe I just don't know how to play. If you're fixed on one strategy you'll lost. I feel that you have to do many small things like in Agricola instead of one huge strategy. Second play was not that fun as first one. Still want to play one more time to try different strategy and to see If I was right. (down to 7) 

ATP (up to 7.5) - Still I suck at Le Havre. A bit too long, a bit too fiddly. But I can play again with pleasure

-- up to 9 --
now it's one of my favourite games. Rules are very simple and intuitive but it gives you so many decisions. A truly great game.

-- down to 7 --
It's a great game but every time I play LH it feels for me like work. I'm almost tired after playing this game. Replaced for me by Ora et Labora

An economic and resource conversion game masquerading as a worker placement game.  I think any comparison to Agricola is unfair as what you are doing and how you are doing it in Le Havre is so very different.  Playing more to get a feel for the long term strategies and to perhaps anticipate my opponents moves better will only improve my opinion of Le Havre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Playing Le Havre felt like a lot of work, more so than Agricola.  You have to feed constantly; you never get more than one action per turn; and in some cases you only have one turn before the phase is over for you.  Fortunately, it is a lot more forgiving as well.  Although it's easy to find yourself in a downward spiral with loans, the penalty is far less punishing than taking a begging card.  I've seen many people who were in trouble with debt during the game still being able to come out ahead in the end.  To me that's a criticism for Le Havre, especially since loans can actually be a strategy employed to get the money you need for the upcoming round.  To be able to intentionally starve your worker as a way to get ahead is a loophole that can be abused, and the penalty for making such a decision should be harsher, but instead the game is far too generous in the number of ways someone can pay back with just an extra coin premium.

Another thing I'm not particularly fond of is that there seems to be only one sure way of scoring well, and that is through the building of steel ships and/or luxury liners.  I don't think there is another strategy that comes close to the amount of VP awarded.  Maybe a heavy emphasis on shipping could work, but somehow I doubt it.  This of course is a theory that will have to be tested.

Without the burdensome individual cards of Agricola, the replayability of Le Havre comes from how the buildings are stacked each time (in addition to the specials that are drawn).  If all of the more important starter buildings (especially the food production ones) happen to be grouped in the same column, be prepare for a slower game than usual.  Even so, I imagine the play experiences of Le Havre to be less varied than that of Agricola simply because the lack in card varieties.

Lastly, I think Le Havre is much too fragile in terms of the player number and card combinations.  While five may make a tough game in Agricola, it is still very playable and presents a different kind of challenge.  Same with the hand of cards I receive.  If they are bad, I can still get a respectable score (maybe not the winning one).  Not so with Le Havre.  3 is definitely the sweet spot.  With 4 it becomes a chore to play and forget about 5.  I see that more as an exercise in tedium, since you are stuck with only one turn in three out of every five phases.  Not to mention the pacing of the game is very much dependent on how the buildings come out.  If they aren't equally distributed among the three stacks, you'll find yourselves with higher numbered ones coming out early but no one can build.  While the lower cost ones not being made available fast enough.

Even with all of the criticisms for Le Havre, I still think it's a good game and one well worth it to play.  I just don't think it will have the longevity of Agricola and probably will wear out it's newness and novelty factor faster than its predecessor.

Update #1: Bumped the score up by half a point.  The 3-player session was much more enjoyable than my first try with 4.  I had a more coherent strategy and a clear goal, rather than just taking actions for the sake of doing it.

The game itself is pretty easy to play. Not a lot of rules are involved, and most of them are just logical. I didn’t read the rulebook, but my guess is that’s in the same style of Agricola, and that is a well written rulebook. Very clear, and it should be easy to explain.

All of the above makes it sound that this one is an easy game. Well, it isn’t easy, or maybe easy is a wrong word. There are so many possibilities to choose from, and you really couldn’t make a wrong decision. There are just one of two options, that might work out better in the end of the game. Read it well, might.

This is one of the best games we ever played. Just can’t wait to play it when we’re at home. Or maybe we try Agricola first. It’s going to be a difficult choice.

Definitely one of my favourites! This game is a brain burner (sort of) and I really like those. It scales surprisingly well, and gets harder with more players. I like to convert resources into other resources:)
Even the solitaire mode is interesting.

Solid competitive game.  Instead of just struggling to feed your family (Agricola), Le Havre allows you, and in fact challenges you, to become a wealthy entrepreneur.

I love the simplicity of each turn and the pressure that comes with the feed the workers mechanic. Set up and tear down is much simpler now that I've found holders for all the chits, but it still is a bit fiddly. Hard to get to the table as my wife thinks it plays too long. Yet to try the shortened version.

RATING: 10
Second in Uwe Rosenberg's 'trilogy', along with Gric and At the Gates of Loyang.  IMO the best of the three by far.

Gameplay is tight and relatively intuitive.  Play time is long enough to be meaty but not so long as to be off-putting.  

Le Havre can bog down when the number of buildings gets high late in the game, but if you've planned well your decision tree will actually be pretty small.

My rating has gone up a bit after every play.

Edit: Raising my rating from 9 to 10.  It just keeps getting better. 11/15/12.

Excellent game for serious gamers.  Very similar to Agricola, but deeper and with many more options.  Better than Agricola for smaller groups (2 - 3).

After more gameplay, I can accurately describe the differences between this and our beloved Agricola.  Le Havre has several paths to victory, while Agricola is always about building the same "best" farm, i.e. having at least one of everything.  Le Havre is a lot more layered, and you're always saying to yourself, "there are so many options, but which is best," compared to Agricola where I think we can all agree the common comment is, "I need more actions!!!"

After 1 Play: I was fairly disappointed.  It's not that the game is bad, but I was expecting so much more, seeing as Agricola is one of my favorite games.  While in Agricola I feel I have the freedom to choose between competing strategies, here the game feels very scripted.  

After 2+ Plays: I gave it another chance, and it failed again, so I'm done with it.  Lowered rating from 6 to 4.  4 is probably a bit harsh, but considering the game's length, I would vociferously protest slogging through it again.

How can a game with only two basic actions be any good? The secret lies in the buildings and the choices you must make on your turn. As Tom Vasel said, "there's only good, good, good and better." Figuring out the latter is the real challenge. A shame that there are a couple of printing errors, but those have since been fixed in the Grand Hameau "expansion." It reminds me a bit of Saint Petersburg and Race for the Galaxy in the sense that you're drafting cards and it takes a couple of plays to understand them. Timing is essential. Resource management is crucial. The short game is perfect for getting the hang of the flow, but leaves you wanting more, especially when it comes to the upkeep which is killer. Plays best with 4 players.

Thinky, tight, smart, and one of Rosenberg's last games to use cards to keep the replayability high. I don't play it as often as I wish I did, but it's still very close to one of my favorite 'feed your workers' types of games.

Quite impressed. The first third of the game is a crawl; it's a snowflake drifting downwards. Then, without warning, that flake transforms into a hectic avalanche. So much fun to play. I recommend long game with three.

Edit: 9/28/15
It's way too long. I know that's a silly complaint, but the moves border on tedium when each turn feels so similar. If a game is long and consistently enjoyable, that's a huge plus. Long and boring? No thanks.

相对于每局起始随机卡牌变化过大的农场主来说，本人更喜欢有限变化的勒阿弗尔，因为你无需每局花大把时间用在研究卡牌能力组合上，而把更多的心思留在资源的计划和管理上。和农场主如出一辙，游戏中你依然需要为获得足够的食物而奔波，而缺少资金大把贷款证明更是一件再正常不过的事，玩家之间互动相对较多，而最终几个小时的努力无非就为了丰衣足食，殷实家业，还有搭上那最终的豪华邮轮。

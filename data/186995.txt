GAME: Doctor Who: Time of the Daleks
RANK: 3431
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
As far as a Doctor Who game, this takes the cake. Too many errors all over the game. Here are a few.. 

Locations: 1. The Sevateem - Shows a photo with Sarah Jane and not Leela, from The Face of Evil. (Even though Sarah was with the Doctor on Zeta Minor, she is not listed as Linked) Besides that, the Sevateem is a tribe, not a location. 2, "Tarken" - Should be Traken, from the Keeper of Traken

Time Anomaly Card - Should read 'Genesis of the Daleks' as they are titles based on episode series.

The TARDIS Console "Boards" are just paper and do not represent the best available photo of each Doctor. Not only that, they used 1 photo for all the cards. On the back side, it would have been nice to have renditions of each Doctor's TARDIS and maybe a quote from them about it. 

The cards are really thin and probably 150gsm. Really cheap. Mini cards with mini pictures and text are a big minus also. 

If you are a fan, wait and see if they release an All-In-One collectors box to get everything at once. Would have been better to have 10 and 11 together instead of 12, and maybe add The War Doctor as a mini expansion. I can only imagine that the BBC twisted this game around and made it worse (Just like the series)

RATING: 5
Time of the Daleks is one of those games in which each player builds a pool of dice, together with abilities to re-roll or change a face.  This is all with the aim of resolving various dilemmas and progressing towards the end of a time track.  The addition of permanent companions if successful creates a pretty rapid snowball effect.  Failure to solve a dilemma, with the loss of a temporary companion, is likely to leave you behind and with no obvious catch-up mechanism.  The game is semi-cooperative in that all players face a common foe - the Daleks - whose ship is also moving along that track and who also pop up whenever a player fails to defeat a foe.  Nothing new or particularly interesting here.  

The miniatures are nice, but, as many have commented, card quality is poor.

Lovely doctor minis. But the demo game I played seem to have few meaningful choices just lots of rolling dice and rerolls. Thematic but didnt seem to be much of a game so I am now not going to buy unless something convinces me to give it another go.

I played this at Origins 2017. It fell flat for the 3 of us that played together. We just didn't really enjoy it. We SO wanted to as the production quality was great. Just never felt like we got anywhere. Very sad actually. Went from a oh sweet must buy to Meh.

Preordered in UKGE'17 for that K9 figure, arrived in Nov'17.

I like the mechanics quite a bit - light dice chucking with equipment cards, many random events and lots of dice manipulation. And I've got to be honest - the game feels like a celebration of Doctor Who in general, with references to many episodes, foes and companions.

I would give it a higher rating if it had better component quality - the TARDIS consoles are just plain old card stock, and the cards themselves are a bit on the thin side. I am quite happy with the figures, the dice and the Earth/Web of Time board, though.

So frustrating. Thematically, this is the perfect game if you're a Doctor Who fan. I can't imagine a game that so thoroughly throws you into the theme: virtually every companion is represented (or will be with announced expansions), so many alien species are here, tons of planets and time lines from every incarnation of the TV series. I was giddy and excited just during the rules explanation.

Unfortunately, the game is a mess. It's basically a dice game, but with a wonky semi-coop mechanic that doesn't work:  since fighting the Daleks not only requires you to roll fewer dice, but also won't allow you to advance your Tardis very far, there is no extra incentive to try to defeat them, and the players who do are more likely to lose. 

Similarly, because lost challenges often make subsequent challenges more difficult (by making you discard companions, etc.), the game punishes players who are already losing, and creates an awful runaway leader problem.  Ugh. Such a disappointment, because the core of a really good game is here somewhere. Maybe some house rules will fix this, because I really want to like this game.

Tried this at the UK Game Expo and I was a little underwhelmed. The dice drafting and matching mechanic just wasn't very interesting and the minis, although very nice, are just markers and play very little functional role in the game. I've enjoyed a lot of what GF9 have done previously and I love the Dr Who theme but this is a miss unless there were aspects of the game that were not revealed by the demo.

This game is odd for how much I like it despite its faults.

While the general gameplay is fairly straightforward, there area several fiddly rules to remember that should have been outlined better in the turn overview on the back of the book, or somewhere.

I enjoy DW:TotD, but I can't say it's as exciting as the other game it was purchased with, Fields of Green. That seems so wrong, given that one theme ought to feel exciting, while the other more tranquil. In fact, though, DW:TotD is a much lighter game. That's one reason I don't think it should play quite so long. If a game is going to go on for a couple hours, it's could be more gripping.

I also don't like the downtime. Three players seems the best count, but even with two there's little to concern yourself with off-turn.

I do think the theme is better served than any DW board game previously published. And it is a well-balanced experience, if a bit long.

I was part of the Demo Team at Origins; GF9 has made a very playable thematically correct game.  Excellent components that represent each of the included Doctors in the base game.  It is semi-cooperative, in that all the Doctors are opposed to the Daleks, though they still want to edge out over the other incarnations.

Race against the Daleks to reach Gallifrey by completing missions on Earth and around the universe -- with the help of companions along the way. Each companion is connected to specific Doctors (just like the TV series) BUT your Doctor will change when regeneration occurs, allowing for a moment or two of power shift and chaos just like the series.

PLUS: strong theme, good cooperative play
MINUS: base game needs more Doctors to really cause shifts

So much potential, but in the end half you time is spent counting dice while the other players just wait around. Feels way to restrictive in the push your luck aspect. Was hoping for a Doctor Who themed Elder sign, but the flow just wasn’t there at all

The theming of the cards and the travelling is well done, but the resolution of the dilemmas seems kind of bland as there is a very limited amount of different outcomes and the semi-cooperative nature of the game doesn't make any kind of sense.

Ugh.  I really really really wanted to like this game.

There are just too many random elements that the game provides no meaningful decisions.  Randomly draw a new companion, randomly draw a location, randomly draw dilemmas.

The game has a serious run away leader problem.  Once a player gets a little bit behind, the penalties continue to pile up making it very difficult to catch up.

The semi-coop element is pretty meaningless.  Players behind have no real incentive to help since the best that can happen is you just don't fall further behind.  The smarter move is to not help and let the leader fail or the game win.

I'm coming into this game with no small prejudice.  The base game is half 11th Doctor and 12th Doctor, my two least-favorite iterations of the character.  The 1st and 4th Doctors are great, but under developed.  Indeed, the entire game is presented through the lens of Steven Moffat's version of the show, which is basically the opposite of a selling point to me.

All of that being said, let me try to address the actual mechanics and game play separately from thematic elements.  Parts of this game were actually more fun and interesting than they initially seemed to be.  Depictions of different locations was incredibly simple, but generally effective.  The different time zones in each location was less effective, as there wasn't really a connection between the two locations other than the occasional Dalek figure to fight.  Additionally, the complete and random disconnect between the locations and the dilemmas was extremely problematic.  These issues aside, it was a very strong presentation.

On the other hand, the game itself just isn't a lot of fun to play.  Building a dice pool, manipulating it in minor ways, and hoping for the best was mediocre at best.  It says something when the game is more fun to look at than to play.  This game was just bland to play.  Challenging, sure.  But boring.

I'm hoping it is better with 3+, but as a 2-player game, I found this to be very disappointing, given the number of delays and reconfiguration (6-player game down to 4) prior to release.  In many ways, it plays like a DW-themed Elder Sign, using a Yahtzee-like mechanic to defeat Dilemmas at the various locations, picking up companions and equipment cards to add to and alter your dice pool, and a simple victory track where the various Doctors race against the Dalek menace.  All in all, not _necessarily_ a bad game, but, like Elder Sign, I'd probably find it incredibly dull as a solo game.

This game makes me wonder if the dice game craze has run its course. There's nothing wrong with it, I suppose, and it has Timey Wimey Doctor Who goodishness all up inside it. But you're still basically just rolling a smallish bucket of dice and rerolling or changing the faces a bit to try and match some symbols.

There's a logic to the rolling and rerolling, for sure, as each color dice represents a skill, and each character has more or less of each skill. But still...roll, reroll, change face, match a set of symbols.

It's also too long for what it is, which is...did I mention this part...roll, reroll, change face, match a set of symbols. No amount of Whoviness or Whoosity or Whoification can change that. Cutting the play time and reducing the downtime would help a lot, although there is a mechanism that allows players to assist out-of-turn if asked for help. Bonus points for that.

I've also seen essentially this same thing before in Warehouse 13, which is a not bad game about science fiction stuff and rolling, rerolling and changing die faces and matching sets of symbols.

This is a better theme, but it's pretty much the same game minus the traitor.

I'm not a Dr. Who fan at all, but I found myself really enjoying Time of the Daleks. As others have said, this feels very much inspired by Elder Sign, though the mechanisms here are a tad more convoluted. At least seemingly so from reading the rule book. I'm sure as I spend more time with the game this will be less of an issue. The only major knock I have against this game is that it is largely solitare. In fact, I would almost rather play this that way, despite what the box says. Only one doctor (player) can win, but you are trying to keep the Dalek ship from reaching the end of the track. It's a little odd that this isn't fully cooperative, and I do think that will turn some off. Between the randomness of the card draws and dice rolls, I'm not sure that there is a lot of skill here. Despite that, I enjoy this game...even more so than Elder Sign. It's a simple design, despite the poor rule book, but it satisfies that dice chucking itch in a mostly competitive atmosphere.

Enjoyable Dr Who game.  Given the rising prices of games these days this one is surprisingly inexpensive.  OK, the cards are a bit thin but they're fine.  The miniatures are good and the Doctor minis do actually look like the characters.

The game itself is a fun dice pool managing thing.  The game play didn't blow me away but it was an enjoyable experience and I'd play it again.  Would like to get more Dr characters but probably wouldn't recommend playing with more than 4 players.

I was expecting mediocre mechanics and strong theme.  I got mediocre theme and slightly above mediocre mechanics.  I didn't have high expectations, but I was still disappointed.

The characters cards are done well -- they evoke a lot of them and history with just a few simple mechanics.  The location/conflict cards are incredibly boring and uniform for a game with such rich source material.  Why does losing to the cybermen advance the daleks?  Why does losing to the sontarans have the same effect as losing to the weeping angels?  How can you make something so drab from a show that is all about wild and crazy stuff?

But the dice rolling & rerolling is surprisingly adequate, if only there had been good theme to prop up with it.  The 'fixed point' mechanic that prevents rerolls is boring, as it removes the one real piece of agency you have, and it occurs blindly and randomly.

Time of the Daleks is not a perfect game, and it is not the definitive one we might have hopes for from GF9. But it is a lot of fun, and it does right by its license. I especially like how it faithfully places emphasis on relationships between the Doctor and his companions. Everyone brings something to every situation, and there's a real sense of loss when a Doctor regenerates and those relationships are suddenly not as strong. I also like the dice resolution system a lot, even if its hardly original.

I wish there was more content in the base game. As it is, only four Doctors really limits the scope of the experience. The semi-cooperative gameplay was also not the way to go, because it leaves the door wide-open for someone to tank the game because they don't want someone else to win. That's not just unthematic, it's the exact opposite of how the Doctor would behave. But played with the right mindset and with appropriate expectations, Time of the Daleks is a lot of fun.

While I love the Doctor Who theme, and usually am a really big fan of Gale Force 9's games, I do not feel that the theme of Doctor who is present in the game, which is what I have otherwise come to expect from GF9. The game is okay and with the Doctor who theme plastered all over the game, I am still enjoying the game so far. But it desperately need some expansions with more incarnations of the Doctor, because the regeneration does not work well with only 4 doctors.

But with GF9's track record of making great expansions I am still cautiously optimistic about this game.

As a Doctor Who fan, I like this, but as a gamer, I think the system is a little too repetitive and long to be really good.

What would probably have been of more interest is dilemmas that affect the dice you have rolled - forcing re-rolls or something as well as non-alien events peculiar to Earth (like the pure historical).  Also mechanics that prevented the non-canonical team-ups of companions with Doctors before they actually met him/her.

As a huge fan of the reboot (I haven't had the chance to see more than two episodes of the original, so can't tell either way on that), I was naturally very intrigued when I heard about this. Having since seen a few reviews and read some more details on the gameplay, I'm not sure at all anymore. It seems like it [i]could[/i] be pretty good, but it seems more likely it's just a mediocre game dressed up with a popular IP… :(

I certainly would like to play it though, given the chance :)

Fun semi-cooperative dice chucker. Captures the Dr Who theme very well. I like the fact that you change Doctors by regenerating. Various powers are fun. The dice manipulation keeps the luck down of the dice rolling. Overall fun though I do think Doctor Who fans will enjoy this one more than other board gamers. The negatives are, first the components are horrible. GF9 should be ashamed of their products lately. Next it seems to easy. I never lost a challenge and the person who didn’t fell so far behind they couldn’t catch up. Needs some difficulty tweaking.

I've only got one play under my belt so far, but it was fun. I hope that this will grow with each expansion, and that we'll see the 9th, and 10th Doctors very soon. Its first impression was good, and it seems like a very hard game to beat, as the players must cooperate to a point to keep the Daleks at bay, and build up their strength by collecting companions enough to go at it alone.

Sadly there are a few component issues. The player "boards" are basically paper, the Timey-Wimey cards, which are held in hand, are of a size that doesn't have any card sleeves available for them. Worse than that, all the cards are basically so thin that they require premium sleeves not to become bent, and creased. 

8x Time Anomaly cards: 80x122 mm (Dixit-sized sleeves).
15x Earth Companion cards: 65x90 mm (Poker-sized sleeves).
12x Alien Companion cards: 65x90 mm (Poker-sized sleeves).
4x Doctor Who cards: 65x90 mm (Poker-sized sleeves).
4x Reference cards: 65x90 mm (Poker-sized sleeves).

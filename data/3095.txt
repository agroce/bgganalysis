Played this with Steve early on at Trashfest!  Really fun game, though somewhat bizarre system that's the opposite of Tales of the Arabian Nights, in that your characters lose skills as the game continues, instead of gaining them.  

I'm not much of a Trekkie, but the game had great scenarios and was a blast.  The 2-player limit is the only thing that kills it for me, since I don't think I'd get a lot of play out of it.  

It seems very faithful to its source material.

I've gotten to play this just a couple times, years ago. I look forward to playing it again, though I fear the paragraph-based adventure portion of the game may not withstand frequent play, since one will likely re-encounter the same adventures and remember the possible outcomes. One's familiarity with the original series is also a huge factor, as the adventures are drawn directly from episode plotlines. The gameplay is quite enjoyable, though, employing a mix of mechanics, and the game may be one of the strongest [i]Trek[/i] games ever at capturing the feel of the series.

Major thumbs-down to the person who stole my beloved copy I'd had for roughly half my life and had played with my brother many many years ago, but big thumbs-up to the person who felt the pain of my loss and procured another copy for me just to be nice.

Okay.  Map is cool and it has an old war-gamey feel with flying your chit-ships around carrying your chit-crews.

But, the adventure missions are kind of lame.  Power use is either obvious or random.  Especially so for the Klingon choices.

RATING: 5
This paragraph driven boardgame uses the reader's back knowledge
of the old TV show to good effect. There are many times in the game
that you have to think back to the series to figure out what would be
the best choice. Overall, the adventure book is well written and its always fun to put together your away team. The planetary adventures are quite short affairs but they really capture the spirit of the old show. However, the war game / boardgame part of this game is pretty darned weak. The movement rules are fine but the delegate / agent rules are quite combersome and silly.

RATING: 8
Excellent paragraph-driven game by Greg Costikyan. The adventures are well developed, mostly original, and even provide different spins on some based on the original series episodes. Though the game is listed for only 1 or 2 players, this actually makes a decent "party" game for a group of gamers with each player piloting a ship with a skeleton crew (or one who plays Captain while assigning a different player to lead each landing party). Note: The game actually melds two systems. The primary one is the paragraph-driven system, the secondary one is the more wargame-oriented sabotage system, where players try to sabotage one another's ships and bases. The Federation player typically is at an advantage in the paragraph system, but the Klingons are favored on the wargame side. This integration of two important systems is often overlooked in reviews. If you love all things Trek, give this game a 10.

RATING: 7
Great 'adventure' game for 2. Only problem is you learn all the adventures (planets) after about 3-4 plays and then you have to put it away until you've forgotten them! This needed an expansion or 2. Slightly balanced in favour of the Federation - but playing the Klingons is more fun!

RATING: 7.5
Despite its age, this is a surprisingly fun adventure game, provided you know TOS pretty well. The stories really do come to life, and you can get into character pretty easily within the basic framework of the rules. I feel like the game is a little imbalanced in favor of the Federation player, especially because it's not easy getting spies onto Federation ships, much less sabotaging them effectively, and the Klingon commanders seem to end up killing half of each other off by the end of the game. 

I wish a little more thought had gone into the design of the of skills for each challenge, especially with the unique or rare abilities of certain races/crew members. Hostile Klingon skills like threaten never seem advisable when compared to the more peaceful methods of the Federation. Maybe I haven't played enough to know.

Bought in 1985, played again in 2015 with my teenaged son.  A great game.  Those SPI/West End/Victory Games paragraph adventure games have aged very well...  Once you play a couple of turns, the game goes by quickly.  Lots of fun, esp. if you are a fan of the original series.

Okay game.  Mechanics are really very good (and production values are better than expected) but the story driven aspect of the game is pretty random, and the stories will get repeated after a few games.  Not a bad romp for a few games but no staying power for me.

If you're a big time nerd like me, then Star Trek: The Adventure Game is right up your alley.  This is an excellent, easy to play game that really captures the atmosphere and ideology of TOS-era Trek.  The game system is smooth, well-developed, and never gets in the way of a good time.  It definitely imparts a sense of adventure and the paragraph-based stories are always amusing (particularly when read in funny voices) and offer a couple of tough choices.  The only real downside is that the game feels like it could have used some expansions and maybe a little more detail in spots but over all this is a great game that will delight two nerds for about 2 hours or you can actually play it by yourself.  The game is actually still available new in shrink from Intergalactic Trading Company as of 8/06.

SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
2 Player Maximum
In Star Trek: The Adventure Game. You either play as the Federation or the Klingons. At the start of the game you determine which officers with which skills are assigned to your fleet of four ships. You move to unexplored stars and explore planets by drawing planet tokens. The planet tokens have a name of a planet and on the first page in the paragraph book you read about the planet and roll a six sided die to determine the general direction of the events on that planet.
You are offered a few choices, some specific to the Federation or Klingon. It is like a choose your own adventure story. The skills of the officers occasionally give you more choices to deal with the situation.

The game is all about the story. Not much strategy or tactics. You can play different sides, 40 planets to explore with different adventures on those 40 planets.

I think it is easier to play Federation side. When making a decision, ask yourself "What would Captain Kirk do?" Klingon side, there is not a role model to follow.

After a few plays it felt predictable.

Amazingly deep and thematic "Star Trek" game that features "Tales of the Arabian Nights"-style game play.  The components are pretty lame but it's fun to crew star ships, send them hurtling across space and beam down landing parties to encounter the unknown.  Shows it's age but still pretty faithful to the original show.

An interesting idea for a game (Tales of the Arabian Nights with a Star Trek theme) but it just made me want to play ToTaN instead. I don't know why I love the crazy randomness in that game but can't abide it here, but there you go.

One of the holy grails of Star Trek collectors this game is really worth finding. Not so interesting as a solitaire game but really a competitive game book. Nearly all the adventures are based on the old series shows. The agents rules for Klingons are a mess, but apart of that the games works well with astonishingly streamlined rules. And yes, you will understand WHY Kirk always had to be in the landing party....

RATING: 6
Although the picture makes it look like a hex-and-counter space wargame, it's actually a story-telling game very similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights. 

One player is the Federation and the other the Klingons. Each explores the universe and has encounters on planets. These encounters develop based on your decisions and the skills of the landing party sent down. The opposing player reads the scenario and outcome from an Adventure book, and the results range from losing crew members to gaining influence over the planet. The goal is to have the most influence by the end.

Although we didn't have time to play a full game, I really appreciated the thought that went into the game. With updated player-aids, I think it could be a pretty fun game. Many of the scenarios are pulled straight out of the Classic Trek universe, but they mixed up the results so that you can't predict what the best course of action is.

I'm a fan of Star Trek, the origional series, and story telling games.  This being both, is something I really enjoy.  I really like the solo rules system.  If you are looking for a good game that uses the story telling mechanic (and can't afford a copy of Arabian Nights!), give this one a try.

Compared occasionally to West End's Tales of the Arabian Knights, since both are paragraph driven games.  ST: The Adventure Game is a pale imitation with very simple game mechanics with little strategic pay-off.  I really have no interest in ever playing it again, though reading through the paragraphs might be interesting.

Michael Barnes suggested this one to me and I am so glad I picked it up.  This is a Choose-Your-Own Adventure Board Game!  The game has its problems (knowing the episodes in depth can make it really easy, lack of expansion, only two players), but it is just so much fun.

The game was made before the Next Generation came on TV, so some names of the Klingon items have changed dramatically.  Non-obsessed fans will never know this though.  I'm a recovering ST fan, I swear it.  I went through the rehab, and they declared me "slightly abnormal" now.  

Even non-fans might like this game though.   The paragraph structure and narrative of the game makes it far different than anything on the hot lists right now.

I'm sure theme has a lot to do with my rating but this is a real good Star Trek game for the fans of the old series. I love exploring the planets, preparing my away team {always take some red shirts} and seeing what happens based on my desisions. It's a bit easier for the federation player as they know many of the shows and their outcomes. Can be a challenge for the Klingon player. The "choose your own adventure" style works well here and you can play it solo, always a plus in my opinion. Have had a lot of fun with this one, if your a fan buy it NOW, you can always find it cheap on e-bay.

A good game for Star Trek fans. As you get to each planet you pick your landing crew (including security guards)and then play out a mini scenario where you read a passage and decide what action (from 2 or 3 choices) to take.  Works well as a solitaire game as well. The two player games missed the trick of actually ahving the Federation fight the Clingons though.

RATING: 8
One of the under-used story book games. Love the concept even without taking in the Trek theme. It does tend to reward the Federation player more than Klingon but playing the Klingons as a spoiler to the Feds is just as fun. If played too much in a row a person can memorize some planets but the use of skills keeps you from completely controling your fate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I had a whole lot of fun playing this game, but I only recommend it to Star Trek fans.  It combines a Cold War inspired game of political influence - the Klingons and the Federation are  vying for power by influencing satellite planets - with a choose your own adventure style story game.  There is *NO* direct confrontation, which is actually pretty great and fits the theme well.  I'm not sure that the Klingon spy powers really work so well as a game mechanic (it's a bit like Pandemic OTB bio terrorist), and they don't make up for the Klingon other weaknesses, so the game is balanced for the Federation.

The choose your own adventure style stuff is a lot of fun, especially for the Klingon side.  They're usually plots taken right out of TOS, which is a weakness of the game, but as the Klingons you get to do some awful things that that make for good laughs - like executing Khan the moment you find him.

RATING: 5
Solitaire: This is a fun game, but not a great game. I suspect it'd be better with two, as a good chunk of the rules (agents and commissioners, diplomacy) are dropped in solo play, as is the need to compete with the other government.

That said, the stories are neat, the board is fun, and the simple components work well. I'd play it again, though it doesn't top my list.

In solo play, it seems like there's no reason not to pack one ship with as many officers as it will hold and just use that one to explore every turn. Which is appropriate to the show, but feels a bit funny when you have a fleet. (Another thing two players would cut down on.)

One game in: Well... it was kinda easy.  Decisions were straightforward: why break up the standard tv-show crew as away team?  I recall a geekbuddy really liking this one, so will try again, but not sure about it.

2017 update: Kind lame solo, I am afraid.  I always make the right decision.  Will try as the Klingons next time because a bit boring as crew.

The definitive Star Trek game. It's pretty sad that I had to go back to a game from the 80's to find something that has the Star Trek "feel" of exploration rather than all the ones out there that tackle the combat aspect, which isn't what Star Trek is about at all. Some mechanisms need to be house-ruled in order to modernize the game, but it's still great for a couple of Trekkies to pass the time.

After I graduated from college in New England I made the mistake of moving back home to the South with no plan and no job.  As a college professor these days I strongly urge my students NOT to do this.  Fortunately I had a friend in the same predicament.  We'd get together at his house, order a large pizza, and play this game until 1 in the morning.  Delaying the inevitable?  Sure.  Escapism?  You better believe it.  But even so, this game got played something like 30 times.  It was fun, escapist, and provided me with a social outlet.  After 5 months of feeling more and more pathetic my friend moved out to L.A., and I moved up to Boston to enter the world of "real work."

Paragraph system game where one player takes mighty Bill Shatner and the Enterprise crew, and the other player commands the dastardly Klingons. Explore planets, pick a landing party, make decisions. Good fun with the right opponent.

The only negative is that, as with all paragraph-based adventure games, you can only play a limited number of times before you learn the best responses, and game play suffers. Those first plays are great, though, and seriously: how many times do you play most games?

It's Tales of the Arabian Nights for Star Trek geeks (even produced by some of the same people). This is a fun game, especially if you're a Trek nerd. Just don't get caught up on winning and losing. Try to enjoy the story. As the Klingons, don't worry about reading the paragraph book, it will not help you. Stick to doing what Klingons do best, annoying the Enterprise crew.

Pretty good, but the fun part of the game is the adventure book, and the mechanics of dealing with the ships and crew and commissioners and so forth kind of get in the way sometimes.

Fun, but fiddly. You absolutely have to be a fan of Star Trek to really enjoy this one, but I am so I like immensely. Playing the Klingon is a little more difficult, but also much more straightforward - think kill them all! instead of diplomacy.

As far as narrative games go, this is a ways down the bunch.  The gameplay gets rather repetitive, and though it's got the same idea as [gameid=34119], it has a much smaller results book leading to a lot more repetition.  Even worse, the writing is not as good.  There's a few more decisions here, but honestly there's not a lot to recommend this game for more than the diehard original series Star Trek fans.

Seems somewhat lacking as a solitaire game; two-player seems far better.  There are some surprising and funny parts of the game, but it doesn't seem to have a very high replay value.  Playing makes me feel like I'm in one of the original Star Trek episodes.

Good stories and worthy of the Star Trek name.  A bonus that it's playable solo.  I've heard that it's tough to play the Klingons.

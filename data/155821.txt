RATING: 7
The draft of 7 Wonders/Sushi Go (to get your actions for the round) mixed with the dudes on a map of El Grande or Tammany Hall (which determines victory), and absolutely beautiful. The victory conditions are both interesting and one of the things that I think reminds me of something like Illuminati, Vast, or Munchkin; the first person to achieve them just isn't going to win cause the rest of us will kick you down. That's not necessarily bad, but it does require a certain sub-optimal play to ensure that you lag behind enough to exhaust everyone else first. Some folks dig that (I sort of do), others don't. In particular, I find the tied victories forcing another round helps strengthen that effect and help counter the natural tendency to efficiently race toward victory. I wish it took a little less time; the better we get at the game, the more ties between rounds we get, and the longer the game runs. Curious if after 5 or 10 plays with the game group, how that might change. Also not sure how the commitment element works in terms of strategy yet, need more plays... If a friend hadn't bought it, I probably would have knowing what I know now.

edit: After 5 games, we had one that lasted 8 rounds, with 5 ties in a row and the winner finally taking it on all 3 conditions and becoming the Bren. I actually think the suboptimal assumption of "ok, I'll get setup for no conditions, and then swoop in and score two conditions in a single round, late in the round" is how you prevent it. The Epic Tales are less than... Still really enjoy it, strong 7.

Seems like a good game overall but just born for me. I don’t like having to be aggressive in order to make progress. I was hit hard by multiple factions but early to mid game and put in a position where I just had to wait till the game was finished. King making seems like it could be a common occurrence. Pretty pictures but theme just laid on top of mechanics. This could easily be a space battle game where your fleets explore different sectors and control planets and space stations. Anyways, since I’m not an aggressive player I get taken advantage of in these game because game games like this reward people for being dicks.

I love nearly everything about this game. (Except the box art) the cards have excellent art and are a great size, the board tiles are beautiful the minitures are decent (the spears warp due to the soft plastic) the game mechanics are really fun. And the game plays really nicely, ok with 2 players better with 3 and best with 4.

Feels like playing passive and collecting red cards is too strong, feels like an anticlimactic win where you just overpower everyone with your hoard of reds.

Is really good with experienced players who know all the cards but new people just dont get it. 

Sold because Dadar owns it and its only fun vs experienced player anyway.

Exclusively with 3 players I think this game is fantastic. It's so tight and not nearly as kingmaker-y. When you add the 4th player cards the game is changed dramatically and can go on for round after round of everyone preventing the person who's claimed pretender to the throne for winning.

Amazing with 3. Miserable with 4.

RATING: 5
1st play: At the start of this play I didn't like this one.  I couldn't figure out how the actions fit together and drafting each round was a strange feeling.  As we got further into the game, I liked the way everything came together in a way I've never seen before - managing your action drafting to fit together into a cohesive plan.  The Epic Tale cards are wildly varied in power, which I'm not sure I love, but it did keep things interesting.  The next play will be very telling, as we'll have a better understanding of how everything fits together, and we'll have a better awareness of how important/unimportant various decisions actually are.

2nd play: Not sure if I like this one quite as much as the other Matagot games.  There's lots of drafting but the actions don't feel like they're big and plentiful.  Cards are mostly "Add a guy and look at a card" or "Move a troop".  The red cards seem very swingy in power and the Brenn token feels too important.  I think that with more plays this game would end up being very good, but I am not drawn to explore it that deeply.

The most elegant dudes on a map game I played, in the form of an innovative drafting card game with strong gameplay and no unnecessary cruft.

It plays fast (60-90 minutes) and produces plenty of action and drama, with unexpected moves and lots of tension. Good times!

The card art is wonderful, but not consensual. The tile card is much more bland, but that's ok for me, it avoids oversaturation.

This is the DOAM game you can play on a workday gaming night, and it even plays great 2 player.

The essential DOAM.

Love Inis, the expanding map is pleasing to the eye and never the same. For a dudes on a map game the combat takes a back seat to more deeper strategy where you can win even if you keep losing fights. Our first game I rarely won but I spread out and was able to win by having influence everywhere. VG design!

Many plays: Sublime. So good at all player counts. A game that will absolutely never leave my collection, and one of the better games of the decade. The game itself is superb, has such tension with the hand management and the drafting, but the presentation is so thoroughly good (the art! the tiles! The huge tarot sized cards!) that it sends it into the stratosphere. The minis are the weakest part of the presentation, but that is more or less negligible.

AWESOME blend of drafting, hand management, and area control. Loved it so much we played 3 games back to back to back at 2p when we first cracked it. Very much looking forward to plays with increased player counts, but 2p still is quite tense and good.

--I think this may actually be best at 3, though 4 is interesting as well, and the fact that it plays so well at all counts is another huge win for it. Interested to see whats coming with the 5th player expansions.

A standard 7 on a first play. I can see what it's trying to do, subverting normal area control with these multiple paths to victory, but it was all just so...boring? Nothing grabbed me like, say, Blood Rage was able to do. Or Kemet. Definitely wasn't above either of those two for me.

The art is gorgeous. It is by far the prettiest game that I own. The first game is pretty slow since everyone needs to get used to the innovative mechanics and all of the action cards available. Eventually though, the game becomes very strategic. The game play is fluid and without too much waiting time between turns. And the ending of the game has yet to fail in being suspenseful.

RATING: 6
A game that is so damned pretty that I really wanted to love it, yet couldn't bring myself to.  Inis' innovation is that while it's a dudes on a map game there is a degree of co-habitation; indeed one of the victory conditions is about others being present in areas you control.  What you can do on a turn is driven by a drafted set of cards and it's generally about expanding your population, moving them into areas (both known and unexplored) and attacking your rivals.  As others have commented it is a game that invites leader bashing and risks fizzling out with a win for she who was bashed the least or he who no one paid attention to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow. I think this game is quite good after one play. The two simple twists on card drafting - always drafting from the same 17 cards and allowing you to get rid of kept cards - really make the game hum. Once you play one round, you understand what the possibilities are, and you just get straight to the maneuvering for a victory (which feels quite a bit like Kemet).

Totally not my kind of game. 
Too unpredictable, and very frustrating when you tell players that if they don't do sth the other player wins - and they don't just because you said it - and the other player wins.
Some cards are too powerful, especially if on first round they are on first player first draft hand. In our game there was no possibility of changing first player. And he got Exploration all the time, so he won by lands, that were far too far from any of us.

I'm sure I won't play it again.

Can be hard to wrap your head around the win conditions but a truly unique area control game. I love the drafting mechanic and the extremely passive aggressive combat system. I also like that there are 3 different victory conditions with ties requiring fulfilling multiple conditions. It also looks beautiful.

RATING: 7
There are a number of positive aspect to this game including: the card drafting at the beginning of each round (who doesn't like drafting cards?!), the small, distinctive rewards that players get when controlling each of the terrains (small rewards for small victories is always nice), many and varied levels of interaction between players' pieces on the map (sometimes combat is initiated, while at other times, it is avoided), a fair number of interesting cards and card effects, a decent theme, an interesting passing mechanic, and three different ways in which victory can be achieved.  

The game has a quirky quality of almost automatically creating the grounds for imminent victory by the third or fourth round, a quality that I find amusing.  In all the games we have played (3 and 4 person games), the game has lasted approximately one hour.

That said, Inis, is a meeples scrum (dudes on a board) with battles being conducted using cards, and card effects which may (or may not) produce surprises during the battles.  And this is not a style of game (dudes on a board) I particularly have a strong desire to play.  

Nevertheless, bottom line: Inis is a quick, fun and interesting game design.

One of the most beautiful games I own. Very puzzle-y, but it often gives one the feeling that the puzzle is overly simple, yet hopeless. Is that good? I'm not sure yet, I need more plays. On the surface it feels like a streamlined version of Blood Rage.

Upgrade to 8: makes more sense with more plays. 

Downgrade back to 7.5: nope, still doesn't make sense. And Sometimes just takes too damn long.

Very elegant drafting and area control game.
Gorgeous art, simple rules, great depth.
There is only one problem...it needs to be played with people with the same experience otherwise a newbie is always going to lose (unless they gang up against the most experienced player). Also red card add a lot of randomness and can make your game a poor experience...but the game is not that long so...this is probably one of my least favorite "area control games that I cannot stop playing". A guilty pleasure, but in small doses.

Christian is amazing to work with. He has the greatest respect for theme, which I love.

I had to beg my gaming group to stop playing it so that we can playtest something else.

Inis is a wonderful game featuring tile laying, area control, and card drafting. The artwork for this game is particularly gorgeous. Every card is beautiful, drawing the player further into the theme.

Most of the components (tiles, cards, and tokens) are of good quality. That said, the minis are garbage. There's lots of detail, but the material they're made out of is prone to warping. For a game of this price, Matagot should be embarrassed.

The game also has one mechanical issue that any buyer should be aware of. There are three victory conditions, of these a player need complete only one. But after completing a victory condition, a player must declare victory, and then hold onto that victory condition for the remainder of a round. this means it's usually possible for other players to take away that victory condition. This is not always a bad thing, but it does mean that a game of Inis can potentially go on for several hours. 

None of this impacts my love for this game, but because of these issues it hits the table far less often than I would like.

Gorgeous and elegant area control, a worthy successor to Kemet and Cyclades. The card-driven mechanics might be a turn off to some players, especially how the Triskel and Action cards could consistently jerk victory conditions away from other players, but it's just another thing you have to think about while drafting and plotting in the Season phases. Hope they expand this, it's truly one of my favorite titles of 2016.

Absolutely breathtaking design, beautiful illustrations and perfect components. And even the game itself is a lot of fun. Very interactive, quite aggressive but still very varied in terms of possible strategies. The card draft at the start of each round adds a lot of tension and makes the game always feel fair. 
The victory conditions are a bit muddled and a surprise win can happen quite fast, ending the game somewhat abruptly.

The thing Inis has going for it (other than the art) is its card play mechanic. I love that there are only so many cards in the game and that they are all (or mostly all) used in a game. You know that X card is coming and you just don't know when!!

Combat could use some improving but it does force you into some excruciating decisions... do you sack your dude on the map or burn that card you've been holding on to?!

Large box.  Large inter-locking tiles.  Nice graphics but in two very different styles - cards/lid vs. tiles.  Celtic theme.  Card selection/draw.  Reasonably engaging.  Played two player.  Only used 5 land tiles.  Green 'action' cards are cycled through and become familiar.  Three victory conditions.  But very much a take that game which I am not fond of above two players - where all actions are against your single opponent.

Great mechanics.  You really have to let the game flow around you, tilting the rudder this way and that with the understanding that your course corrections are not guaranteed; adjusting your strategy as things progress.  It's really a test of flexibility and alternative planning for multiple situations.  Very clean and easy to learn; fantastically challenging to master.  Reminds me of Quantum in many ways (which was probably the best dice based game I have ever played), but with drafting.  Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like it tight and don't mind variance do not pass this up.  Art design is 10/10.

Another very nice "Euro-y dudes on a map" game from Matagot. Actions are simple but cleverly put together that lends itself to metagaming for those familiar with it.

With a good expansion I think this game could really soar, but still quite enjoyable with just the base.

Quite a fascinating twist on the usual dudes-on-a-map area control game. The combat isn't the focus but instead it's more like a balancing act through the clever use of the limited cards. Drafting your "actions" is brilliant. Not only are you trying to get cards you want but you're often thinking about what other people might want and trying to deny them those cards as well. Then when you go to play your action cards is an interesting game in itself. With only 13 cards (17 in 4p) you quickly figure out what cards might be played and so carefully choosing how you play your hand is a major element to this game. Passing when you have a whole hand of cards is not uncommon. I am a fan of the art in this game although I can respect it won't win everyone over. The map tiles are also pretty neat. After playing this at all player counts, I think the game scales really well. The 2p game is a tense back-and-forth but with 3/4 players there's more to think about. The potential for kingmaking exists in larger player counts but I haven't found it to be a major issue as mini-alliances form to take down leaders. Overall the game has lots of great things going for it but the one area I can see being problematic are the Epic Tale cards. These cards are cool and fun but also have a large element of card-draw luck involved. Some cards are simply better than others and drawing the more powerful cards may swing things quite a bit or even win someone the game. For a game that can last two hours, that potential for swingy luck is problematic and may turn some people off.

-Minis feel flimsy.
+General Aesthetic is great. Each card has it's own unique artwork.
~Tiles can be off-putting for some but actually make sense gameplay wise
+Negotiations can be resolved quickly, it's up to the player(s) on how they wanna twist or complicate it.

Nicely designed and produced with a system unique to my game experience.  If this were one of a few games available to play then the following opinion would not apply.  However, with hundreds of great games to choose from, I will pass on this one.  It suffers from what I dislike most in current game releases.  That is, technically, this game could never end.  The number of turns in not fixed, there is no game length timer, and victory points can be taken away.  Now there are many other games that I regard highly that suffer from being without a fixed number of turns or fixed game duration, but at least in those games once a player attains victory points, those victory points cannot be taken away.  I know, I know, you say "how likely is the game to never end?"  I say, yes, but TECHNICALLY it could never end but that in itself is not the entire problem.  More specifically, games that could technically never end and allow victory points to change ownership have a way of putting the players in a situation where everyone does nothing while waiting for some other player to blink.  When that player blinks, the game will punish that player for it.

These comments are based on one three player game; so take them with a grain of salt.

I'm not a big "dudes on a map" type gamer, but I had heard some positive accolades on this title. So when I was offered a play, I was curious to know what the hype was about. 

Well, the game left me with a "meh" viewpoint towards it. It's basically a drafting and area control game with an abstract feel when you take away all the bell and whistles. Although there are some interesting things going on with the drafting, it becomes repetitive after a few rounds. I guess the small amount of cards being drafted makes for a quick learning curve, but what does it do for replayability? Also, the surprise of "I play this card and knock you out" just didn't sit too well with me.

The back and forth at the end of the game trying to avoid your opponents from winning seemed to drag on a little too long. And the clincher; I was left with the kingmaking decision of deciding which of my two opponents do I give the victory to. That's never a good thing in my book.

All that said, there are some interesting decisions to be made and the components are very good. I could see why some people would love this game and although I would play it if asked, it's not one that I would seek out on my own.

Played 4 player game. its okay... nothing special... my main problem was that one player eventually had to decide who to let win. We were in the situation that two players were able to finish the game but not both (if more than one player meets the same amount of winning conditions -> tie and continuation of the game).

Similarly, during the game one player had to choose to either allow for a tie between two players and therefore to continue the game or by being bored of the game to let one player win. That really sucked... 

So I would play again, if someone asks, but wouldnt be my first choice. Surely, would never buy myself.

Nice art though...

The good: Short and still interesting rules, not a lot of exception or stuff like that. 
The bad: Only short term planning due to drafting, many stupid "take that" cards, some actually totally useless and just for that "take that" feeling, half of the game is spend building up the other half is spend preventing someone from winning (like in Munchkin and Cosmis Encounter). Overall I was lucky when the game ended and have no desire to play it again.

Any game that allows direct conflict of any kind should award the players who take the hard road, not hurt them: yet Inis does exactly this, it penalizes the aggressive players, as fighting helps those uninvolved in the combat only.

In the end, Inis is a slog where the player who’s apter at planning can easily build his path to victory: he can even commit all of his attention to his own strategy ignoring everyone and everything else, as that rule that requires the player who triggered a victory condition to state he’s winning is there to call the master planner back from his solipsistic brooding and thus make his job even easier.

“One is reminded in this connection of a story concerning Kobori-Enshiu. Enshiu was complimented by his disciples on the admirable taste he had displayed in the choice of his [art] collection. Said they, "Each piece is such that no one could help admiring. It shows that you had better taste than had Rikiu, for his collection could only be appreciated by one beholder in a thousand." Sorrowfully Enshiu replied: "This only proves how commonplace I am. The great Rikiu dared to love only those objects which personally appealed to him, whereas I unconsciously cater to the taste of the majority. Verily, Rikiu was one in a thousand among tea-masters.”

Surprisingly it seems like I do not like area control/dudes on a map games. I thought that this was a lot better than Kemet but in the end it's just a constant stalemate with everyone waiting for someone to make that decisive mistake.

RATING: 7.5
Rated this lower before, but having played it three times now, the beauty of the design begins to dawn on me. It has a very simple rule set but pretty deep play. The mechanic of action card drafting for manipulating your clan members on the board is so well thought out. The three victory conditions combined with gathering "deeds" as wildcards is a very clever way to open up different strategies. This game needs to be played more than once to be appreciated.

I would think the balance is best for four players. That's also when all action cards are used. It certainly needs the right player group to shine. Since there's so much player interaction there's not much place for AP-prone players. When turtling too much i gets a bit boring. It's better played intuitively but with a keen eye on how all the card effects intertwine. Oh, and timing. Timing is *the* key to winning.

There are many subtleties in the card combinations and the art of playing this well is flying under the radar. Using diplomacy and red herrings for distracting opponents of your plans and striking when no one sees it coming. That's hard to do since most information is in plain sight for everyone. Utilizing your Epic Tale cards together with Advantage cards on just the right moment is the way to surprise your opponents. And after taking a shot for glory, there's hoping no one has an Epic Tale card to take away your precious victory.

Pretty good game this. Also pretty. I doubt I'll ever be any good at it though.

Excellent thematic game. Takes one game to understand the mechanics and numerous thereafter to work out how to play tactically. Very intriguing puzzle, particularly one on one, like a game of cards that maps onto a board and where careful application of the available possibilities can turn around fortunes all throughout the game. No reliance on dice makes this much more a game of skill. A great package of theme, gameplay and wonderful psychedelic artwork.

I expected a decent degree of chaos with the card play, which  dominates the area control - much like in El Grande. Except that cards are drafted by passing as in 7 Wonders. But it's tighter than 7 Wonders in that you are only keeping four cards so your margin of error is thinner. The outstanding feature is the end game conditions for winning - three different ways - that allow for subtle moves. However, a player is forced to warn opponents of their status for the end game by taking an action - taking a special token that will allow them to claim victory - and also allow the opponents to stop them. Unique game that I want to play again.

Very impresed with this game, the negotiation in it makes the gameplay very diverse for having such a small core of cards. A negative might be that as the game progresses it becomes harder to tell how long the game will last. The Deed tokens really start to ruin your math, and I'm not sure yet if I find that a drawback to the game, or a great feature. A very rewarding and "different" area control game, absolutely gorgeous production, too.
EDIT: I've dropped my rating a bit; I really don't like the check-mate feeling of the endgame, trying to stop everyone else from winning long enough for you to benefit from someone else's mistakes. Still, great energy and heart-racing tension to this game, and that is something a bit unique.

Not my cuppa tea at all. Generally dislike drafting games, but make exceptions to the rule when other mechanisms in the game are more enjoyable - i.e. I rate Sushi Go 2/10 but Seasons 9/10, for example. Played Inis in the hope that the area control etc would make up for the draft, but ended up being disappointed. Found the dynamic of the game incredibly odd and actually uncomfortable at points (played with a new group) due to the passive-aggressive nature of conflicts during the game. Obviously can't judge this categorically after one play, but there was an entire deck of cards that you have to work relatively hard to draw from - all of which have exceptionally powerful abilities. However, every single one I drew was utterly useless to me - to invest a turn to earn one of these cards, only for it to be utterly useless seemed incredibly odd - and it didn't seem to be down to my inexperience, as all other players at the table pretty much ignored this deck. I might play this game again in the future, just because I absolutely adore the artwork - I would even pay for a few prints for the walls tbh - but the gameplay itself did absolutely nothing for me during my first game.

RATING: 5
Really not our type of game. I am not a fan of drafting-heavy games due to the high degree of memory required. Luckily, it's not too big of a problem here because the deck is so small. I am also not a big fan of swingy card play ("Ha ha, you don't get to play your card!"), which theoretically is also mitigated by the draft.

The problem is that this game just feels arbitrary to me. If you don't get closer to victory from placing units or conquering territories, you probably will come closer by building citadels or sanctuaries. For me, it is not a good sign in a direct-conflict game if someone can win without ever having begun a conflict. 

Now I know someone will tell me that they could whoop my behind at this game because there is skill involved, and I don't doubt that. But if you can win by doing something, or doing nothing, or fighting, or hiding, there's just no tension for me. This is like a monster-sized version of Love Letter, but a hand of LL at least has the advantage of ending in five minutes.

Very vanilla expansion/conquest game, sort of in the mold of Cyclades but with a card-drafting engine. Sunk by very incremental actions which make for a tedious pace of play, and by the fact that combat is extremely attritional and so players who fight will knock each other out (seriously? It's 2016 and we're still designing games like this?). I didn't personally like Cyclades, but I found it tolerable; this is just incredibly boring. Features some of my least favorite hack-designer tropes, like an event card that lets you search the discard pile and reclaim a previous event card, and event cards where the text is "play to draw three event cards and pick one to keep".

Inis is a really interesting blend of card drafting and dudes on a map, where the cards you draft dictate what types of maneuvers and actions will be available to you in a given game round. You'll use your maneuvering to position yourself to be the first to reach one of the three possible win conditions, while trying to prevent your opponents from doing the same.

Each round, nearly all of the cards are drafted, so with experience, you start to be able to plan what your best moves are based on what cards have been played or not played. However, there are still some neat and surprising twists, as another type of card (that is not part of the draft) can enter play through various means, keeping things from being completely predictable, which keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The only part of Inis that I'm not a huge fan of is the end game, which tends to struggle a bit from feelings of kingmaking in typically close games. It's always up to someone to prevent someone else from winning, which can feel a bit off when multiple players are in contention.

Overall, Inis hits a sweet spot by offering players lots of meaty decisions with relatively few rules (you could teach this game in 5-10 minutes, and be playing). I'm generally not a fan of dudes on a map games, but this one is very good!

In a clash, the initiate does not get to place their clan in citadels. Only the other players can place clan members in Citadel.  Thus in a two person clash, the citadels will only be occupied by the other player's clan.  Also the winning condition of chieftain over 6 other clans, can be fulfilled over multiple territories e.g. territory 1 has 3 green, 2 red, 1 white and territory 2 has 2 green, 1 red, 1 blue, 1 white - green can take pretender token etc.

Smooth game that doesn't crack open your skull and tickle your brain immediately. Lots of cool little things that have you nodding along but nothing as dramatic or mind blowing as something like Blood Rage.

Then you get 3/4ths of the way through your first game and that warm fuzzy feeling creeps over your body as you're buzzed and feeling good. Everything starts to click and the emergent depth seizes hold. 

Very satisfying game that injects negotiation, map expansion, and thoughtful action drafting into the mix. Sophisticated as a mother.

Preliminaryish thoughts after a couple of plays.

This is one of those games with emergent depth that is right interesting out of the gate. Being interesting from the first play is something I basically require, but because so much of its depth and balance are obfuscated your first few plays it's hard to judge. What I can tell you is this is this is tense and delicious and I can't wait to play more. I can't tell you how well it holds up over the long haul (yet), but I'm hopeful.

I usually don't care for drafting games but drafting really works here, because the cards are your ONLY actions. This wouldn't matter if Inis weren't a totally solid dudes on a map game first and foremost, and it most definitely is. Your main focus is on the board and what you're trying to accomplish there, and the cards are simply a means to an end. This makes the draft totally agonizing, as there will always be more things that you want to do than you're able - and anything you [i]don't[/i] do goes to your opponents.

Not sure how I would rank it compared to Kemet or Forbidden Stars yet but so far I am happy to own all three.

It's difficult to describe what makes this game so good, but I will try nevertheless: it's a game of subtlety and careful consideration that rewards high level tactical thinking, immaculate timing and high level strategy.

(Based on 3 plays. Rating is likely to go up) I really love how far combat has come in board games. From the early days of Risk to Kemet and Cyclades to Cry Havoc and Scythe combat has evolved for the better and does not need dice. Having said that I really love how Inis delivers it. 1) Stay and lose a clan member or 2) lose an action card or 3) hide out at the local citadel or 4) retreat where you are chieftain or 5) Use an Epic card. Think about this, you have five choices when an attack is instigated against you. I cannot wait to see how this plays out with four. Throw in the Epic cards and you have a game that will seemingly grow into a masterpiece with future expansion. Seems I am in the minority with the artwork and theme, which I happen to love. The rulebook is lazy and leaves a lot to be desired as I find more and more questions popping up with each play. and thus a Forum list with 174 entries so far. A PDF revised version would be nice.

Rated 7 after one play. Not bad! Of the "trilogy" of this, Cyclades and Kemet, this felt least like a "dudes on a map" game and more like an area control game such as El Grande. Combat is extremely abstracted, and the fact that players can both agree to coexist means that you're only really combating if it is directly a part of your plans.

The drafting was interesting, the interweaving of win conditions was interesting... I didn't fall in love with it but there's enough here to peak my interest in giving it another shot.

Hard to define where Inis fits in, as no game really compares to it. Downside to Inis is it takes some time (and plays) to actually figure out what is going on. Once grasped, the game is very fun and very strategic. Good option for players that aren't too cutthroat but still want some conflict with a lot of strategy. The game is almost in the same realm as Go. A beautiful ebb and flow of concessions, compromises, adjusting and positioning. If Go is too boring, you can have a similar game with beautiful cards and artwork in Inis. Everything is brilliantly balanced, with no card being able to go unchecked if played in position or the precise time. Constantly need to be aware of the cards in play and in other player's hands. Deceptively complicated and complex, yet accessible and fun.

Solid, compelling design. The game is sure to frustrate and disappoint many players. Why? Because winning requires aggressively playing your opponents. Very mean. The draft is spectacular. It takes a few rounds for players to get a sense of how the game works, but once you find your sea legs there is room to run here. The game is fixed on the "middle distance" between strategy and tactics.

What sets this game above standard area control fare is a.) the action card draft at the start of each new round, which ensures you'll always be playing and dealing with different actions, b.) the fact that players aren't necessarily forced into fighting with one another (at least not until one player is getting close to reaching victory), and c.) the gorgeous art. If there's a downside, it's that the cards all have a lot of text on them. Parsing all that info might be a turn-off to some. Otherwise, this one's a pleasure.

It was really different from what I've expected.
Both component wise -everything is bigger- and gameplay wise.
I expected something like Blood Rage or Kemet. Those are way more similar to each other than any of them to Inis.
This is the least noobie-friendly of any area control what I tried. Which is not a problem but the lack of more green cards can be. I feel the game needs more. Good game overall, I suggest a try.

RATING: 8
A terrifically enjoable area control game with an innovative drafting mechanic and simple, straightforward "combat". I initially thought the 'counterspell' card would be annoying, but selecting it carries a large opportunity cost and is never an obvious choice. Some of the Epic Tales cards feel much more powerful than other. The way the scoring works keeps players on their toes, ever watching out for one (or more) of the multiple winning conditions being satisfied by their opponents.

Inis is the better version of the modern light fighting games but still suffers from similar shortcomings. There is a strong balancing system in place where players can balance each other out, turning last couple of rounds into king making rounds for a random winner. It would be hard to be "skilled" at this game unless you play a 2 player version, which I have not tried.

On the upper hand, the graphics are awesome and the great art hides the fact that it's a simple hex map not unlike katan.

Notes:

Great game, sharing elements of Cyclades and Blood Rage. Lovely looking game with a strong theme. One of my favorite area control, dudes on a map style game. Players need to be aware and be ready to be able to counter opponents, as well as strengthening their own position for end game victory conditions.

RATING: 8
Pretty, interesting, and I feel like we barely scratched the surface of good play. Early game saw a lot of purposeless hitting people, which was quite irritating, but I think probably wouldn't have happened once we knew the game. You definitely have to be OK with playing a game in which your cards can be canceled / stolen / countered, though; if you hate that sort of thing then Inis will probably frustrate you no end.

The "Land" victory condition looks like it may mitigate the usual propensity for games like this to end up locked into "nobody can win" endgame slogs, which is good. (Also appropriate use of legend tokens, which nobody went for in our game.)

My rating may be high because we weren't able to finish our play, so I'm really curious to see how a full game plays out.

RATING: 9
There's a lot of depth here, and the strategy feels fun. Games are tight without it feeling contrived, and it ties up in just the right amount of time.  It's easy to teach because so many of the rules are on the cards. Great at 3 and at 4, haven't tried 2 yet. Only problem is that games that end in kingmaking are unsatisfying: it'll often come down to whoever started to win SECOND. Essentially everyone teams up on the first person to take a win con and then the second person can swoop in.

My current favorite area control game.  Having three separate win conditions is genius.  This game is perfect.  I can't think of a single thing that could be changed to make it better.

RATING: 10
First of all, Inis' graphic design is astonishing. From the box that many find to be pretty ugly(I've heard an opinion that it looks like a vomit splattered on the floor. Ugh, sorry :P), through the beautiful map tiles(the board looks really impressive) to the psychedelic artwork you can see on the cards. It's quite unusual but it speaks to me to the extent where I want to play this just for the aesthetical reasons. 

After two plays my first impressions are that it is NOT a typical area control game. It really differs from, let's say, Blood Rage or Chaos in the Old World. No victory points, instead you try to create a specific board situation. Fighting others may help you achieve your goal, but not necessarily, this is not a combat-focused game. Three possible victory conditions make this game really interesting and forces to look at everyone's moves carefully as anyone can pretend to a throne of Ireland just by playing one card in a right time. Time, time, time, it's all about proper timing, knowing when to play which card and I like that aspect a lot. How the passing works(more like skipping a turn, basically) only adds a flavour.

Having mentioned passing it's worth noticing that the game has several unique mechanisms. Typical drafting you say? Wrong! The thing that it is possible not to keep the card you've previously taken but pass it to another player and take the others instead seem to be minor and unimportant but trust me it's not. Concerning the action cards that you draft, they are very limited(17 only, fewer in 2-3 P) but it is an advantage to me, as you get used to them very quickly and you know what the others are capable of. This allows to learn the game in a short time. Second thing that I haven't seen in any other games are citadels that allow your clans to hide from an overly agressive enemies. What it means is it's hard to completely remove a player from his territory and he will always keep his presence there, which is important for many reasons. Last but not least, each territory has its own card that you can gain by maintaining the leadership of the place. These allow you to do some great things and are strong thematically(as everything in Inis, to be honest). 

I'm very hyped for this game summing it all up. For now, I just want to play it as much as possible. I think it won't replace Chaos in the Old World as it is an excellent game as well(both feel very different but are awesome in their own way), as for Blood Rage... I don't know, I think after having experienced Inis I won't be so keen on that one as I was used to. Time will tell everything, however.

Strong theme, beautiful graphic design, clever game-mechanisms, high interaction = 9 from me :)

EDIT: My previous feelings were all about a 3 player game. We played a 4-player game today, man it's even better. Inis has a really elegant design, everything seems to be on its place, to the extent that I'm afraid about the upcoming expansion(it has been confirmed if I remember well) as I'm not sure what could be added without overcomplicating the game - because really, the combination of such simple rules with nearly infinite possibilites is what makes Inis a truly great game. I am probably going to bump the rating to 10 as the game seems to be getting better and better each time we play.

Ce qui marque en premier quand on regarde la boîte, ce sont les illustrations. Elles sont plutôt originales et chouettes pour un jeu de ce genre. Car c'est la grosse sélection du mois. C'est un jeux Lyonnais (du CAListe Christian Martinez) qui se place dans les affrontements de clans celtiques irlandais. On est dans un jeu de placement, de majorité, d'affrontement, de psychologie, sur une mécanique de deckbuilding, le tout très bien imprégné dans le thème celtique. Un jeu où il ne faudra pas d'arrêter à la 1ere partie car la courbe d'apprentissage est importante. Que le meilleur Brenn gagne !

1 play. Amazing design, but.... if it had ended within the advertised 90 minutes it would have been a 9, +30 minutes an 8,  but it was at least 30 minutes beyond that.  People would go for the victory and be torn down, again and again. By the time the winner was determined, no one cared.

This was only one play, and I would try it again (with people who already new how to play). I am hoping that a more rapid victory might be achieved with experience players, but it might be the opposite. If play time accelerates this would be a top tier game. Art is beautiful, many very clever design decisions.

To me, an obvious ancestor to this game would be my beloved Cosmic Encounter.  But CE is more swingy... and speeds much faster to a conclusion.

Not sure yet if I like Inis or not. I bought it because of the good comments here and the positive review video in SUSD. We have played it three times now with my wife and we still cannot get hold of it.  To be honest, I spend most of the game yawning (yeah, not metaphorically but actually yawning). The game has been very (very) slow paced and there is no feeling that you are achieving something. And suddenly you notice someone has won. Maybe it will be more thrilling when played with more than two players. Nice game to have, pretty design. But only to be played when you cannot be bother with the setting up of a more elaborated game. Within the same kind of games, I would rather go for Ethnos.

I really wanted to like this game and played 4-6 times with three players. The first few times I enjoyed trying to learn and looking for strategies/tactics, learning cards etc.. Like many have noted, I started recognizing the "stop the leader" rush, at which point the whole game becomes just that. But there were other things that started to bother me that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I think oninoyakamo's review here in the comment section really sums up a lot of things I couldn't verbalize. I just kept thinking that they published this game too soon. I literally hate this game by now. Will see how to get rid of it.

Based on one play. The thing I probably liked most is that you can use action cards not only as actions but also as a defending mechanism in battles. Gives interesting dilemmas. I don't think I like the artwork: the box looks a bit amateuristic to me, the cards look nice, but the board has a totally different art style. Overall quite inconsistent. The theme was pasted on. In terms of gameplay: pretty nice, but I'd rather play other games that scratch the same itches for me. Game of Thrones, Scythe when I want area control with less interaction, or even Risk when I want to play something with less rules. So: OK, but not great for me.

It is a decent card draft /area control game however has a problem of the much intensified late game when anything can happen and it gets really chaotic with everyone competing to win and in the end it will be very easy to fall into kingmaker. Despite that it is enjoyable.

RATING: 6
There's not really anything *wrong* with this game; it's just very meh. If I want to play an area control/ empire-building game with action card drafting, Blood Rage is more flavorful, and Eight-Minute Empires has a quicker pace. This is better than Cry Havoc, although CH at least features a clever combat system. I think they were trying to be clever with Inis' battle resolution, but they didn't really pull it off.

The Celtic art and names are kind of interesting, but disappointing in that the game doesn't do much with them. Each event card features some figure from Irish history or mythology, but they include no flavor text to relate the character to the effect ("trade a card with somebody" or "put another couple of dudes on the map"). The generic units and random map tiles don't exactly impart the feeling of ancient Ireland, either.

The artwork reminds me of games from the late '70s or early '80s, but at my age, that's kind of a nostalgia bonus. :)

And that's not just because of the art! It really is a great example of elegant design: few rules, great depth.

Expect your first few plays to take 30-40 minutes per player. I'm sure the box estimate is correct when everyone knows the cards, but it's off for initial sessions.

Edit: 2 more plays and this game just keeps getting more and more fun. I love the pace, the length, true multiple victory conditions... I want to play the crap out of this game!

Enjoyable dudes on a map game that has some interesting decisions to make and plays in around an hour - looks pretty too.

There is some strategy in that during the early rounds you need to be positioning yourself to be within striking distance of a victory condition or two for turn 5 and beyond. After that it's all about tactical opportunism of making a lunge for the line whilst preventing others from doing so - hording some nice Epic Tale card combos from the early rounds will certainly assist in this as will acquiring some 'deeds'.

Good game.

RATING: 5
Honestly the game is okay.  In actual fact the rules are not the best in several situations.  Winning via clan dominance is only useful in a four player game or a 3 player game where some major mistakes are made.  

Really the win is done 90% of the time through sanctuaries versus the other 2 methods. 

Standard play almost invariably includes 3 sanctuaries in one zone with a number of citadels equal to one less than the number of total players.  This will invariably allow you to maintain that sanctuary count and unless your opponent gets the 1 epic card that allows attacks on citadels you will be able to maintain.

Epic cards are a MUST in game play.  The amount of power they provide far outweighs the rest and cards such as OTHER WORLD can be devastating.  This card is another game changer.

The rules of being able to place 2 clans in ANY territory when being eliminated is also devastating.  Make sure that you don't accidentally eliminate a player entirely as they will be able to place in the 2 most advantageous regions (almost invariably in the region with 3 sanctuaries and citadels) and move them from behind in the game to tied for the lead or at least very close to it.

The game is 90% about epic cards and sanctuaries and the rest of the game is really not as effective. 

Overall the game is easy to learn, quick to play but the rules leave much to be desired (IMHO).

A very nice blend of card drafting and area-control. Fantastic art combined with high quality game components, in-depth strategy and a unique theme. You can tell the designer poured their heart into it. The map pieces are some of the most unique I've seen, and they allow for a ton of map-variety. They also take up a lot of table space, so make sure you have enough room. There are 3 different winning conditions, so players have a lot of opportunity to mix and match strategies.

Played it at Essen:
- Combat is awkward and pretty dull.
- The pieces of scenery don't flow into each other, but are just loose pictures that don't combine at all.
- The use of cards instead of normal actions is clunky (There are almost no "normal" actions)
- The drafting of the 4 cards gives the illusion of control, but actually there is so much luck involved with it because of their only being 4 cards per player.
- You need to announce, that you think you'll win next round...

With two, Inis is such an elegant game.  It feels so, almost, minimalist, while at the same time so agonizingly hard to fully grasp as you watch each of your choices blossom into full blown consequences both in the near term and far.  Each game I've played has peeled back the layers bit by bit and I find myself thoroughly enjoying the process.  Just brilliant.

With four, I'm not as sure.  I finally played with more than two and the game is [i]very[/i] different.  I'll wait and re-assess after a few more plays, but some of the complaints I've read (kingmaking, randomness) started to look a whole lot more legit.

Love the way it uses drafting for actions and how new locations completely change the game with their special cards.

Overall, where there were parts I liked, but way more things that I didn't

What I liked: 
- the draft concept where you could pass cards you had earlier drafted if they didn't gel with what you got.  In practice though, this was almost never taken advantage of since the card you drafted first was probably the most powerful of the initial deal and so why would you get rid of it.
- Variable paths to victory
- Epic cards
- variable powers on the locations

What I didn't like: 
- No set ending, see below about a long game, but things can just continue to go back and forth for quite awhile until someone gets some slight advantage

- too few epic cards came out.  These changed things up so much in interesting ways, but they were so hard to get more than one or 2 into your hand, if at all

- too chaotic.  There were few cards that allowed you to move and fight, and so if someone is planning to win on a turn, they can either guarantee themselves a win by just hording the conflict causing cards, preventing others from coming to fight them, or by grabbing the Geis card which cancels another card.

- can be too long.  This doesn't work for my style of gameplay which tends to favor careful expansion and turtling some times.  This game is better with more players and when everyone is moving around all the time.

- the battles were very anticlimactic, since if no epic cards are played, both players just mentally figure out if they would end up with the most or tied clans, and if not, they just withdraw, so too few guys get removed

- the UNO win condition whereby you only win if you've spent an action to take a win token letting people know you are about to win.  That only rewards people to not pay attention and to suddenly gang up on the leader, thereby prolonging the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty fast playing area control type game. Though the main element of the game is in the drafting and not the in the are control. The combat is present in the game but it is subdued which I like.

The game is almost more a chess like game. It is very interesting but definitely needs a few more plays and probably more than 2 players to really shine.

Nagyon szép darab, de sajnos eleve eléggé nem nekem való, de még azon belül is egy elég rosszul sikerült darabnak érzem. A area influnce minden királycsinálós nyavalyáját maxra járatja, és ezen felül még egy rakat fura dolog van benne. Pl ez kombinatív draftolás tök jól hangzik, de élőben semmi értelme, mert 4 lapból sose fogsz kombinálni. Esetleg egy 7w érdekes lehetne, itt hasztalan volt. Ezen felül ez az uno/macao mechanizmus elég nevetséges. A legrosszabb talán a lapok disztribúciója, ami nem változik a party során. Így az elején fájdalmasan kevés az embert behozó kártya, ami cserébe a lapok 80%-át totálisa feleslegessé teszi, mert minek mozognék, támadnék, ha egyszerűen nincs mivel. Ráadásul simán lehet, hogy körökig nem is lesz, ha szerencsétlenül jön ki kicsit az osztás. Már csak hab a tortán, hogy a pofonegyszerű alapszabályok mellé iszonyat bonyolultan és hosszan szövegezek kártyák társulnak, amiknek az egymásra hatása se teljesen tisztázott sokszor. Kicsit ellentmondásos érzetet kelt így. Nem teljesen értem, hogy mások mi jó látnak benne, ennél kb sajnos szinte bármelyik AF játék jobb. Ez se lenne alapjaiban elrontva, de valahogy nagyon sokat kellett volna még csiszolni ezen a játékmeneten. A  design fenomenális, illetve a kelta mitológia is nagyon vonzana, így nagyon fáj a szívem érte.

Decent game, but very vicious. Interesting drafting mechanic, although I find the entry complexity a bit too high. You need to play the game a couple of time to fully internalize the way cards work and be able to draft ideal combos. Even then, it's essentially a long series of "take that" plays interrupted by "nope" cards.

Kartengetriebenes Area Control, das derjenige gewinnt, der als erster mehr von drei verschiedenen Siegbedingungen vorweisen kann als jeder Mitspieler. Das führt zu einem unerbittlichen Abnutzungskampf, der Nehmerqualitäten, Stehvermögen und erhöhte Frustrationstoleranz erfordert. INIS ist aggressive Interaktion, Attacken auf das Gerechtigkeitsempfinden, Sisyphos und Kingmaker als Spielelement. INIS ist harter Asphalt, eingegossen in ein hinreissendes Artwork aus Hippie-Tarot-Ästhetik, Fotorealismus und künstlerischer Zerklüftung. Wenn man das Aushalten von Pattsituations-Wiederholungsschlaufen als Teil der Idee betrachtet, ist INIS gut. Gute Nerven sind von Nöten. Nüsse zum Knabbern bereitstellen. Im Fußball würde man sagen: ein von Taktik geprägtes Spiel. Und dies darf es auch sein und bleiben.

Ah, Inis.  It's been awhile since I was so unsure of my feelings about a game after playing it. First off, it feels quite different from all the other "dudes on a map" game I have played. The card drafting and action phases are enjoyable and the combat resolves quickly and is intense. A load of tension. Really enjoyed those aspects. My negative feelings go solely to some of the reaction cards, especially the Epic Tales which you really can't plan for. I can accept that war is hell, and there's always a chance that things can't go your way. But it feels painful and at times random when I consider what players are able to do to each other.  I'm okay with some "take that!" in a game, but it better be extremely well-considered when implemented and I'm not sure it wholly was in this game. My other complaint is the game length. This could be purely a first-time player thing and would be cleared up as the game goes on. This is totally a great 60-90 minutes game.  Our game went on for 2.5 hours. Waaayyy too long for a game like this.  We had a situation where two players tied up for victory for a number of rounds, while a third player had almost all their clans in the capital city. This meant that nobody was really going to go into the capital city to gain the tiebreaker and so we had two players keeping each other in a stalemate while the other players had to either avoid easy kingmaker situations or pursue their own victory goals which were slow to gain momentum and made the game go an hour over its recommended play time.

Anyway, I thought a lot about Inis after it was done, I think that's the mark of a good game.  It was fascinating to make the game work for me.  But with a game this painful, I hate the feeling of "take that" randomness. It's not the entire game, but it's enough of it to not make this wholly a classic in my book.  The game directly creates kingmaking situations and keeping everything balanced and in check makes for a slow-crawI stalemate game until somebody wins, usually due to a random Epic Tales event.  Part of me thinks this is a game to play best with people who have played it before.  Too bad the learning game can leave a sour taste.  I am intrigued to try it again soon and see how I feel.

This might be my favorite game right now.  It seems simple but it's got a lot of depth and is always a very satisfying game that is a lot of fun all the way through.

More tactical than strategic... but you can definitely plan ahead and set yourself up, yet your actual victory will never be quiet what you thought it would be.

Really enjoy the way combat works, and I really love how it is possible to win this game without ever fighting anybody (if you are careful!)

Also, art is superb IMHO and I am a sucker for the theme!

EDIT: the more I play the more I like this game.  So many strategies emerge throughout each game.  

Not only does it scale well in terms of a number of players, it scales well in terms of player ability; I played one epic game with my NUGG friends who are hardcore gamers that was so different than the ones I play with my more casual friends.

Amaaaaazing art. The gameplay is super simple, and plays out quickly...at least, it should. I could see some situations of player denial going on as you can force the game to linger by tieing up on win conditions. The theme works well here though. Definitely reminds me a bit of Cyclades, where every player feels they're "one turn away from winning."

I was very excited to try this, but alas it falls way short of Cyclades and Kemet to which it is often compared coming from Matagot.

The modified drafting makes it even more susceptible than other drafting games to the risk of a weaker player ruining the experience.

Moreover, while the territory advantages are a neat idea, the 17 cards (of which you draft 16 every turn) are really boring, the fighting is uninspired, everything is bleak...

I really enjoy how different this game feels compared to other area control games as well as other drafting games. It's very unique. I like how passive everything is, that players can choose not to have or continue a fight at any point, as well as having 2/3 victory conditions not be based on domination. It feels more friendly than other area control games, yet the drafting is more tense than other drafting games I've played. It's also beautiful. I like that the game is fast and tense and there's plenty of possibility for smart plays. 

I have experienced a game that slowed down immensely, because people realised that people that could win the game had to take an action to take a pretender token, so everyone else could simply pass until they do. This meant that play slowed down, no one wanted to do proactive plays and were merely waiting for opportunities to negate another's win conditions. This is part of the strategy of the game, but it also resulted in endless stalemates where no one could win. Another similar point: Since the Brenn wins ties, there's a necessity for group think where players will usually agree to sacrifice a win condition in order to stop the Brenn's win, leading once again to endless ties. Perhaps we need to get better at the game to find ways to stop endless ties, or simply not put the capital in the mountains.

This felt so messy. For an area control game, give me [thing=93][/thing] any day. Even [thing=91312][/thing] is simpler/more elegant, and with the similarity of multiple potential victory conditions.

I really dislike the mechanism that (unless you can pull off a quick strike win) you're motivated to extend the game just for the sake of [i]maybe[/i] getting the cards you need to get ahead or drag the leader down.

Not all the action cards felt fun to play, which is a shame with relatively few available.

Rating based on one play.

PROS
-Artwork is stunning and miniatures and tokens are good quality.  
-Limited number of cards allows new players to quickly become familiar with the options available but location and epic cards can add some great variability.
-Reminded me of a beefed-up, more thematically interesting version of Konig von Siam in that it has a much more chess-like feel than a typical dudes-on-the-map game like Kemet. This is mainly due to the "6/6/6" win conditions.
-Drafting option of getting rid of the card you just drafted feels like the only natural way to draft cards.
-Passing but being able to re-enter later rounds makes for some interesting decisions and tense moments.

CONS
-The "Check" aspect of taking the Pretender Token means the game can outstay its welcome. Maybe house rule it so that someone just has to maintain a win and call it at the end of a round?

Played two times with fairly seasoned gamers new to this game.  Total playthrough time for both was 7.5 hours.  It probably speeds up a bit after being familiar with the cards.  Both games were a bit unpredictable.  Often it feels like a 3-way struggle where you have to weaken yourself to prevent an opponent from gaining too much.  Maybe the 4th man felt unable to get back into a winning position after losing a clash due to a useful Epic card early on.  The artwork and components are outstanding.

I love the action drafting-- it's very quick to learn the whole 17-card action deck, at which point you're drafting with everybody knowing everything everyone else might be holding, and that's kind of the promised land of drafting games, right?

First play through never seemed to end. On paying closer attention to the game mechanics, advised players on 2nd game that the 'deeds' are essential to winning. Game progressed more smoothly this way. Given the ability to gang up on a winner, it's nearly impossible to win without deeds, but that's not super obvious from the game.

Really enjoyed my second play through. It's a rich game, with lots of whiplash in effects, but very enjoyable.

Production quality is mixed. The inserts into the box don't fit that well. The art is amazing in some places and not my style in others. The theme is really well done.

Un jeu qui a une mécanique intéressante mais que j'ai trouvé moche (les cartes action et la boîte sont d'un kitchissime achevé). Vous développez (via des pièces qui s'emboîtent) un plateau via des régions et essayez d'être majoritaire dans les régions du plateau. Les cartes actions du tour sont distribuées en draft, et comme à dominion, vous augmentez votre main de vos cartes à vous que vous allez récupérer petit à petit. Le but du jeu, c'est d'être majoritaire dans les régions où y'a des pions adverses (10 pions adverses "soumis", de mémoire). On peut se balader dans les régions en y faisant la paix ou la guerre. J'ai pas été transporté par ce jeu, même si y'a des bonnes idées dedans et que le thème est là. Les explications pourries par le démonstrateur n'ont pas aidé, faut dire.

RATING: 4
This game is in the vein of "Blood Rage", with each round starting with a drafting phase, followed by an action phase where you can play cards. Differently, however, all your actions require playing a card, and this is very limiting. There is only one card that allows you to move troops to new territories, another one to place a new tile, one to build a citadel, one to build a sanctuary, and so on (at least in a two- or three-player game). This is probably necessary for the game not to end too soon, but it feels very slow.

Sometimes you end up with a number of useless cards, because they can only be played during clashes and you can't move or to initiate one. Besides, clashes are often a bad idea, because they will often weaken both players, and it can be even worse for the initiator if there is more than one opponent, because they can easily ally against him. Also, I really disliked the rule about discarding action cards in order to prevent the loss of troops and keep fighting.

The production features the nice plastic miniatures that are usual for Matagot, but nothing particularly attractive. And this time they decided to give all different models of units for every player, making all armies equal. The artwork is beautiful, but the cards and board tiles are in completely different styles, not to mention that someone thought it was a good idea to use landscapes to build a map (instead of the traditional view from above). To make it worse, due to the shape of the tiles and how they fit together, the pictures can't even all have the same orientation.

I like the Celtic theme, which is relatively fresh, and could forgive some flaws if I found the gameplay at least engaging or fun. But the fact is that I was simply bored most of the time when I played it. At one point, I just let it end, before it devolved into ganging up on the leader with potential kingmaking. I may try it again to see if my first impressions are confirmed or not, but I don't expect a very different experience.

Take a game vaguely reminiscent of Cyclades, in that it often takes several steps to accomplish anything of consequence; add to that a lot of take-that cards and weird/arbitrary canceling effects; and then introduce a painfully attritional combat system. Not a good mix.

Drafting cards (yes, again...) with a small twist and a board to fight and get control. That's all the game has to offer and it wasn't any interesting to me.

RATING: 8
Played my first game in January 2018 (two players). This game was a terrific two-player experience. Elegant and minimalist rules set and mechanics that mesh extremely well - area control, multiple paths to victory, and card drafting for a set of 13 action cards each round which become your "one action per turn" set of moves. 

With two players there is almost 100% perfect information to inform your strategy and that of your opponents. The random draw of the territories each game - each of which has it's own special power card that the majority owner can use - add variability but also transparency in information. The Epic Tale cards are the rule-breaking, tactical cards that could foil plans and are kept secret. But even these are mitigated by the fact that one of the 13 action cards introduces them to the game, so deciding to keep this action in the draft is a player's choice. 

The fast pace - and learning curve - even by seeing the cards for the first time and sussing out some of the terminology - was very short, and we were playing without much fiddliness after the first round. The design and graphics are elegant and clear. 

I was very impressed with this as a two-player with less swingy "take that" frisson during the gameplay, and also with how quickly it plays. 60 minutes is accurate and was close to that even with rules and setup. I can't emphasize how blown away I was with Inis. One of the gems in my collection and one of the top games released within the past year.

[Update after 2nd play]
This went pretty good, but, as with my strategic group, much longer than advertised. Everybody like the game in general. The red cards are strong, can be swingy, hit-or-miss if you get useful ones. We all had some complaints about production: cards are too big; the game could use more icons (e.g. to symbolize the map tile special abilities); references sheets for the winning conditions are missing. Solid mid-weight strategic area control game. Giving this a 7 right now.

---
I cannot yet rate it after one play. I seems very solid, very interactive. Once you know the cards, I can see how strategic the play can become, especially when to pass and when not. I like that there are only 15 (or so) base action cards; I like the location cards (some are very powerful, which adds a nice almost meta layer to the game); the hero cards I found too unpredictable; also some of the take-that elements I did not like. However, as I said, strategic passing etc., I could see how you can predict even these take-that cards once you know them by heart.

As usual, I'm performing pretty badly in such direct conflict area-control games, which is why this will probably not become one of my personal favorites. But I totally appreciate the design.

And my stance on the most important question: yes, I like the unique artwork very much. Component-wise, though, I found the cards overly huge for my taste; the simply colored minis are fine, although their bases did not fit into the settlements, like I think they are supposed to do.

I'm generally a cube-pushing eurogamer, so this is not my typical style of game, but I have to say that I really enjoy Inis.  The card drafting is fantastic and allows you to limit and manage other players' actions.  The diceless combat and multiple win conditions just add more positives.

The first time I played Inis there was a bit of fatigue. It lasted 2 hours but I think that's more our fault as players than the game (learning each action card and how important deeds are). With each subsequent game I fall deeper and deeper in love with the strategy of this game. Overall the goal is simple and the 17 action cards become second nature. Wins seem to come out of no where and are, 90% of the time, completely earned by the victor for being more clever than the rest. Started at a 6.5, moved to a 8. Let's see what happens with more plays. Also the art and figures are beautiful. Minor typo though in some versions with how many citadels and sanctuaries there should be in total.

This game has a working drafting mechanic which normally i dont like any kind of drafting until it serves game well. This game's drafting serving well.

Matagot's production is still at its best. Game map can randomly be generated by players which adds much replayability. Epic tale cards are totally unbalanced and the action cards may seem repetetive after few games. Different victory conditions makes every game unpredictable.

Solid area control and hand management game but it is a little overrated.

RATING: 10
The perfect evolution of "dudes on a map" popularized by games like Kemet and Blood Rage. Drafting round is brilliant: 17 cards, one burned, are drafted in a 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 fashion. In short, getting a bad hand lets you save cards for the next pass OR naturally build combos then abandon it if something doesn't work right. It also means you're building the hand of the person you're passing to.

There's a lot going on under the hood. Three victory conditions, all of them contestable, and the game continues if there isn't a majority (first player breaks ties). At times you have to sneak a win and everyone must be aware of the board state 100% or else a player who appears to be losing can snatch victory.

Some critics say it's prone to kingmaking. This isn't incorrect, but experience allows you to understand the warning signs of an imminent victory. A group of newcomers learning the game can misunderstand the end goal resulting in a stalemate for a very long time. PROTIP: deeds are your friend! Think of them as permanent VP compared to your clans being temporary VP. If someone gets 2 deeds they are either winning or a force to be dealt with immediately.

Critics are also negative against epic tales. It's true they are random, but they are immensely situational. If someone turns a game around with epic tales then they had to sacrifice other important moves to get those. Everything in Inis comes at a balancing cost. If you're fighting, you're not building. If you're building you're not gaining ground. The victor is whoever balances the board state and controls the draft.

As is usual from me, I bought Inis without knowing anything about the game, however, when I realized the game was from Matagot, I knew it would have, at least, great components. After playing the game, I also liked it very much.

I have been slowly drifting away from area control games because they have the hated (by me) “bash the leader” mechanism, however, Inis is much more Euro than Ameritrash and that allows me to enjoy it. 

The rules are easy to grasp, but there are many rules. You can explain them under 18 minutes. Play time is surprisingly short for this kind of game. You can perhaps play it under 60 minutes with seasoned players or around 90 with new players.

I like the theme.

The game´s components are very good. The art is gorgeous and the bits are also great. The modular board looks amazing on the table and adds great replayability.

The game decisions aren’t obvious. Each turn you have to draft cards, the novel point being that you can pass previously drafted cards. I like it. Also the amount of cards you draft are around 15, so you get familiar with them rather quickly. Once all players have their cards, they begin playing them to control territories and expand. There is some luck with the epic cards (red ones) and with the terrains but I feel you can control and react to it so it doesn’t bother me. 

I like that combat is not mandatory, you can inhabit the same terrain that your opponents, and when there is combat, it is dice free!

I feel it is best with 3 players (as most drafting games), but I would play with 4 players also.

I´m a bit worried that with experience, the game could drag a lot as no player could fulfill the victory conditions without being attacked. That wasn’t the case in our game but it seems the logical conclusion if all players want to win the game and play to the best of their skill. I need more plays to verify this point.

Bottom line, Inis is a good area control game, it appeals to me as a (mostly) Euro gamer. The game´s decisions aren’t easy. A friend wanted the game for Christmas so I gave it to him, but I already bought it again. I think it will be a keeper in my game collection but it depends if the game will drag or not with experienced players. MUCH better than Blood Rage though.

I don’t have anything bad to say about Inis, but I have two small issues.

I really think the game end conditions should be on the player´s aid, also, I hate flicking the coin to see the direction of the round. That can lead to degradation of the coin itself. I know I’m very annoying with how much I care my games, but that’s the way I am :D. In our games I won’t be flicking the coin, I will use a replacement.

2017-07-10 - Technically, I don't even have a full play of this game, as we called it a couple of rounds before it would have likely ended because it was getting late and we had seen what we need to see. This game has interesting mechanisms and choices, but the standard action cards are too low-effort, take that for me. I am confident that I won't ever want to play this again.

Rating after first play but this will be on the table many more times. We had a blast. There was non-stop talking around the table, which for me is the first sign of a good game. The conflict negotiation, spiced up by non-combatants pitching in with their own advice, is often hilarious. 

If I'd suggest anything (I know, after one game), it would be not to let yourselves get bogged down with endless reading of the cards (which, to be honest, you internalise within a few rounds) trying to form meticulous strategies. Draft quickly, play quickly.

RATING: 7
seems to me very similar to Blood Rage (drafting, combat and area control as the main mechanics) but somewhat more refined as there are less cards (less overpowered cards also) to deal with, you can better manage to keep track of what your opponents are capable of

RATING: 8.5
Another hit for Matagot, amazing components and board. The way the board has a white border around each piece and they all fit together although cut very differently to a usual game tile is impressive to see.

The way you can win by three different winning conditions is so intriguing also the combat/area control system is great too!


How Matagot's games are always so close right until the last turn astonishes me, great games!

Rating would probably go up with more plays, but they would have to be with 3 players. Lots of interaction, both between players and the cards, so that part works well. i thought the build up felt very long, and the game was then suddenly resolved. would definitly play again, but feel no need to own. Blood Rage is a far superior game in the same genre.

RATING: 7
A nice stream-lined take on territory control. Many similarities with Blood Rage but I like this much better. Plays in only 30-45 minutes with two players. As with most games containing verbose cards, you will occasionally be blind-sided by a card (from the Epic Tales) you didn't know existed. This is frustrating, but doesn't happen that often. The main deck drafted each round contains only 12-16 cards. You will likely have internalized most of their abilities by the end of the first game. The art-work is detailed and colorful, but will turn some people off if you don't like the style. Combat is another strong point, despite not being the focus. When you are attacked, you simply remove one of your pawns or discard a card. Then you can withdraw to another region or attack back. This continues until the region is empty or everyone agrees to stop combat.

A tricky game, the fighting system needs some time to wrap around. Although the victory conditions are quite "peaceful" compared to Kemet, early aggression is needed to keep players in check. The cards really make the game shine.

Inis is a work of art. The entire game is infused with symbolism, even the modular board tiles, shaped like elaboraten oak leaves, combine with the theme of finding a new unexplored Celtic island. Is it the Isle of Mann? Jersey? Somewhere in the wilds of the Orkneys? It doesn't matter, the whole game feels like legend. The terrain illustration is good, earth toney, and perfectly fine. These earthen bases contrast brightly against the character illustration cards, which rank as some of the best game art I've ever seen. It reminds me a little bit of Dragonmaster, a game I wish I owned.  This was so obviously a labor of love for everybody involved. I haven't had much chance to play it, but I have seen it played and know a well designed game by its rules. 

So happy I took the plunge and bought it, I will be holding on to this one.

Elegant, "simple" systems that interact in emergent, complex ways. Quick to teach. Quickish to play. Social. Not a shoegaze sort of game. Psychedelic art that seems to "stare back" at you. Points off for some male gaze, in the be-boobed miniatures especially. Played while listening to Celtic Woman. Much better than Celtic Woman.

First impression

RATING: 8
Multiplayer conflict is a genre I mostly avoid. Inis' (pronounce Inish) advantages are the deterministic diceless combat and the card-driven gameplay. 

Each turn consists of a drafting phase and an action phase. In total, there are 17 action cards in the draft, i.e. four per player +1 card respectively four less for each player less. While this doesn't seem to give much replayability, it works perfectly as players quickly will get a feel what can happen in the game and plan for this while limiting the chaos factor. The replayability comes from the different combinations of landscape tiles, each with a unique card given to the player controlling this landscape and the epic tale cards granting powerful special abilities.

In the action phase, players basically play one of their action cards to gain majorities or spread their clans. Clashes in principle are one-by-one exchanges of clan members but are subject to negotiation and affected by some cards which can be played as reactions. The unique element is the incentive to end battles before elimination of an opposing force as one of the victory conditions is dominance over opposing clans. Getting into the necessary mindset for this won't be easy for players used to crushing enemy units. Whenever one player meets one of the three victory conditions, he can claim pretender status. He only wins if he still fulfills this condition at the start of the next turn and no other player similarly is a pretender.

While Inis still can be unfair to a sensible Euro gamer like me, the unique cards, the negotiation part in clashes and the incentive for co-existence make it a contender for my favorite multiplayer conflict game.

Beautiful game with great production values. The drafting mixed with area control also generally works quite well, despite the standard actions only being included in the drafted cards, until people start to grab those pretender tokens. At that point, when the game is about to end, it may be about to end for a very long time. Fulfilling the few victory conditions can lead to a hopeless tug of war that can also be decided by some players overextending themselves in a battle leaving the game ripe for taking for another player.

Interesting game. Drafting game with a map. You get reliable actions to take in a turn, combined with some semi-permanent bonus actions from your areas and all of this spiced up with some Tale cards that usually throw a wrench in your plans. Or save your bacon. Quite nice. Tale cards seem rather overpowered but focusing on them means you're sacrificing other stuff or feeding others stuff.

The objectives seem kinda balanced. Don't expect to win once reaching the first trigger though. It feels more like... the start of a second phase of the game? People get tunnelvisioned, other sneakily pull off those things they need to get their own objectives closer, etc.

The art is great but I didn't really look at the cards. They just... kinda blended in? Which is less awesome. Then again, the land tiles looked nicer than I expected. So kinda evens out.

I have only played 2p though. Would prefer holding final judgement for later. After I tried playing with more players.

Az első és egyetlen sikerélmény a játékkal kapcsolatban, hogy nem sikerült felhúznia. :) Az egy dolog, hogy nem az én világom, de igazából borzasztóan kiegyensúlyozatlan az egész. Teljesen kártyavezérelt, de alig van benne kártya, draftolás során hozzájutunk néhányhoz. Nagyon különbözőnek éreztem a lapok használhatóságát, volt olyan, ami kis túlzással bármilyen körülmények között jól használható volt, és volt olyan, amihez elég speciális esetre lett volna szükség. Szerintem ez probléma. Területfoglalós, dominanciára épülő mechanika, amiben folyamatosan előjön, hogy amennyiben megtámadok valakit, a csatában nem részt vevő játékosok erősödnek hozzánk képest. Támadó félként is igen fájdalmasak a következmények, lapokat, embereket veszítünk közben, ez nyilván a többieknek kedvez. Nem, nem szeretnék még egyszer játszani vele.

RATING: 8
A game that has the potential to climb up my ratings. As with other card drafting games, once you know the cards and how they work together, the game really shines. The first game was a mess, with no one really having a strategy, but subsequent playthroughs really had me thinking. Two player is great since you can really play mind games as you know exactly what the other player has, and vice versa. It can be a little "Take That!" at times. Four player is also fantastic, as you know in general what players have, but not exactly. But four player could also result in players ganging up on whoever is in the lead. Artwork is incredible and I love the oversized cards and unique area tiles. Really elegant and smooth gameplay and feel.

RATING: 10
I used to like heavier euros before I picked this game up, but it has since eclipsed them by far (even though one of them was Eclipse).

What I love:
The game is extremely simple and accessible, but it presents an incredible amount of flexibility and decisions. It is the extreme of clean design, deep choices, and a lot of variation between plays. The game is extremely interactive, to the point that it makes it quite a reactive game, with nobody really being able to snowball a lead because there are consistent answers that people can have to any kind of lead. You see victory coming many turns in advance, and there is plenty of opportunity to try to prevent a victory while setting yourself up for a victory in the future. The game has an incredible amount of replayability. We've gotten to the point that we know all of the red and yellow cards by name, and the red cards add a huge amount of variety to every game.

Things to consider:
The game is very different at 3 and 4 players. I cannot say I would recommend 2 players (it sounds awful, as this game is really reactive and with 2 players it seems like a lot would be missing), but I haven't played it that way. With three players the game will last around an hour (maybe less, if you are all experienced), and end when someone sets up a turn really well and makes sure the opponents used their ability to interact with other players before showing their hand. While it is usually true that you lose knowing you could have played better that turn, it is also sometimes true that you couldn't have - you either weren't in a position to do so, never got passed the cards to do so, or couldn't have played around a particular red card.
With 4 players the game is completely different. It can sometimes last a really long time if people are playing well, but all the while the game is tense and no one person can say they couldn't win. Everybody is interacting, reacting and setting themselves up. The only issue is that the deed tokens - the things that let you meet victory conditions much easier - are much easier to get in this mode, meaning that the game either ends quickly and - I would say - satisfyingly, OR another person gets a victory condition while someone else being the Brann (something much harder to accomplish in a three player game). When the latter happens, the game can last a while. I will say though, it is tense throughout. Every turn FEELS like the last turn, it feels like you could win every turn if you play your cards right.... it just ends up being that most of the time, the game can continue with ties that get harder and harder to keep until it explodes. When it lasts too long, the end just feels anticlimactic, like you could have won four turns in a row but at the end the person who got ignored or who you were counting on ends up taking the win. This is really rare, but this is also why some people might get the experience of it dragging out. It usually doesn't, but unfortunately the more evenly matched you are, the more it can happen.

Inis is a game that needs repeated plays for a good knowledge of the cards.

There is definately luck in it. The drafting gives you alot of information to digest.
Much has been said about the game ending abruptly.
This probably is true for your first game but in reality it hardly is.

The run for safety in the citadels , is the action that will end a lot of  beginners games.

I am not sure that I like this action. But the decion to include this make the length of the game alot shorter.

  Silky smooth interactions and combos, a game for sadists where you get to backstab and laugh madly at each others misery and misfotune. 

  My complaints: Too few basic card pool so that 100% of the normal interaction cards are in the game each round.

  And the game can last waayy too long for the cards in it and what is said on the box, this might have been again because of the unexperienced players.

  We might have played fiddlily with the territory cards and when the chieftain changes.

Wonderful "dudes on a map" game. I love the redraft every round and the finite number of cards / citadels / sanctuaries. It seems like it would be repetitive but it's not, in fact. I do not like the "kingmaking" ability. My first play of this, I won a hollow victory - someone else could challenge and take away my win till the next round but another played the "cancel another's action card" and gave me the win. Still a very nice game if playing with the right people.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I wonder if this might be a great 3 player game and not shine as well with 4? It is an interesting game where one tiptoes around trying to meet the win conditions while preventing others (hopefully convincing someone else to do part of the work of stopping others from winning). The soft pass comes into play here in a huge way - but if everyone passes then the round is over. The same 13-17 cards are in play for drafting each and every round, but I don't think that is a bad thing as you learn the cards and know exactly what can be done with those cards. There is slight uncertainty as one card is always out of play (unless a certain territory card comes into play). Cards can also be gained from the territory deck (if you are in control in a region you gain that region specific card/ability) and also the special red deck which is usually more powerful and can be held in hand for that moment where you make a run for the win on a turn. Three different winning conditions means one must pay attention to the board state or one can mistakenly hand someone else a win. This game is relatively simple to play in regards to rules and may be overproduced (the tiles crack me up with the jagged triangles that connect to other regions). I didn't really expect to like this one, but I was pleasantly surprised!

I feel like the huge amount of "bash the leader" in this game, enabled by the pretender token mechanic, makes this game just miss for me.  Our first game took an hour, the second took 3 and I feel like it could easily grow from there.  I could have prevented my last game from ending by "Geis"ing (card that cancels another card) the last conquest card played, but chose not to because I was basically out of it and felt like I was king-making.  Although, in retrospect, had I extended the game, I don't think a win for me would be out of the question, but at that point I was ready to be done.  I recognize the brilliance of the design, but it just doesn't click for me.

RATING: 8
* With 2 players

I was not blown away by this game, but I feel that it has potential: after a first game, I don't yet have a clear view/mastery of what my opponent can do to me given the actions I chose (and the territories that we dominate). As a consequence, I did not feel like I was really doing my best in our first game; it was like being in a place a bit too big to be comprehended quickly. This restricted my enjoyment of the first game.

Also, I made the mistake of not putting my troops in the capital, at the beginning: this makes sense in a 3+ player game, where multiple players can gang up against the Brenn so as to steal his 1st player and tie-breaker advantage, but not in a 2-player game, where I am alone against him.

I also made the mistake of not concentrating early on getting more clans on the board: this made me an easy target. At some point I had only 1 clan on the board.

In terms of rules, we had a couple of questions:

- Some Triskel cards can be played after playing a Season card. We guessed that only one such cards can be played after a Season card (since the second card played is a Triskel card, not a Season card). This is what a strict reading of the rules says (this does not prevent multiple Triskel cards from being played in a row, as long as their conditions are fulfilled).

- We were not sure what to do if the clan reserve ran out, but guessed (correctly apparently) that we cannot take a clan from another location (I could not find anything in the rules about being able to do this, and one answer from the designer seemed to emphasize this).

So, rule-wise, the game was quite clean, that was nice.

The rules are quite streamlined (3 victory conditions where the magic number is always 6, simple rules, etc.), which I appreciate. Explaining the game was quite easy and quick.

A masterpiece of game design. Amazing theme, perfect mechanics with a lot of strategy, tactics and fun. And lots of interaction too. Once you get your hands on it you don't want to stop playing. 
I don't really understand the "kingmaking" critics, did they misread the rules? Often times you can pretend to win on the very last turn, hence avoiding backfire.

Bit heavy at first sight, but once you get the basic rules it perfectly flows! 

If you like direct interaction, this game is flawless.

RATING: 9
It's a really great area control game that always has the tension of potential aggression, but it never gets too bloody. It's like a cold war.
The art is beautiful, the Action cards are well-balanced and the Epic Tale cards make the game more interesting and unpredictable.
By the end, usually everyone has a chance to win and even the losers will feel like they were so close and want to try again.
My only issues with it are that there's a bit too much "bash the leader" and it's prone to AP. It's an AMAZING 90 minute game, but a mediocre 180 minute game.

Great area control game driven by actions selected from a tweaked card drafting mechanism. Lots of fun. Visual feast for the eyes. Familiarisation of the action cards necessary but the game is easy to learn and easy to teach. Players can team up heir forces against a leading player. Victory / win conditions make the game more about succeeding due to good game play rather than collecting meaningless victory points. Good card synergy. Gorgeous art by Kim Fitzpatrick. And no dice in resolving combat who hoo! Review https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yVKEYYh3ZFs

Love it, the drafting elements make this game feel very balanced, when I lose I feel like it’s my fault and next time I can change something to do better. When I win I feel like it’s because I made clever plays at the right time it’s very rewarding.

Initial Impressions: I like the game but probably wouldn't have thought it was worth it if it wasn't celtic themed. With a theme less attractive to me I would probably tentatively rate it a 6, with the possibility to bump it up to a 7 later, as the way each action card fits with the other seems really well thought out; I am just worried that it might make future games too samey. Some things potentially helping replayability are that it'll probably take a few plays to understand how all the action cards work together, the cards for controlling different terrain might matter a lot, and also it seems like group dynamics could make this game play differently when playing with different people.

The rules are fairly simple (outside of clarifying win conditions), but the game will take some plays to master. This is normally a good thing, but an uninexperienced player of Inis may be lacking a little in terms of having a direction, may accidentally kingmake by overly hurting a particular player, and the ending may come as too much of a surprise for them. I do think that people's claims that this game is completely kingmaking are overwrought though. To me, it seems like it is best to have the potential to claim more than one objective and play it by ear (possibly even fulfilling multiple on the same turn to give yourself a margin of aafety), and if you go all or nothing towards a single win condition you are leaving yourself too vulnerable to be countered.

I'm normally not a fan of negotiation, but I think it worked here, keeping interaction high between players without bogging the game down too much. Perhaps it is because the negotiation choices while important are rather binary in their choice (move here or there, continue clash or end it), and that it allows for the interesting aspect of occasionally wanting to coexist. Also, the need to keep everyone in check doesn't hamper the sense of progression in this game, as the board expanding and having structures added to it already does that.

The combat system certainly won't blow you away but it is not as mediocre as I thought it would be. Besides allowing for peaceful options choosing wheher to discard or lose a unit when being attacked can be tough, and the withdraw action allows you to save your units in the case your opponent is just too stubborn to end the fight.

Timing of when to do what is paramount in this game. In the latter half of each round it feels like a game of chicken where people are passing to save action cards because the effects are much stronger if your opponents have less cards to respond to it, but if everyone passes consecutively the round will end with you wasting all your remaining action cards. Timing is so important that there is even a card that does nothing except allows you to not have to pass. If you'd rather manipulate physical assets rather than worrying whether to wait and risk not being able to play a certain card, this game may not be for you.

I feel like playtime might have high variance, which can be annoying for planning purposes.

The epic tales cards I feel may be polarizing. They are fairly situational and so I think some people will be frustrated that they can't use them, feeling someone else got lucky with a better draw. However, I actually like their situational use, especially since you can keep them between rounds as a growing asset to be used at the right time. By making them more situational there can be more cards that "break" the game, allowing for the game state to develop more interestingly. Unfortunately, these cards are the only place the game felt distinctly celtic (as the cards reference mythological objects or characters).

Love the theme and artwork. I also love the mechanics of the card drafting, passing and using the deeds to lower the victory point conditions.

First game took 2 hours as a learning game. Folks at the table felt it took too long and over stayed its welcome.

2nd game ended somewhat abruptly and still lasted somewhere between 90-120 minutes. Players felt it was a lot of build up for a somewhat anti-climatic ending with the surprise victory.

For me, there is a lot to like about this game but it seems the people I am playing this with do not enjoy it as much as I do.

Artwork is amazing and the components are very nice.

Area control with a card drafting mechanic.  Simple enough, right? In 4 plays, I've never had anything less than the board game equivalent of an intercontinental three-way nuclear standoff. An incredible amount of strategy, interaction, power swings, deal making/breaking and fun for what is a no longer than 10-minute rules explanation.  Truly a triumph of game design.

After a single game I'm undecided. I like a lot about the game, but I don't know what to think about the combat system - something just doesn't sit right with me. Everything else in the game is good, but it's a bit more cut-throat than I like for my strategy games.

Still, it boasts an extremely impressive presentation. One of the most beautiful games I played.

Another Euro-DoaM game with real potential.  Similar to Kemet and Cyclades in that I think in the end it is more Euro than War/Area Control game.  6 victory points makes for narrow margins and seemingly lots of potential for kingmaking.  Deeds make that even more true.  I'll have to play it more before I decide if it's brilliant or dustbin material.

Fantastic area control/drafting hybrid. Beautiful evocative art and an enchanting theme. The tense end game elevates the experience into something special, as each player has a chance to meet one of three victory conditions and block other players from succeeding. Giving all players agency to further their own goals at the expense of other players minimizes the "pile on the leader" problem of other multiplayer games.

This is a brilliant area control game with many innovative ideas, a really exciting breath of fresh air in a traditional and sometimes stale genre.  The card drafting is done right, with juicy choices and the feeling that every choice matters (and I am a gamer that usually does not like card drafting mechanics).  Many possible strategies, many paths to victory, the game also allows you to successfully adapt and change strategy midstream.  A great crescendo that leads to a final showdown with opportunities for last minute surprises.  You finish the game, stare at the board, and can't wait to play it again.  One of my favorite area control, dudes on a map games, and right now the area control game I want to play more than any other one.  Last but not least, the art is phenomenal, and very original.

As an area control game I cannot help comparing this to blood rage, which is my favorite game in that genre. Ultimately Inis feels a bit bland as it lacks special powers altogether and looks a bit pale in comparison to blood rages outstanding tabletop presence. I think there is a good game somewhere buried deep within, but I am missing any thematic ties and in the end it just feels very mechanical to me. I guess it is just not for me.

Would pick blood rage over it any day.

I wanted to enjoy this game much more, but I can't

It has all the qualities of a great game: Amazing artwork, drafting, area control, simple combat, and so forth.

So what made me dislike the game?

Much like Cyclades, Inis is a game where everything is going great until the very end when someone is close to winning.  Suddenly the quick turns that lead up to the point have turned this exciting game into a slog where everyone conspires against the leading player.  This makes drafting and the flow of the game screech to a halt since every decision is no longer an individual's choice, but a committee of players just to stop the leading player from winning.

This issue could've been solved if the game ended via rounds or a condition that the other players cannot stop (e.g. the sixth Star in Scythe).  Simply put, I don't enjoy games where the leading player is punished and the game can literally go on forever because players just screw over one another.  If I wanted to play something like that, I can grab Munchkin at a fraction of the price of Inis.

One of the best games I've played in a long time. With the ability to go over 1 of three objectives, and ties broken by being a leader or additional victory conditions, the game just has so much depth. The best part is that actions are drafter each round, meaning, each turn you select what you want and what you do or dont want your occupants to do. Peaceful cohabitation also means that this area control game doesnt have to be a strictly combat game, but a mind game as well.

By far the best artwork in a game I have come across. I like the drafting, but rules are a little odd for me: claiming crown for victory conditions you have met, giving other players the opportunity to deny you seems like it prolongs the game too long.

A fantastically produced game, with incredible art, tiles and nice minis - premium matagot quality.  The game play is a little unintuitive until one realises that this is a game of area control, not so much charging into combat - which can be lose-lose like mythotopia.  Should play in about an hour once the rules are known.  The action drafting really limits options, which may not be to everyone's tastes.  Expect there will be plenty of copies turning up for trade.

It's Matagot, so you know it will be overpriced and overproduced and it is, but still I was thinking this could be a really interesting game. Card driven is a plus and different victory conditions too. The game play however is boring and repetitive. And conflict resolution is just strange. If A, B, C and D are in a province. A starts a fight with B. B reacts. But then while it is still A's turn, C and D can grab the opportunity to start fighting as well. It's just chaotic and odd. All in all a very simple game that overstayed it's welcome big time. If everybody pays attention and keeps each other in check it drags to the end. Disappointing.

I have never seen an expansive area control game so balanced and simple as this one. And the premise is just ridiculously simple. There are 3 ways to win, and 17 actions (13 with 3p) of which you draft 4 each turn. Those 17 are the same every time, so after three of four turns you start memorizing what your possibilities are and then the real fun starts.
The endgame is a matter of trumping each other over and over until someone wins. And when you hold those four actions, you know there's a win in there somewhere, but WHERE!
You can break this game out anytime, I'll sit down to play it.

There were only few things I liked about this game. It looks pretty, the figures are nice, and its take on drafting where you can exchange previously drafted cards is something I want to see implemented in another game.

The card pool was too small, it basically came down to being lucky enough to get the card you needed in your first hand.

The land cards were mostly useless or they were impossible to trigger to get use out of them.

It was just one frustrated turn after another, and it felt like every time I wanted to do anything I couldn't do it. Some people might love this game, but I hated pretty much every minute of it.

Inis / Kemet / Cyclades?
People will compare these... don't. You may know that Kemet and Cyclades are quite different from each other. They scratch a similar itch, but in different ways. Inis is far more different. A similarity would be: Kemet felt like it broke ground in getting players to the heart of the fun part of the game, and skipping a lot of the pre-conflict empire setup that slogs down war games; Inis completely takes this to the next level. Kemet is my sweet spot, but Inis is SOOOOO refreshing in how instantly your are into the meat of the game. 

Inis / El Grande?
MUCH better comparison, but still hugely different. Draft from a wisely limited deck of action cards each round. Use the action cards to shield your units or do the cards actions. Repeat until one player has more victory conditions than the others (3 victory conditions, all easy to remember, one player must be the only player with the most victory conditions). Sub hour games, that give you the epic feel of the best part of multi hour games. My group rarely plays games twice in a row, but they were easy to convince to play a second with this one. I wanted to play a third, but didn't push it. So good.

Map space abilities:
This almost never works in games. Just too clunky. It works in Inis though.

So what's bad about it?
Price. That's not comparing price to what you get in the box, just saying the box is expensive, so I have to hold off. 

Art:
I love the cover art. No one else I played with did. They took a big risk with the art style and the game play, but I think both are just brilliant. Art of the cards and game board are completely different, and have a far higher universal appeal. I personally would have liked to see the cover art carry through stronger, but it may have made the play state too busy looking. So maybe they made the right call. Certainly they did for mass appeal.

I commend them for taking so many risks and putting out an amazing product.

Like Blood Rage, Inis may require a few plays to get into. Certainly familiarity with the action cards at minimum, not to mention the epic tales and territory control cards, goes a long way. My reservations surround the seesaw both of territory control and card play, as well as the attack-the-leader problem. It seems far too easy to kingmake the second-place player when trying to stop a telegraphed victory.

Tight design, every rule counts. Strategically I thought there wasn't much room for variation but maybe there are some funny land tiles or epic tales which could become the lynchpin for something unusual. Consequently I don't feel like there is much mystery left in the game after a few plays.

Very cool and interesting area majority game with fantastic win conditions that really spice up the game

RATING: 5
Main focus of the game is to save some units and epic cards to make one great turn to go for victory meanwhile preventing other players to meet the victory conditions. But if your plan fails you have to wait a few turns to try it again (munchkin style). Between rounds you dont get permanent bonuses so there is no real build up. the game is in a constant climax, this paradox is the problem. By constantly giving you the feeling that this might be the last round it becomes like the last hour of the Return of the King movie........endless

I participated to play testing of the game, and it was just incredible. Very few components, only 4 cards in you hand per turn, and you can create combo that are just awesome. 

Very good area control card drawing mixed game. There is a learning curve however, and playing with experienced users (who cards and combo) might give you near to 0% of winning the game at the beginning. No luck involved, only strategy. 

Inis should be part of any good game collection :)

RATING: 7
Excellent tension between your long term strategy of aiming at one (or more) of the win conditions, and the brutal short-term tactics. By its nature, Inis is a mean game... forcing you to initiate clashes every round. Though you can both agree to take the peaceful approach, you BOTH need to agree to this... so you could (and will) end up losing valuable clan members or action cards just about every round. Great decision points.

RATING: 9
Near perfect! I am amazed at how a simple rule set can create such a rich, tactical and enjoyable game. It looks great on the table and the card art is some of the best I've seen. The only thing stopping it being a 10 is that it lacks those really tense, exciting moments that were so prevalent in a game like Cyclades and that it takes quite a number of plays before strategies become apparent.

Inis is an inoffensive area control game that pales in thematic beauty with others of its ilk, especially the recently released Blood Rage. Very much a missed opportunity with a tight design and what should have been an engaging world. The various elements, however, fail to cohere, and I fear it will fade next to other more risky, unique designs.

Inis - this is an area capture game with a Viking theme. It plays very quickly. That said several games at the convention were abandoned as the game annoyed the players so much. However, not to be put of I gave it a whirl… Within minutes I understood the issue…. you do an action, someone else plays a card which negates your action, you play a card which negates their negate card and so on. Meanwhile you have spent all your cards and the other players can see easy prey…..

Inis is a game about spreading clans on an expanding map until one of three victory conditions are fulfilled. You do this by drafting and playing cards that allows you to grow or fight. Replace the cards with dice and you have the gameplay of RISK, where the players check each other until everybody is so close to victory that stopping one player will only pave the way for another.

Играл уже раз пять с половиной. Первая партия производит очень странное ощущение, непонятно какие карты лучше брать и в какой момент их разыгрывать наилучшим образом. Вопросы также возникают при сражениях. Но со второй партии все встаёт на свое место,война не всегда выгодна, причём всем участникам, карты можно очень здорово комбинировать между собой. Играл на 2х и 3х. Оба варианта хороши. После игры остаётся приятное послевкусие и хочется повторить.

Thinky territory control.  Warning: All players must be invested in actually grabbing winning conditions otherwise a player that does not is very likely to hold a kingmaking position.

I do like it, and it looks attractive on the table.

Yay! Card Drafting! Ugh! Area Control!

Inis is overproduced and under-explained. It is engaging, but in its current form it is just confusing.

Let's get this out of the way: Inis is attractive, but not in a way that does anything for its gameplay. Beautiful artwork, intricately detailed plastic pieces. 

The ornate Celtic style used on the cards is lovely, but overly busy, distracting from purposeful iconography. Thankfully the board sections are in a painterly, realistic style, but the difference between the board and the cards is jarring. Drab coloring can make things difficult for the color blind.

The minis are molded out of a mushy plastic that leaves figures leaning one way or the other and the Sanctuaries and Citadels wobbling on warped bases. Also, was it necessary to have different models for the figures when they all have the same play value?

As for gameplay, the card drafting is needlessly complicated. The option to swap cards already chosen with cards just received leads to analysis paralysis in players with commitment issues.

Terminology too was chosen for theme, rather than function. "So, Citadels provide sanctuary during combat, but Sanctuaries don't, instead they're what we're fighting over to win?" "A Clash means I initiate combat in a region and a Maneuver is an attack that I make?" "Each of my figures is an entire clan?"

The provided Player Aid cards are mostly useless. They're not organized in turn-flow, the 'legend' side doesn't explain the worst of the terminology, and none of the game's multiple victory conditions are listed.

On the topic of victory conditions, game end can (gratefully) come out of nowhere, often with little to no recourse for players.

RATING: 10
With a set of strategic concerns that are well outside my wheelhouse, Inis exposes how easily I can be blinded to the intentions of others when I focus too closely on my own situation. It is the rare eurogame that offers these types of reflections along with a player conflict system that somehow doesn't trigger my deep-seated rage when I'm attacked. All this while employing area majority as a (non-central) mechanic, which I typically decry.

A note on the artwork: I feel that I haven't yet recognized how important art and design are for me. There is an immersive quality to the gorgeous and consistent production of Inis such that, on some subtle level, I felt I was in the world of the game while playing it.

It is possible that the experience of playing Inis has had much greater impact on what I had previously held as my "game preferences."

Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of this *type* of DOAM game. It has minimal rules (it's more of a skeletal structure of rules), a bit of politicking/king-making, and a potentially unforgiving combat system.

But the reason why I like it is because of its streamline components, nothing extraneous or superfluous; in this way it's very elegant, which is something I always appreciate. And also the brilliant little twist on the card drafting mechanic that is the primary, driving force behind how you play.

With such a small deck of cards, the skeletal nature of the design is necessary for players to be competitive in any given situation. In a way, it's more sandbox-y than anything. And while I normally don't care for such games, I make an exception for this one.

After watching the "Shut Up and Sit Down" review, bought the game with high expectations.  Game arrived, got the group together (3 players) and 8 games later I wanted to go to bed, but the other guys were begging for another game.

Note: for a review, watch the SUSD video.  They do a great job.

Wow!!! Do we love this game.

The game is great out of the box, but reaches it's full potential when all the players know all the Action cards by memory.

When that happens, the game reaches a whole new level of tension, planning, twists and turns.

Very rarely has a game given a constant state of "tense" anticipation, as each turn plays out.

At first, we thought there's no way we are going to finish in an hour.  Wrong.  We finished and wanted more.  The next game was over on turn 2, about 15 minutes.  The third game went for over an hour as we got better at anticipating moves.  All the games since have been about an hour.

Most fun I've had in a hour's gaming in a long time.

Highly recommend this game.

We really love to play INIS:
- the celtic setting and saga you learn while playing
- you can win the game with or without fighting
- the artwork ist just stunning
- the shape of the tiles
- the Brenn isn't just the start player, you have advantages when you are Brenn, but 
  this doesn't mean, you are automatically the winner. 
- what makes the win, aren't overpowered cards, rather the players own strategy and 
  adjustments during the game.

Extremely tentative rating, but I don't see it rising. First off the artwork on the cards is amazing. Like really, really, really awesome. The tiles, while fine looking, don't really compliment the artwork of the cards. The components were rather nice looking. But with all that being said, I just found the gameplay uninteresting. You draft your 4 actions for the round and sometimes you can just get fucked over and not have much to do that round. Combat wasn't really interesting or even exciting and the game just kind of ended, not with a bang, but with a whimper. I'm not a fan of a "counter spell" card when you only have 4 green actions. It kills off 25% of your turn unless you've been accumulating red cards.

The tiles having special actions each just put this a touch over the top for me as it just seemed like it added unnecessary complexity. I'd play it one more time, but I'm kind of glad the artwork didn't suck me in on this one.

Inis is a weird game.

It has weird shaped tiles that connect to the incredulity of others, it seems like they're not going to! It has an amazing weird art that permeates everything, it is so psychodelic you can't ignore it. It has this huge cards in three sets, including the red cards, that are a ton and have even weirder art. The winning conditions are weird, and amount to 6, and are three, so it feels like 666? The first player is a Brenn (male or female) there' some harps you have to announce you're going to win. It is a dudes on a map game where you can choose not to fight if all parties agree to? WTF?

Inis is a weird awesome game.

Card choosing works as in 7 Wonders, but you don't have to take the one you keep on your first go, you could anytime on the draft, give up the ones you picked if you get a new set. 

It is a game you have to play twice to fully get, first time you are just reacting and figuring it out, second time you know what to do, you start strategizing.

People often make the mistake and play like this is an area majority game. It is not. 

It is an offbeat game, it is like watching an indie film. It is a game on another level, yet it works. It almost feels like a Sandbox game, you can choose what to do, and that is what might scare people, not having an specific goal, but that is what's fun.

Inis is a great weird game.

RATING: 6
Best card drafting and area control game I have played.

27/8 (ratings lowered from 9.5 to 8.5) - I still prefer this over Blood Rage perhaps due to the way that drafting is the focal point in this game. Drafted cards keep getting re-drafted in future rounds and in some way this allows you to predict what actions your opponents might have. Epic Tale cards being the random/unpredictable factor that your opponents should watch out for. Simple rules but a game that requires you to pay close attention to your opponents. This shouldn't be played with players that don't "play" the game. They would literally break the game and stretch a 60 minutes game to 3-4 hours. Will still keep this game. Looks good and plays well but if I didn't have this game at the start I don't think I would sink 300 for it.

04/12 (ratings lowered from 8.5 to 7) - Game is too dependent on the Epic Tale cards. Seems like the winner of the game is the one with the most epic tale cards. Overall too swingy and lengthy and too reliant on players to keep the game balanced. Game will get sold.

This is a pure push-and-get-pushed-back - game were waiting (especially in a 3-player game) until the others slaughter eachother will be a rewarding strategy. Some cards seemed to be fucked up, which make you think you're in control, but it's in fact a bit of a chaos fest. A pity, because the idea of adding tiles which adds extra special cards if you're Chieftain over there is quite nice.

RATING: 7.5
This was pretty good. Keen to try it again with 4. Certainly overproduced -- this could have just as easily been a lovely reasonably priced game, instead of the nicer yet too expensive game it is. 

It felt a little like a puzzle game, and a little more abstract than I usually like. But it was pretty quick playing with a wide variety of VP sources and ways to get to victory. Not sure about the role of the pretender tokens, but it 'd be easy enough to ignore them, i.e. no pretender token possession necessary to win. 

While all games will certainly be very different in virtue of the number of land tiles there are, I worry the game might start to feel samey quickly-ish since you're always drafting/playing the same cards each season (save one). I think the 3 player game would be better if you just played with all the action cards and, instead of removing 1 each round, we were to remove 5 randomly instead.

First play last night... and it didn't go so well.  Players had a hard time wrapping their heads around the game, even though it is quite simple.

Still, all agreed that it was a strongly thematic game with great potential for strategic depth. I like it.

A very combat-heavy area control game. While the small number of "action" cards is good for strategy (you quickly learn what your options are and can theoretically construct a cohesive plan), there is no escaping from the fact that direct confrontation and eventual ganging-up on this turn's would-be victor is inevitable.

The game seems to be a constantly revolving door of "screw-you"s, with each player having a turn to be both the distributor and recipient of strife. In order to win, somebody must become a "pretender" to the throne, and this can only be done if they meet a victory condition. In order to win, they must maintain this claim into the next round, so once somebody becomes a pretender they paint a target on their chest. This serves no purpose other than to delay the conclusion of the game. Another aspect of how victory is determined that I did not enjoy is that if multiple people "tie", then the game simply continues, opening up the possibility for each person to lose their claim to the throne. The mechanics seem to encourage keeping the other players down, which is really just another form of kingmaking. Eventually, there is a tipping point when there are too many territories or arbitrary VPs floating around for a stalemate to be maintained, and eventually the game ends. It felt more like trying to make the other player lose than trying to make yourself win.

A game I wanted to try out before buying. I wasn't terribly interested in it when I heard about it, but it was getting some good reviews so I wanted to try. It is a drafting area control game. The main problem I have is that the cards you are drafting are the same for every game. It will always be the same 13 cards or whatever. The tiles that come out will change and the red cards will change since there is a huge stack. For me the 13 cards from round to round was already getting boring by the end of the first game. I just played 3p and it had the typical problem area control games have at that player count. I surmise you really need 4p to make it work best. For me it was an okay game, but not one I will ever request. I could be convinced to play again but it is not high on the list. Very pretty though.

I passed over this originally because of the artwork as I found the board painful to look at and the box cover just downright minging. Having played the game, I can at least accept the board's design, but there is no excuse for box art that is just blech. Fortunately, the game itself transcends these issues: Inis is a card-driven tight area majority game, the mechanics of which are similar to my favourite *design*, Konig von Siam (aka The King is Dead). There are twice as many cards in Inis, which are drafted, and more you can acquire elsewhere, but other than that, the feeling of similarity remains with me. I like the three victory conditions and saw that there were good opportunities for clever card play. Good game, painful box art.

Card drafting, area control. Nice artwork. Interesting mechanic to trigger different victory conditions but it may also lead to an endless slog of stalemates, and yet everyone feels like they're generally one turn away from winning. A thinker's game, having to adapt tactics to various possible moves and conditions; can be a bit of a brain burner for some. A fair amount of combat, hard pressed to win without an aggressive strategy. Lots of player interaction with low luck outcomes.

This is a fairly dull dudes on the map game. The general idea is that there are three victory conditions, and when a player has achieved at least one of them, they can declare that they will win next turn. At the start of the next turn, if they have met more victory conditions than the other players, then they actually do win. Otherwise, play continues. The game's actions are built on an action card draft, where the same cards keep getting drafted and redrafted every time. This is good in that you can sort of expect what things will happen each round, but it's a little annoying because at times the types of actions you need might not make it around to you. The victory conditions are very dependant on your opponent's either not paying attention to you, or on someone just not getting the hand they need to stop you. The game can go on way way too long, and there's just little to no interesting tension.

Dieses Spiel überrascht und überzeugt tatsächlich auf der ganzen Linie. Es sind so viele Mechanismen enthalten, die kurios wirken, aber einfach von vorne bis hinten funktionieren. Das Draften ist anders und bietet in einigen (seltenen Fällen) wirklich mehr Möglichkeiten des Taktierens. Ich liebe die geringe Anzahl an (großen!) Karten, die schnell erlernt sind und immer im Hinterkopf bleiben- man weiß fast immer, welche Aktionsmöglichkeiten die Gegner noch haben. Auch das abrupte Ende durch die Siegbedingungen ist zwar nicht jedermanns Sache und kann das Spiel auch weitesgehend in die Länge ziegen, kam in unserer Runde aber saugut an. Alles zusammen ist einfach stimmig und passt zum grandiosen Aussehen der Karten und der Orte.

Love it! Everything you can do is written on the cards, so you understand the game very quickly, but it's still deep enough. There are three ways to win this game, which I find a big plus. Your strategy can easily change because of the other players and you don't know who is gonna win until the very end.

The cover art is the worst part of the game ironically. The rest of the art is great and useful for creating an epic setting for the epic battles. The game if anything is too balanced so your wits are the only things that can put you ahead of people. You don't have to attack people if you don't want to and still win which is awesome.

The first game my friends and I had of Inis was a little uneventful. By which I mean, we were all nice people who never attacked one another till the very end. However, each game from then has been a delight for those that are familiar with the cards. This game is surprising funny. The more I play this, the more I love it. Highly recommend =)

RATING: 9
This is a highly strategic game of area control. I find it much more methodical and mind-bending than other, more "traditional", area control games.  It is very chess-like in its play, with positioning very important as opposed to just straight area conquest.  The triple win conditions always need to be in your mind, both for your sake and your opponents. You need to juggle your own interests (which victory conditions am I going for?) as well as your opponents (what are they going for and how can I foil that while still promoting my own interests?)

The box art, in my opinion, is almost painful to look at, which is a shame because the card art and production quality inside the box are top-notch. The theme, celtic mythology, is original and refreshing.  I personally don't know of another game that makes use of this theme in a meaningful way (until Eric Lang decides to use it for one of his mythology series of games I suppose).  

I deliberately compared this to Kemet and weighed which I would prefer and ultimately I am very glad I chose Inis.

RATING: 5
An odd game.   The art is top notch, and the drafting element is interesting... but there's not really not much depth to justify its run time.
Feels like a feather light filler game wearing the pants of a mid-weight area control game.   Still, I seem to be the only one in my circle who feels that way.

RATING: 7.6
Fast, elegant and pretty.  Victory was had by Epic Tales Card, which I am guessing is the norm.  If this is the case, then it betrays weak board mechanics underlying the card play.  That said, I will gladly play again and perhaps find that the Epic cards less pivotal than I expect.

A tidy 7 with +1 for wonderful production values.  Mos def pick up a 2nd hand copy.

I found this game to be average. I mean, I see the potential, but I don't love the fact that there are only 17 action cards. I mean, they really set this one up for an expansion. I just don't like the way the actions work that much either. I can see the potential, but after a first play I don't think this one is good enough to make my collection at this point. I'll stick to Blood Rage, Kemet, Cry Havoc, and Nexus Ops. Would be down to try again, and did not dislike the game.

Missed out on this at Essen, and not too unhappy I did. It's perfectly playable. Good artwork, very balanced and I liked the card drafting. Also liked the toing-and-froing of dishing out unpleasantness when you see your chance at winning.

However it's one of those games that drag on as you...very slowly....work towards the winning conditions. It's all about reacting and ganging up on the player who has met a winning condition, then playing another two or three turns before repeating it all again. Just felt slightly frustrating and laborious at times. Happy to play again, as I liked a lot of mechanics in the game, but not sure it'd have seen a lot of table time if I'd bought it.

I judged a book by it's cover and I grabbed this game while waiting in line a line at Gencon 2016 and I am extremely pleased that I did. Since coming home from Gencon, Inis has been our most played game. The drafting mechanic between rounds allows for exploration of different combinations and card interactions without feeling like you wasted a turn. My favorite aspect of Inis is that there has been no mechanic or inconsistency in theme that has taken me out of being completely immersed in the game.

I was really looking forward to this game. However, I was sorely disappointed. It was more like an abstract chess match than a dudes on a map area control game. With the declaration of "I'm going to win if you don't stop me", the game really did drag on. Declare the possibility of a win, someone stopped them, Declare the possibility of a win, someone stopped them, Declare the possibility of a win, someone stopped them, Declare the possibility of a win, someone stopped them... I do like the card drafting and such in this game. I was not a big fan of the way battles are fought. It really weakened the players involved and allowed the others to have a huge advantage the rest of the round. Its a fine game if it were shorter and less expensive. I find the art captivating!

Inis is near perfect for me. Drafting is actually made interesting, and the deck of actions is so small that one completely familiarized one's self with it over the course of the game. Having a single card left over provides a brilliant unknown factor, and the Epic Tale cards manage to inject a bit of randomness without breaking the game. Pretender token works exactly as intended (I think all games should have something like this) and deeds can change the trajectory of the game on a dime. Everything about Inis just works.

Only thing that confuses me a bit is the art. Both the art on the cards and the art on the tiles is GORGEOUS. Cards are evokative and dynamic, tiles are compartively tranquil and easily indentifiable. But the styles just don't match up. They look like they come from two different games. And at least for me, that throws the experience off just a little bit. 

Really want this game. Good at all player counts, especially a tense chess-esque two player mode, in which the drafting is awesomely tough.

RATING: 7
Interesting drafting/area majority game.  There are different ways to win so you really need to keep track of everything when playing.  Very simple to learn but lots of tough decisions.  However, if you just don't get the right cards, it would be very hard to expand and to win.  You are very limited at times in what you can do.  Board and cards are very nice but the plastic player pieces feels a bit cheap.

RATING: 7
i don't usually play "dudes on a map" games (and honestly i wonder if it would lose anything to replace the "dudes" with cubes), but the theme and design of this along with the very simple-seeming victory conditions really drew me in. i don't normally go in for take-that slap fests... Small World isn't very random, Order of the Stick offers nostalgia, and i own so much Smash Up almost entirely only because i own so much Smash Up. i'm not interested in Khemet or Blood Rage. Inis is different than all that. it really feels like an abstract game (bring on the cubes!!) with a shifting board. the win conditions make it feel much distilled down, finding a groove that Ank-Morepork missed (and had to make up for with hidden roles). add to that the very contained card draft every turn and you've got some serious move-and-counter-move struggle. trying to read the other player's hands and intentions with every play feels so reminiscent of playing cutthroat Spades with my Dad and uncles. so elegant and clever! it suffers only a little from ganging up on one person (with a nice minor catch-up mechanism rather than player elimination, thankfully) and king making. it suffers also from the chaos of the red cards. oh, god! those damn powerful red cards combos! they can be so ridiculously game changing in specific situations, oooor they can be a dud every time. there's no way to know!! but, they're almost always worth getting just to unsettle your opponents. also, i guess they do end a game quickly. this is the sort of game i wish i got to play regularly. there's so much depth hiding beneath the initially arbitrary-seeming take-that and chaos. definitely hoping to one day run across a small "travel" version (with cubes!!) that i can convince my wife is not a mean war game but rather a variant of Hey That's My Fish...

An elegant game in which you are the leader of Celtic clans. Unique shaped tiles are puzzled together to a beautiful map. The artwork is one of the best and most thematic I've seen so far. No less a person than Jim Fitzpatrick (famous for his Che Guevara stencil) was responsible for the paintings on the cards and for the front cover of the box.
The game combines interesting mechanics with moments full of diplomacy. There are no victory points but several victory conditions. This makes the game exciting until the end. Great design!

RATING: 8
It's very pretty area-control card-drafting game, with huge cards featuring psychedelic Celtic artwork.  The draft is tricky even though you're only picking four cards total from the same small set each turn, and getting the right combination of unit placement and movement to grow your board position takes some thinking and luck, and can be disrupted by other players' attacks.  It definitely takes a bit of play to figure out the rhythm of moves, and seems like a deep system that will reward mastery.  I'm eager to try it again, but worried that experienced players versus new ones will be a one-sided blowout.  Game length also seems like it could be highly variable depending on how things play out.

RATING: 7
Very simple rules. With just 17 action cards there's good scope for planning for what's not been played yet. This is the high point of the game for me - just enough variation with the action cards and then throw in the red Epic cards you can hold from turn to turn to keep everything off balance. Nice little moments of conflict on the board. A constant balancing game.

My main criticism is that the red Epic cards are rather unbalanced. Sometimes you draw one after another that barely helps with your plans and other times I can't believe how powerful they are. I think they needed to be categorised between conflict, movement and expansion and the balance tweaked.

The artwork is refreshing. The interlocking boards are a great design. Unique regions with their own special abilities for control are a terrific idea. Player interaction is excellent, but victory seems to come with a surprise combo as players become weary and let their guard down. That might be good or bad, I'm still making my mind up about it. There's a potential for Kingmaking, but how much of a problem that is will depend upon the group. I tend to play with people where it's not an issue.

All in all I enjoy this one quite a bit. Nothing wondrous or completely innovative, but a solid package that plays in about 90 minutes with easily taught and remembered rules.

RATING: 8
Go in expecting some serious player conflict. There will be assaults. there will be serious "take that" play. 

However, what feels unrecoverable can turn around to be either a victory or a near win. The player in dead last can come from behind with one well executed turn and win. 

There's a LOT to unpack in this game, and it's pretty darn good.

Solid "dudes on a map" game that takes a very unique spin on combat and board presence.  I'd be oversimplifying things to say that this game feels like Cyclades with drafting replacing the auction mechanism, but one cannot escape the feeling that Inis "belongs" to the same Matagot collection as Cyclades.

So, I finally played this and I have to honestly say that I don't know what all the hype is about.  The game is ok and I can see what they're going for, but in the end, it's an area-control type of game that I just don't care for.  The card-drafting is meh and I didn't find the territory cards to be that interesting.  I also found that the gang-up-on-the-leader element just drags the game on.  I stopped someone from winning, only to delay them winning for 45 more minutes - we could have played a full other game.  Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but it was immediately dropped from my want list and I don't have any burning desire to play it again.

A very streamlined and beautiful strategy game. It is tense throughout the game and offers interesting decisions from the very beginning. I like how the table talk in this game works out. It is a lot of fun to see players try to force a draw with the current pretender so that they can try to improve their position the next turn. Light on rules and hard to win. An excellent game. I think I will keep playing this one for many years to come.

Update: One major downside to this game is that it is hard to play with new people. The game requires a lot of finesse and understanding of the game's mechanics. A new player will not realize when they should or should not play a card.

Lots of interesting things going in here.

What I love:

What I like:

Combat was easy
Winning conditions - although the action of taking an "I'm able to win" token felt kinda dumb

What I'm meh about:
Epic Task powers - some are really more powerful than others.  Felt like a balance issue.
It's a little chaotic since you don't know all of the cards, but I'm ok with that.

Looks super great, relatively simple to teach for the amount of depth. Absolutely brilliant card drafting/action system. Sense victory conditions. Last game you are frantically trying to squeeze every possible advantage from your actions and people fight for the win. You can make some VERY clever plays and then have them out-clevered by other players and it just feels brilliant instead of frustrating. The way the tiles influence actions and come out randomly, the way the drafting system works and the way the Epic Tales cards work means no two games will every play the same. Being able to pass on a turn, hoping the other players don't also pass so you can take a later action once you have a better idea of the lay of the land is brilliant too. Absolutely fantastic game. I also can't say enough nice things about the wild artwork.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play so I may improve rating with more. The game itself is fairly good looking (meaning the cards are gorgeous and the map is meh). The gameplay involves an interesting card/hand management mechanic that in the end feels kinda dry. It lacks the sheer crunchiness of Euros and the excitement of Ameritrash. Also, thematically, aside from the pretty cards, it is lacking. Not sure what all the raves are about. (However, just one play, so maybe more experience would reveal depths. Your mileage may vary.)

This area control game is quite nasty and feels a lot like Blood Rage and El Grande mixed together.  I am enamored by the art.  The game runs way past its 60 minutes stated on the box, though, which is its biggest draw back.  Theme end conditions can cause the game to last indefinitely.

This is one of those game that sounds interesting on paper, but just really doesn't come together all that well. It's not bad, but there's nothing too interesting. The basic action cards get pretty easily drafted, and then it becomes an opportunistic grab for a couple of majorities out there for some bonus cards. I wasn't wowed by any of it, and it seemed to be just a pretty vanilla area control game.

I really like the draft! And the cards are pretty, but it is just too random + bash the leader for me. At some point I had 9 troops in a zona, against 4 from each of the 2 opponents, but a fight came at the end, and everyone was left with ~2
Next turn I managed to win with 4 vs 3 for each of them, this time I passed a couple of turns, and when my opp. were about out of cards I put a bunch of troops there and had a counter to prevent any "riots" there.. seemed like a weird ending

RATING: 10
Possibly my favorite game. Every time I play, I see something new which blows my mind. It's very tactical and very interactive. You're constantly watching what everyone else does, and with three ways to win, you're never completely out of the game. Plus, the art is incredible! I expected there to be too much bash-the-leader, but the actions are restricted enough that it isn't usually a problem in practice.

RATING: 6
Area-majority game built around a very small shared deck of action cards, which are drafted each round. There are three different victory conditions, each based on a slightly different variation of presence/control. The action cards are used to place and move dudes on the map, with only some of them able to be used to initiate attacks; as with all such games, the plan is that drafting leads to games of bluff and timing. Control of individual territories also grants a specific territory card, so there's incentive to fight over specific locations.

In practice, Inis reminds me most strongly of Ankh-Morpork, which does the multiple victory conditions and location powers better; the game there is that you don't know who can win in which way, so players work to deliberately obscure their real goal. Because the goals in Inis are all public it is more transparently a game of trying to bash the leader.

The cardplay, unfortunately, is somewhat reminiscent of Strife: Legacy of the Eternals, which took R's basic premise and then made it so complex that the bluffing got lost in the chaos. Inis wants to be a game of second-guessing opponents, but combinations of powers (such as those that allow stealing cards) and the red events (which are so varied as to be utterly unpredictable and so powerful as to potentially no-sell any key action) make that just about impossible.

That's OK, but if I wanted a short and chaotic area-control game I'd pick something like Ankh-Morpork.

Nice artwork.

RATING: 6.5
One play.  I love the art.  I like the card drafting and board play.  I'm not big on the win condition.  For a game with the "I need to stop this guy so someone else can win", I'd probably rather play Kemet.  In general, I prefer a concrete end point instead of everyone hop on the leader.

I have a few problem with some of the mechanics of some of the cards.  I don't like the search the discard card, and the red power cards have pretty massive power disparities.  Still, it was interesting, and I'd play it some more.

Comments regarding 4-player game

Beautiful game but felt very limited in what I could do in a round. What you can achieve in a round is completely dependent on what cards you get access to in the draft and the choices in the draft are not that difficult.

What you need to do regardless of “strategy” is to:
-	Get more dudes on the map
Requirement to win in all victory conditions and it also increases the probability of chieftains status in regions which gives you ongoing benefits.
-	Get deed tokes
Very powerful as they get you closer to fulfilling win conditions and makes you more versatile in switching between the different ones.
-	Get red cards
Can contain powerful actions that cannot be predicted by your opponents and is a requirement to gain deeds from the Master Craftman card. The more you have the better but can differ much in usability.

Since all players want the cards which give you the above in the first couple of rounds the draft became rather uninteresting.

Playing the game felt more random than I expected. Inis had some interesting mechanics though in the way you draft, the passing tension and the battles.

Would play again to see if the above holds up, if it does I would prefer to play other area control/dudes on a map games.

Excellent game. Easy to learn, hard to Master. Provides compelling, tense, and interactive gameplay. The proximity of your opponents and overlapping victory conditions make ever decision in the game weighty and meaningful. It can feel like there is a scramble to be king of the hill at the end, with only luck to rely on, but that is far from true. It is all about jostling for advantage while ensuring that your oppents can not run away with a victory. The highlight for me is the simplicity of gameplay melded with high and tactful interaction, without it being over confrontational.

Theme doesn't grab me, seems to be depending a lot on card knowledge and quite random in play as there is a sincere lack of control. Mitigated by a drafting mechanism, emphasizing the card knowledge a lot more. Add in victory conditions that penalize the leader to pass a turn to wave a flag they can win. Hmm.

Ah well, friend of mine is getting a copy so we'll see whether my reservations will be justified. But for now, nothing really grabs me.

tl;dr: solid design, not for Eurosnoot!

This was quite the hit at Spiel. And it's currently the 5th highest ranked Spiel release on [geeklist=215374]the ranking list[/geeklist]. So I had to try this. Also, it comes from a company that mainly publishes accessible family and strategy Euro's.
The rules are pretty short, very streamlined and well written. Game play is pretty fast and the game flows well. I appreciate the artwork on the cards and the rule book (not so much the box or the tiles). The components are nice (but way overproduced). That's all good.
But this is not a Euro. After reading the rules, I thought this would be mostly an area control game. There is some of that, but there is a very solid amount of fighting. The fighting rules are very clean and easy, until you start playing cards. And that's where the main problem for me came from: there are a lot of cards that you play during combat of the type 'and now I do this, and you didn't see that coming, haha!'. Many people like that, but my group doesn't.
I really do believe this is a very good design that is very well developed. I like the fact that the same set of unique action cards are drafted each round, so you know what cards are out there and what effect they have. That's cool. But some of the things those cards do just don't work for my taste.
So solid, not for me at all.

Initial rating: 6.8/10

interesting area control game
has interesting mechanics and a good Celtic theme tied in

in short:
+ good area control game with thematic twists, great game idea
+ mechanics (drafting action cards, territory advantage cards, epic tale cards, unique combat system, majority over victory conditions, change of play direction, ...)
+ Celtic theme, tied in amazingly
+ artworks
- the big fuzzy-bordered tiles, oversized box
- rules a bit confusing, rule book not completely clear, errors in card texts, gameplay a bit repetitive ?
- heavily card based (sleeves necessary)
- can take long
- a bit expensive


I don't like the fuzzy-bordered tiles with the artwork showing landscape from a not fitting perspective. These could be improved and then the game would probably fit into a more reasonably sized box.
The cards are oversized. That's great for artwork, but not so practical.

Sad that it's for maximum 4 players, 5 would have been great.
The limited number of action cards make it feel a bit repetitive. The more diverse epic tale cards play a bit too minor role in the game.

RATING: 10
Have many more plays than I have recorded. A beautiful area control game, subtle and tight. The Epic Tale Cards take it from something purely efficient and strategic to another level of sheer fun. Having the Dagda at a key moment leaves the table in uproar every time. I'm still grappling with how /fair/ these red cards are, though, even after at least a dozen plays, but the rest of the game is so deep and satisfying. Also scales very well, from a chess-like 2p mode to a grueling 4p war. Now very excited for the expansion.

I have only played this game a few times so far, but so far it is my favorite dudes on a map game.

The card draft in this game is genius. First, in normal card drafts you draft 1 card, draft a 2nd card, etc. So each time you draft a card you are locked in with that card. This can really suck when you are trying to decide whether to draft a card and its worth really depends on being able to combo it with another card that you may or may not see in the remaining rounds of the draft. INIS has such an elegant solution to this problem. In the first round of the draft you choose one card to keep. Then you draft two cards from your new hand but this doesn't have to include the previous cards you just drafted. It offers so much more flexibility in the draft, and I love it! 

Second, I really like the fact that there is a very small pool of cards in the draft. Each draft you will see pretty much exactly the same cards (one card is randomly left out of the draft). This allows you to focus on considering the interactions between these cards. Moreover, it allows you to know what cards are likely in other players hands and then do you best to play your cards in a way to counter-act those moves. It makes the game very tactical. 

Finally, this game really is all about timing your moves correctly. This is why the rules about passing are so critical. You can pass on your turn in an attempt to stall on playing your cards and revealing you strategy for the round to your opponents to early. This is because passing doesn't by itself prevent you from taking actions later in the round. However, passing is still tension filled because as soon as each player passes in row the round is over. So you might pass in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage only to see everyone after you pass as well and end the round before you actually get to play your cards. I can't stress enough how much I like this game.

I have played this twice so far (1/1/2017). I really like the game. The card drafting for the Action card is very simple and easy to understand. The Epic Tale Card is what makes the game interesting. There are so many of those cards that will make the game slightly different for each play. And look at those arts! OMG.... So pretty....

Initial rating after a two-player learning game. This one has potential, though! The aspects of the game I found so interesting will bloom with repeat play, which is a good sign of the game's depth and potential to manufacture complicated inter-player jockeying. For a game that's not in my preferred genre (dudes on a map), there is a lot happening here. I hope I can raise my rating as I start playing in multi-player games.

[b]A unique twist on drafting and area control.[/b]

Inis does a lot of typical area control things, but what makes it unique is the card system.  There are 17 cards, of which 16 get drafted into 4 per player (for a 4 player game).  The cards are very unique and define which actions you can take.  You can't attack unless you have an attack card.  You can't recruit unless you have a recruit card.  After a few rounds, you know what all the cards are and you know what to expect.  This system is really cool.

On top of that, there are unique regions that grant powers to whomever controls them.  There are 3 different win conditions, and there is an Uno-style mechanic where you have to announce your imminent win so people have a chance to stop you.  All-in-all, a solid and unique area control game.  Area control isn't really my cup of tea, but I would play it again.

It has flaws. The combat system can take awhile to get your head around and it can get quite drawn out/repetitive, and like Cyclades is not terribly good two player, but literally everything else is brilliant. The drafting, the card play, the area control, the artwork, the player interaction and that same Cyclades like gameplay where everyone is trying to keep one another in check, knocking down leaders and preparing for battle but only striking at the right moment. However, battles seem to be more frequent and the cards have some really interesting abilities.

I've actually really enjoyed my two plays of this and wish it would get more play in my group.  It seems to be not setting the World on fire with everyone else though.

Personally I feel that every single action, card you get, decision you make is exceptionally important and has far reaching effects.  

This the best "you need to pull of a sneaky victory to win" game that I have played.  You need to bide your time, fly under the radar, manipulate the map and your opponents and then grab the victory when at long last they have no way to stop you.  It really allows a lot of creativity within a relatively light rule set.

I personally really like the art work and find it more striking than off putting so that takes things up a level for me as well.

I feel like I played it well, but the draft did not distribute the card abilities like it seemed like it should.  There were several cards I never got the opportunity to play.

What a brilliant and beautiful game this is indeed. There is something to be said for extensive playtesting and the rule book notes 7 years worth of it.  You can feel how well honed and polished the game play is due to that. It paid off big time.  

[ImageID=554375]
I know the cards scale for fewer player counts but truth is I just feel there needs to be at least two other opponents from yourself to really create the tension. I do like it with three players but two...just doesn't work right. The game is designed to be a "how can we stop that person from winning" and with only one person thinking that way it feels like part of the game is just missing.

Really superb game. Plays well with two but even better at higher player counts. The modular board and multiple victory conditions means that every game presents an interesting new challenge.

I've had the chance to play test the game in its early stages, and always wanted more since then! Tension is always high in this game. Even the choice between passing or playing must actually be well weighted. Playing it better, and with better opponents, I've got all the way to try guessing which card a particular opponent has drafted, based on his position in the game and his habits, and trying to counter it: so it's very deep, this adds a lot of fun! Theme is also strong and you'll find there is a celtic tale fitting each epic tale card's effect. A game is short enough and you can easily play 3, 4 games or more in an afternoon session. All in all, probably the best game.

Based on 2 player experience only:

What a wonderful surprise this game has been.  After 9 plays, I really don't get this game at all.  But I love it.  It's amazing how easily the game can turn such that noone's "out of it," yet this really isn't due to luck.  So strange, so beautiful, so enjoyable.

This game continues to be a mystery to me.  It's not to say I can't win; it's just too easy to let the victory slip out of your hands missing something your opponent is planning.

Love this deep but simple game.  Just wish the instructions were a bit clearer.  Referred to BGG for errata but even the corrected rules are a bit unclear or are clearly in conflict with the rules packed with the game.

After two plays, I have come to the conclusion that I do not need to play this game again. In some ways (drafting, majority control) it competes with Blood Rage for tabletime, while in others (standard action cards, the short game length, the precarious balance of power) it does not. I am not a big fan of games in which everyone is only one step removed from winning for half the game and needs to keep each other in check. Games like Cyclades, Kemet and now Inis (which is the worst offender of them all) feel too much like a knife fight in a telephone booth to me. No enjoyable building up your forces, but very into your face and mostly with an anti-climactic, abrupt ending. Even worse in Inis is that you need to have the right card at the right moment to even be able to simply move your forces. Also bad are the unbalanced territory abilities. Still, I can see that the game, like Cyclades and Kemet, could be great for people who like the very things that I do not. Overall, it feels solid enough for that.

Inis is an elegant game. The round by round card drafting is excellent, it really lets you get intimate with the cards, and allow you to work on your long term strategy, but also switch it on the fly when you need to. The modular board is cool, the extra cards you get for being the leader in each land and the Epic Tale Cards keep the game fresh. The art isn't for everyone, I love it personally.

There are some cool things mixed into this game. The card drafting, area control, and ever-so-slight diplomacy all work well together. I'm not usually much into dudes-on-a-map games, but I appreciate giving players a choice over attacking or peacefully working things out. The tiles, huge cards, and artwork all look lovely. 2p works, and is decent, but not preferred.

Pros: area control game integrated with card drafting, extremely high level of player interaction, moderate strategic bluffing, highly tactical decision-making, low-to-moderate luck

Cons: limited strategic options, highly variable playtime means it can overstay its welcome, aggressive take-that aspect, prevalent bash-the-leader play

A fantastic area-influence game tempered with card-drafting and set in ancient Irish Celtic mythology. The card draft and option to pass in the season phase gives each player a lot of power, making for a well-balanced game. The trick is waiting for the right moment to strike. In response to others' complaints, it is no more prone to kingmaking or bash-the-leader than any other area-influence game. As some have said, it is certainly more a game of tactics rather than strategy. It weighs heavy in the tactical decision-making, however, as it can be quite tense finding a way to victory. Surprisingly, it is a game full of diplomacy, negotiating and bluffing, but the social aspect can be subtle or subdued. With a high level of player interaction, it guarantees an excellent build-up and a climactic finish. As of February 2018, my favorite game!

Still mulling over my feelings on this game.  There's a lot I love about it, but the end game feels silly at times.  I love the tactical drafting and board play... but it's just too much back and forth.  When someone could win in 30 minutes, but another 2 hours of back and forth could continue.  It's even more than Kemet.  I kind of prefer the more definite ending of Cyclades.

After 10 plays, this is confirmed as my favorite "dudes on a map" game.  Being tactical about when to fight and when to concede is HUGE. There can be some king making, like in any area control game, but it's not too bad.

The game is rarely about strategy, which some people don't enjoy. This is a game about tactics, thinking quickly, and adapting – along with some clever bluffing, card play and drafting.

The theming and component quality is excellent, and the card play is really tactical. 

Best with 4 players.

Fairly good game, but you need to play it with people that know how to draft. 
The draft pool is pretty limited as well which makes it easy to learn but also means people get the same cards that are allowing them to win easily and you cannot stop it. 

The artwork is stunning, one of the best visuals in a game I have ever seen.

The game, while very cool in how it plays, feels pretty broken in terms of actual strategy. Too much of the game revolves around obtaining Gift tokens, which lower your victory condition requirements. When an entire game feels like it revolves around 1 mechanic (and not even a "main" gamplay mechanic at that), it feels unbalanced.

Great bulky components and some nice aesthetics on the cards and minis make Inis a game to behold on the table. The theme is also very well realized and the game has a lot of surprising mechanical and visual cues to the celtic culture.

The strategy isn't necessarily very deep and too often based on luck of the draw, especially when it comes to Epic Tale Cards, but it's workable. The combat system is an absolute lovable mess. It's so simple but the way it incorporates player discussion is genius and makes for some very hilarious encounters that involve the whole table and not just two players going head to head.

Huge plus for a very low barrier of entry. Inis is a pleasure to teach because of its simple and clean rules

The only bad thing is that Inis can be a drag sometimes. The 1 hour playtime can in reality be anything between 45 minutes and 3 hours. The 3 hour games are tense in their own right but you need to be a special kind of crazy to enjoy the wildly varying game length and also not pressed for time if you plan on having an Inis game night.

Very good card drafting driven dudes on a map game like Blood Rage, but completely different. If you like Blood Rage you will probably also like this, but even if you dislike Blood Rage you may very well like this.

Simple rules and simple gameplay where each player starts with just 4 basic cards, but it ramps up nicely from round to round with more and more cards added gradually.

There's a lot I don't like about this game. 
The main sticking point is the Brenn breaks ties, and if the Mountain or Iron Pass are in the staring tiles, you either place all your dudes there or there's little chance to dethrone him from that tile. 

The epic cards vary from being awesome to utterly useless. I find the draft to be a lazy balancing act. It gets worse when you know how to stop someone from winning, but can't because you can't get the required actions to do so.

Inis is sort of an alt-Blood Rage. It has a similar card draft, similar area control and card driven area movement and combat. What is different are the victory conditions. This isn't a point scoring game. There are three different ways to win and all of them are in play in every game. If you can win multiple ways on a turn, you have precedence over other players that can only win one way.

This is much more interesting than simply scoring points, as it allows stop someone from winning either by knocking them down or more importantly, by matching their win condition. This makes the decision space much more layered and dynamic, while also bringing into play the ability to negotiate, since points are not dictating the winner.

The art is absolutely stunning as well. It's sort of oddly busy and maybe even garish, but it looks different than everything out there and once you really focus in on it, the detail is astounding. The aesthetic really grew on me, as my first game carried on.

This is absolutely one of the best of 2016.

This is our family’s new favorite area control / area movement board game. I like the card drafting mechanic of this game. The card combo makes a lot of advantages for each round. The game starts with slow speed at the beginning to read through the card description but it will be faster once we are familiar with each card. The only thing that’s bother me is the “flock of crows” token which is not worked well when tossing

I'll likely revisit the rating on this one, but Inis is an interesting take on an area control dudes-on-a-map game. It has drafting much like [b]Blood Rage[/b], but the draft is with fewer cards and combat is a much smaller part of the game. It's more about the combinations of clan placement and the three different victory conditions. It's neat and one I look forward to playing some more.

Great merger of drafting and area control, with the drafting and subsequent action taking being especially well done. Art is fantastic. An interesting but divisive aspect is the win condition: it is inherently prone to kingmaking and cheesing wins, but is certainly more interesting than VP counting employed by every other game that turns those games into optimization puzzles.

Celtic clashing dudes on a map area control using card drafted deck building infused with epic mythos.  I like that during the draft cards can be returned to select different cards reacting to a later opportunity.  A limited number of base cards favors the card counting.  Add jigsaw territory tiles leading to unusual end game triggers with the number six. You even get to flip a pog.

RATING: 8.5
The simplicity of the ruleset combined with just the right amount of available information made the game pretty quickly accessible. But the card play was clever and always felt like I had an interesting decision to make.

I agree with Matt in his overall assessment of the 3 Matagot XL games. After only one play of Inis I still enjoy Kemet more. But it's surprisingly hard to fairly compare the two despite both being area control dudes on map games. That seems to be where the similarity ended.

Kemet is a tactical game that encourages... demands battles. But even a cursory glance at the mid game board state showed Inis wasn't that at all, as players occupied the same areas, which keeps the tension high. A victory condition actually supports not wiping your opponents off the map. In retrospect, I probably initiated more battles than I should have. 

It's the only (?) area control game that welcomes not obliterating everyone else... but you need to keep them in check, to avoid them becoming overpowering. It's a unique push and pull. It's something I think is giving some gamers difficulty who are expecting a more traditional area control game.

Inis does net some major points for being as rich of an area control game in such a short playtime. As much as I enjoy Kemet, playing with a fully complement of players is agreeing to a +2 hour play time. You can see the 8 years of work designing this game and I imagine that even comes more apparent with repeated plays. We played our first game in under 90 minutes, including time to teach.

Although I'm not vehemently opposed to a bash leader catch up mechanic as Kemet is one of favorite games which has quite a bit of bash the leader throughout a game, I was curious how it would play out being an often cited concern. Frankly, I was expecting it to certainly devolve into a bash the leader type endgame.

Although there were a few moments of "we got to get this guy because he is closest to winning" I can say a well played hand closed our game with no opportunity to even consider "bashing the leader" who won with a single victory condition. A smart draft and a well timed pretender token locked the other players out from being able to respond to the leader, netting him a rock solid win. Even more assured would of he had a deed.

I'm not implying every game will never have a bash the leader fest, but it seemed at least from what I saw, that a good play had the opportunity to mitigate this potential. 

Finally, I really did like the art in this game. I'm not big on most boardgame artwork. Some is better than others, but this is a very attractive game (aside from the box art). Admittedly, the artwork lends to this game's premium price, as it was done by Jim Fitzpatrick (who also did the iconic Che Guevara image). But it's worth it.

Inis was a game that I knew I was going to pick up as soon as I heard about it. Another Matagot dudes-on-a-map with a Celtic theme this time? Already sold. And both the designer and publisher confirming pre-launch that the game works very well with 2P? Double sold. I know that Inis is quite divisive, but I'm certainly on the side of people who adore it. I LIKE that after a couple of plays you'll be able to easily remember all the action cards. As I keep coming back to time and time again, I love games that want you to try to get into your opponents' heads, and Inis does just that. What cards do I think he has, and which do I think he'll play next turn? The gameplay is solid, turns move along extremely quickly, and the game is stunning (in my opinion). Hoping to get many more plays of this in 2017.

I absolutely love the way card drafting works in this game.  It's such a great idea, and it's one of those things I'd never thought of until now.  I like that this game is relatively easy to explain -- new players need to know about the victory conditions, and the card draft, and then after that it's just "do what the card says."  Don't be turned off by the box art, because the art on the cards is excellent, and the modular board tiles are great as well.

Inis is a puzzle as much as anything. If you've ever played Red 7 you will have experienced that moment where you declare you cannot make a legal play and you lay your cards on the table. Five seconds of play-by-committee later your significant other is gloating about how you missed an easy play, and not only that, one that would have guaranteed you victory! There's more than a little of that in Inis, although, thankfully, your most embarrassing oversights are unlikely to be laid bare to your opponents.

Inis is all about clever card play. I'm almost tempted to call it a card game with a board, rather than a board game. It's a deck builder as much as anything else, and once your deck is just right you make your bid for victory, ideally making the play that sets up that victory with your last card, then taking the pretender token with your last turn. This minimises the time your opponents have available to thwart you.

That you can go from almost oblivion to victory in a turn or two is part of the genius of the design. You are never out of this game, though it can pay to pretend to be. It's up to your opponents to be alive to your ruses. 

You need to leave your preconceptions at the door with this one. It isn't El Grande, in fact you can win without controlling any areas at all. It isn't Risk, and if you find yourself battling a lot you're going to be slaughtered by an experienced player. It isn't Munchkin, and if you're strategy is mindless 'take that' you're going to be slaughtered by an experienced player.

Make no mistake, this is a very, very good game that should be done in under an hour with four players who know it. I think it was possibly under-hyped.

Very good tactical card drafting game. A quickly created thick meta amongst the players will grow even if it's only your first game and the decisions are all tight and spicy.

First off, this game is BEAUTIFUL on the table.

The game is so streamlined and balanced, I think it will be difficult for other area control games to find space on our shelves (this game is the reason why Blood Rage is for trade). The action constrains combined with the win condition makes Inis feel significantly more strategic/crunchy than Blood Rage

The game scales well for 2 (removes action cards, less staring zones). I've read some comments/reviews that the conflict is zero sum at 2 player. For my taste, conflict at 2 players feels very strategic with a lot of focus on your action cards (especially your Epic Tale cards).

If Blood Rage have proven anything, it's that Drafting + Area Control= Fun!

Inis is a unique beast. You have 3 different ways of winning and you have to archive that during the action round, then still be able to win at the start of the next round. It's kinda like Chess in  that way, you claim that you can win, then people try and stop you. Great artwork on the board and cards

Council of Verona: Poison Expansion (2013)

RATING: 7
Fun fast little game. At first glance the game seems like it will be overly complicated for what it is. However after playing a quick round you get it and are ready to go. My game group enjoys this one and it will go right next to Love Letter on game nights as a solid filler game. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS play with the poison expansion, its not the same without it.

RATING: 8
An incredible bluffing and deception game, in contention with Red7 for me favorite microgame. The cards are excellent, the art is good (it grows on you a little), and the box is amazingly sturdy. So many surprises, accusations, and lies in one little box which has earned itself a spot as one of those games I'll take almost anywhere thanks to how easy to carry it is.

(Note: I have only played with the poison expansion and can't imagine the game without it. My comments on gameplay apply only to the game with poison)

+ Plays extremely fast but still gives you plenty to think about, bluff about, and stress about.
- Going last seems to be a crazy advantage; Not sure if there needs to be a rule or something to balance that out.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This needs to be a game that's repeated/known to be fun. The explanation portion of this game is rather lengthy and if the players agonize over their draft too long it drags. 

That being said I find it fun/interesting and enjoy the theme so I will reserve final judgement until we get a group to play it a few times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played at Origins 3 times with 4 players each time.

Had high expectations for a small game, but it seems like there are a few inherent problems with the game, and they are both linked to the same problem.

#1 Last player advantage is huge in this game.  They can play a card which changes the sway on council makeup and Council vs. Exhile (a Capulet or a Montague in the Council, or use Tybalt/Benvolio or Nurse/Friar to change the makeup to meet their influence markers.  They have the last card they have a guaranteed influence win since the board will not change.

#2 The last player is also the only person who knows the one card that is not played in the game. They can simply save it until the last card and the above players have no idea which one it is.  

#3 Drafting the entire hand is problematic because of issue #1, both Lady Montague and Lady Capulet need to be counter-drafted by the first players so that the 3 and 4 players don't have access to completely change the influence tokens right at the end of the game.

Overall, the consensus of the group (one including a published game designer) was that the last player advantage was too strong and caused an imbalance.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good filler with simple rules and a little bit of bluffing, deduction, and second guessing. Can be chaotic as your plans can easily be ruined if your tokens are swapped, but that's definitely part of the fun.

It's not even that hard or long to setup and play. The issue is that the decisions don't feel that meaningful, even for a filler game.

RATING: 7.1
Light hand management with some strategy, and a Romeo & Juliet theme. A decent game, but nothing exceptional, possibly because we don't have the 'Poison' expansion, which honestly should have been included with the base game if it's as good as folks seem to imply. Anyway, the varying powers of the cards do offer some variety, and if you play with 5 there are more added in. For fans of Love Letter and similar games.

Very light "double think" game where you try to figure out what your opponents are doing without giving away your own plans. The order in which you play your hand is crucial, and the token-switching cards are probably the most powerful cards in the game. Going last gives a huge advantage, which I can't see a way around. Otherwise, a nice, quick, clever little game with wonderful art.

RATING: 6
Playing this, I almost feel like the goal of the designers was to get the most game out of the fewest components, as opposed to making something fun. It feels like the complexity and downtime (during the draft) far outweighs the chaotic nature of the game. 

For something this chaotic and short in terms of play (seriously, it's three rounds, that means three decision, long), I shouldn't have to sit through a really long draft (it's long when everyone wants to read the cards to see what they do or try and figure out what cards others have taken), and the game shouldn't take longer to teach than to play.

I really like the core bluff-betting dynamics of this microgame, but find my enjoyment undercut by what feels like a large last-player advantage - perhaps it's illusory, but it's also seemed that way to nearly everyone I've played with, so it's a strong illusion. I don't consider the "play one hand per player in the game" to be a good fix - if I'm in the mood for a quick 5-minute game, I usually am not in the mood for 4 of that exact same game in a row. (This might be different if there were some sort of carryover of state from game to game - then it would feel like something bigger - but there isn't.)

I'd very much like to try this game with the Poison expansion / promo, in which characters can be killed off by influence tokens revealed during the scoring phase; this seems like it would maintain a desirable uncertainty through the end of play about who will actually score. If that didn't add too much chaos, I think it would be all to the good.

RATING: 4
Card explanation and drafting setup is rather slow because it is one hand of cards that gets passed around like Citadels for hidden role cards.

The main hook of the game isn't the drafting though besides setting up some potential reversal of fortune cards which adds to the game's double-think card and betting plays for the main part of the game.

It also comes with a micro version of the game where every player is dealt one card with two possibilities on it to choose from. The double thinking is reduced to a couple of outcomes including the Juliet player.

Double-think or mind game filler with betting and small drafting elements.

I love the idea, and the execution...but to me, it falls a bit flat in the play.  I think that it is begging for something *more* than the "microgame" treatment: five cards/turns just isn't enough to allow for the sort of strategic depth that I think this concept is worthy of.  Left me feeling unsatisfied (teased?); I wanted more opportunity to develop plans/plots, fiddle with influence, move people from Exile  Council, etc.

Very neat, very fast little game of influence. Your first game might not be the best as players need to figure out exactly what cards they want and how they think they'll be able to affect the scoring, but it will last exactly 10 mins.

This is pretty much what I expected... a quick and light microgame without player elimination. I think it is a bit more thinky than Love Letter. Basically, you'll be dealt a random card from the deck. After this players will draft from the remaining cards. After the draft each player will take a turn until all cards in hand are played (3-4 depending on the number of players). A turn consists of playing cards to an Exile zone or a Council Zone, optionally using a character ability (if they have one... ie moving characters from one zone to another or swapping influence discs), and optionally playing an influence disc face-down on any character that can hold influence discs. After all cards are played, each player in turn order plays another influence disc and then the discs are revealed. Any character that can be influenced has an Agenda (ie Romeo's agenda is being in the same zone as Juliete or another characters might be that there are equal number of Capulet's/Montegue's in the Council zone). Only characters who succeed in there agenda will give points to the players who have discs on them. It was decent but it felt too hard to be able score in this game and pretty random. For example, it seems like Romeo and Juliet will never score because they might not be the same zone, one of these may not be included in the game after the draft, and it's possible for one/both to die through the poison expansion. That seems a terrible waste of 2 characters that can be influenced, even if it is thematic. I think it would be best with 5 as there are 4 new cards which are included in the 5 player game which I feel would make the game more interesting. The sad part for me is that I like other fillers that accommodate 5 people much better: No Thanks, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, 6 Nimmt, and Dixit.

RATING: 4
It's ostensibly a game that requires clever card play, but since I had to play all the cards in my hand and other players were constantly changing things, my choices dried up to the point where I had to play a card to my own disadvantage; not very fun as a game drives to the end. 

I'd suggest you have 6 cards and choose to play 4 or something so you have some wiggle room and more decision space. As it is, I felt like "well, that happened" more than we played a game.

I printed out the P&P version from the Kickstarter and carried it around with me as my go-to filler game for months.  I've played it dozens of times, and it's just great.  

An excellent and well-balanced fast-filler that's dripping with theme, and really communicates the complex world of Romeo & Juliet.  It's easy to for culture to present the story of Romeo & Juliet as if it's a love story about the titular characters, when really they're just two kids mixed up in a complex world with a story that is much bigger than themselves.  There are so many characters with conflicting interests, and this game communicates the differences of those characters in a way that works so incredibly well.  Set aside your Cliff Notes, put your No Fear Shakespeare on the shelf, and pick up a copy of Council of Verona to experience the visceral characters of Romeo and Juliet in a whole new way.

Gameplay tip: We don't draft cards in the beginning, but just randomly deal and then pass two cards to your neighbor.  Works just as well and plays really quickly.  Also, don't try to draft cards when teaching the game to new / non-gamer players -- just deal randomly and it's way simpler.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Council of Verona is a micro-deck game of bluffing and control, based on the characters of Romeo & Juliet before the tragic end of that story.

The small deck of characters either allow players to take actions (exile/restore characters, move or view tokens) or to score influence if agendas are met.

Players also have several influence tokens with different values, which they can assign to open influence slots face down.

This allows for bluffing/misdirection, as well as interesting maneuvering for influence.

The game plays quickly, so it holds attention, as does the guessing game of who played what tokens, and the play time is short enough that repeat plays are easy.

This is a sharp little game, and I have rated it a 7.25 after a few plays.  I think it's a little more interesting than Love Letter, and it plays equally quickly.

Another nice contribution to the growing set of mini-deck card games.

I was able to scoop this up from Pax South with all the expansions. It's a neat game where you attempt to gain control using the various members of house Montegue and Capulet, Romeo and Juliet themed, fun and unique. Small box makes it easy to play on the go as well.

If Love Letter is too simple, then Council of Verona is the answer. It gives players much more control over the proceedings with some ever-so-slightly more complex rules, but is still random enough to give new players a shot at winning with about the same play length as the former.

Do pick up the Poison Expansion - it makes the game even better.

Excellent for what it is -- a super-short double-guessing game.  I don't agree with those who feel the last player advantage is a problem, at least with the poison expansion in play.  It's a five-minute game, and there are too many unknowns -- as well as influence tokens played after the final card -- to make a significant difference in fun.

2014-04-16 - This is a nice little microgame. It's easy to teach and plays very fast once you get going (4 players only get 3 cards each). It has a little bluffing. I do feel like the drafting makes the game a little longer than it needs to be. I wonder if it would play better with 2 or 3 than at higher players counts, which would give each player more cards and more options.

2017-11-06 - I like the theme, and the game is alright, but I don't think I would ever choose this over Love Letter.

The game starts with a card draft. Subsequently, players on their turn play one card either to the council or to the exile and finally put one influence on a character. If this character fulfils its goal, the influence counts as VPs.
Another microgame that doesn't stand the comparison with Love Letter. There's a lot more rules overhead while not really offering more fun (in the contrary) or depth to the high randomness of gameplay. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I actually enjoy this game, but I rate it a 6 because I cannot believe it was decided to publish the game without the Poison "expansion". It seems all too common for publishers to purposely withhold game content for use as future expansions or promos and this is a terrible offender. The game is marginally interesting alone, mainly only because of its pasted-on them., Regarding the components, the box is highly annoying, typical of a corner-cutting Chinese production.

Neat little drafting game, that I bought as a present for my girlfriend. This was a big hit.

With new players the drafting at the beginning takes too long though.

Variant: Deal out the right number of handcards to each player and have players draft with these. Weird card combinations make the game chaotic, but hilarious and the players can familiarize themselves with the cards in the game. 

On subsequent rounds you can proceed drafting according to the rules (or continue drafting with 3 cards for that extra amount of chaos).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple filler game along the lines of Love Letter and Lost Legacy. I find the game to be mildly entertaining. The drafting stage is often the most time consuming stage since everyone wants to get the proper cards to play. Gameplay is also quite chaotic. Turn order is a very important factor towards deciding which card to choose since if a player who is going first in the last round of card placement will definitely be at a disadvantage of having others mess with his/her play.

In the same vain as Cheaty Mages, this game is all about picking a side and doing your best to make sure your side wins.

Playing cards with the Romeo et Juliet theme is fun.  The artwork is great.  The game plays quickly and we've found that if it gets one play it stays on the table for another 5 plays or so.

Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you haven't.  And get the poinson expansion.  Makes things even more interesting.

This is a fun, fast game with bluffing elements along with some take-that moments (which my group always enjoys).  My only real complaint is that I think it should be a 3-5 player game, not 2-5.  The 2-player game doesn't work nearly as well.  It loses a lot of the bluffing and tension, and a lucky draw can significantly sway the game in one player's favor.

It's rather clear that Love Letter inspired this game, that's why I bought it. Accordingly, I will rate this game with that context in mind. Love Letter is a great game to introduce to non-gamers, not just as a gateway, but as a fun alternative to other ultra-light games. It's also something that can be played by gamers as a warm-up or cool-down game. While Love Letter is fun and a deduction game at heart, it offers little in the way of strategy. It's about 30% strategy/70% random. I prefer the inverse. Council of Verona, on the other hand, offers much more strategical planning, while also offering a considerable bluffing element. Additionally, this game in fun with 2, unlike Love Letter. I love this game. It builds on Love Letter's greatness, adds some new mechanisms, and raises the bar in general.

As expected, the poison expansion takes this game to a new level!

Update 3/9/14:
I played this with 5 players tonight. We had a great time. Though, I expected to enjoy this more with 5. Before tonight, I had only played at 2 and 3. Oddly, I didn't enjoy it even more at 5. There's more interaction, but there's also much more chaos. So, I would call 3 players and 5 players a tie. I imagine this would be best with 4.

Update: 7/6/14: Still one of my favorites. I LOVE THIS GAME!

Council of Verona is a clever micro-game.  The theme is based on the story of Romeo and Juliet.  The idea is that the citizens of Verona have had enough of the Capulets and Montagues fighting, and causing trouble.  So, a council is being formed to deal with the problem.  Some Capulets, Montagues, and others will be placed on the council.  Others will be relegated to exile.

On a player's turn they will put a card depicting a Capulet, a Montague, or a neutral character out onto the table either in the council, or exile area.  Some cards have a special ability that can be used.  Other cards have the ability to score points.  Once the player puts out the card, and uses the special ability, if one is available, and they choose to do so, then they can put out a point marker.  Some cards depict characters that have agendas, such as having more Montagues on the council than Capulets.  These are the cards that players may put their point markers on.  If the agenda is successful, then any point markers on that card will score.

Council of Verona has some bluffing, strategy, and surprise twists.  It's quick, easy, and fun.  A great filler.  I highly recommend it!

Very nice little filler game.  I'm not fond of the drafting phase at the beginning since it can take almost as long as the full game with new players, but once the game gets going the pace is good.  The mix of secret agendas and various abilities to shuffle cards around really makes for some interesting choices and opportunities for misdirection.  The quick play and easy barrier to entry makes me want to bring this out with a few more groups.

The poison expansion makes this game absolutely amazing. It's a brilliant deduction game that is quite short but filled with strategy and luck.

Deeper and more strategically interesting than Love Letter (though it's a fundamentally different game, I include the comparison since many people consider this the "Love Letter Killer.")

Either way, it's a solid, fast filler that still demands some actual thought instead of casual luck. I look forward to it staying in rotation as a filler game with my group and with the students I game with at school.

Fast-moving card game that I could see hitting its stride around games 3-8, once everyone is familiar with all the cards. But after that, I wonder if it would suffer the same replay value problems that, for me at least, plague Love Letter.
----
Replay value questions on plays 2-3... once you do know all the cards, is it really any fun to follow through on playing the game? Mechanistic gameplay invariably yields the following outcome: depending on which card is thrown out, either there will be one more Capulet or Montague in the council; Romeo and Juliet will be together, 4 neutrals in the council, and no one in exile. Greatest advantage to the last to draft, who sees the card that's thrown out. Perhaps novelty value is all that's here?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nifty little micro-game that still has room for some bluffing and a little bit of strategy. I wonder about the imbalance of various starting positions, but would need to play more to confirm or deny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
--- Preliminary thoughts ---

The last player has a huge advantage (knows what card has been discarded and he's the only one who will play 1 card (his last one) knowing the final composition of the Council-Exile board.

You place bets, but you really don't have a lot of control of what happens (obviously, the more players, the less control).

Memory is important: if you memorize the cards that were taken during the draft phase, once some of them are played, you will know who owns the rest and you can second guess their strategy.

I don't think it has a lot of replayability. There's not enough variety or combinations.

I will improve the rating if I'm wrong.

One in the new fad of 15 min micro games, but one which left me cold. Get 1 secret card, then 2 others via a pass-round draft. The cards offer either VPs if a condition is met, or an ability to hopefully obtain a condition on which you can score. After you play a card, you may play a face-down scoring chip on any VP card in play that you think will have its condition met by the time all the cards are played ... being after 3 card plays each. So the ability cards seem vital. Going last seems good for abilities, but is offset (more than offset?) by not being able to get onto the likely VP scoring cards. Reveal your scoring chips, highest score wins. Which all sounds like a likely game, but it's just not that interesting playing out 3 and only 3 cards, and then guessing who's going to play what ability last to screw things up. And each game just has to feel similar to the last. Dull, and not a game I wanted to spend another 15 mins on.

It seemed like a solid game, but not necessarily something I’ll be seeking out. Council of Verona lacks the laugh out loud moments of reveal that are so prevalent in Coup, and to a lesser degree, Love Letter.

Microgame at a good level of subtlety vs bluffing: Poison expansion is essential as it adds no extra time yet brings more finesse.

This is a very silly filler game. Over three rounds, each player plays a single card, then they may use the ability on the card if any, then they may place a scoring token in an open slot on any card if any. At the end of the game, each card with scoring tokens is checked. If the card met it's printed requirements, and that card didn't die to poison tokens, then that card scores for whomever placed on it. Since each player has only a 0, a 3, a 5, a poison, and a cure poison token, at best you can hope to score 8 points, but it's usually more realistically only 3, 5 or everyone gets zeros. The game plays very fast, and the neat thing about it is that when people's plans are messed with by other players, it doesn't feel personal, since it sort of unfolds to the characters in front of you. It's like, of course either Romeo or Juliet were poisoned. There's 6 slots between the two of them that could accommodate a poison token! This game isn't mind blowing by any means, but it's absolutely worth a chaotic laugh. The expansions bring replayability, so I don't think you should play this without them. Both the poison expansion and the corruption expansion.

This is a good game in the "Love Letter" category.  There's more to do than in Love Letter and all the tension is built up during the game and resolved at the end.

note, I haven't played without the Poison expansion.

I really like the ideas of the game. Cards are from one of the two families or neutral and most characters on the cards have their goal. If the goal is met the players supporting that character, card, gets points.
You place the card in the city council or out of town and then you activate it's special power, if the card has.

In the first play I saw too much going on to keep track, it felt turbulent. Maybe I get better notion after more plays.

A decent filler. I prefer this over Love Letter, but I'm not convinced there are many choices pr strategy on display here. I strongly recommend playing with the poison expansion.

This was a little disappointing.  There really just feels like there should be more to this game.  The game is too short to set up a bluff with the zero.  the card drafting aspect is interesting when trying to set up a strategy but overall the game was just blah for us.   However, the poison expansion really rectifies these problems and transforms this game into a very solid filler.

Well it is short, has an ok theme ( though  thematically why are the only options to have people be on the council or in exile?), and I do like drafting as a mechanic. Aside from those things it's swingy with very little interesting decision making and an insane last player advantage.

RATING: 4
It's going to be chaotic, but each round is simple and quick. Then it's off to the next round. What's not to like? Well, the last player seems to have a significant advantage for one. (So there must some sort of control there somewhere.) So you'd better play those multiple rounds... or you could just call it and enjoy it for what it is. Probably group dependent on those who take these light games seriously or not.

Still a little hesistant that it will hold up to repeated plays, but it's a solid filler with some simple rules and just a few bits, yet just enough going on to have really good intrigue. I like that there's a bluffing element with placing your chits and that there are just the right amount of competing agendas to make it interesting how to get the cards. I also appreciate the drafting aspect as it lets you shape a strategy and gives you information about your opponents.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Uninspiring bluffing microgame of hidden influence. Scoring cards have an agenda (e.g, Romeo must be with Juliet); if the agenda is fulfilled, players score the value of their face-down discs on that card. Other cards have abilities, like moving a card between locations or swapping influence discs.

It's OK, I guess, but dry as dust by comparison to the likes of Coup or Love Letter and with frustratingly little control [i]or[/i] meaningful bluffing.

The poison expansion adds the opportunity to kill of characters, who are removed before checking agendas. In practice this does fix the problem of the last player frequently being able to determine all or most agendas, but it does so by removing even the modicum of control in the base game.

Note to self: comments above were based on playing with the upper range of players, but I hear that the game works well with two, which I never even considered (because Coup and Love Letter are awful with that number). Try with fewer players.

I liked it...not quite as much as Love Letter, but I still thought it was a pretty intriguing game.  There is a slight advantage to going last, but it's alleviated by everyone getting to go last once.

I do wonder if the drafting could be sped up a little bit, but since there's only one card left out, it seems difficult at best to come up with another way to go about it.  My initial reaction was to make it more 'Fairy Tale'/'7 Wonders'-like.

Interesting yet brief little game. Part of the challenge is trying to deduce what cards everyone else is holding, and in what order they intend to play them. I suspect it would improve with repeat play after everyone gets a feel for what all of the different cards do. Luckily, with a play-time of about 5-10 minutes, repeat plays are easy! I did feel as though there was a significant advantage to going last. I wonder if this advantage would be minimized with experience.

I don't mind games not having a theme, but this one actually goes a step further and feels like it has negative theme. There are two piles of cards, you can play cards into either pile, and some cards score points based on how many other cards are in that pile. That's it. Nothing else. Play and move cards between the two piles.

On top of that, as many people have pointed out on the forums, there's a huge advantage to playing the last card of the game. So that ruins most of the hidden information aspect that the game had going for it. This game has been compared to Love Letter because of a few similarities, so I'll say that I very much prefer Love Letter.

Sold.

This is a fun little microgame thematically set in the world of Romeo & Juliet although the theme certainly isn't required or pervasive.

When you play 2 players it feels like you're playing the same game over and over each time.  With 3-5 players, you have much less options, and there's a very distinct thing you're trying to make happen and it NEVER goes according to plan in a great way.  Although 5 players is probably too chaotic, you really only have time to make one move and possibly mess with someone elses plan.

Game is really fun, I'd sell it as a slightly more complex Love Letter.  Everyone I've introduced this game to doesn't want to go back to Love Letter afterwards.

It is really chaotic though, you'll just be laughing at points because you have no idea what's going on anymore.

RATING: 7
Very clever neat little game. Only three rules/actions and a few minutes of gameplay but so much depth. There is an element of deduction as in Mr. Jack, but this is more interactive and interesting/exciting until the very end. The bluffing is not the dominant element at first, but through repeated plays a metagame quickly emerges that keeps players on their toes. 

I was nervous about some of the negative reviews on here, but honestly have no idea what they are talking about.

EDIT: On more extensive play and after adding the expansion, I actually do understand the criticism now. Using the poison counters from the expansion you can run into games that leave all players empty handed. They also add a lot of chaos and fog of war. The game thus can feel like you are flying blind and you might as well just randomly place tokens. In short, there does not seem to be any strategy anymore.

I downgraded a bit given that experience, but I will still hang on to it. This game may actually be better without the expansion. A few more games will (have to) show.

This is a light bluffing game where players take turns playing cards and resolving their effects to move characters around, gambling on their final position. It's fun for what it is, but it's a micro-game and those tend to burn out fast and this one did, at least in our group.

Each member of the Bard's famous play have agendas, usually a certain number of people in the eponymous Council, or in exile, except of-course Romeo and Juliet themselves who just want to be together. A great game of playing characters to enact their abilities, and secretly betting on who you think will have their agenda met. Unless the Poison expansion is in play, in which case, they may die all together. Brilliant!

Thematically, I love this game and it's character art. It is also short, with simple and straight forward rules.  The bluff chances are moderate to high, but any strategy that you play can easily get derailed.  I almost always play 2-player games with my husband, and as a 2-player game, the "board" can be a little transparent. I suspect it is more fun with more players, so I anticipate changing my rating once that happens.

While I have played this twice, I have to wait for my final evaluation, as I missed two rules that changed the game a bit too much - for the worse. First, we didn't remove the 4 point Influence Token from our 3-player games. Second, we forgot to let everyone, in play order, place another Influence Token at the end.

We felt that the game gave a huge advantage to the last player in turn order, but had we played correctly by the rules, and allowed each player to play another Influence Token, things should even out a little. I hope to try this again.

I've played Love Letter and Coup... but I have the suspicion based on my first play that Council of Verona is my favorite micro-game.  The hand of cards gives you just a bit of long term strategy (particularly in the 2 player game, which this does much better than the other micros I've played) while the bidding tokens give you a chance to mask that strategy through bluff.  Great art and theme are supported by some fine components including a heavy duty box and high quality linen cards.

I've only played two player games so far but if this scales up as well as I hope my rating will increase as well.

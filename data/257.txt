151117 Still love the idea of the game but its gameplay is degrading in my mind's eye.

100103 Great idea, but it must have more than 2 players.  Would play any time if that was the case.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is an OK game with some black humor that sort of straddles the line between a social game and strategy game.   There are different variants of the rules included in the game, and we normally play the version that uses both Doctor Lucky and the dog.  We've found this prevents one player from getting a very quick victory and allows the game to progress more naturally. 

There is some light strategy, but it's way too much luck-based for me.  It can also become tedious when the game drags on forever, because everyone has a ton of cards to foil the murder attempts.  Still, it can be mildly entertaining for a few gos.  

Of the two, Clue is vastly superior.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The play on this game changes dramatically depending on the number of players - not for better or worse, just different.  Getting alone in a room with Doctor Lucky is easy with three players, dang near impossible with six.  This is improved from its Cheap Ass Games past, where it was just a "wait out until no one has enough prevention cards," in that you get bonuses for even attempting a murder.

Fun, light game. Can have a little to much downtime, players can get skipped alot if someone sets it up so they get multiple turns.  This mechanic sees it rarely hitting the table, as my players find it irritating to potentially lose many turns with very little power do anything about it.

My favorite type of game: Simple to learn, easy to teach, doesn't require a lot of deep concentration but still has a nice layer of strategy involved. I've played this game with three different groups of varying board game experience and have yet to hear a negative word about it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
2 plays / 5+ players

LIKE: Great, funny theme.
DISLIKE: Feels random, chaotic. Strange "stalemate" strategies, when players are in the same line of sight. some downtime between plays if there are many players.
OVERALL: Not a difficult game, but seems a bit slow for what it is. I find it funny when you get a bonus for trying to strangle the doctor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a game of attrition. Mechanics are simplistic and strategy is nearly non-existent. So it generally comes down to a slog - not terribly lengthy - to find the end game. Not for me, but I could indeed be talked into it with the right group (somewhere around Monopoly in that sense).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
*Rating based on 3 plays.

+A somewhat enjoyable "reverse Clue" logic game.

-With the way that turn order changes depending on where Dr. Lucky moves, it is possible for a player to wait a long, long time in between moves, especially if some players are prone to analysis paralysis.

-The game can end suddenly if people refuse to play their cards to prevent someone else from winning.

RATING: 6.7
It's a good game that accounts for how some of the rules could be used as an advantage and ensures that one single person can't get all the cards. The only problem is that the pre-killing phases often takes a large portion of the game and doesn't affect the card distribution too much. And I got this super space-saver version so it's not even a space killer in my closet.

A very enjoyable game with a fantasic theme, but you have to have played a few times to know how to properly "ride" Dr Lucky since that isn't obvious from the rules (or theme).

It was my entrance into this hobby, so I can't give it bad marks.

Nor would I, though.  I still like this game a lot.  It's got strategy, bluffing and screwing people over.  Many don't like being skipped, and games with a lotta people tend to run long.  But getting down to the end and killing him with a poke in the eye can be rewarding.

This game is wonderful. Can a player win on their first turn? Yes. Can a player play way better than everyone else and totally dominate the game and still loose? Yes. Can the game go on for a little too long? Yes.

Howver, none of that matters. Play the game and read the flavor text on the failures as you use them. 

I almost gave it a higher rating just to bump it up the list. More people need to know about this game

You know when you wistfully wished you brought a game to someone's house, it's got to be recommendable! After a long 3+ hour game of Agricola, we wanted to play something easy, not a brain burner, and under an hour - Kill Doctor Lucky came to mind. 2015 UPDATE: One of the few games that I upped the rating as it's become a favorite that is tons of fun! I plan on getting the card version soon, so we shall see if it compliments this or replaces it!

Yikes.  Terrible game.  The first 15 minutes was boring build up.  The second 15 minutes was OK manoeuvring and the last 15 minutes was boring waiting for one person to win the game.  It's also got the Fluxx-like potential to go on for far, far too long.  Everybody being half-drunk before you start this game might make it tolerable.

The original, CAG-001 non-Director's-Cut edition. Probably bought directly from J.E. at Origins way back when, along with Give Me the Brain. 

Ten or eleven years later we play our first couple of games. The first two were very short as we hadn't quite worked out how things go yet; the third was long and enjoyable. I kind of like the lack of explanations on the failure cards -- it means we get to come up with our own silly reasons why that damnable Doctor wouldn't die! And after another couple of games at work, I think it's proven: this game is really fun with a good group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is usually the game I play with non-gamers (misc relatives and such).

I own the Director's Cut version of this and we use the default board for 3-5 players and the additional "mansion" board for 5-8 players. Also we practically always use the variant were a player gets a counter for every murder attempt. He can use these counters as additional points in murder attempts and/or additional failure points (a public ones).

2006 Since seeing this mentioned on a few geeklists I was curious enough to buy it without really reading any serious reviews. Even with only playing it four times since buying it that decision isn't one I regret.

Now that I've had my fifth game I seem to have reached the point of not being interested anymore.
A sixth play with five or six completely new people and I had fun again. I don't think I'll be playing much more but with new people it seems a fun diversion.

2015 I've played a few more times with the new release with "proper" board and pieces etc. The game isn't better but it does look nicer and while playing with people that enjoy it I also enjoy myself.

The first game dragged on, the second was fast and the third dragged a bit. Overall I think it just doesn't play fast enough. It's a light game and it needs to be over in about 45 minutes but that seems to be the exception rather than the rule.

The best way to describe this is "Clue" in reverse.  I have gotten a few friends into this game with that description alone and hooked a few into the idea of "Game Nights".  Fun, but I would like the win to be a little more climactic than everyone else just "giving up" and letting you kill the doctor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fun game with 4 or 5 players.  I've only played WITH spite tokens which I quite liked and can't really imagine playing without.

With more than 5 players down-time can be a serious issue.  It's easy for 2 or 3 players to maneuver so that the remaining players get very few opportunities to act...boooooring.

This is a really simple fun game that anyone can play.  I like the theme and idea, and the cards themselves are amusing, but every time I play it seems to drag on until you run everyone out of save cards.  I think that if people were more aggressive and just made more attempts earlier, take advantage of expansion rules such as revenge tokens it can speed the game up significantly.

This is one of the better Cheapass games. That being said, this is also a game that you will get burnt out on before too long. My group used to play this quite a bit, but the game can go on for so long that we decided to spend our precious game time playing something more worthwhile. Save Dr. Lucky is probably even better than this, since it literally forces a timely conclusion to the game.

As far as Cheapass Games go, this one packs pretty good bang for your buck. It is actually quite unique, and requires a little strategy to do well. It is very much open to tinkering and house rules, which I like. For such a simple game, it can lag at times, but it does (thankfully) have a built-in clock. For what I paid for it, I can't complain.

Played with full compliment of 7. Of my 6 starting cards I was dealt 5 'Failures' and then proceeded to draw 6 further failure cards on back to back turns. This game was obviously going to be ground out much longer than the 45 mins. Through other players using move or room cards (of which I was only to receive one the whole game), the turn order seemed to miss the same players repeatedly, leaving me with the feeling that this game has no applied skill, is utterly reliant upon the card draw and the unpredictable action of others. The collection of spite counters forces a long drawn out death but I was wishing for my own demise long beofre the game actually finished itself off.

Utterly dreadful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Can be fun or tedius depending on how the cards fall.  I think that limiting the number of escape cards in the game for large groups is necessary, as we had to go through the deck several times before we were able to burn through all the escapes.

RATING: N/A
Nice game, very simple but nice and funny. It's a good game for the rookie of the boardgames to play a game where you have a little strategies to attemp to kill the doctor when the other player are missing the fail card. Much lucky so your strategies are also a lottery!!!

RATING: 8
A sort of reverse clue. Instead of finding out who killed the guy, you want to do it yourself, without witnesses. Unfortunatly, the humour of the cards can wear off if you play too often (like more than twice a month) and there can be a problem of king-making.

RATING: 6
The art and story behind this game are so charismatic and great. The end spoils the whole affair. You go around the table and see if anyone volunteers to stop some one. If they don't, that's end and everyone glares at the people that could have. If they do, then it's one step easier for someone else to win. Everyone just ends up unhappy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Like many Ernest games -- fun theme, cute presentation, and absolutely no strategic depth whatsoever. The game goes on until everyone runs out of cards to keep the next player from winning. Then that player wins.

Not terribly balanced or strategic, this game plays easy and fast, with some interesting twists, and a fun theme that everyone gets into.  Not for a group of "serious" gamers, but it's a fun diversion for those who just want to be a bit competitive and still laugh and have a good time.

I enjoy this little cheapass filler -- but moreso because whenever we played we used a little jade Buddha, so the game is now referred to as "Death to Buddha".

RATING: 6.5
More like a filler type card game than a board game. Played with 3 it is a lot of fun but very, very quick and quite chaotic. Played with 4 or 5 it is about the right length and has a little less chaos and at least some tactical thinking. I don't fancy playing with 6 or 7 (would be way too long).

RATING: 6.5
An okay game and one I'd play on occasion.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game about being in the right place at the right time.  For such a simple, family style game it's does some interesting things.  Needing to get the old man alone to kill him is difficult.  Then you get the mini game of people playing failure cards to cause the murder attempt to fail.  It's neat....nothing mind blowing.  Strictly something for families and entry level gamers.

Entertaining game wherein players try to match weapons cards with room cards AND meet Dr. Lucky alone to bump him off. Tends to wear over time due to stylized play induced by the map.

This was my gateway game. I owned the original cheapass version and had a good time. So I had to buy this one! Then I looked around the store and saw everything else they had...

The pawns in this version were rediculously awesome/large, and the wooden rage-tokens are nice too. Its a really nice looking game.

RATING: 6
Every time we play this with a group (usually at the end of a gaming session), it's a lot of fun, but I personally find it a little too hectic. But it's possibly our most-borrowed and requested game (no, really! Baffling, I know). I recommend using the figures from Heroscape, or something else appropriately goofy, as playing pieces. Played this much more in previous years, not so much since I started logging games played. The deluxe edition is interesting, but gets away from why I like the game! Although... 'And His Little Dog, Too?' Heh. Tempting.

Pros: my parents will play this game and that's saying something, the 'screw your neighbor' element is present but not grudge-inspiring.  Cons:  the first time you lead Dr. Lucky by the nose, it's entertaining ... the Nth time it happens, you want to scream.

RATING: 6
All the criticisms of the game are true.  It does suffer from pushing the save off to the last player (a la Attika).  There is also limited incentive to try to kill early as there are plenty of save cards available.  However, I like the concept -- it's a lot of fun, especially with the right group.  I would play it again. Two copies, so one available for trade.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Not bad, quite light and definitely more luck than I like. Saved by it's short playing time: we were maybe around 15-20 minutes per game. For that playtime you get a decently fun game experience.

too much wandering around, hoping to set yourself up for a good play, only to have the doctor moved far away. Cards are unbalanced and usually one person lucks into running away with it.

Nice setting, actually, but implementation has fundamental problems.

Not recommended.

The idea is a little fun - a reverse Clue. But the game isn't very good. The only really interesting thing you can do is taking multiple turns by predicting where Dr. Lucky will go, but that means that other player have to skip their turns, which is never a fun mechanic.

As all Cheap-Ass games. This is a great game for the price, and I don't mind having to supply my own pieces and moneys. The winner of this one is mostly random, which lowers its score from me.

A light hearted relatively quick game. If you get into the role playing where you are trying to thwart your fellow murderers (would-be murderers?) plans it is a romp. Yes, there is some luck involved but you also can convince people to go else where so your plan will come to fruition. I highly enjoy this game although, I have the previous version which I like better because of the art work.

This is basically Clue, but with more player interaction.  I classify this up there as a "wandering the house" game.  Not bad when you consider the fun you get from playing luck cards or whipping out a badass weapon to "off" the Dr. with.  Ha!  Fun game.

One of the better efforts from Cheapass, but still ruined by the "failure" cards, as the game will almost always be decided by a "kingmaking" player. In the case of Cheapss, "one of their best games" doesn't mean a lot. Oh yeah, and it takes too &)^*&% long just like every other Cheapass game.

[thing=257]Kill Dr. Lucky[/thing] is basically [thing=1927]Munchkin[/thing] with an added spatial element.  For my thoughts on Munchkin, go [url=http://france.worldcupblog.org/files/2009/11/crying-child1.jpg]here[/url].  The spatial element actually adds a lot to the design insofar as it gave me something to think about beyond the stupidity of playing a game that is so random and so juvenile.  Despite that distraction, the feeling is inescapable; you can't help but feel worse about yourself for having been a part of the experience.

For what it's worth, our first game lasted about 5 minutes (at which point I had already had too much).  Our second game lasted about 90.

The cards are hilarious. 

Unfortunately, the game takes forever to play out (spite tokens make the problem worse, not better), especially once everyone at the table figures out that early assassination attempts never work, so it's better to let the other players waste their time and cards, saving yours for when it might actually succeed.

Very nice components in the Titanic Games edition.  This game is fun with the right people.  I feel immersed in it's theme and game play but, people who are competitive and care about who wins will not enjoy this game because, the end is very unsatisying.

People who play to have fun with the story of the game and want some interaction with some thought and a few laughs with each other will greatly enjoy this game.

The two hours earlier than Clue theme of the game is really cool, and there are some interesting tactical decisions, but it really feels like the winner is completely arbitrary. Unless you're counting the block cards (and this game shouldn't require that) there is really no way to know if an attack will be successful. Whoever happens to attack when they run out is the winner.

RATING: 5
This game was actually better than I expected. Initially it seemed very hard to be in a position where you could actually kill Dr. Lucky due to the line of sight rule, but with 4 players it wasn’t too hard. The game was fairly quick (about 30 minutes or so) and I like that the turnorder changes throughout the game. The fact that you can bluff and force your opponents to play cards is nice to as is how you can “teleport” yourself or Dr. Lucky to different rooms; it adds some decisions to an otherwise light game. 

BUT… It has the same problem as Munchkin: when a player is close to winning and goes for the final game-winning move, the other players use their cards to prevent this (as they should, to be sure), but then the next player wins because all of the good cards have already been played… This is such a crappy gamedesign decision and the reason why I hate Munchkin (oh, and also because it takes 2+ hours to play). It will not happen all the time of course, but it did happen in our second game, in which I as the last player had to prevent a player from winning by playing all of my cards, but that just meant that the next player who attacked Dr. Lucky won very convincingly as everybody had used all or almost all of their good cards. Argh. That makes me sad! But in any case I would still play it again simply because it’s so fast and relatively relaxing.

I have one real problem with this game, which is that it could all just be slightly better than it is. The minis could be actual minis and not card. The board could sit more flat. The cards could have a nicer finish. The counters could be thicker. The humour on the cards could be mroe consistent - failure cards are funny on about half of them and the rest are just "you failed". 

But as an intro game for non-gaming friends, it's a blast. Initial shouts of "It's a bit like Cleudo" are soon dispelled as soon as the characters begin to spread around the board looking for quiet spots, and it's amazing how quickly people get to grips with bluffing over failures. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A decent beer and pretzel game that is the inverse of Clue. Try to kill Dr. Lucky in a mansion when you can't be seen. It's highly random because it's all about drawing cards to move, trying to kill him, and trying to prevent someone else from killing him. With all that card drawing you can get completely hosed by the cards and have little chance to do anything productive. With 5 the game played in about 25 minutes which is the perfect length for how random it is, but as long as everyone is in for having some laughs with the flavor text on the cards it's a decent time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Funny, quick, and light game.  It seems to run a little long for a filler of its depth, but I suppose one way of controlling game length is to remove some blocking cards (that save Doctor Lucky) from the deck at the beginning.  It's not a game I would want to play too often.

Blech. I played the high-end retooling with the nice components. This game is similar to games like Munchkin, where there are humorous things on the cards (the first time through) and there is a lot of back and forth: "Take that! No, you take that! Aha, but take THAT!!  This is fun!......later.....Is anyone close to winning?.....OK, is anyone close to winning NOW?..............OK, Bob can win if he does this and this....OK, good game Bob.

Still, I'd be willing to play occasionally if someone really wanted to, as long as we kept the game moving along at a nice clip. Otherwise, I'll pass.

I should admit, I rate this a 9 with the caveat that you play with the variant that you can kill other players.  I played this on an almost daily basis 7 or 8 years ago with a group of my eighth grade students, and it was not unusual to have 12 kids around my desk at a time.  If you didn't off the other players, the games would never end.

Played first game with 4 players = very good game.  I like the ability for additional turn comobs.  The spite tokens are a great idea.  Failure card elimination makes a nice game timer.  Fun game!
Only downside would be the potential for a kingmaker situation.
6 players too way too long and almost everyone wanted to quit - NEVER again!

The game is deceptive. The game is all about positioning your pawn to get the best opportunities. For someone who doesn't do this, they will spend most of the game watching other people have their turn.

After several playings this is a disappointing game. It plays better with fewer people. It is all about clever position of your pawn.

One of the Cheapass classics. I love the idea behind this game and the humor and game mechanics are great. The game mechanics allow a player to take multiple turns in a row or get a turn out of position if they are in the room with Dr. Lucky. This is part of the charm of the game, but it also makes it likely that someone will get frozen out of the game for a long period of time without a turn. I rarely play it for that reason.

I have the print and play free version and it has given us a lot of pleasure for the price of printing out a few bits of card. As the game goes on the tension mounts up. It is arguable that at the start of the game it is a pointless exercise as you will not manage to kill the Dr but the collection of spite tokens is important to increasing your chances of winning in the end game. I would certainly consider getting the 'real' version but I do have an affection for my printed copy.

This game can be a lot of fun--or it can be a total drag.  Sometimes it just won't end! The enjoyment of the game really depends on the group, and on the number of people playing.  If there are too many players, the game seems to last forever.  If there are too few, the game is over before you even know it.  Five players is a great number to have, or four and Lucky if you don't have that many friends.

(Sleeved)

Best described as clue but in reverse.  This is a great card based gateway game.  Play style is light and fun.  My only suggestion is to try and get your players to invent some motive for trying to kill Dr. Lucky and to have everyone read aloud the flavor text.  If you play the game without these elements it can seem dry.

Fun to play a few times, but eventually games end up the same way (a big stack of spite tokens moving around until someone collects them all). It seems too easy to thwart others using the cards, so once they run out whoever ends up with the pile wins. Also prone to kingmaking, if one player is tired of the game.

Rating based on 1 5er game.  The players chase Dr. Lucky around a maze of rooms.  Hopefully he eventually lands on you so you can take an extra turn...skipping the other players.  Sometimes you can get skipped a lot of times and wait around awhile for your turn.  Eventually someone gets a chance to kill Dr Lucky.  They play a weapon which has a value and hope the other players don't have enough defense cards to match that value.  The best part about this game is the brinkmanship on who will play defense cards.  It's a once-around and there are some comments such as..."looks like I'm all out of defense cards, you better play yours"..."no, i'm all out, you should play yours".  Brought about some funny moments.  Good game for once in awhile, but wouldn't want to play it regularly.  Should play with fewer players too.

RATING: 3
This is the first board game I played with my girlfriend, Becky. Its surprising that she ever agreed to play them again, after this introduction. ;P

The game is fundamentally broken from a fun perspective in that it is designed to result in unequal spotlight time between players. The rule that allows player to take multiple turns in a row, not only causes that player to be more likely to win (by getting more cards), but also results in them taking more turns then any other player who is involved in the game, making it more boring for those involved. 

On top of that, I just do not enjoy the game. The fun in playing it is pretty elusive to me (beyond thematic reasons, of course), and I ultimately traded it away. I am pretty sure I am going to refuse to ever play it again.

Thematically, it's a reverse Clue with a good dose of comedy.   Basically you just need to intercept the black pawn (Dr. Lucky) while out of sight from other pawns.  Eventually it happens, and someone wins.   Funny for a little while, but nothing anybody would want to play very often.

Simple and cheap, I can't help but feel this game simply involves moving around the board until everyone runs out of "Failure" cards.  If you happen to be alone with the good Dr. at that time, you win.  More luck than strategy.

RATING: 7

The laughs you get out of this game may be worth the play, but the game dynamics are pretty dull.

Played with 5 and 4 players, the game is mostly what I thought it was, random, and luck filled. It was quick enough not to bother me too much.

Themain skill seems to be in convincing other people to through out their block cards rather than have to use your own, which I don't find to be very fun.  Other than that it is largely just if you happen to be the person who made the attempt when the block cards run out.  Too much time and effort for too little fun.

It's like the prequel to Clue! The premise and thematic elements to this game are fantastic and funny. Gameplay however can be somewhat dull at times, since there is very little you can do most turns besides move and fill your hand with cards.

Love the board and the theme, kind of like Clue in reverse; but in my opinion perhaps a bit too much luck is involved whereas even if you may have an excellent plan waiting to be hatched someone could always manage to sneak in there and steal the prize kill away from your grasps ..so that can be quite disappointing, very much fun otherwise!! And again, a game designed with multiple players in mind, no way to play with just 2

Irreverently themed and lightly ruled, this Clue send-up requires more tactical than strategic processing. I recommend 3-5 players.

Playing with 6 people was not an optimal number. Too many characters on the board prolongs the game to the point where chance (and holding onto the right move card) snares you the win condition.

It's definitely a "non-gamer" game: just tell them it's the opposite of Clue and you're good to go.  We have a house rule that you have to read the Failure cards out loud. It's also pretty long, so don't start late in the day.

Hopelessly random take-that game that lasts entirely too long as it'll take EVERYONE emptying their hands before someone can win. It's not really broken, but it's very, very dull and requires virtually no thought to play. There is little satisfaction around the table when the good Doctor finally runs out of luck and bites the dust. I'd dock it a point for being a Cheapass game (in terms of components), but it's already rated too low. If this is the best that Cheapass has to offer, I see no need to try any of their other offerings.

A nice little game.  With the right crowd of people that kind of get into it, it can be cause for laughter.  AND you have to get over the fact that sometimes you'll get skipped.  I think I didn't play for about 12 minutes at one point!  But when you help thwart a killing of Dr. Lucky, you get drawn back into the action.  Dramatic readings of the flavor text make it extra fun!

[Old comment: Haven't played it yet... But I did make bits!  Looks pretty straightforward.  And, if it's anything like other Cheapass Games, it'll be goofy and fun.]

It was fun the first time we all played it. But then it got obnoxious when somebody stopped playing failure cards. But at that point I hadn't really appreciated that bluffing was a huge part of this game, so in retrospect, I wasn't in the right state of mind. I'd like to try it again knowing full well I need to bluff and lie about having any failure cards to pressure other people to use of theirs.

Ok, I admit it. I like this random but solid and clean card drafting, hand management game.  In this reverse of Clue, you ARE trying to kill Mr.Bodd- er Dr. Lucky.  While he wonders about the house each turn.  And the other players are trying to be the one to kill him.  Clever line of sight rules prevent easy kills in the presence of others. And the other players provide the "Luck" for Doctor lucky to avoid your attacks.  Funny sayings and a nice mechanic for stopping damage round this worthy game.

A three year wait to play a game that is nearly 20 yrs old, and it turns out to be much more enjoyable that I expect.  Sure, its a take on Cluedo, but its more that a parody, rather a nice twist with an interesting mechanism.  I can see how with many plays you could get into arguments about not playing fail cards, but the game works, the theme (and reading aloud of the fail cards) is amusing, and the dog variations also give a nice added wrinkle to the game.  Keeper, and a nice link for those who only know the traditional board games (Rating 7.342, July 2015).

Kill Doctor Lucky tends to really drag with more than 4 players. With many players it is very difficult to be in a room with Doctor Lucky, not be seen by any other player, and have enough power to overcome the fail cards your opponents have been hoarding. The mechanics become almost tedious when the game lasts longer than an hour due to these difficulties.

This game has a very fun theme and sense of humor.  However, we have a number of conservative players who often run sequences of card-drawing turns but never use them, making the game drag on for hours and create considerable downtime for players who were skipped over.  We always played with the variants where you could attack other players and spite tokens to speed up the game to mitigate this, but never entirely solved the problem.

The gametime varies greatly from 10 minutes to 2 hours (if it takes more than an hour it has definitely overstayed its welcome), depending on luck of the draw and how well you block each other.
It's a good game with enthusiastic players and involved storytelling, but it can definitely overstay its welcome and drag on far too long.
I'm going to try more of the variant rules (spite tokens, doctor lucky's dog, killing other players etc.) in order to breathe life into this game again.

This is certainly a fun game as players jockey for position on the board and attempt to lure the hapless Doctor Lucky into their clutches. It may become more fun as players get a feel for how the game works. The luck of the draw can be hilarious at times. I managed to kill Doctor Lucky without a weapon in the second game we played because nobody had any failure cards. The intriguing part about the strategy of the game is trying to position your token on the board in the right place to give yourself the best advantage at bumping off the old geezer. 

The only aspect I wonder about is the replay value. My guess is that the peak fun value comes in the third or fourth game once players have a sense of the tactics involved. After that, I suspect it will become a bit repetitive and one-dimensional. We make it more fun by dramatizing our murder attempts and failures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a decent family game.  My nieces and nephews enjoy playing and the mechanics are simple enough that even non-gamers enjoy it.  But after several plays you learn that there really isn't that much depth in the game at all.  You just chase the doctor around and hope you time your moves so that it all lines up and no one is watching, and if you're lucky you have the right cards in your hand.  But it's really a crap shoot until the very end and then, once the failure cards are gone, it's a gamble for the spite tokens.  Whoever manages to grab the spite tokens and pull off an attack wins.  

The theme and artwork is well done, and the version of the game I have has quality components (painted wooden pawns and wooden spite tokens).  My brother bought a copy for his kids and it has cardboard people on plastic stands instead of the wooden pawns in mine.  They were really disappointed in their version of the game and wanted to return it.

In general this game isn't deep enough for my tastes, but we keep it around because the kids have fun with it.  Adding "And His Little Dog Too!" makes it a little more tricky to time things just right, and I think it's a worthwhile addition to the game.

[FEB 09] [Rating: 4]
I would say there are two main points of strategy in the game. The first is a press your luck element, where you try to not play your failure cards, but still not giving things away. The second thing is to plan out how you can move Doctor Lucky or you to a spot and be concealed to try to assassinate. In the first strategy point you have to wager if there is enough failure cards left or if you play some to look like you don’t have many left. The second strategy point is harder to estimate as plans change and there are some serious concerns with AP in this light game.

I wouldn’t say that it is that random of a game, but it is very chaotic. The main problem is that it should be a quick game, but it isn’t. Things become rather tiresome because there is a long game before the end game and the end game often end anticlimactic.

I’ve found the game play best with 4 or 5 players as with more players the game drag. One word of note, I’ve played the Cheapass version and without spite tokens. If I play it again, I will probably play with spite tokens.

Game flow:

Player A makes a murder attempt.

If nobody blocks it, player A will win. But blocking it uses up the resources I need to win myself. So I would rather someone else did it.

Therefore, the best way to win is to convince you that I hate playing the game and don't care if I lose as long as it ends. Luckily, this is true.

Killing Dr. Lucky with an ill-fitting hat was funny that one time, though.

Quite fun for what it is.

Finally manoeuvring Dr L. into a specific room unseen for a mega weapon-bonus is very rewarding too.

Game can drag on too long though, especially if people don't make many murder attempts (because the failure cards build up and up and up), and *especially* if people don't get in the spirit of the game.

Formerly released by Cheapass Games, Kill Doctor Lucky uses a setting familiar to anyone who has ever played the classic game of Clue.  A party has assembled at Dr. Lucky’s mansion.  Unlike Clue, however, there is no body … yet.  Here, the setting is a step earlier, as players are all attempting to kill the good doctor.  Players will move to different rooms in the mansion, hoping to corner the doctor and commit the dastardly deed.  Murder attempts are conducted via card play, and usually utilize a variety of strange weapons, including duck decoys, shoehorns, and even a tight hat.  Most attempts, however, are doomed to fail, as all players have the opportunity to play "failure" cards in order to thwart the attempt.

There is no denying that the game is fun at first, and the quirky text on the failure cards is quite humorous.  However, the ultimate goal of killing the doctor takes a bit too long, and the "pass the buck" aspect when attempting to foil a murder attempt is fragile.  In spite of its flaws, Kill Doctor Lucky is still a fun, albeit morbid, ride.

what happens before clue? kill doctor lucky. a frustrating game where you chase the DR. around until someone makes a mistake and you kill him. Fun for a few turns before a more serious game but yes it can drag on, you might need to house rule that DR. lucky dies from exhaustion running round his house.

The structure and development of the game is horrible if not non-existent. There is no proper state in the game, you just exhaust the failure cards and someone wins.

A fun game for its theme with fairly simple mechanics.  The original bits are pretty cheap, but so was the price.  I found the complexity to be low enough for Jr. High students to enjoy the game.  You can slightly exceed the maximum players but you tend to end up with even longer games.  I found the game length to be about an hour or so, but every so often a game would drag out longer, making me wish it progressed a bit faster.  Sometimes players get in a rut of just collecting as many cards as possible as fast as they can which can definately delay the ending.

RATING: 6
Quite a bit of chance in this one, and not very nice components (though I guess that's Cheapass' way of doing things). You are often forced to move in ways you don't want to, or cannot move in ways you do. However, the failure cards are quite funny, and the mechanic of leaving the failure responsibility to the last player is a fun psychological exercise. Moderately entertaining, but not really something I would suggest.

If you're looking for a family game, this one is perfect. The gameplay is light enough that active can get it after the first couple of turns (rules explanation always seems to baffle them though), and the repeatability is amazing. Players can form their own methods and strategies but still have a great time if things fall through since everything is so light hearted and the cards have small jokes. The game can get lengthy when playing with 5 or more people though.

This is a fun game. It's basically "What if Clue was a good game." It does have some downsides. The biggest being you tend to want to do something other than what you can do. In spite of that it's worth playing, and amusing.

RATING: 6
Fun simple yet addictive game. Fun for families or adults. House rule is that you have to read the flavor text of the Failure cards. We've made up several fun cards ourselves. Games can be too long though, with all the Failure cards in the deck.

A not-bad family or stupid-gamer-friends party game, as long as everyone plays fast and loose.  The minute anyone takes it seriously, strangle them with a duck decoy.

NOTE:  After several plays we've decided that Spite Tokens are a must for every game—no, not every game of KDL—EVERY GAME.  Wood for sheep?  Suck a Spite Token, jerk sauce!

This was fun for a while, but dwindled quickly when the "Failure" cards were gone and the "Spite" tokens were flying around.  Too many sight lines, player turn order changing, and everybody expected everybody else to prevent the murder.  After an hour and a half, we were just glad to have somebody end it.

The gameplay is a bit more complex than it seems at first. Midgame tactics are interesting.

However the endgame seems to degenerate into waiting for other people to run out of cards and winning the game is often up to luck. Suprise victories early in the game are possible and not fun.

Even though the board and cards look (and are) cheap they have a nice retro feel. The pawns that you use (not included in the package) should convey that same retro feel in order to keep the roleplayish spirit up. Gaming requires some funny roleplaying since taking the game as pure tactics is not a  good idea.

The Cheapass version of this game is actually kinda neat.  The theme of the game is just great, but (unless the game ends on a fluke situation early) the game can feel like its dragging on a bit until the failure cards become scarce.

SOLD Sort of like reverse Clue. Try to kill Doctor lucky by getting alone with him in a room with a good murder weapon while everyone else trying to stop you so they can be the one to take out the Doctor. Light game, a bit repetitive.
(the game board is stiff and folds from one into four sections, two sections split off so now the board fits flat and looks modular like many games are, the split is unnoticeable, otherwise the game was only played once and looks new)

Decent end of session game. Too many players can mean the game takes far too long (and can involve lots of downtime for anyone unfortunate enough to have their turn repeatedly skipped). Good fun, and my group agrees that this is the best of the series, overall.
The speed-up variant rule, whereby each attempt earns the player a token which can be spent (and discarded) as an extra failure, or used (and not discarded) as a +1 attack, phenominally improves the game, as it prevents the group just collecting loads of cards until the deck has run out and only then having a shot at the old fool.

I think you must play with at least 4 to 6, nice that it goes higher in case you need it but there will be too much downtime with big numbers as you wait and wait while others make their moves.  Some room for a little clever card play, you need to set yourself up to grab multiple cards by following him around.  A social game, light, fun, mostly luck but that’s okay, it's a neat game of tactical movement and hand management but most decisions are quite obvious. Unlike most other games of this nature as when someone tries to murder someone else, the other players have to cooperate against the murderer by playing enough combined cards to stop him, a bit of push your luck here as you might elect to let others waste their cards instead of you having to use yours, this could cost you the game however.  A little like a weird version of clue....

I can't say there's anything wrong with this game; I just didn't enjoy it very much. It's sort of a prequel to Clue, and the theme is fun, but it very much plays like an older game.

This is certainly strange. The messages on the failure cards are great and the board of the Titanic edition is pretty (although the cards are ugly), but it just doesn't seem to work very well as a game. You're trying to set up "long turns" where you draw cards in succession, adding to your hand. However, using those cards on early murder attempts is just going to drain a communal reserve of countermeasures - it doesn't really matter if you're the one going for the kill. You actually just want to dick around, amass cards and get lucky after the failure cards run out. Then of course there's the inevitable kingmaking refusal to use failure cards, leaving it to the last player who doesn't have any or won't use them out of spite.

Well, OK. It CAN be fun, but I've had more than one game turn into stasis toward the end. Less like Clue than a game of careful movement calculation a la Chateau Roquefort (which otherwise couldn't be more different.)

This is a party game with high strategy content.  It's a good choice if you are trying to sucker a beginner into playing "real" games - just tell them it's "reverse Clue" and watch as they fall in love with strategizing.

Anyways, I always have fun with it, thematically and mechanic-ly.  Some people refuse to play it because they hate how Lucky can move and skip a bunch of players' turns.  Personally, I think that aspect is one of the things that makes it so interesting and unique.  But beware, if you hate having your turn skipped you'll get frustrated really fast.

ブラックジョークのゲームで、その「テーマ」はチーパスらしくて気に入っている。しかし、カードのひき次第なところがあり、その数少ないチャンスを何とか生かさないとゲームに勝てないように感じるので点数辛目。（そこがこのゲームの良さでもあるような・・・）正直、デラックス版よりも白黒の盤の方が理系の感性にあっている。犬のヴァリアントも試してみたが、（全員の邪魔になる）犬を殺すことに反対する人はいるのだろうか？あまり犬は有効なヴァリアントのように思えなかった。

I've only played the old paper Cheapass Games version.  It tended to drag out too long.  However, the new rules with spite tokens might really improve the game, and I want to try it that way sometime soon.

RATING: 4
I like the movement system a lot and "Cluedo but you kill the guy" is a good pitch to new gamers, but the game's just a series of clever setups that may or may not be foiled by whatever cards people decide to play. The big-box version speeds that up with spite tokens, but endgame is still usually just a disappointing "X thinks Y has failure cards but Y doesn't so Z wins".

RATING: 5
Expansions, sequels, deluxe editions -- c'mon folks, the joke is over! Seriously, this is a mildly entertaining game sometimes, which too often just goes on and on beyond the fun. And in the end, it's mostly luck a question of who's lucky enough to make an attempt no one else can prevent.

Fun, humorous game. Simple "anti-Clue" game, where the goal is to get the old coot alone in a room and knock him off.  One warning - don't play this with too many people. While it can handle 7 players, I probably wouldn't play it with more than 5.

Could this game be *any* more boring?  Thankfully, the Failure cards are removed from the deck as they are played, so *eventually* someone will kill Dr. Lucky.  The game might be more intersting with fewer people or a lot fewer Failure cards in the deck.  Don't ask me to play this one again!

This game is a hit or miss with me.  Sometimes I have a blast and other times it just drags.  I think the biggest problem I have is that I will go 4-6 rounds and never get a turn because it hops over to the person Dr. Lucky is standing on.
The new tokens can really speed up play also they can slow it to a halt too.

The funny theme and cards are good for a laugh or two, but that's about it. Wouldn't play this with with higher player numbers - length of each players turns vary greatly plus there isn't all that much to do between your turns, so situations where you make a 1 second move and then wait and wait and wait for your next turn are common.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Ok, I get it - it isn't Clue. Sad to say, Clue may be more fun. Art and the tranny French Maid are the best part. Too much random (cards) and weird board movement mechanics. Skipping turns is not fun. Too much waiting for your turn with 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easy to learn and play; generally enjoyable but game experience can be overlong or frustrating if certain players don't "muck in for the team" and cough up failure cards. Eight piece board MUST be taped together - drives obsessive-compulsive neat freaks crazy otherwise. At the end of the game, everyone understands why they must kill that rotten lucky SOB. Strategies are fairly straightforward, better with multiple players to make unobserved  killings with bad cream or shoe horns less possible.

This is another great game that lets you play with a larger group. Although, it is much harder to win with larger numbers (or at least it takes longer). My friends and I have adopted a variant where spite tokens cannot be given away as a failure card, so the game goes REALLY fast. About 10min on average. It's another great game to sandwich in between some larger ones.

Popular game from Cheapass Games, which specializes in quick games with very cheap components. Players are expected to supply the usual gaming stuff - dice, markers, etc; Cheapass Games supplies the rest with a large dollop of humor. In this notorious game, players move around the mansion trying to murder Dr. Lucky without being seen. An inversion of Clue. The key to the game is that you have to be in the same room as Doctor Lucky and no one else can see you.

The inversion of Clue, this game can be very long and drawn out with more than 4-5 players, especially if someone chains his/her turns by following Dr. Lucky.  The newer edition makes it a bit faster with the spite counts but still not one of my favorites. Fun cards but gets old quickly.

Great mystery game -- except you are the killer, and you're just a mystery waiting to happen.  Dr. Lucky moves at high speeds, and the best way to play this game is as a fun timekiller with a bunch of friends.  Also makes a great game to take out to a restaurant/coffee shop/etc, both because it's so generic in appearance yet keeps you laughing.  Quite a good play.  Appropriate for younger audiences (as long as you aren't screaming "killkillkilldiediedie" every few seconds). :)

The premise is good ("Why are there so many plausible suspects roaming around Mr. Boddy's mansion at the start of Clue? Because they [i]all[/i] had it in for the old man!") but the gameplay breaks down. Hoping you can move to just the right spot to attempt to kill Doctor Lucky brings in one of the worst parts of Clue, and victory often hinges on whether or not players pass the buck on stopping a murder attempt to the last person in turn order (who will, eventually, not have enough resources to stop things alone).

This is reverse Clue.  Players are trying to move around to gather weapons and isolate Dr. Lucky to kill him.  Players are trying to stop other players from winning making so that he can live another day and give them a chance to win.  The player who kills Dr Lucky wins.

The macabre theme does not bother me, the art is "cartoonish" and so should not be taken seriously.  The game play is fun, but becomes repetitive fast.  The game can really outstay its welcome.  

The game is fun at first but becomes boring.

Like clue but with such a great twisted approach.  Fast game play and a lot of fun.  The rules need a twist for 5 or 6 players (we have a house rule where we start players in different rooms selected by drawing room cards for each player.  Avoids players getting skipped at the beginning over and over).  This is one of our favoriate games and everyone who plays it with us likes it, even my parents.

Read Rules. Looks fairly simple. You can make a kill attempt as long as you are not in sight of others. If you can then you have 1 kill power you can play a card to increase that. Then the other players can play foil cards - if the numbers of these are >= to the number you had then the attempt is foiled. the 'foil' cards are discarded so eventually the deck will have very few in. Deck is quite large though. Different and interesting idea will see how it plays out.

So it played out well, winner managed to win quite quickly I think because others were too busy thinking about what they were doing instead of preventing an attack. Then when used a 4 damage attack they could or defend it.  That might be an issue with just 3 players but with more maybe the crowded board makes getting an attack an issue? More plays needed!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.4
The Failure cards are great fun to read aloud, though there are only a couple that will remain funny long term. Not particularly suspenseful until the deck is depleted of failure cards. It's an ok game, good for some laughs but it can overextend itself a little sometimes.

Played twice with 2 and a couple of times with 3+

Ken:
Works with 2 via variant; better with 2 if using variant and Dr. Lucky's dog; best with 4+.  Logic puzzle that is somewhat dependent on luck of the draw.  Thematic, with an appealing art style.  Silly, lightweight party game slightly reminiscent of Munchkin's "screw the leader" gameplay.

Not particularly interested in playing again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Clue turned upside down. Now you are not trying to find out in which room someone was murdered with which weapon. No, now you try to be the murderer, and you are going to pick the weapon that will do the job best.

Although this is a stupidly simple game, it feels realistic and everybody constantly keeps an eye on the board to anticipate. Not only do you try to kill Doctor Lucky, you also try to prevent someone else doing it, before you.

Minus: 1 - 3 (replay ability) - 4 - 5 - 10

I love the "reverse Clue" premise and the silly murder weapons (Tight Hat FTW!), but nearly every game turns out the same way. Because the last person to have the opportunity to block an attack MUST play cards if they can, there are a few turns where everyone passes to screw that person, and then someone makes a bad call and no one can stop the killing blow.

I realize that's how it's supposed to work, but every single game follows essentially the same arc, and that's boring as hell. The redone Paizo edition has a great board and much nicer cards than the original Cheapass edition, but they both have the same fatal flaw.

2 / 5 - Fair.

On first inspection this looks to have potential - the theme is vaguely amusing and there's some strategy here in spotting and playing clever card combinations to move yourself and the good doctor round where you want. The trouble is that as a game with a very obvious "stop the winner" mechanic which rewards trying to let other people do all the murdering it can be a fun thirty minute game or it can drag horribly. Once everyone has grasped this, determining the winner can become semi-random based on who gets the murder turn when no-one has cards left to stop it.

Silly fun at first, but sometimes the game REALLY drags.  Luck of the draw is especially bad in this game because once you get a good, useable card you can "ride the Lucky train" and pick up a few more while everyone else sits there doing nothing.

I own the 2002 Director's Cut Edition.  I really like this game.  The turn order rule, where it becomes your turn if Dr. Lucky enters your room, is what make this game.  The board layout is also really good.

I recently played with 7 players on the larger board. Downtime for certain players was a problem sometimes, but I still enjoyed it a lot.

In order for this game to be fun, players need to pay attention and play quickly.  The strategy isn't that deep, so turns should take under 30 seconds.

I bought this game along with Formula De based on some of the reviews read on this site.  Both were flops with my group.  The feedback from certain players was scathing.  Admittedly, the game took forever to end, and while that might be part of the fun for some, it made certain players resentful, sulky, and restless.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun little game with some strategy. This is actually a good game to introduce non-gamers to a board game since it is based less on luck and more on strategy, including some poker type bluffing elements.  Very good value since you can get it for between $5-8.

RATING: 5
fun for awhile but lasts a bit too long for what it is.

game play is players start in room 0, doctor lucky is randomly placed in another room.  Players try to enter the room with the doctor and not in sight line of any other player.  At this point a kill attempt is made by playing various cards to get an attack value.  Each other player in turn can play defend cards to thwart the attack.  If after the last player puts down cards the attack is greater than all the defend cards, the attack succeeds and that player wins.  If not, play continues.  Any defense cards used are NOT shuffled back into the draw pile so that eventually an attack must succeed.  Doctor moves by automatic rules (going to next higher room number, cycling back to 0), or can be moved by card play.

I find the first good number of turns is simply moving around and trying to collect good cards.  Then trying to get into a good attack position.  Its not over complex, but can take awhile for a fairly simple game.  With more than 4 players the game seems to drag on forever.

The related game - Save Doctor Lucky - is perhaps better as the number of rooms shrinks as play progresses, making the game take much less time.

Good fun party game. Can work hilariously with the right people. Using various ridiculous miniatures for players adds some smiles as well. 
First couple of rounds can be a bit boring if you don't use the spite tokens variant. And although it makes the game longer, I like the dog variant as well.

UPDATE: got the luxury version as well! Thanks Erik!

NL: Jij en je medespelers zijn te gast bij Dr. Lucky. Maar jullie haten 'm zo hartstochtelijk dat je 'm wilt vermoorden. Maar dat wil je natuurlijk perse zelf doen. En het kan alleen als niemand anders je ziet. Maar die Dr. Lucky loopt zo vlot door de kamers heen dat het best lastig is.

Leukste spel uit de Cheapass reeks: het spel is spotgoedkoop gemaakt en ziet er eigenlijk niet uit. Maar ik vind 'm wel leuk. Bord heeft 2 kanten (voor verschillende aantallen spelers)

At its core, this is the "win against the table" mechanic, only unlike many other games built around this mechanic, there's almost nothing else.  As such, it bores me.

I understand there are some extremely strong feelings about this game, both in the positive and the negative.  Myself, I'm sort of ambivalent about the whole thing.  Getting back into gaming I'd had this famous title recommended to me by a friend.  I've played it once, a fun experience in general,  and I keep bringing it along to game events with friends but, truthfully, I've discovered so many more games that I'd rather play at this point, it just never gets picked for play.  If it were to disappear tomorrow I'm not sure I'd even notice, and I suppose that pretty much summarizes my feelings on the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The cards are a lot of fun and the concept is promising, but the game fails in execution.  Both of the times I played, it was an exercise in frustration, as momentum would start to swing wildly as the spite tokens piled up.  I never felt much of a feel of strategy, and the swings in play also removed most sense of control over the outcome... except when I reached the end of my rope and simply refused to stop someone else from killing the bastard.  (As the last comment implies, I've found the game to suffer very badly from kingmaking, as frequently the outcome of the game will depend on the decision of someone who has no personal stake.)

I am starting to get bored with this game, but then again, I have played at least a dozen times before I started logging plays.

After a long, long time of not playing this, I played a game with a group at Board Game Day in St. Charles.  Ugh, it was awful (and it wasn't the fault of those I was playing with, who were as fun a group as could be asked for).  Because of the way the turn mechanic works, you can sit for a long time with absolutely nothing to do.  Playing with the spite tokens, it's easy to get into an endless loop where nobody can win.  Hooray.  The game ended, mercifully, because someone just got sick of playing and refused to play any failure cards on an 8-point murder attempt.  Thank goodness.  If it had gone on another turn, Dr. Lucky would have won because I probably would've killed myself.

A cute little game with a satisfyingly black humoured theme that kind of sits as an 'anti-Cluedo'.

Game play feels like you are wasting time throwing cards at the Doc until you finally get lucky and play a card nobody else can counter.

There may be a game where brinksmanship of the "I want to be the person to fire their large gun just after everyone's expended all of their defenses on somebody else's large gun" variety is an interesting game mechanic, but I don't believe this is it.

I've only played the old Cheapass version, though.

A subversion of Clue--instead of trying to solve the murder, you're trying to commit it!  A game for opportunists with a wicked sense of humor.

Although being lucky enough to draw particular cards will be very helpful, this can be mitigated by investing your turns to collect more cards.  You're more often thwarted by other players, directly or indirectly, than by chance itself.  There's still an element of hidden information and bluffing as you have to deal with the amount of failure cards your opponents may have.

The theme and clever reverse clue ness saved it a bit but it takes too long with its back and forth, and I'm still not crazy of the munchkin mechanic of "gang up on the one about to win" - it devolves into a tug of war of timing and more chance.

Another group favorite of ours to play, this Cheapass game is a bit more time consuming than some of Cheapasses faster playing games, but well worth it.  Our group finds it fun to play using Call of Cthulhu miniatures as our characters and Dr. Lucky.  I have yet to pick up any of the newer versions of this game but fully intend to at some point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun at first but becomes a tedious chore after the first 1/2 hour of play - especially infuriating if you keep getting your turn skipped, which can happen over and over again. In the end, it comes down to being in the right place at the right time with the right cards - strategy is limted to sitting in one place, following Dr. Lucky for a few rooms to gain cards, and hoping you have a weapon and the others have run out of failure cards.

Meh.  My kids like it.  It's pretty random.  The cards are really funny, though.  They always make me chuckle once or twice.  Otherwise, pretty blah.

Fun game - visible strategy, but I'm guessing once everyone figures it out, there's not much more depth. Still a fun fast filler, I want to play it more.

September 14th, 2008:
Lowered from 7 to 6. The rules aren't written that well, and the strategy is limited.

April 16th, 2010:
Lowered from 6 to 5. I'd play it if people went faster, but the game isn't good if it takes too long.

RATING: 8
I had a lot of fun on my first play of the game.  I have the new 19.5th anniversary edition which comes with Kill Doctor Lucky and then Escape From Doctor Lucky.   The main game is sort of like reverse-Clue which was a lot of fun.  Then when that game is over you can optionally play the Escape game which leaves all the meeples where they ended during the main game.  Once you start Escape it feels like another haunt from Betrayal at the House on the Hill (which is one of my group's favorite games).  Both game types were a lot of fun and I would definitely play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although not terribly deep, Kill Dr. Lucky has proven to be an amusing addition to our gaming group.
Of particular note: The turn order flip-flop, although sometimes annoying, does add to the game.  It forces one to pull themselves out of complacency and pay attention to where the good doctor will be going next - and although you may be passed over for a few turns, we have never seen someone cut out of the action for unreasonable periods of time.
Also - bleeding the other players for Failure cards is a dangerous business.  If you don't pay attention to how many cards they have already used up you may find your fellow players unable (or unwilling) to foil a murder attempt.
Not recommended for groups who cannot handle light and/or frivolous games.

Not sure about this one. It seems that it's sort of press-your-luck almost. Best to try and kill Lucky as often as possible to build up spite tokens. Also, since there is no hand limit, following lucky around the house to fill up on cards is almost a necessity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I loved the original Cheapass version and the higher production values make this one all the more better.  I also like the addition of the spite tokens.  This is another game that almost anyone should enjoy, even kids.  Although with kids you may want to change the name to Tickle Doctor Lucky or something less, you know, death-y.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Hilarious if played with the right people -the plot, the board and especially the weapons to kill Doctor Lucky are a complete treat. With bloodthirsty players not afraid to have a go at him with bare hands you can enjoy two hours of nearly continuous loud laughing. Unfortunately, if it is not the case the game can turn to a bunch of players drifting around to load up for later, without much movement... sometimes it takes ages to build up (and therefore to finish). 

Upon repeated plays there can be some planning in advance (only a relative benefit, since getting the right cards is still pretty much luck), but the surprise factor of the weapons wears off.

Save Doctor Lucky isn't as much vicious fun, but it does debug this in a decent way.

A funny idea, but with considerable weaknesses in practice. I've played this only once (6 players), but it was obvious that it may bring too much downtime for a game of hilarity (5 minutes in average, I guess). The cause is a mechanism that allows extra turns under certain conditions. 

However, the major flaw is that there is absolutely no reason to start assassination attempts (other than bringing the game forward), because it's clear that there will be enough failure cards in the game. I think you'll usually prevail if you safe your assasinations until everyone else has no cards left to cause failure. This qualifies as a game breaker, and makes the game last too long.

This game is a gateway drug.  Enfanta bought a copy at More Than Games way back in the mists of time, and we played it dozens of times that day and the next.  Soon, we were both addicted to board games and I had to get my own copy of this one (which I also bought at More Than Games.)

Kill Doctor Lucky is pretty much the inverse of Clue.  Instead of figuring out who committed the murder, you are attempting to commit the murder yourself.  Don't worry, sanctimonious Doctor Lucky deserves to die.  The trouble is, it's rather difficult to get him alone in a room with you, out of everyone else's line of sight, which means the game tends to drag on for too long.  I have the Cheapass edition, and must say I heartily approve of their philosophy (as well as their humor).  Games are very expensive these days, which is part of the reason that I don't own a lot of them.  Cheapass Games keep prices down by providing only the bare essentials, leaving you to come up with dice, pawns, and such yourself.  Graphics are black and white, no color.  My only complaint is that the tiles that are arranged to create the board for this game are thin and don't want to stay together. I've discovered they can be anchored with post-it notes on the back, however.  Kill Doctor Lucky is good, clean, silly, murderous fun.  (3+2)

Cheapass Director's Cut version. A fun and total alternative to dragging out the ol' "Clue" game. Seems to be best with 4-5 so you have enough players to foil murder attempts and make the game last, but not so many players that it becomes difficult to gain an uncontested line of sight to pop off the old bugger. Taking the time to buy some interesting figures spices up these Cheapass offering. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
An old classic and a nice quick filler.
This isn't really a deduction game at all as I first thought.
You chase Doctor Lucky around his mansion and if you encounter him when no one else is looking, you can kill him.
Your opponents will try to stop you, so they can do the dirty deed.

This is a very quick...say 15 minute game. The new edition has some new streamlined rules, rules for 2 player games, and you can add in the cat or the dog to spice things up.

I quite like this game, in all its mean-spirited nature. After a half a dozen plays, I've found the big problem to be that there always seems to be a player that gets tired of the game before it's over, and begins to play recklessly in an effort to end the game early. I believe this is because of the seeminlgly arbitrary nature of the turn order (downtime sometimes lasts longer for some players, and a player expecting to go next might have that right jerked away from them at the last minute). People sometimes also develop an undue attachment to their spite tokens, holding on to them so tightly that when it comes time to bid on an attempt's defeat, they'd rather have a stack of tokens and lose on their own terms than be forced, by strategic bidding by other players, to give them up. If and when you can overcome these minor problems and find a group of people that have the patience and capacity to understand the unique nature of the rules and turn order, then this is an excellent, exceedingly well-rendered game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The latest version looks great. The game itself is open to variable length of play and I suspect most games go through the deck before a murder happens.

The sort of game that needs to be played with good humour and be in the moment and the large number of players and ease of game play is a plus

Beautiful components.  I love the big heavy pawns, and the pretty board.  It's like reverse clue.  The reason I didn't rate it higher is because of two flaws.  One is that when you play with lots of people, you NEVER get a turn because someone before you is always swiping Dr. Lucky.  Then he moves to someone ahead of you and so on, and this creates lots of down time.  Also, there are so many red spite tokens floating around that nobody can ever kill him unless people are being stingy with their tokens.  This is usually the case, and everyone gets pissed at that person who gives away the game.  It should perhaps just be limited to the failure cards.  Anyways, I do like this game, but it can be frustrating.

This is ok.  Mechanically I think there is some very interesting stuff here, but ultimitly it has some flaws   It can get frustrating and drag on in large groups, so go small.  It can also be ruined by someone with an "I'm taking my ball and going home" attitude.  That is to say, some one last in line refusing to be forced to spend their spite tokens so they let the murder happen.  Some people try to spin that as a positive feature, don't belive it, it is petty garbage.

This is a funny game. It's fun to read the card text and imagine the ridiculous ways that Dr. Lucky escapes death. The gameplay, however, is not very good. The variable turn order in this game can be frustrating, and it is difficult to impossible to plan anything out ahead of time. There are some minor strategies, but mostly it's just reacting to unpredictable events and hoping that you'll be in position to make a useful move when you get a turn.

A game where you want to plan out where you and Dr. Lucky are, as well as manage your hand so when you strike no one can stop you.

A cute (if you could call it that) parody of clue and other deduction games. Where you maneuver Dr. Lucky into a room with just you and him to off the old codger. 
Given the changing turn order, I can see how sometimes it can be tiresome as your turn gets yanked away from you. 
Eventually as the failure cards get burned somebody will get into a winning position. I feel the early and mid game is the most interesting, but it tails off from there.

Game drags until the end when there is tension as to who can actually pull off the murder after most of the failure cards have been played to halt previous attempts. Best with 3-4, because of the turn skipping mechanic makes 5-6 a problem.

And some things seem forced.  The game is has a lighter weight theme that doesn't take itself too seriously and it does generate some social interaction. The game itself has a sense of humor.

There's not much game to this game.  Your object is to kill a wandering npc without another player stopping you.  The dominant strategy is just to always walk in front of the npc, which causes it to always be your turn, drawing as many cards as you can, then using your hand superiority to whittle away everyone else's hand until your victory is inevitable.

RATING: 6
Fun game for a change of pace - theme goes a long way. The gameplay is rather flawed, since the winner easily could be the one who's turn comes [b]after[/b] the guy who (just) got rid of everyone's failure cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game, seems like it could be called "PreClue". I like how the Doctor's path winds through the house, with plenty of "line of sight" opportunities. What I don't like is that due to the draw of cards, the game could either be over in two turns, or go on forever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Played twice, won both times because players who could have stopped me figured the next player would but they couldn't. Not a very satisfying way to win.  Also, I prefer games where you have lots of choices, but in this one (as in many other games) your choices are dictated to you by the few cards you have. It isn't a bad game, it's "some fun or challenge at least" and I'd play it again, but only if there wasn't some better game available.

It's pretty chaotic and there's potential for a lot of downtime as players chain turns, but there's something satisfying about forcing players to spend their hard earned spite tokens. It's a push your luck game at heart, and knowing when to shoot down a players evil schemes or cross your fingers and hope someone else has the cards to stop him can be tense and satisfying. Still trying to find the perfect number of players to play this with.

The original envelope edition was my gateway game, so I'm still quite fond of KDL. I added Clue figurines, the Mr Poe mover from The Perilous Parlor Game, the dog from Monolopy, and a few red glass beads from Pente for spite tokens, and my itch for bits has been scratched.

It's a fun game with non-gamers, but I'd never break it out for any serious gamer friends.

I own the Titanic edition, and the Cheapass Director's Cut. I quite like it, though it's not a serious gamers' game. 

The doorways and room names are a bit difficult to see in the Titanic edition. New players have a tough time understanding the sight lines because the walls, rooms and doorways are all roughly the same tonal value.

I like that you can deal someone in late and it doesn't break this game at all.  This attribute makes Kill Doctor Lucky perfect for a game group when two or three members arrive and are waiting for more members to arrive.

If anyone knows of other games that people can join after the game has been going a few rounds, please send me a geekmail. :-)

Update:  It doesn't work as I had hoped, because it goes on far too long for what it is.

Welcome to Doctor Lucky's mansion! This is where Dr Lucky lives. He likes to wander around in the house. You are a servant/guest, you want to kill the old geezer for some reason (just think of a reason: maybe you can therefore get his heritage, you want to take revenge for your friend, you hate his cat, or he is just being ugly). Your fellow players, though you may know, want to kill him, too! Alright that's an absurd setting but it's all about fun. This game is really interesting and hilarious.

A resonable very light game - all about drawing streaks of cards into your hand, and trying to play the right combination before your opponents. Board positioning is key, but fairly simple.

RATING: 6
A diamond in the rough, Cheap Ass scored highly with this game.  The tongue-in-cheek attitude makes it relaxing, but a decent light-weight strategy will win most of the time.  The game relies on a little bluffing, a fair amount of card combination, and most especially weighing patience over the need to strike (or lose).  The set of combinations make this game a high one on the replay list, especially if the group is 4 or more, up to 10 (more is better).

Own director's cut.

American-style boardgame: move you pawn around and set yourself up to kill the annoying Doctor Lucky. Once you're in the same room with the Doctor (and our of line of sight of other players), you can attack him.

The Doctor moves around the board in a set pattern. You have a hand of cards you use to move yourself or the doctor, or to deny other players or you might get a weapon to increase your kill rating. You can draw a card if you don't attack the Doctor on your turn.

Chaotic, silly and probably better as a 'cheap'ass version. The Paizo version has pretty graphics but the gameplay doesn't really justify the sticker price.

This is a clever and fun game, and certainly the best one ever published by Cheapass Games. However, the game can come to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end if the players are too ruthless or if one passive-aggressive player didn't really feel like playing. The first time I played was a very challenging eight-player game at GenCon. The dwindling supply of failure cards was a great way to keep that game moving towards the inevitable murderous conclusion.

The one time I did play this the rules were badly explained, so that may influence my opinion.

Having said that, the game as it's supposed to work seems like a glorified game of chicken.  Obviously you can use strategy to make more/stronger murder attempts than the others, but if that other guy decides he can't be bothered stopping someone's murder attempt, it's all for naught.

I'm not wildly crazy about this one.  I think there's more luck involved than anything else in this game.  That's not entirely a bad thing in all cases.  I like to feel like I've got some course of action in a game, though, even one that's luck based.  This one left me feeling like my turn was worthless much of the time.  At least it's light and quick.

Quite a good game of murderous intent where each player is trying to kill Dr Lucky while out of site of the other characters.  If you get the chance, the other players will then try to frustrate your murder of the good Doctor by playing amusing Failure cards to try to match your score.  You can increase your score by using weapons of different types.  Originally an innovative Cheapass Games creation, but Paizo and Titanic have brought out higher quality production versions.  

Can be quite fun for the right group of players, but it can sometimes drag on past its optimal playing time.  The addition of the Spite tokens mechanic (to the original game) has helped with this, but I dislike the option of using them to add to Failure attempts also.  For more than 4 or 5 people, the game can still drag on.  

I do like the dual mechanics of out-of-sight and beating other players' Failure attempts, but I must confess that I find many of the 'funny' Failure explanations a bit silly and lame.  Still can be a fun game, with the Spite tokens (for Murder attempts only) and with 3 or 4 players.

Early on I was confident that I'd win, and indeed I ended up winning after another 20 minutes or so. I like the idea of the game. The map is interesting and the cards are fun, but the opening moves feel scripted and the first player has a significant advantage. Strategy seems obvious, and the game goes on way too long.

My rating takes into account that this is indeed a cheapass game -- if I had spent $70 on this, with beautiful components and high production value, I likely would have rated it lower and been dissapointed.  Having said that, I got exactly what I expected -- a light, fun game, on the cheap, that I can get just about anybody to play at least a few times due in no small part to its rather novel kitsch value.

I wanted this game for a long time. When it was out of print I found a copy at my game store and grabbed it. I really enjoy it. The game mechanics are very different, which might turn off your non-gamer friends, but I managed to get a few interested.
It can drag on a bit too long, and can also end very quickly.

While the game is in no way my thing, I can see that it really isn't all random foolishness. There's a bit of tactical planning, even after taking into consideration not being able to count on how the Doctor moves due to other players' interference. The cards you have seem less crucial than the timing of when you play them. I'd never, however, pursue playing this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bit long for what it is, since the way to win is to be the lucky one who makes a murder attempt when someone crucial has run out of failure cards. Whether you can orchestrate that relies on both lucky timing and lucky draws.

It can be quite funny, though: "I try and kill Doctor Lucky in the dining room... with a [i]tight hat[/i]!"

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Granted we all were new players so some of the random feeling could just be because no one had any sort of strategy.  Really this game felt like it was about just hoping to be in the right place at the right time.  The early parts of the game seemed trival and then at some point everyone took their shot at the win, and hoped to get the timing for the kill just right.  I won through pure luck.  I would not mind trying this game again if someone else requested it, but certainly won't go out of my way to try and play it.

Suffers from three major flaws:

1.  Too long for what it is
2.  Luck of the cards too much
3.  By far most importantly, the element that allows everyone to screw the last player who has to play cards and the bad feelings and occasional early game endings that that engenders.

Up one point for the price.

ERGONOMICS: not impressed I think there are line of sight issues (In a board game?!) and got tired of looking at it after awhile.
STRATEGIES. Just have to follow the best path through a house that was modeled on the one used in Clue. I.e. not good. 
NARRATIVE. Sort of. The game winds down a pt where someone has to win.
DRAMA. a little.

A satirical prequel to clue involving committing the murder?  Quite tempting indeed.  I played the deluxe edition with only three players, it had a decent play time for being so light, it seems apparent that the game could be over in 10 minutes or 45.  The risk taking failure bidding is a fun element, but the Failure cards flavor text is where the game was stepped up a level.  It's extremely light for what it is but considerably better than clue (the movement system and line of sight for example really shine compared to its predecessor).  Solid theme, fun murder weapons, all round a pretty enjoyable game.  I like the off kilter turn order, which can be frustrating but serves to make the game abit more interesting.

This game didn't grab me much in the first place, but the final nail in its coffin was when some people in our group refused to use their bonus chips to prevent an attempt on the life of the good doctor, even when that meant handing the game to the would-be murderer. As far as I'm concerned, that's tantamount to walking away from the table in a strop when you're losing, and this has caused one of the most amusing heated arguments amongst our group in some time.  :)

Seven players makes the game initially far too slow-paced, because of the need to have no other player in line of sight to attempt the murder, and the initial lack of power up cards.  Maybe if we had dealt out some power up cards initially, to get the game going, it might have been more fun.  After 30-40 minutes, the whole table REALLY wanted to kill Dr. Lucky, just to get the game over with.

Didn't really care for [thing=257][/thing]. The production value is good and there is a fine amount of interaction between players, involving some quantities of cooperation, back-stabbing and bluffing.

I would play it if in the right mood, just not often.

I played this three times the other night with 4 of my friends. A very easy game to learn and pick up and a fun game to play. I like the bluffing element of the game. There is some strategy to the game as well, such as positioning your character at the right place to draw extra cards and using certain cards to move dr.lucky and cause him to skip a player's turn.

I wouldn't play this with less than four people and five or six would be ideal as it would make it harder to perform assassinations on people.

A fun and short game that I don't mind playing once or twice during game night.

The game is kind of fun, but the turn system makes some people have long periods of having no turn. Since the game is better with more people but more boring with more people, it's tough to strike a happy medium with this game. The flavor text, though, is great.

Very nicely themed "reverse Clue" which, unfortunately, is a boring and repetitive game of trying to force the other players to do your dirty work.

After a play or two, even the wonderful theming can't save this sorry excuse for a game.

Same complaint as everyone.....the final player has the burden of saving the game and that quickly gets extremely annoying. Plus, the chips are going around the table but if you miss your step and luck out early, it will be very tough to get back into the game because of the above mentioned weakness of the game.

The spite tokens do make the game flow faster. I cannot imagine the previous version of the game where no spite tokens were used. Yikes.

Avoid this game at all costs unless you want to have an exercise of frustration and futility.

Neat! Kind of like reverse Clue. Unlike what the majority of other geeks think, I believe the Spite tokens lengthen the game (after spending 3 hours on a late night game, I have cause to). While their lack adds a bit of capriciousness to the endgame, I feel the reduction in playtime is well worth it.

I've had this far longer than I've known about this site or all these other games, so it's kind of a classic for me. I've found it very accessible and enjoyable for non-gamers that don't want to learn a lot of rules or think too hard.

The new ExpensiveAss version is pretty swank. I'm curious how people would evaluate it had it never been a Cheapass game. 

Much fun.

I've played both versions, and the experience of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/4713]Titanic[/url] one is far better than the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/12]Cheapass[/url] version.  Not only are the components far and away better, but the spite tokens add interest without making anything any more difficult.  I like the idea of Cheapass games, I just don't like the execution.  I'd rather that a game was designed to need a minimum of components, as opposed to needing lots of components that you provide yourself.  Besides, this is an experience game in the first place, and why play an experience game if the components don't support the experience anyway?

Popular game from Cheapass, which specializes in quick games with very cheap components. Players are expected to supply the usual gaming stuff, dice, markers etc, Cheapass supplies the rest with a large dollop of humor. In this notorious game, players move around the mansion trying to murder Dr Lucky without being seen. An inversion of Clue. In the Cheapass game Save Doctor Lucky the goal is to prevent Dr. Lucky from drowning.

RATING: 6
This fun little game has a lot of things I like: simple rules, easy to set up, moderate play time and a fair amount of interaction. I think the morbid theme adds to the fun of the game, but not all of my friends share this opinion. Unfortunately our edition is more on the abstract and ugly side of things. 

I probably would rate it higher and play it more often with one of the more colorful editions that where marketed later. My main reason for rating it so low is, that there are not many opportunities to play it. The game is much more fun with 5 than with 3. And on the seldom occasions that we come together with so many people there are other games that attract us more.

This a great party game for the Munchkin crowd. The rules are very simple and most of the challenge lies in bluffing your opponents out of their "gotcha" cards. This particular game does a better job than Munchkin at keeping its length on track, avoiding the pitfall of mandating endless attacks on the leader. It does this by removing the interrupt cards from play each time they are used. Eventually they become scarce, allowing someone to seize the victory.

It's silly, maybe a little low brow...but I have to admit, killing Dr. Lucky is a pretty good time.

Kill Dr Lucky is great with three or more, especially when you get up towards 6 or 7. The new version that added the spite tokens really spices it up and makes it pretty quick.

A great light game, close to a filler but *can* run a little long for that purpose alone. I usually mix it in with another hour or hour-and-a-half long game, such as Mystery of the Abbey or Pirate's Cove, for a light, fun-filled evening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Enjoyable light-hearted game of murder.  A group of guests gather at Dr. Lucky's mansion and take turns trying to kill the old man.  We use the spite token variant, where each murder attempt earns you 1 spite token that adds to each subsequent attack (and cannot be used to cause a failure).  Fun for big or small game groups, but don't take it too seriously.

Based on two plays. Had a great time with the newly-released Titanic Games edition at GenCon 06. I didn't win (in fact, I caused the winner to win.. sigh) but had a blast. I suspect this game is very dependant on people who get into the murderous spirit whilst playing. Curse you Dr Lucky!!

update: played this again with less people and now have this game up for sale &/or trade. Really not impressed with the amount of decisions and overall strategy involved here. I was apparently blinded by the charisma of the publishers at GenCon. Could be a good drinking game, but even for something ultra-light, I think I'd rather play something else.

With added crappy paper components.

Simply one of my worst game evenings ever was spent playing this. Rare are games that have me wishing that somebody, ANYBODY, would win and end my waking nightmare.

They say "worse things happen at sea" but since I know a fisherman and a submariner - neither of which has reported an evening as bad as the one I had playing Kill Doctor Lucky - I can say, with some anecdotal authority, that sea-based mishaps cannot trump this boring creation.

I enjoy this game from time to time as the game play is simple (though for some reason hard to explain... expecially the "activation" thingy) and the flavor text of the luck cards is often quite funny (we demand they be read aloud in our group).  I do agree that without the spite point variant this game does take a *long* time.  We have also found that for large groups it is best to allow the players to take shots at each other as well.

My rating for this game would be lower if it weren't for the flavour of the text.  The people I play with have lots of fun embellishing what is written.

RATING: 5
Online play only.

Thank goodness for the computer version because I can't imagine having to manually keep track of Dr. Lucky's movements as well as whose turn it is each and every time.  With that said, this game is fun in concept, and a nice departure from the usual deduction fares that feature a mystery theme, but it is also one with conflicting design.  One would think the best thing about Kill Doctor Lucky is the fact it can accommodate up to 7 people.  Unfortunately, the game itself isn't actually more fun to play as you add more players.  The increased downtime (you actually spend more time watching others taking their turns than performing your own actions), not to mention the difficulty in creating the situation of being alone with your target to attempt the murder and catching people with a hand devoid of failure cards, both of which will keep the game dragging until it has long worn out its welcome.  This is more often an exercise in futility than enjoyment.

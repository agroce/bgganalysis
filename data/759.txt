Típico juego antiguo con sus cosas buenas y sus cosas malas. No me ha entusiasmado.

Tiene mecánicas interesantes, pero otras que no tienen mucho sentido. 

La desorganización variable de las unidades atacantes tras un ataque fallido es bastante acertada, pero el ataque por separado a grupos frescos y gastados en la misma área chirria un poco y da lugar a estrategias raras. 

Tampoco me parece lógico que los bombardeos o atáques aéreos solo consideren en defensa el terreno más el valor defensivo de la mejor unidad... no le veo explicación a la regla. Y así con otras varias.

También lo veo muy dependiente de la suerte tanto para los combates como para la duración del día o la noche. Una sucesión de malas tiradas te puede llevar a perder por muerte súbita, por muy bien que plantees tu estrategia. Demasiado aleatorio.

Jugar con el bando ruso puede tener sus momentos de aburrimiento en los que hay poco que hacer más allá de hacer escombros o mover alguna unidad suelta. Hacer algún contraataque con ellos es difícil y arriesgado, por lo que toda la partida te la pasas preparándote para el golpe y solventando las crisis puntuales que van apareciendo. No me ha resultado demasiado interesante, la verdad. Entiendo que el bando alemán es mucho más divertido.

Sin ser un mal juego, no me ha enganchado lo suficiente. Creo que hay juegos actuales que me atraen mucho más para emplear mi tiempo.

Only downside of the game is the fact at the Russians mostly have to just sit there and take the German abuse; otherwise, though, does a very nice job portraying the assault on Stalingrad, and is tense and exciting. Like Breakout: Normandy, it is probably worth playing the 2nd week but it rarely seems to happen. Some 2nd and even 3rd week scenarios would be very nice additions to the game (since playing one week is just about the right game length).

RATING: 6.5
One of the better area-impulse offerings, this would be my choice for fighting out the struggle for Stalingrad. That said, it remains a long game, and there are German strategies that can significantly alter the balance. The Soviet player is unlikely to be doing much attacking (on the other hand, this makes it pretty good for solitaire play).

More recent games, such as Storm over Stalingrad or The Hell of Stalingrad, probably get as much game into a shorter, smaller package. The latter lacks some historical detail, but they're playable in an evening, rather than a full day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Had this title years ago and it didn't work for me then so I sold it.  Occasionally, I wished I had it to give another try, particularly as I played more A/I games.

I picked up a player's copy (with the expansion) at a great price and have been enjoying it.  It's a bit of an odd duck, a bit rough around the edges, what with being pre-Breakout Normandy and all.  I'm not sure about the spent/fresh "groups" being separate targets.  The fact that units attempting to fortify an area can repeatedly fail they dig and dig to no avail, and if they do so in a frontline area they risk opening the door to an easy attack against their "spent group" is odd.  You learn that areas can simply not be fortified once they are on the frontline, it's just too risky.  

But the game works and is evocative of the historic situation.  

In fact, it succeeds where more recent treatments fail.  The German advance is rapid at first but bogs down.  The German player has to adapt his approach as the rubble builds and his troops dwindle.  The only downside is that the Russian player *often* has little to do but take pot shots with his artillery until it is suppressed, and then start rolling for its renewal.  The occasional counterattack, infiltration or ranged fire notwithstanding, things can get a bit slow on the East side of the table.

A good game, the best treatment of Stalingrad to date, and I am glad I gave it a second chance.

One of two games I own of this genre.  The potential for counterattack keeps the strongest side off guard and keeps the defender interested.  If you exhaust all of your strong units too early in a turn you open yourself up to a pounding.

The game system keeps both sides engaged and even if you are clearly weaker you can still show some teeth. The grinding yo yo nature of the combat and the way that the mechanised units are unable to play to their strengths feel authentic.

I played this a long time ago, acquired it recently, then sold it again. After setting this game up and reading through the rules, it looked like it would be little more than a slugfest. I was also somewhat baffled by the fact that AT and AA units didn't seem to have any special effects, despite the somewhat tactical nature of the game.

So, I'll be sticking with [i]Breakout: Normandy[/i] as my WWII area-impulse game of choice. If I want an area-impulse game on this subject, I prefer the shorter and simpler [i]Storm Over Stalingrad[/i].

Another good entry in the area-impulse design of games, and again, like 'Storm Over Arnhem', it's very asymetric. Playing the Russians requires completely different tactics and strategy than playing the Germans. If you're the Russian player remember Chuikov's advice to stay as close to the opponent as possible - 'grab them by the belt'.

RATING: 8
Very good game using the area-impulse system to capture the flavour of the Stalingrad battle. Not as good as Monty's Gamble or Breakout: Normandy though, mainly because there isn't much for the Russians to do except hold the line for the first week. Also, there are no scenarios that allow players to start in the 2nd or 3rd week and even if you devote the necessary 15 hours to finish all 21 days, the base game (without the expansion) takes you to only Oct 3 (not a very satisfying climax). 



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Together with Breakout Normandy is a great advancement in area-impulse system. A few new rules make all the difference between them and their predecessors Storm Over Arnhem and Thunder at Cassino. 
Now each turn is totally chaotic, unpredictable and challenging. If you have only played SoA or TaC don't hesitate, it's almost a new -much much better-system of movement and battle.

While the area movement/combat system would enjoy even better revision in follow-on games such as BREAKOUT: NORMANDY, this title represented a significant evolution of it.  Captures better than just about any other game the rhythm of urban combat in Stalingrad and puts both players in very similar psychological states as their historical counterparts.  For the German, it seems that just one more push is all that's needed to topple the Russians (where or where can he scrape up the forces to do it?).  For the Russian, the defense hangs by a thread yet there are opportunities to inject just a bit more friction into the German war machine to prevent him from winning.  The game focuses on the first three weeks of the battle and many sessions end in a shorter time.  An expansion kit is available to extend the battle another six weeks, but by then the situation is so static and gains so limited it's only recommended for the historically-minded to tinker with.  The first three weeks are the most mobile, the most tension-filled, and the most fun.  Keep in mind, however, it takes a long time to play, nevertheless.  Typically players can get through a week to a week and a half in a long day of play.

MMP's STORM OVER STALINGRAD provides a much faster playing alternative and can be considered an improvement in competitive/tournament play for this subject.  Some will prefer that title over this one.

I have played this only once at the con (the first week) and I have to admit I didn't get it. We didn't get all the rules right but most of the stuff. My biggest problem with the system was that the only way to inflict casualties was to attack the enemy. Therefore the german suffered very few casualties and on unimportant pieces, as Russia suffered heavy casualties every turn since there was no way to stack several pieces and keep continuous line. It just didn't seem right. Also the super-efficient artillery which cleared whole sections of my front seemed too powerful.

This is relatively a game of medium to low medium complexity.  The game contains a board instead of a paper map.  Unlike most of the games I own or have owned, this one doesn't have hexes but areas.  The quality of the game is about average.  The counters are in better shape than some of the old Avalon Hill games.  I have found the game to favor the Germans for the most part.  In my opinion, the areas are too small and it is quite easy too get units in the areas mixed up.  I also found that a lot of times it is hard to keep track of which units have moved, which are going to move, and which will stay in place to do battle.

A great wargame with non-traditional rules (area activation) that has very little downtime. You don't have to sit back and watch the other guy move an army across the board. It's great to watch the Soviet player hang on every roll the Germans need to lose to bring on night (and Russkie reinforcements). Movement costs offer a unique implementation of ZOCs. Cool infiltration rules. Like it a lot and I've just started playing 19 years after it's publication.

I am always interested in any games on the Battle of Stalingrad.  This bitter struggle between Axis and Soviets is the high tide of World War 2.  Avalon Hill's area movement coupled with sudden end impulse driven turns fueled the battle even more intense.  I enjoy this game so much that it virtually becomes my long time favourite.  The areial movement and combat systems work just fine and draw many followers. The system is warranted for the battle of Stalingrad in which fierce contest of area control, and the shifting thereof, was going day by day in Stalingrad. The system, in fact, was originated from the game "Thunder at Cassino" whereas the Allied had a bitter struggle with the German over the control of the mountainous region. (Many say that it was originated from "Storm Over Arhem" but I still think "Thunder at Cassino" is more akin to it). Buildings were reduced to rubble and smoke rose everywhere in both battles. 
The concept of "Spent" status of the military units is especially relevant to the tired and low ammo-supplied soldiers on the streets of Stalingrad. Supplies, apart from the bare minimum, are impossible to obtain. I pull this game out every now and then once for a while, even just merely looking at the gorgeous map keeps me from sleeping well at nights. (Oh....I was in control of the October Factory before....)  I agree the rulebook is hard to digest.  But it is compensated by an excellent, never-seen-before, topographical map on the Stalingrad campaign.  The best area movement game from the AH’s series.  While you play this game, read Antony Beevor's "Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege, 1942-1943". You can know how hollow it was.  Then, watch  Jean-Jacques Annaud's movie "Enemy at the Gates".  You are there. You will be addicted to this game as much as I do.

The first area-movement game I ever played. Fun, but always just a bit too complex and too long to get to the table. I think Breakout:Normandy is a definite improvement on the system.

This is a very cool impulse action game.  You can't be certain about what's going to happen next, so there is some unpredictability involved even when your forces outnumber your opponent's.  Recommended.

RATING: 7.5
I have played at least a hundred games of TP:S.  Back in the 1989-1991 time period I would have rated it a "10" as the matches were tense and epic.  Arguably this is the game that really established the area-impulse system thanks to the "sudden death" sunset die roll mechanism.  But later games such as Breakout:  Normandy, Monty's Gamble, Not War But Murder, Breakthrough:  Cambrai, Last Battle:  Ie Shima, etc., have left this one behind, both in terms of ease of play, realism, and component quality.  The heavy pro-German bias of the game is also a serious issue.  Usually I support bidding without any reservation but the bid to play the Germans in TPS is so far above the actual victory conditions that, in the end, it now lessens my enjoyment of the game, at least somewhat.  Even so TP:S was an influence on my own Stalingrad:  Verdun on the Volga (Last Stand Games, forthcoming 2016).

I have played this one a lot when it first became available. The tension that I felt as a Russian defender was incredible. You actually pray that darkenss will fall and you will manage to get across the river some badly needed reinforcements. As a German you have power but need to be very efficient and constantly look for opportunites to infiltrate and get favorable positions from the enemy. But look out for the unexpected Russian counter offensive! I love this game.

RATING: 7
One of my first wargames I purchased. (along with Thunder at Cassino) Fun and addicting, but with some flaws. Having no close combat phase in a Stalingrad simulation is perplexing. While the rules are fairly easy to digest and lend to playability, they abstract too much for my taste. I just don't get the feeling this is about the struggle for Stalingrad, it could be any battle on the eastfront. The limited number of impulses per turn is brilliant however. One last note: quality control on the counters was POOR! You take your chances buying this game on eBay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not really a bad game, but doesn't feel like Stalingrad to me.  The Germans form killer stacks and don't seem to take many casualties.  The artillery rules are too fiddly, and the 'historical' set-up has major play-balance issues.  A caveat to my rating is that I am not really interested in East Front games below the strategic level - if I were, I would probably give this a '7' rating.

If the German player is better than the Russian it will be a short, short game.  

With two players of equal skill it is unparallelled.

But the extended game rules without counters?  Avalon Hill deserved to go out of business.  If there was any justice Hasbro would've razed the entire city of Baltimore to the ground to make sure whoever made that decision couldn't have escaped.

'Evocative' seems to be the word most often used to describe this game, and it's indeed apt. The two sides certainly feel very different, and the Soviets have to survive the initial onslaught of the qualitively superior Germans before they can make the Red Army's manpower advantage felt. I especially like the division into day and night periods, with the Germans exploiting air superiority to dominate the day, while the Soviets use the cover of night to reinforce across the Volga and to infiltrate forces into enemy-held areas. There's a fair bit of granular detail here (and a corresponding commitment required to learn the rules, although they are not overly complex by wargame standards).
The area-impulse system has a nice fluidity to it, although the constant back-and-forth between players makes this a poor choice for Pbem. There's also no hidden information and thus no fog-of-war as such, bar the question of what plans may be being formulated in your opponent's head.
General consensus seems to be that TPS is imbalanced in favour of the Germans, although this can be addressed by increasing the victory points that side needs to declare victory.

The third of the series and unfortunately the beginning of the end as far as systemic focus goes as well as bearing the heavy-handed imprint of Don Greenwood. As for the claims about imbalance to the Germans, well if you only focus on the first week, naturally the Germans will hold the initiative and consequently the reins. I think too many people have missed out on a game that is much better than word of mouth has said, primarily because of the short play version. Not to say that the game is without flaws - Still too high a scale for the basic system but the variable game turn length is a strength. If it came down to BKN and TPS, I'd keep this.

I put this one just a tad lower than SOA, mostly because the Russians eventually get creamed.  For some reason playing the Brits in SOA is more interesting.  But this game has a number of advances, and in many ways is better than the all-time classic SOA.

I have been going through a lot of Stalingrad games lately.  This being the last in the line for awhile.  I don't evaluate games as comparisons but on their own merit.  

This game is very attractive using real playing boards not paper maps.  The counters are big (5/8) and easy to see.  Overall, I love the way the game looks.

The rules look deep but are not.  I put in the files section a 7 page condensed version of the rules.  It helps me to learn the game and reference it once I know some of the main points.  The small print of the rules is what makes it look tough.  

Well you should know some history about the battle and this game will reflect that strongly.  One problem for me was that the Germans are very powerful.  They wiped out the Russians by the 2nd week.  

What I didn't like about the game and had to adjust my strategy was that the Russians don't get to attack much.  If they do, they can get easily picked off.  Best to look for targets of lone Germans and pick them off, but otherwise stick to a concentrated defense.  Russians attacking during the day has a disadvantage so do your attacks at night.  

So with a different strategy that has to be played as the Russian side, (just sit around and take the poundings), I could not give the game anything higher than an 8.5.

I did like the game very much and had a lot of fun playing it.  It would be fun to try again, but it may just be the same situation, in which case, some house rules to soften up the Germans or strengthen the Russians would be in order.

Simply the best game covering Stalingrad on this scale ever produced. Doesn't use 1000's of counters or take as many hours to play. Elegant system, fast, engaging and a remarkable simulation of the battle. A great victory point system without getting too ahistorical to achieve a victory for either side. One of the early zone movement systems which broke out of the old 'hex game' mentality for great wargames. The variable turn length and Day vs Night mechanics gave the game an intense feel that is very evocative of the battle.

The rule book appears cumbersome at first. It's presentation is more suited as a reference guide once you've already understood the main premises of how the game works - so it is lacking a good overview. However, once past this I have found the play to have a more real feel to it than hex-based games, and the board quality is especially high- just the look of it makes you want to play.

RATING: 10
This game was a quantum leap forward for the area-impulse movement wargames that I already enjoyed. Unlike it's predecessors, Storm Over Arnhem and Thunder at Cassino, for the first time you could both move your units and do combat with them. Much less luck dependent than those games because you no longer noved units into an area adjacent to the enemy and just hoped your opponent didn't blast them on his turn.  In some ways, I like this even better than Don's subsequent excellent effort, Breakout Normandy.  I think TP:S is a bit less scripted.

I need to play again.  As I recall, the area movement seemed wrong at first (no hexes?!?), but after a while I realized it was actually a better representation of the battlefield.  I like the game, but its another one I never seem to play.  Will need a serious reread of the rules to try it again.

Outstanding fun. In my top ten two player games list. A real slog. While Breakout Normandy is a fluid mobile game, this is pleasantly different. There's the periphery rapid movement to enable planning adjustment, with the grinding battle in the centre and at selected sites. It doesn't get bogged down in rules and the historical accuracy helps make this a very good game.

First off I think all four games published by AH in their Area Impulse series are great. Many people try to rank these games, usually with "Turning Point: Stalingrad" (TP:S from here on) or "Thunder at Cassino" (TaC) coming in last. However, each game is quite unique in itself, so comparing them directly is really buttocks. 

The core of the Area Impulse games consists of players alternating in taking an impulse, i.e. fire or movement with any units starting in one area. After these units have taken their action, they are flipped over to the 'spent' side, which usually has a lower defense value making 'spent' units easier targets. That's simple, but players should still carefully plot their moves to avoid units getting smashed in an immediate counterattack.

The advantages of the Area Impulse system are, that combat is simple, because you only take two numbers, add a couple of modifiers (no more than five) and roll four dice (two per player). Furthermore the alternation of player actions reduce downtime and create a very dynamic and realistic play and battle progress. An added bonus is that the map having no hexes and being quite vivid, which might attract casual wargamers. 

After "Storm over Arnhem" (SoA) and TaC which featured combat on a bigger tactical scale, it is unique for TP:S and later "Breakout: Normandy" (B:N) to depict a whole battle on an operational scale. Personally I think the Area Impulse system work best on a tactical scale, but nevertheless TP:S works well, too. The second unique aspect of TP:S is that units remain 'spent' for more turn, depending on their combat performance. Results vary from overrun (0 turns delay) to disastrously repulsed attack (4 turns delay). The randomly determined length of day and night was also revolutionized here.

TP:S also has a slightly above standard amount of chrome rules, for example German and Soviet artillery are resolved completely differently and Soviet reinforcements have to cross the Volga first which is more difficult if the Germans occupy observation points across the city or at the shore.

My two points of critique are that firstly the Soviet have to play really good to NOT lose the game after the first week, because if the Germans do as well as they did historically they'll win too soon. The Germans are more powerful than the Soviets on the first week of the campaign, but taking just the Southern part of Stalingrad and tearing a few holes in the Soviet Northern defense line shouldn't win them the game. Secondly the game plays for a long time and is very hard to be finished in one sitting, which in my opinion wasn't what the Area Impulse system was intended for. (The inventor of the system only created the first two games: SoA and TaC.)

Another word on the expansion counter sheet. Even including the extra counters shouldn't take the game to NOT be resolved after three weeks, which is the same period of time the base game covers. Wasting more than $10 on a sheet of cardboard is therefore ridiculous.

This is a surprisingly good game. I really liked Storm Over Arnhem which made me believe that TP:S might be too big, too many counters, too long to play. However, once the first turn is done, most of the units are "resting" after combat and out of play. Some people might be put off by all the rules for varying rates of movement, exit conditions, etc. that define the individual units... but once beyond that hurdle, the excellent play begins to shine through.

There are four levels of disruption in the game and a slew of different counters to mark their condition. Scrap those; instead, just flip the counter for Level One disruption, turn the top of the counter "East" for Level Two, "South" for Level Three, and "West" for Level Four. Then, as time passes, just unwind the clock until the unit is fit to fight again.

Completes my set of the Area Impulse games originally started by Storm over Arnhem. When I get to play it I'll give it a 'proper' rating but looking at the map, counters and, knowing the general ebb 'n' flow of the area-impulse mechanics its a fairly safe bet to rank at least a 7 in my book.

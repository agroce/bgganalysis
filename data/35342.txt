Extremely attractive game.  The game play can be glacial unfortunately, and in my humble opinion, extremely biased to the defender.  On the plus side, the game is very simple and is very easy to tinker with.

RATING: 10
At first glance, this looks a lot like [thing=10630][/thing] for the American Revolution, without toy soldiers. Kind of, but not really. There is more strategy involved. You are not bound by cards because it doesn't use them. Your decisions are made from command points,  and while the amount of command points is based on the die roll, the way you spend them (moving, firing, rally, close assault) are entirely up to you. The battles have a lot of replay value in them and the expansion is every bit as good as the original.

RATING: 7
First rate components made in Germany create an excellent impression and add to the enjoyment of owning and playing the game. A handsome, practical bookcase box with stunning artwork contains a mounted game board and full-colour 24 page rule book with 13 scenarios. The 63 double sided hex terrain tiles provide forest, hill, swamp, town, fence, entrenchment, waterway, ford and bridge types. The 111 large square and oblong counters represent British and American regular, elite, light and militia infantry, along with dragoons, artillery and leaders as well a handful of markers to keep track of the game turn, action points, and victory points on the on-map tracks.
The system is comparable to Command & Colors in complexity. One significant difference is that the command cards are replaced by an average die modified by a side's command rating and affected by leader loss to drive and limit the action. A change for the better in this grognard's book, it still leaves the system very accessible and makes it extremely solitaire friendly. 
Overall, it's a nice light system appropriate to the era and has enough terrain and unit differentiation to be interesting without floundering under excessive complexity. There is already a French & Indian Wars expansion set, with the promise of more to come! 

Update: For the genre of light wargames I can't fault it, but for me at least it's not a keeper.

RATING: 5
Another easy to get into light wargame system.

Like all 'light' wargame system, there will always be some lacking and some certain strategy that is more game winning then others.

With CnC Ancients, the card play and the draw is perhaps the limiting factor as much as it is the system's intent. The right/centre/left structure does create certain interesting situations that is considered OK for a game.

In HtL, this right/centre/left structure is somewhat removed and the luck on drawing of certain cards are also toned down towards only 'action points' or in CnC context, as 'orders'.

However, this action point dependent game lacked the abilities of special cards. So in a sense, it tweaked the action points and improved gameplay, but suffers again, when special moves could not be added/executed. Making this a game that is 1 step forwards and 1 step back.

Nevertheless, the game is entertaining for some fun dice rolling sessions. Nothing more on excitement.

I have trouble with the idea that a 4-rated unit reduced to a 1-rated unit can still conduct attacks with the same proficiency. Action point system slows down play. Also, the board (terrain pieces, too) is so damn slippery that a hamster could go tubing on it.

RATING: 9.8
Broke down and got HtL even though I have Clash for a Continent. I rate Clash very highly, and I have to say, right out of the box the beauty of the components stand out. My Wife helped me punch out the counters and even she said "The pieces are pretty". I was part of a big (and I must admit nasty) debate about their original decision to produce this with plastic miniatures (I thought plastic was a poor choice for this system). While I am sorry it didn't work out the way they envisioned, I have to say, it is SO much nicer this way. The counters are thick and beautifully rendered, and the possibilities for expansions is increased since they don't have to produce a bunch of different molds for each type of unit they wish to create, just new artwork.
Of course the game itself hasn't changed much, it is still one of the cleanest and best systems i have encountered for playing horse and musket, gunpowder era battles.
Anxiously looking forward to their Mexican American War expansion.

RATING: 4
The main problem with this game is its Command mechanism : you've got Action points to spend, so you cannot do whatever you want everywhere...but you can do where you want to. Instead of simulating the chaos of Command and Control (with chits to some extent, like with "Into the bastards", or with cards like in CC systems or Up Front,etc), it only leads to developing action in the hot spot and artificially freezing the other troops. Not convincing at all.

RATING: 5
A very mixed bag where the sum is much less than the parts.

Physical components -- actually PHYSICALLY, a 9 -- sturdy, nicely cut, etc.; artistically, a 5; the map and terrain tiles are dark, the unit art disappointingly generic.  And more PINK brit counters, and baby blue Americans?  Lighten up the map, and use pure background colors, and the components would have POPPED off the mapboard.  Instead, we get pastel units in dark green murk...  Set up -- 4; I have sometimes spent time setting up terrain equalling about half the time it takes to play a scenario.  Yeah, yeah, lots of flexibility and scenarios, but given the actual games lengths, the set up becomes more proportionally a chore.

Play length -- a 9; I love that I can solo a battle in 20 minutes!   But, play fun/frustration ratio -- 5; play "realism" -- a 3; just enjoy the chaos as you can; none of your "maneuvers" or "good troops vs poor troops" thoughts and decisions will ever really apply.  Buckets of dice combat and no reduced capability despite reduced strength guarantees large doses of randomness to every game.

I read another review comment that I found mirrored my own feelings concisely, repeated here:

>Players are straitjacketed by the system, and not for their own good. You move a unit or two, shoot a bit, and then let your opponent do the same. There's very little sense of grand strategy, maneuver, progress, or satisfaction.

Also, the entire game feels 100% reactive. Player are often taking potshots at nearby units because they happen to be targetable, rallying a unit because it's about to be killed, firing with a unit one last time before it gets ambushed, or moving an about-to-be-blasted unit out of the way.<

I'll keep it, and return to it, as no-brainer filler games when I want to take a break from some "main" game I'm playing, but I'll never view this as more than candyland wargame filler.

I have itâ€”with French and Indian War expansion! The components are really quite beautiful: a first-rate, mounted and flat-folding mapboard; heavy, Memoir'-style terrain tiles; thick unit counters with rounded corners that practically fall off the sheet themselves; a glossy, full-color rule-book; and all tied together with period drawings, graphics, and a Don Troiani print on the box cover. Fans of the Clash for a Continent system won't be disappointed: the new scenarios and component upgrades alone will be worth it. Important: Get the FAQ for this game!

RATING: 9
After playing through 2/3 of the scenarios face-to-face (with all the advanced and optional rules, which are a MUST), I've raised my rating from an 8 to a 9. This is a great game and a great system. It has the ease and accessibility Battle Cry (another of my 9s), but plays quite differently. Beyond the visual similarity between the two games, the Hold The Line system seems more cerebral and definitely rewards careful planning and maneuvering. The presence of leaders is another similarity, but they seem more complex in Hold The Line. They offer greater benefits to the troops they accompany, but also present greater risks. They're less resilient than the B.C. generals, and more susceptible to falling in battle... and the loss of a leader in Hold The Line is more than just another Victory Point for your opponent. You permanently lose an Action Point (this game's equivalent of Command Cards in the Command & Colors games) per turn for each leader lost. And in a game where your options can be severely constrained by a scenario's initial setup, such losses can be devastating.

Hold The Line is a thoroughly enjoyable light wargame... and a very impressive offering from Worthington. It hits a sweet spot for me in its balance of simplicity, depth and short play time. And just the act of pondering last night's games in order to write these new comments makes me want to break it out and play again!

I love the Hold the Line system.  Some think that is very much like the Commands and Colors system, but other than the tiles I don't see the resemblance.  This game uses a die roll to determine action points available and they can be used to order anyone on the map.  There are no cards or restrictions on playing in certain flanks.  
The decisions are agonizing.  Do you slowly bring up your infantry in a long line and open them up to being fired upon as you prepare to assault, or do you stay back and try and pound the enemy with artillery and musket fire?  Tough game to attack in (which I understand feels right for this time period).

The game is already a success and I haven't even played anyone yet. It seems like a wonderful solitaire game but interesting enough that I could anticipate a real opponent doing things differently  The simple systems seemed a little dry upon reading  but in play it creates a fast, balanced approach.  I only wish there were more scenarios. I love the period and think I will enjoy this as a fast alternative to C and C.

Very simple and very quick rival to Borgs Command and Colors series. For those of us that are over the hill with cards, or people that like the idea of Command and Colors but don't want the setup time and the fuss this is worth a look. It's sound tactical fun, lots of dice chucking a bit of manouvre and the occasional surprise. However it feels more random than its rivals with combat being very dicy. It also loses a layer of strategy as there is no hand management involved.

When I first saw Hold the Line I was concerned that it may be a bit too similar to Commands and Colors Napoleonics which I own and enjoy.  I'm really pleased that I went ahead and bought it.  With free-er movement, a simpler rule-set and a different war this one is proving sufficiently different and just as enjoyable.

A pleasant surprise on the simulation meter and a joy to play.  It's a simple system that seems to really capture a feel for the tactics and style of combat of that era.  This coming from someone who's favorite tactical wargame is ASL and who will only play Memoir'44 with young gamers that are new to the hobby.  The components are top-notch (wish that the leader counters were "named" on the actual counter, but that's minor and easily remedied).  I've been playing this with my 13yr old son (who also plays ASL with me) and we are really enjoying it.  I think the fast pace of the game is very attractive to him as he sometimes dreads waiting to do something in the more complex and time consuming games.  I may bump this up to a "9" after more playings - or it could go down if I find that it loses its luster after a half-dozen playings or so.

So, it turns out that the cards in the C&C system are what make it fun, giving variety and promoting specific tactics and strategy. Who knew? I honestly would not have realized that without playing this game, which is really dull. Without the special cards in C&C like Line Command, you don't have anything to work towards, and there's no variety in turns. Very repetitive.

The best introductory wargame on the market. period. Hold the Line encourages some realistic tactical choices within a simple system provided in an attractive package. You cannot move all of your units around the map like in older SPI quad games, but nor will you find yourself restricted in movement by cards. Of all the simple wargames I've played, owned, and enjoyed Hold the Line is my favorite.

RATING: 6.5
A kissing cousin of Borg's Commands & Colors games (particularly Battle Cry), but now you get to curse your command die instead of your cards if you don't get to do what you want to do on your turn. A bit less color for lack of cards, but it is mostly made up for with some sleight unit differentiation and some conventional but still evocative wargames rules grit. Yes, it would be nicer with little figures, but the counters on display are nice and the map board and map tiles are a definite improvement over previous Worthington Games publications. I don't know enough about the period to speak to the game's historocity, but all the things I expected to see were in the game -- units advance under frequently murderous fire then test morale to see if they can finish the job with cold steel. Terrain seems a bit overstated (woods and hill hexes seem virtual fortresses), and artillery was not so effective as I would have expected. Plenty of scenarios. Ticks right along. Recommended if you like these light wargames and are interested in the period. If nothing else, you'll have an easily-playable little wargame to break out on the Fourth of July.

This one's not doing it for me.  Similar in many ways to Commands and Colors: Ancients, but ultimately inferior.  The action-point system in Hold the Line allows for more interesting scenarios than C&C:A, which is mostly restricted to the two-lines-of-dudes-meet-in-a-field-that-can-conveniently-be-divided-into-left-right-and-center-sections variety.

But HtL falls down because the rules don't allow for interesting maneuvering. All the action points available each turn are spent moving and shooting in a few hot spots while the rest of the units sit around waiting to become relevant; each unit (the very occasional dragoon excepted) may only move or fire each turn, not both; and most units can only move one hex per turn.  Imagine a C&C:A scenario that consists of 95% heavy infantry, with a special rule that the infantry can't move and fire in the same turn, and you'll get some notion of how a typical HtL scenario plays out.

I doubt this is an accurate reflection of AWI warfare; in any case it makes for a boring game.

Worthington's got a game system which moves swiftly and provides a variety of scenarios, from stand up linear engagements to ambushes and petit guerre.  Good stuff.  Only downside is some of the unit graphics - the French troops look to me like they're shaking tambourines rather than wielding muskets.

RATING: 6
I gave this game a "6" which feels harsh, so I'll explain.

First off, the components are great and it's not a bad game, if it is the kind of game you are looking for.

I didn't enjoy it because I expected something with more depth.  Fans of Memoir '44 will notice similarities, and may enjoy Hold the Line more if they dislike the card aspect of Memoir '44.

I found myself jumping back and forth in the rules because of the way they are laid out.  There is data in the rules that should be on a separate card for easy reference.  There is also at least one example of obfuscation that is easy to recall: namely that all combat units roll three dice all the time.  While that bit of data is in the rulebook, it's in a table.  Why include a table that has "3" in every row?  I found myself digging through the rulebook to look for an exception that could explain why the information was presented in a table.

Note also that while the pictures on the box show the counters in a "line" the game has no "line" aspect at all.  They are just counters that can be rotated in any which way.  I bought the game expecting facing to be a playable tactical element.

Great light wargame, excellent components, short and concise rulebook, and a heck of a lot of fun to play. I solitaired the first scenario after skimming through the rules and enjoyed. Reread the rules and noticed a couple of errors I made in the frist play-through, so I set it up again and played it to completion with the Americans winning by one point. Can't wait to play it FTF with my wargaming buddy, a BRIT! (Guess which side he'll play?)

Hold the line is the exact perfect amount of wargame for me. The rules are, compared to most entries in the genre, quite simple and easy to memorize with a few replays. They are complex enough to allow for in-depth strategizing but not so complex as to cause one to be bogged down over rule minutiae. Hold the Line accomplishes its goals admirably.

07/20/08 Pre-ordered to get the extra French & Indian War scenarios and counters. 08/22/08 Received. 
09/29/08 Now that I've played it several times I've rated it a 7. It easily could have been a 8 if it didn't have so darn many errors in the scenario set ups. Plus, I've found several vague rule passages. I also question some of the design choices (hex grid on board almost impossible to see, hard to tell hills from woods in scenario set up if a unit is on them, size of counters not logical when considering stacking rules). Most of the above I find quite strange, considering this is basically the same game as WG's Clash for a Continent. The rules problem should have been ironed out in the intervening three years. Some of the (re)design changes actually made things worse. 
As of 05/20/17 I've played 104 games of Hold the Line.

Plus F&I expansion. 

Nice, clean "battle" game, but let's face it, the picture of linear warfare you get is painted with some very broad strokes indeed. I'm also slightly underwhelmed by the game's graphics; the artwork on the terrain tiles in particular is uninspired and battlefields look dull and murky when set up. Will try out some of the advanced rules to see if the extra flavor is worth the overhead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an excellent game. The mechanics are very intuitive especially if you have played any of the Commands and Colors games; you will find some familiar terms and processes. 

The game play is smooth with only a short learning curve. My 7 year old and I were able to read over the rules and play the first scenario in less than two hours. I suspect now that we are familiar with the rules out play times may decrease slightly. Then again they could increase as we employ new strategies.

Overall this is a fun game and I look forward to getting it on the table as often as I can.

Very nice, light wargame. Thanks to action points instead of cards it's more solitaire friendly than the C&C games and just as fun.  It's still below Memoir or CCA for me in terms of desire to play. However, I really do like playing this system with counters instead of miniatures, so bonus points for that.

Tactical combat set during the American Revolution. Take the Berg's C&C sytstem, strip it of its cards and three fronts, and you have HtL in a nutshell. For such a simple ruleset, the games and scenarios do a surprisingly good job of capturing the actual battles and tactics used.

There is a nice feel to this game.  It looks nice and despite the fact that you may only have a dozen units per side it feels like a genuine 18th century battle.  You get that feel of troops advancing against withering fire and either faltering or initiating a successful bayonet charge. I have won and lost battles playing both the British and the Americans  in many different ways so there seems to be high replay value.  The games play quickly and it works well solo as well as head to head.  It also lends itself well to being played in a campaign.  I see there is a new version out on Kickstarter which looks very nice.  I'm happy with my version but would love to pick up the new scenarios as well as a copy of the old version of the French and Indian war expansion.

RATING: 5
I don't understand why anybody enjoys this game. There are only a couple unit types. Having to track turns is tedious. The action allocation system is simplistic and linear, allowing no flexibility or surprise, and there are far too many units on the board for the system to be made interesting. Worse, because its sole desire is to be simple, it fails to reflect the realities of the period at all. The gameplay can be boiled down to: roll a die to determine how many dice you roll. And you repeat that until you've reached an arbitrary turn number. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice game with terrific production values. Looks simple but there is some depth there. More historical and easier to play then C&C Nap but the style of warfare is somewhat different as well. In C&C you begin the game already lined up against each other. In HTL you have a little play in how you do that because of the use of CAP rather than section cards. Plays quickly too. Lots of fun.

Good weight, nice play time, good little production. I sometimes feel it's just a bit too abstracted though. I'm not sure why. The close combat doesn't feel dangerous for the attacker. So a unit can just charge gung-ho, and if you don't have the points or don't want to spend the points to respond next turn, your unit just stands there waiting for orders. It is a little odd.

After more plays, some of the other scenarios are really impressing. I think you have to add the optional close combat rule for this game to shine.

First impressions: Light tactical hex and counter with really large hexes and counters. Lots of elements you may already know from other games: terrain effects, infantry, light infantry, artillery, cavalry, militia, leaders. Morale checks, retreats, LoS, rallys. All kept very simple.

Intuitive. Plays quickly, but what you see on the map isn't really fast paced as units cannot move and attack at the same activation. No facing, few TEM (hill, trench and forest weren't even different in the first scenario). 

All in all, HtL is a bit too bland for my taste. The feeling reminds me of Blood and Roses (a mechanically different game of course, but still), and a level of complexity that is somewhere above Memoir '44.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This edition has really nice components, plus a mounted board, which is a significant upgrade over the "Clash for a Continent" which comes with a thick coated stock 'board.' 

"Hold the Line" also features an attractive 4-color rulebook, although obviously there was no editing (almost total lack of punctuation and some printed rules contradicting each other), plus the font--selected by the designer or someone involved in the production--includes an extension to it on all instances of 'st' or ct' plus the same extension in the rules description on every letter 'e' that resembles an apostrophe and makes reading difficult. A really bad decision. 

But, the game itself is right in line with the excellent "Clash for a Continent"--which I also own, with scenarios of the same general quality. In all, a worthy add-on.

Bought a ding-and-dent copy at GenCon 2014.

Worthington Games makes good game but there is always something they do in the rules that prevents them from making the game great. In this game it is the random AP allocation each turn. You have a set amount and then roll a D6. Your game completely hinges on this one roll each turn which causes the entire are slow down and act like Forest Gump trying to say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious three time fast. Everything uses AP from moving and combat. So you roll low you are not doing anything that turn. A simple fix of allowing your army to move for free and use AP for combat would make this a great game. Until that it will remain a 5.5 rating for me.

Light wargame that's gobs of fun. I'm not sure if I know why, as there doesn't seem to be anything groundbreaking here.

Attractive counters, functional board.

I really like how simple the rules are for this game.  I also enjoy how fast it moves through the turns.  And very importantly, I enjoy and get to learn more about the time periods of the American Revolution and the French and Indian War.  Oh and it plays great solo.

Sold it because it wasn't played as much due to theme and overall feel.  I often wondered about how the troop movement didn't feel like a real battle as only few units moved.

Light wargame, nice components. Simple so you can get non-wargamers into a historical flavored game.  
 
Similar to Command and Colors, units have step loss, can move, fire or close assault. Uses variable initiative points which can be used across the map and not limited to sector. Units retreat much less frequency, only during close assaults. As a commander need to decide when to withdraw damage units and to use leaders to rebuild damaged units of pursue an attack.

RATING: 6.5
Rated 6.5 based off one solo play where I included the advanced rules after reading through the standard rules because the game play seemed to be a little too simplistic for my tastes.

The components are certainly very attractive and its great to have so many scenarios/battles from the AWI in one small package. However, the use of generic counters and tiles to achieve this made everything feel a little too abstract, e.g. I had to keep referring to the legend in the rulebook to remind myself which of the generic leader counters related to the historical leaders in the actual battle, etc. Despite the few paragraphs of historical introduction to the scenario, I found it difficult to become truly engrossed in the events taking place on the board in front of me and each unit became simply that, just another unit of whatever value at the time.

I have other games on the period which will likely scratch the historical itch better but for what it is trying to achieve, this light wargame does appear to deliver very well.

I can easily see myself playing this game with non wargamers and think that it would also be a nice way to introduce people to the AWI as well as the 'exciting' world of historical wargames in general :)

RATING: 8
The evolution of Richard Borg's command series. Throws out the card based combat and replaces it with an action point system. This system allows for some interesting unit placement that's a refreshing change from the north/south placement found in battle cry, memoir, etc... The counter and board quality is of German standards, Â unfortunately, the production design is not. A certain amount of "pimping" is required for this game to truly shine. For example, even though an action point track is included on the board, it's rather cumbersome, and when you're dealing with 7 points, it can be easy to forget which troops moved or battled. The rule book is filled with ambiguities, and the FAQ becomes a necessity. It's apparent that Hold the Line could have used another month or two in play testing with the final prototype.Â 

Even with all these marks against it, that shouldn't deter you from picking up this excellent game. Just set your expectations accordingly.

This is a fun tactical game system.  The scenario's play quickly and the mechanics are easy to learn but not overly simplistic.  A really good option for tactical level gaming that will not burn your brain with rules nor take hours to finish.
This is a very good intro wargame and an even better PBEM  if you like quick hitter files (like myself).  The impulse nature and the variable OP system add a couple solid elements to the game that create tension and endless replay value.
The only issue I have is the amount of units in each battle.  Every game saw many units untouched due to the amount of AP's available each round.  Not a bad thing but just a little odd.

This game is essentially an updated version of "Clash for a Continent: Battles of the American Revolution and French & Indian War" with better gaming components.  It's probably the type of simple wargame that a Euro gamer might be willing to play.

The game system is somewhat similar to Richard Borg's Command and Colors series, but the player determines the number of turn moves by rolling a die instead of playing a card, and the three-column Command and Color system restriction is eliminated.

This is essentially the same game as Clash for a Continent, with different scenarios. On the plus side, the components have been improved, but as a minus the French & Indian war scenarios, which were included in the older game, have been stripped out and packaged separatedly as an expansion this time. For me, that adds up to the same rating I gave for the earlier game.

Beautiful components, the units are printed on thick cardboard.  Plain map is altered by terrain hexes placed onto it so very flexible.  Rules are fairly straightforward and the game has a large number of scenarios available.  However the game doesn't really grab me, there doesn't seem to be much variation in tactics other than attacker walks towards defender getting shot to bits and hopes to have enough strength left to close assault.  Probably very historically accuarate but a bit dull as a game.

RATING: 9.5
I like this game, which is based on Worthington Games, Clash for Continent.  Excellent play value with quite a few scenarios.  The Action Point system works really well, and I actually prefer it to the much more luck driven process found in the Commands & Colors series.  Since you get a known + random number of AP points each round, which can be used for any of your units, you won't find yourself losing because of a series of poor draws. 

The components are VASTLY improved over Clash for a Continent with nice chunky tactile counters and a mounted board.

We've downsized our home size, and I've had to radically cut back on game boxes--not everything was sold by rating, and like in this case, may simply come down to how much play it is likely to see in the next year.  this is a GREAT GREAT game that I just don't currently have any opponents for.

I want to like this game for its great components and ease of play, but after my first few plays I am a bit disappointed. Not a bad game, but I agree with the comments by other players: slow play, excessive influence of terrain (move or fire is fine, but advancing towards an enemy in cover is deadly, your unit will probably be swept away before arriving in effective firing range), unbalanced scenarios, high luck factor (that's true also for C&C, but IMHO in Borg's system it's more fun). But maybe I just played wrong and I will change my mind after some more plays. Did I say I want to like this game?
Great for playing solo, though.

Update: rating upgraded from 6.5 to 8 after a few more plays. I will not change my previous comments, they are still true but may be counterbalanced with appropriate tactics. You have to be patient and build your tactics up slowly, if you make a wrong move the game can be unforgiving.

2nd update: my first comments were a lot of crap. Rating updated to 9 after playing all scenarios from the base game and the expansion. This is a great game, period.

This game is not trying to give you a sense of linear tactics, nor is it trying to faithfully recreate a given scenario in historical detail.  

What it does do, and does well, is allow you to have a fun gaming experience, (ala Memoir '44 ~ let's call it M44-Lite, or Battle Cry-Non-alcoholic), yet without the strict "sections of the battlefield~ left, right, center" and without the cardplay.

Here, Action Points rule the day.  The graphics are good, and the play, though light, is fun...enough!

There is a lot of game in this small, portable package. It's a fun and fast system that never loses it's new-game charm. Seems to be requested more than other games lately, so it's on my game table almost every weekend. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but I'm actually thankful there are no command cards or plastic soldiers cluttering up the map and game table. When it's set up, it looks cleaner and more like a traditional wargame except with jumbo counters and hexes. It also does a great job of recreating the feel of manoeuvre and combat for that period.

First time I played this, I became giddy.  It was sitting on my shelf for about six months when I decided it was time to give it a go.  I didn't have high hopes because it looked like a poor knock-off of Memoir '44.

I played solo and my excitement grew as the game unfolded.  By the end of the game I tadly became sadly.  :)  I stood up, stared at the board and replayed the game in my mind.

Fantastic use of the action point system mechanic.  Seamless, smooth, empowering.

I really felt like a General deploying his troops and reacting to battlefield situations using eighteenth century tactics.  ("Close ranks!  Form line!  Wheel right!")  The design of the game teaches you that  Napoleon era armies fought the way they did because, given the weapons, any other way would be suicidal.  

A good number of scenarios included in the instruction booklet makes the replay value of this game high.

To repeat my [i]Clash for a Continent [/i] comments:

Players are straitjacketed by the system, and not for their own good.  You move a unit or two, shoot a bit, and then let your opponent do the same.  There's very little sense of grand strategy, maneuver, progress, or satisfaction.

Also, the entire game feels 100% reactive.  Player are often taking potshots at nearby units because they happen to be targetable, rallying a unit because it's about to be killed, firing with a unit one last time before it gets ambushed, or moving an about-to-be-blasted unit out of the way.

I am by no means a game snob, but this game is so light that it technically doesn't exist.

really like the action point system controlling flow of game.  Most games were close with some knock down fights.  Really enjoy this gem from Worthington.

A dandy simple little game based on tactical battles of the American Revolution. Don't be fooled by its simplicity, this game has a lot going for it.

One of Worthington's most beautifully produced games. Excellent counters and board.

This is a perfect game for both wargamers and non-wargamers.  It plays very quickly, has simple rules, yet holds together very well as a game.  I'm kind of surprised how well the game sometimes mirrors the actual historical events, although for me this is not a criteria for this particular game.  It still speaks well of it.

For those who are looking to break into the genre, and found Memoir 44 not to their tastes, this game almost certainly will work for you.  It is a far, far better "gateway" wargame than M44, and even seasoned wargamers will enjoy it.

An well-designed introductory war-game of the American Revolution period. Top quality components in a portable box. The gameplay is fast, the rules are clear. Easy to learn, effort need it to conquer the asymmetrical senarios-battles.

Found it to simple. For many it is a good lite board game but like Memoir 44 I found it dull. I'll play it upon occasion though.

Nice battle game, action points system adds a good element of uncertainty, but works better imo then BattleCry's cards.

Great components. Clean rule set. Some similarities to C&C system. Instead of cards, you use dice to determine the amount of actions you can attempt in each turn. Scenarios are varied and interesting. I really enjoy the same C&C pressure of not being able to do everything you want in one turn, but the flexibility of ordering any of the units you have on the map.

Preliminary rating. Looks like a Commands and Colors-style game to me...and I LOVE those! Future plays may affect rating, which I'm predicting will go UP if it moves at all!

I am a little luke warm on this.  I enjoy light wargames, but this seemed a bit meh.  I don't mind the action point mechanic, but I feel the allowable actions are too restrictive and result in a much less interesting game.  Most units can either move one space or attack.  Being able to only move 1 space makes it hard and costly to do much maneuvering.  Mostly you move into firing range.  However, as soon as you move into range, you have to stop and then the other side gets to fire on you first.  In most cases, it is simply easier to wait for somebody to move towards you.  Some of the scenarios seem pretty unbalanced.

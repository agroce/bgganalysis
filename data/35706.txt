Carpe Astra was a quasi-impulse Tanga purchase.  Given that the cost of the game plus shipping was no more than $10, I wasn't expecting all that much.  Do I feel as though I got my money's worth out of Carpe Astra?  Yes.  Is Carpe Astra a great game?  No.  Is it a game worth playing? Maybe.

RATING: 7.7
Very nicely produced, great quality all round and pleasing to look at.
The game is also surprisingly evocative for such an abstract game, the text on the cards and the shifting loyalties really make the political theme come to life.
I also like how, at around the half way point, the game becomes meaner and meaner as support chits run out and people start drawing cards from "the naughty deck". It can be quite vicious and sometimes your only possible move is to harm the losing players which is frustrating for them.

Our first game ended 10/10/10/6, which made money the tiebreaker, and in this game money is tighter than a gnat's chuff.

An odd game of forming connections (lines) to score cards and obtain influence markers.  Points are awarded at the end of the game for first (majority) and second for each of the 6 factions.

Decent premise and execution.  Theme is somewhat pasted on, though it's flushed out nicely by the flavor text and characters.  Art is nice.

GOOD:  Interesting mechanics, decent gameplay, somewhat novel.

BAD:  Can have downtime between turns.  Card draw is critical and totally random.  The cards (which specify which connections you're trying to make) have 2 or 3 symbols on them.  If a player lucks into lots of 2-symbol cards, they will have a *MUCH* easier time of it.  If a player draws lots of or only 3-symbol cards, they're effectively screwed.  Very little you can do about that.  Rulebook has lots of errors in it.  (You *MUST* check out the FAQ/errata.)

SUGGESTIONS:  Rotate start player for each round.  May want to use variant that has 2 cards for each type (Network & Slander) face up as choices.  Not much you can do about the downtime.  STRONGLY recommend avoiding playing this game with the AP-inclined.

There is a lot to think about in this one.as you try to gain influence in the guilds. The only thing I didn't like about it was that there is a set of events that allows you to plan but then events come up that change the events that you had planned for. Just annoying why have something to add an element of planning and then change it randomly every now and again. 1 Play.

I raised my rating after playing a 3-player game. Why? Two reasons. One, I wasn't as tired as the last two tries and found the game to be easier on the brain. Therefore, I was having more fun instead of thinking it was some kind of devious test. Second, 3 players alters the stratgey considerably and for the better.

I can't wait to give the four player a try!

An interesting concept and very attractively put together.

Also the driest flavour text I have ever seen.

RATING: 7
Neat little game that may or may not be a step above filler.  More plays will reveal whether there is real depth there or whether the moves are fairly obvious.  Regardless, it's a fun mess-with-your-opponents game that shouldn't take more than an hour at most.  Rating may go up based on further play but is unlikely to go down.

Carpe Astra took me a bit by surprise since it was a lot heavier and more abstract than I had thought. There was a lot to consider and so I was really struck with some severe AP. Overall, I did enjoy the experience but I need some more plays to see how much I might like or dislike the "ganging up on others" aspect of the game. 

Until I get the chance to try it again, I rate it a 7.

Only managed 1 play of this neat little game so far and I can see my rating potentially going up with more.  This is a game of building influence (or weakening your opponents influence) through the creation of links.  It's a clever game with nice, modular double-hex pieces, although the theme is a bit pasted on.  Well worth a try if you get the chance though.

UPDATE: I've managed some more plays of this now and I find that I really enjoy the game.  Money is incredibly important here as you have to pay to do just about anything in this game (bloody bribes) and is a very tight, limited resource.  There's a bit of luck involved in what you get when drawing network/slander cards but it's generally manageable and is less of an issue with more players I've found.  The interaction in the game (in the form of Slander cards) doesn't really kick off until late in the game when most/all of the influence tokens have been taken via Network cards but that's okay.  Besides, woe betide you if you completely ignore what your opponents are up to during the early game.  If you do you'll lose.

RATING: 6
Some definite pacing issues: being able to buy new cards at the start of your turn encourages players towards paralysis. The event cards seem uninspiring, and a lost opportunity for more interesting-yet-fair variety in the game. Money is useful in the game, but once you have a handle on the mechanics, seems extraneous.

*** Got my finsihed copy and played today. Seeing the final production pushes it up to 7.5 for me. A very professional polished result. I lost, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The two new players picked up the idea quickly ,and we had a lot of fun reading out the slandering! *** 
Playtested, in development, interesting, needs a little more choice or control for the players. *** Playtested new versions, much improved, the second version is much more dynamic, fluid. *** Playtested more versions, working out VERY nicely. Very tight but open, fluid, quick decisions. Personally my main problem is how to turn the scoring to my advantage. Everything else is a good for me, but I just don't read the best way to optimise my score. That's the only thing keeping my rating from rising. I think Ted & Jack are definitely onto something new here. Lots of possibilities and you could probably play two games with the same components as is.

There are some interesting aspects to this game but on my first play it seemed simply too tit-for-tat. I think I would raise it to a 6, possibly 6.5 with more players. I can see how the decisions would become more important. Fairly mundane and uninteresting with two players. On the plus side, there is a good amount of interaction and the game is of short length so it could make for reasonable filler if it plays better with 3 or 4.

This game have a lot of interesting ideas, but I've never been much fond of majority nor puzzle games, which are two very strong mechanics in the game. The interaction is pretty random, as it's rather what you can do with your cards, than who is the leader, which makes your choice of slandering.

I played a prototype of Carpe Astra with co-designer Jackson Pope, at the Summer Stabcon Event in July '08

A connections and set collecting game, with a political theme, and a space setting... It was not quite what I anticipated from the title and the space theme, but it's a clever little game, with plenty of screwage in the later stages of the game, but without being too confrontational...

Rating is for the prototype version I played.

RATING: 6
Some good ideas and interesting gameplay, but flawed execution. You have to place your agents on guilds in order to fulfill network and slander cards, which give you a token or take one from an opponent. Luck of the draw is a little high, since there is a huge difference in getting a card with two or three symbols, or cards with identical symbols. 

But my biggest complaint is that while it seems the intention was that players alternated the use of network and slander cards, in practice it doesn't work that way. Given the higher cost to use slander cards (losing an agent and having to pay money to get the guild counter), the tendency is to use only network cards during the first half of the game, until the pool of tokens is exhausted. In the second half, players use slander cards to steal tokens from the opponents, preferably bashing the leader. But sometimes it is costly to change your target, and you may end up attacking always the same player. Also, there is nothing a player can do to defend against attacks. It really displeased me the way the game evolves and all the chaotic stealing in the end, and I eventually sold my copy.

This is a very good euro, and is probably my favorite game by this designer so far.   Unlike a lot of popular euros I have played recently, this one has a LOT of interaction.  You are battling for "influence" which is a limited resource.  The first part of the game you collect these tokens from the galactic bank and the second half of the game you mostly spend stealing them from the other players.  There is a lot going on in an hour long package.  You gain influence tokens which determine the end game scoring through cards.  You have money you can use to buy new cards, tiles representing areas of space, or to bribe other players.  You use the cards to get influence tokens in areas where you have placed your agents.  There are also event cards that give you money based on what you do each turn.  Basically, every turn you are moving agents and buying cards, sometimes placing new tiles, to set up scoring an influence token or two.  As the game goes on, the influence tokens in the bank get scarce and you build towards each other, so you end up interacting more and spending more time stealing other people's tokens.  

The theme is also very well integrated into the game.  You are a galactic politician and the game is galactic politics and intrigue, with your agents moving through space to support your various secret agendas and get you influence with different groups.  

I played a playtest copy which was finished except for rulebook tweaks.  If this game gets quality components and the price point is acceptable, it will be a hit.  It occupies an interesting niche.  It plays 2-4 in about an hour, and has both long term planning and tactical play.  As I mentioned before, there is a LOT of interaction, which is always a sticking point for me and eurogames.  I don't really like the multiplayer solitaire type of games.  Carpe Astra is the OPPOSITE of that design style.  One of the best "under an hour" four player games I've played.

UPDATE: Wrote a big ass review.

RATING: 6
Based on my only play (4 player), I found that player interaction was little and not encouraged, and also that the main roles (Admiral, Politician, etc) could benefit from assymetrical powers on the board instead of just on the scorecard. Speaking of scorecards, this proved a bit fiddly to manage and to keep track of who was in the overall lead. 

The game shows plenty of promise but there's still things that can (and should) be changed before publishing.

Edit 20/09/08: Played a very different and definitely  improved version of the game. It's become a real brain burner and although I'd still like to see more interaction between the players and less downtime, the game now has a good balance to it that I can understand any reluctance to change it further. I think it is now a good game. Will the designer and publisher have the courage to change it further and risk making it even better at the expense of the current goodness?

Played this as a prototype (almost final version) in a two player session.  The game is very easy to pick up and plays quickly, however it feels more like a heavier strategy game with each decision having an impact further along the line.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep and heavy games, but doesn't have hours to spare or a circle of friends who love listening to complex rules explanations (So pretty much everyone).

No artwork has been produced yet, though it will be by the same artist as It's Alive! so expect good things! The fluff is being slowly released and is shaping up to be very nice, I'm really looking forward to seeing the finished article.

There are a few unresolved issues here that needed a bit more attention.  The most obvious concerns stem from the cloassical multiplayer wargame issues.  How do you keep players from picking on the weak?  How do you prevent the leader from being constantly dragged down?  It does not seem that either of these issues received any real treatment.  

Secondarily, this is really an abstract networking game.  Elements of that backstory are preserved in the card text, but somehow get lost in all of that funky, stylized sci fi art.  I think a cleaner, more obvious application of theme and mechanic would have stood the design in good stead.  Busses, telephones, electricity, computer networks -- any of these would have been better than an unfamiliar, and largely ignored space opera background.  

That said, as a network game, it has the possibility of being very engaging.

One playtest game only, which (after a few rounds of wondering how it all fitted as one) came together nicely for me.

While there may still be some tinkering to be done, there was a balance between the various parts of the game I enjoyed. Resources are very tight, and need to be carefully managed. At its heart I saw a hand management game, but you cannot ignore the other mechanisms, nor indeed the other players.

Unless Jack relaxes the rules, the tightness and balance around the resources mean it's one best suited to a gamers' (rather than a casual) crowd.

You influence tiles in continuguous patterns to earn influence over guilds or destroy influence of other players. You score points for having majority or minority influence of the guilds at the end of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really interesting game where each player is trying to gain control of the Senate in order to become the new Galactic Emperor.

The game is driven by the need to gain influence within the 6 Guilds. Doing so allows players to compete Network and Slander cards which in turn earn you power within those Guilds.

The game uses abstract movement mechanics combined with hand management and set collection to complete the cards. The scoring uses a 'majority / minority' system to award points for the players holding the most and 2nd most influence within each guild.

The importance of earning credits, which allow several important actions to be taken each turn, cannot be underestimated.

Finally the game uses 10 events to control the length of the game as well as offer important goals to aim for each turn.

All in all this is a clever little design by Reiver Games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Some definitely interesting ideas, but I think the game could use some more development. The game play is most likely to be divided into two stages; first, people will building networks and second, people will slander each other. Considering that, it seems a bit unfair that the turn order is fixed throughout the game. I would say let the player with the most number of faction tokens to go first, because playing last seems to have a slight advantage over others. Another idea that our group had was to let individuals score after the end of their last turn, a la Vinci style. Finally, it would be more interesting if different characters had some differences - not too much, since it will be too fiddly, but maybe different combinations of starting tokens?

I like everything else about this game - especially the long-term strategy aspect which many miss.

I love this game. It feels like a Peter Chung created a board game. I love the theme, and the idea that you can decide to grow or to attack your opponent. There is a bit of AP, but not too bad. I want to try this with more than two players, but I can almost already see that it is probably not going to work as good because of the time it takes to play your game.

Played much better than the rules read. 

Like how the game has to phase - begins positive by accumulating support tokens then turns nasty as you have steal tokens from the other players. With occasional forays back to the positive side. 
 
Money is the limiting factor as to have any sort of flexibility required by the limited number of cards you have and movement of agents, you need money.
Turns out to be a nice balancing act to gain money and to acquire the support (victory tokens).

Like how event cards factor in to the money/card  process to drive some of the action.

Vie for guild votes by building networks with your agents in a competition to become the new Galactic Emperor. A game of two halves: win the available votes then slander your opponents to make them lose theirs. A few elements that might be slow to grasp for some, but the game is well worth the effort.

--Feb2009-- More brain-burning than it originally appears.  The difference in utility between the two-target and three-target cards seems very strong - so how well one does at card draw may drive results more strongly than I might prefer.  Definitely interested in playing again.

(Naturally, I'd need to play a lot more before tweaking things, but at my current level of naiveté I'd be amused to sort them into separate piles, and require that each draw from the 2-target pile cost 1 coin in addition to any other costs. Sadly, it wouldn't work without other tweaks:  the economy is nicely balanced as is, and I expect it would upset things.)

I lvove the conceptual theme here, and it works great at the executive level too. What made me trade this eventually was that the end game could've used more tension. As it is, everyone scrambles for favor tokens from the supply, and then knock them out from each other one by one. The end will usually be really close, and a little anticlimactic. Maybe the board play plays a bigger role than I ever got to see - we never rotated the double hexes much. I feel about Carpe Astra like a coach might feel about a kid who shows great effort but always falls short: you want to keep giving him chances, but in a competitive environment he will eventually fall by the wayside.

Quick enough to play when you're not up for a long commitment, but not quite a light filler: the tactics and strategy are present, clear but not too simple or too complex. A great game that I keep ending up suggesting time after time.  

We did have the problem that we've been playing it wrong up until the current count started...but I'm not sure if we don't actually prefer it wrong...

Played four and two player. Do not recommend playing with more than two players for any reason.

With two players, the only interesting part of the game is money management; the rest of the game is just there to make this complicated. Otherwise it's down to luck and lots of calculating with little informed decisions.

..and those flavor texts!! Man, those are real hacks..what a theme’ing  :D  ..love that art and 'story' beyond..

Played a prototype at Beer and Pretzels 2008. It's a game that requires some thought about how to win it, hence the medium play weight. There are some unique game mechanics and also some tried and tested ones, they mesh together well in a game which is good, but for me not one that excites, hence the 7 rating. I would say definitely worth a try.

Two 4-player games with prototype (with slight rules changes between plays). Strip away the Galactic Empire theme, and you have a game of arranging your pieces to achieve tactical objectives and score VP, often wishing you had more movement actions. I think it's possible to underestimate the game after a single play - there's potential for players to concentrate on their own little objectives and ignore the bigger picture. Unusually for a euro, the game also gives you the option of targeting other players to reduce their score. Successful players will probably combine both approaches.

Further play of July 2008 prototype; streamlined scoring greatly simplifies bookeeping, and the option to pay to benefit from slander on an opponent increases the importance of money. Looking good!

A decent little game, which is very quick to set up and play. Despite its size there is a fair bit of depth to the gameplay as you really have to concentrate at times to work out how best to play your cards and place your pieces. There's also quite a bit of replay value due to the different combinations provided by the cards and 'board' pieces. By no means the greatest game you're ever going to play but it doesn't allude to being anything other than a quick game with a bit of depth so you can't really criticize it too much for that.

Described to me as 'fairly random and it basically comes down to who does best on the last round'. That would seem to largely bear out though with 2 players attacking each other (in a three player game), the outcome was determined even earlier than that.

The hand of cards is so small, that you can't plan ahead and drawing the right few cards goes a long way to determining the winner. Just awful.

Quite addictive. 'Thinky' enough without being a brain burner and at 40 minutes (2 player) it doesn't outstay its welcome. Plus it looks great and I love the theme!

I was initially worried about the 'build stuff up only to have someone steal it later' aspect but slandering only tends to happen in the last few rounds so you don't really lose too much. That's how we play anyway!

if the placement mechanic weren't in such a confined space, i think it could shine more.  the card event mechanic is very cool, unfortunately one type of card event rises quickly to the top as the important kind.  So close to awesome in 2 different aspects,  but instead falls short.

One play, with 4, provisional rating.  Love the political theme, though I found it hard to recognise that in the mechanics. I'd like to try it again with 3, making it a little faster, and with equidistant character tiles.

This isn't a bad game, but it doesn't feel like it's very well developed.  It has a puzzle aspect to it, where players are trying to manipulate the board in such a way as to match patterns against symbols on cards held in hand, and players can either work toward collecting symbols for themselves or work toward taking symbols from other players.  That part of it is fine, but it seems like playing slander cards (which take symbols from other players) should be harder than it is.  It seems weird that moving onto another player's token is as easy as just moving on to that space, especially since there's no way to defend against that sort of movement.  I get why the action is there at all -- otherwise, someone with a big lead will keep it -- but it seems like it should be harder to pull something like that off.  Also, the game feels like it would work better with more than just two players, since with that number, it's too easy to fall into a tug of war game with your opponent.  And it seems like going last is a huge advantage, and the same person goes last every turn.  I'm not really sold on the game as it is.

10,000 years in the future, humanity has claimed the stars. But all is not well. The Emperor is weak, and without strong guidance the Empire is crumbling. Powerful guilds within the empire are squabbling, positioning themselves for their own gain. If the Empire is to survive, it needs a strong leader - that means you! You must build a power base throughout the Empire by connecting with important guilds: the military, traders, priests, engineers, expansionists and politicians and then claim the throne. Time is running out though, others also struggle for the throne. You must form a network of support with powerful guilds and slandering your opponents. Each connection gains the support of some guilds, at the end of the game the player with the most support grasps the Galactic Throne. Take advantage of events that occur for further gain. Be careful though, as each slander you receive reduces your support.

Generally, an abstract game with not too much interaction.  First part of the game involves claiming tokens; second part involves taking tokens from everyone else.

There is too much down time and AP potential to make it a great game.

small simple game, nothing exceptional but it plays fine, some strategy (not much), some luck. Just wait for the correct card and set the board so to be able to play it and score points. occasionally grab points from others.
there's not much tension, probably it flows even too smoothly.

This is a big game in a small box! Tight resource collection and straight up stealing each other's majorities make for some heavy interaction on the board, but the randomness injected by the card draw and events make this much more tactical than strategic.  Interestingly, its easy to see how most of the mechanics are derived from the theme... but the game feels like a pure abstract while you're playing.  Worth a shot if you don't mind a bit of kingmaking here and there.

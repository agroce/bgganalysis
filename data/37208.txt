8/30/2011: Just played this back-to-back for 3 or 4 hours.  An excellent game.  Reminds me a bit of Condottiere, and not just because they both involve the Medici; they both have a bunch of standard 1-10 value cards, but some special cards as well.

Each game plays out quite differently.  It's very dynamic.  After about our 7th game, I made this comment: "You know, this is one of the best 'standard' card games I've ever played."  You could pretty easily play this game with a Sticheln deck, or even a standard deck of cards.  Even so, it's definitely a great buy at less than $10 a pop.

From the Reviews: A quick fun game with some interaction and a little bit of "messing" with the other play. The quick play time is appealing and it is cheap. I think this would be worth picking up. It is a card game so the wife should like that and it looks like there is some mental burn which is a plus

RATING: 8
This is a really fun, short, mean game.  Don't expect the people you play to live very long.  There's a lot of death and destruction going on in this game. 

It's full of difficult choices.  Should you make an alliance worth 16 points, even though there's already one worth 12?  When is the best time to play your minister? 
Should you play your high cards early if you have them, or plan for the future more than once.  When's the best time to play your lady in waiting?  Don't expect your joker to be living too long either.

It's a great game.

Loving exploring this game at the moment.  Its a game in which there are lots of choices but strategy is not apparent straight off.  It takes a bit to get a feel of what to do.  With that a new player facing an experienced player will flounder a little although they could quickly spot what their opponent is doing and become more competitive.

2 player card game that is actually much easier to understand than the rules make it out to be.

Fun and quick.  I can't imagine a hand lasting the 25 min listed on the box.  Excellent take-that play.  I think this will become a close competitor to Lost Cities for end-of-the-evening play time.

The cards are a little thin, but the linen finish makes them nice to handle and easy to shuffle.  The portraits and quotations on the cards don't affect the game play, but they add a pleasant distracting touch.

Keeping up with the Joneses in old Italia...

This game is a quickly played 20 minute exercise in planning a balance of two sides.

It seems to explode about 5 cards into your draw pile and the several plays I have gone through make it seem like a person with a streak of 4-5 powerful cards can pretty well put the nail in his opponents coffin.

I like this game enough to play it whenever I am asked--and I would suggest it to newer players of games however there are several other two player games that I would prefer like Rummy, Hill 218, etc.

Fascinating card game with a surprising amount of long-term strategy for such a simple set of rules. The special cards can help or hurt you immensely, and if you don't set yourself up right, you can be wiped away in just a couple of turns. I am not very good at this (I have lost every match so far) but I am still intrigued by the game. Great to travel with or bring out in public.

RATING: 7
The very first thing to strike you will be the superb artwork - credited to 'Renaissance Masters' - and then the absurdity of hiding it in such a plain box!

The next thing to strike you is that this is a rather interesting game, not least for it's unique approach to the 'two sides with the same card sets struggle for control' which we've seen so many very similar variations on since Caesar & Cleopatra kicked off the Kosmos 2 player series with a bang. 

While my first game had a rather dissapointing ending that was because my lack of experience left me unable to anticipate what was, with hindsight, an obvious winning move.  What encourages me to play more is that the game has a mechanism which enables you to address that 'obvious' move and I get a very strong impression that further plays will reveal further subtleties.  I looking forward to finding out.

Interesting little hand management game.  Pretty cool how it is up to the players as to how to control the end of the game, so you must both manipulate your points, but at the same time try to manipulate the end game so that it occurs when you're ahead on points.

In our game, there were several turns at the end where either of us could almost win, but were just a tiny bit away from finishing the job, so it made for a very tense game!

Updated 5/13/10

We've played several times now, but usually just to break the monotony of our other card games or to demonstrate the game to new players.  The mechanics are interesting, but I don't really connect with them; the card quality is mediocre; and the theme is a turn-off.  I can see why some people like it, but I'm not one of them.    

I can't really complain about a $7 card game, but with Battle Line and Parade in the house, I doubt we do anything with this other than take it out to dinner, where I'm not concerned about food spills or grease spots.

If you are looking for a small, short, simple, confrontational, cheap two-player game this is one of the best i have ever played. Only 50 cards, you can also easily play it with regular deck of cards, so you can take it everywhere. I was sceptical when i looked the first time at this game, but after i've played - i love it. It is surprisingly good for a game based only on cards with numbers.

[u]May 2009:[/u] I was eyeing this one for one year and a half, but it was always delayed... I had totally forgotten about it until I was looking for a short 2p game. I bought it right then after reading its only review, looks like a game I'd appreciate.

[u]June 2009:[/u] This one is a winner, both my gf and I LOVE this game. After 6 plays, we are still discovering and trying very hard to see how to play, as it is very counterintuitive. The game is very short, 15 min top), the cards are beautiful.
The only problem is that there is a lot of counting (perhaps even more than in Lost Cities as at each turn, you must count, how much all your nobles are worth, how much your opponent's nobles are worth + the total value of the alliance you want to defeat + the value of your conspiracy + 2 or 3 times these latter so you find where exactly you want to play... Well most of the time you do it by feel but I think with some players they'll be counting and calculating a LOT), but that doesn't bother me and nor does it bother my gf. Moreover, she is usually very prone to AP and I was afraid here she would spend her time calculating but as a matter of fact, the game goes quickly and without any downtime.

Anyway, a real gem, not easy to master and very beautiful to look at.

RATING: 4.5
This is a clever little card game that I actually admit has some depth that’s not immediately revealed after a couple of plays. Sure there is luck of the draw and which of your cards starting in the inner courtyard and such, but I do think that an experienced player will beat a novice 9 times out of 10 – so there isn’t that much luck, at least that how the game feels to me.

The special action cards add a lot to the game, and it’s important to keep track of those – if your opponent has used all of his ministers/0 cards, go ahead and make a pile of cards as they probably won’t be destroyed. If he has one of those cards left, you might consider splitting your stack up by playing the “1” special card. Also, the jester can be treacherous and hurt you more than you hurt your opponent, so watch out for that!

I like the “in your face”-mechanism; you are constantly slaughtering your opponent’s cards, and that’s always a lot of fun…! But you can even destroy your own cards, which might seem counter-intuitive, but it can be the smartest way to play if you’re ahead in points. After my first couple of plays I kind of had a “meh” feeling, but I have to admit that I actually thought about it later on, and I’m intrigued by the tactical possibilities, so I’m going to play it a couple of times more before passing my final judgment (which is probably “meh, I’ll probably just sell it”).

The fact that there is room for clever play and the take that-mechanism coupled with a play time of 15 minutes means that I could see myself play this in the future, but it’s not a favorite card game of mine (if you're not counting Summoner Wars, which is my favorite 2p card game, I also prefer card games like Star Realms to this one).

I liked this quick 2 player game! It was a little difficult at first to pick up and understand a flow to the game, but after awhile the game strategy unveils itself.  The play is very quick with some highly tactical choices and a lot of back and forth in this game. It'll fit in nice as a quick 2 player filler!

Wow, what a great 2-player card game. Do not judge this game on 1 play. Seems pretty good after several plays. But after more than 25 plays, I am still seeing more and more possibilities with every play. There are so many chances for really creative and clever play. It's quick enough to get in multiple plays in a session. When both players "get it," the contests have tremendous momentum switches and the finish can be both sudden and epic. Great replayability.

Let me start with some negatives: The rulebook isn't the best one around. It's totally possible to learn Court of the Medici from it, but it took me quite some reads until I figured out what I'm supposed to do. The other thing that I'm not particularly fond of is the artwork and card layout. I would have prefered it if the cards were more in the line of classic card games without the paintings. To me, they look just ugly. Sure, it would have killed theme completely. But to be honest: There isn't that much theme in the game at all.

Now that I've got my complaints out of the way, let's begin with the praise. Court of Medici is a really clever two player card game that get's deeper with repeated plays. The rules do just provide you with a framework that allows for some really clever card play. The more I play it, the more ways to win emerge. It's rare that two games of Court of the Medici play out the same. But this degree of creative freedom comes at a prize: You really have to play Court of Medici a few times before it starts to shine. Once you've reached that point, Court of the Medici is on par with Schotten Totten and Battle for Hill 218. Two other card games for two players I rate highly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I probably shouldn't rate this, because my one game of it lasted four or five turns - all plays to the inner court to boot the opponent.  I'm led to believe this is a degenerate case, but it occurred in our one game.  If I play it again and if it's better I'll adjust my rating likewise.

Bought this based on Joel Eddy's (Drive-thru video review) recommendation 

[[b]FirstImpression6thJAN2014[/b]] Very good game that comes in a small package. I'm surprised at how good this game is when I first tried it. When I read the rulebook, I wasn't even convinced that I'm going to like it. 

The game is very portable, and consist of only 50 cards (25 per player). The game is mathy but it isn't too much that will turn someone who doesn't like math in game, down. The math is very easy (simple addition) and done pretty quickly, unless you try to think 2-3 steps ahead. 

One thing I'm worried about is that it can be too competitive and brain burning. I'm okay with this, but since I got this game to introduce it to my mom, I suspect she might not like it. Game like Hive, where it is too chess-like, brain burning and too competitive can be a deal breaker for her. To certain extent, I sometime steer away from this kind of game too if my opponent plays it too competitively, or just too good at it.

Overall, it's a very simple game to learn, fun to play, highly strategic and very portable 2 player game. I really like it.

Court of the Medici is a two-player tug-of-war card game with a very traditional feel. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it yet. On one hand, there is certainly room for clever play, on the other it seems that most decisions aren't actually all that interesting in that they are mostly tactical and typically easily patched over in the long run. Probably needs a few more plays to fully assess, though.

Ok first thing first. There are so many ratings of this game from people who have hardly played it. Please refrain from rating a game from an ignorant viewpoint. Court of the Medici is a game that takes time to understand and subtle play is required in realtion to the complexities of rolling investments in alliances. There is no one way to play COTM I have played over 100 games now and have found that the comments relayed on the ratings of 7.5 or less are pretty well completely off. 

So my take, its a fast moving game of investment and risk dressed up in a lovely historical constume. Knowing the effects of the special cards are absolutely paramount to understanding the game. Use all your ministers early and your screwed. With this in mind it is a careful game of aliance making and destroying. The main decisions
however is whether to draw out the other player and lose some points early, when to go for the kill in the inner circle, or when to hold back in the outer circle with a hope at an scoring end game. The outer court (circle) is critical to winning regardless what the other mis-informed idiots say below. Its a great themed game where the numbers part is so easy that you have time to think about the overall approach to the game. 
Your investments are tied and can be made to tie with the opponents intimately creating a dense field for strategy and interesting, maybe even odd approaches (such as wiping an alliance you have a major stake in to push the inner court to end game to score on the outer court). This is a game with a sense of freedom that can be bewildering to begin with (much like chess), but surely enough develops into a much tighter tense game once you understand it.
The nearest thing to chess with cards, genius.

Tug-of-war card battle with the solid feel of centuries-old traditional card game. Its similarity to Scopa might explain this. Very good, and perhaps now our 2-player game of choice when stranded with nothing but a standard deck of cards.

Interesting card game with elements that make it feel like a standard deck game. Strikes me as the type of game where I could unlock loads of strategy if I played it from time to time the rest of my life. That makes me feel good. A clever card game with the potential life of a Cribbage or Rummy.

On the other hand, there are times I feel that it is complete random bollucks. When I lose I am never quite sure it was acctually because I played poorly.

UPDATE: 
My impression about the potential of this game has proven correct. As I play more and more, my opinion of the game continues to rise. Unlocked a new strategy on my 40th play that may completely change the way I approach this game. It is a card game, so there is some luck. But it is unique in that each player has their own, identical deck. You will, by game's end, have the same cards available to you as your opponent. It's all about who uses them the best.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2011)

It´s been a while since I played this. I remember I didn’t like it as much as I thought I would. The theme is very boring (for me) and it is pasted on the game. I remember the game has very simple rules but the decisions needed in the game were not that interesting.

To be honest I don´t remember a lot about Court of the Medici.  I will play it again soon to properly comment on it and to decide if I will hang onto my copy of the game.

Current Rating: 5.0

I finally played it again. I have read some comments that the game is deep but I don’t see it. It has lots of luck (luck of the draw) but perhaps it can be controlled, still the decisions seem rather obvious.  The rules are very badly written, they confound a lot for such a simple game.

The game plays very fast, perhaps this is its main virtue (and perhaps it can be a, somewhat, deep game for a 12 minute play).

Bottom line, I don’t enjoy it so I’m getting rid of it ASAP.

I was surprised that this is as good a filler as it is.  It languished on my shelf for years and then I pulled it out one night.  Games have some nice choices and play time is closer to 5-10 minutes than 25 min.  A nice little game for "one more time".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow. For a numbers game, it's wide open. There are tactics, game changing flow, risk, and strategy. A neat two player game and it was a strategic war.

On first reading the rules, I'd thought eh; I couldn't see much in it. However, after playing 3 cards solo...I saw a huge decision tree and flexibility in play.

The first game with my buddy was tense, strategic, balanced, tight, vicious, and fun. There is a lot of thought and game in here. 

I love the real world paintings for the portraits (and the names of the actual artists being on the cards). The fact that you know there are 2 of every card, but only one of the Duke gives you a lot of control in how you play and protect or annihilate the nobles at your whim. 

There are a ton of combos you can use. I am impressed. A great game for 10 bucks (U.S.); it has joined my 2 player bin for constant travel--it's nustled right up with "The Battle for Hill 218", "Blue Moon", "Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation", and "Travel Ingenious" in my trunk.

A tentative first play rating: 8.

Two-player card game where cards are simply laid on the table. You can group cards together to join their strengths in an alliance or create an alliance for the purpose of eliminating opponent cards from the table (called a conspiracy). For such simple game play, there are a couple of wrinkles that make the game interesting: you can ally with your opponents cards, which complicates eliminations, also 3 cards have special abilities that are perfectly powered, have interesting effects, and are crucial to good play. Good tactical little game. The only issue is that sometimes it gets to feeling a little too much tit-for-tat.

Might revise the score higher with more playing. I have to admit as I get older memory type games are less and less appealing.  I never had a good head for it.  I suspect one with a good memory and who enjoys strategy would enjoy this game more.  I also suspect though that luck has some role to play, particularly in the creation of the "inner-court".  Did some nice tricks early on and probably could have won the game at some crucial points if I had been paying attention.  The fact I had a hard time paying attention doesn't bode well for the game though ;).

A cutthroat two-player filler. Quite an aggressive little card game, in which you win by taking your opponent's points off the table. Not for the faint of heart.

For me, though, there isn't enough variety here to get this one to the table.

The game might be great (I hope it is) but it is a letdown to open the box and find an incomplete standard deck of cards (a bit nicer graphics, very little text added, but it's actually a standard deck with two Aces missing.) So this is a game perfectly playable with a standard deck of cards (one player is with the black symbols and the other one is with the red symbols) but this box of cards can't be used for other games with a standard deck. I would have liked it more to have been published something like "A set of 52 beautifully illustrated cards with rules for a brand new, great card game called The Court of the Medici!".

Meh, don't much care for this game.  I'd much rather play Battleline/Schotten Totten in the same time frame although the two games don't really compare.  In this one you are going to be playing cards to remove opposing nobles from the court and certain low value nobles have special powers.  There are some neat interactions in the game with how the joker works and the ladies in waiting and such effect the game, but ultimately it just left me feeling a bit flat afterwards.  Perhaps not enough there???

Very tense from the beginning on.  My first games of Summoner Wars were quite boring, compared to this game, even though SW has grown on me.

Extremely tactical, with combinations that you have to devise by yourself.  This brings nice "ah! ah!" moments, where you enjoy outwitting your opponent, or where you think "how can I have missed that?".  The beauty of it, compared to a game like Magic: tG, is that the simplicity of the mechanisms forces to be more creative in your tactics.  It is hard to plan on the long term (unlike in Schotten-Totten), though.

Very cutthroat, with lots of attacks and blood spilled.

Comparable to Schotten-Totten/Battleline, for the tenseness, the quick play time (Court of the Medici is even shorter), and the tactical play. ST/Battleline has more strategy, though.

I like how the game teaches lessons easily: I like to know why we lost, so as to learn. Examples: never forget that the next play of your opponent can be a Minister that wipes you out of the Inner Court and ends the game; near the end of your deck, you must generally make sure that you have a high card at the bottom of the deck (Prepared for the Future) and that the board situation is not too bad for you, because having to do both at the last minute can be hard.

Very quick: 5-10 minutes, not more than 25 minutes: very convenient.

RATING: 5
This seemed like another nice, portable card game that we could always throw into a bag and take with us.  The rules were surprisingly hard to wrap our heads around---we had to read the rules several times before we could start playing.  It's not that the gameplay is hard, it's just that the concepts are pretty unique and new, which makes it hard to envision before you start playing.

It took us a couple of plays to get into it, but it's a quick, vicious little game.  The artwork is evocative of the theme and you can imagine groups of nobles getting together to assassinate other groups.  There are just enough special cards that break up what otherwise would just be a numbers game---although, because it is a numbers game, the game doesn't feel too "mean".  Do you keep your groups small and avoid attracting too much attention?  Do you try to grow them big after you smoke out the Minister?  Do you join forces with the other side to protect yourself?  Lots of decisions packed into a small deck of cards.  There's a lot to explore---for example, we still haven't gotten used to playing cards on each other's side yet.

These rules make my head hurt. Have not played this yet.

Update: The rules are terrible. It looks like there was more to this game that was taken out. Terms are used without being defined - 'Alliance' is used to define 'Alliance! The 2 END GAME conditions are listed in 2 different places in the rules - would have been handy if both had been listed in the Game End subsection.

Having played, it looks to be something of a memory game, and without experience it seems that the 2nd player will win (experience may teach us how to kill the 2nd player earlier on). I generously rate this a '5' because I assume that something more is here than is yet clear, and shall try it again soon to explore further.

Weight: Light
Duration: 15-45 minutes
Notes:
card-counting strategy is useful



Court of the Medici is a simple 2 player head-to-head card game. In it, a deck of cards is split identically between two players. Several cards are placed into the middle of the table and act as the inner court of the Duke of Tuscany. Both players are attempting to control the court and and win more favor than the other player by playing cards into their own court to score points, cancel out opponent cards (assassinate them) or tag onto them for protection. The game plays out as a play-one/draw-one format until all cards are played or the inner court cards are all removed from the game.

This game is strangely fun and becomes addicting once the rules are fully known. The biggest hang-up for new players will be coming to terms with the role of the 8 initial cards sitting up in the inner court: they are simply an effective timer for the game; once all those cards are removed from play, the game ends. This game is also ultra-portable with just a small deck of cards and the rules. In fact, this is so portable, that you can substitute cards from a standard card deck and just assign the roles out to the various card values.

One upside to this game is the replayability, largely grounded in the surprising amount of strategy and tactical decisions underneath the simple game mechanics. Once you start playing cards on top of opponent cards and leveraging the inner court as a game timer, you can actually try to make plans on how you want to win. Also, even if a player gets quite a ways ahead, the game is never over as points can swing wickedly quick with a timely assassination or two.

One downside to this game is the tacked-on theme. The cards are artful, taken from actual historical pieces, and the abilities of the cards do make sense, but really you can play this game without the theme and it's just fine. I personally prefer the thin veneer of a theme that it has, but others may feel it is too tacked on.

Very pretty cards with some interesting quotations on them, and an earnest attempt to paste a theme of courtly intrigue onto what is apparently a much older abstract game. This could have been done better if the rulesheet had been produced with more flair. Tactics as far as I can tell seem to boil down to figuring out what's least likely to be in your opponent's hand, which makes the game mostly consist of an exercise in mental arithmetic plus a guessing game, at least for those (like me) too lazy to count cards.

The description calls this a casual card game but really it's not. It does play fast. You really need to pay attention to what's going on. There's a certain tension and at times you're really just at the mercy of your opponent's cards. I found it intriguing, fun? not so sure about.

RATING: 5.5
A short fast game for sure. Autoplay in the first three/four rounds. After that the game gets interesting and because the Inner Circle ending conditions forces the player with the least points on the table to play creatively, this forces the other player to play creatively too.

Now playing with an open discard pile, because my opponents and I are not that good in card counting. This way the game is at least as deep as schotten totten/battle line, but time per turn increases slightly.

RATING: 5
Play cards to form conspiracies and eliminate opponent's conspiracies, for most points.

Plays: More than a dozen?
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family game = A game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 15 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Low – card draw from two identical decks.

Replayability: High, it’s quick so why not go again? 
Fun: Not so high. The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management, but the best play each turn seems fairly obvious and there is little opportunity for planning ahead as your cards are easily eliminated.
Memorability: Low.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Very good, renaissance card art and quotes from Macchiavelli.

Who will like this: People that want an alternative to Battle Line. It's cheap, portable, quick to play and easy to learn but lacks the tactical depth of Battle Line.

What a vicious little game. Really different. Very nice cards, both for the artwork and flavor texts. The box is either a little too big or a little too small. What were they thinking? A reading of the rules leaves you wondering just how the game works. A couple of examples of game play would have helped me get into the game much more readily. There should at least be some warning about not expecting your cards to stick around for long! After a couple plays, add in the Duke for even more nerve-wracking fun. [12 plays]

[url=http://geekdo.com/article/edit/4876612]Full review[/url]

My verdict is that this is by far one of the best 2 player card games I have encountered. It has a classic feel which I can appreciate - the theme works very well as do the special cards. In a strange way for me the game feels like the bastard child of [thing=2655][/thing] and [thing=760][/thing] played like [thing=15889][/thing] – and all those three games are excellent by themselves. The game has much less luck than people think, and there's many ways to victory. Everyone who has come to boardgames through classic card games or is looking for an aggressive 2-player game should try Court of the Medici – and you should try it 20 times before you make up your mind if you like it or not. I have little doubt it will be my most played game in 2010. Final word: Down with the Gonzagas!
-----------

9.5/10 (-0,5 for that ridiculous box and the poor rules).

RATING: 6
What at first reads like a deep, quite strategic game unfolds very differently - a setup that sometimes can be really unbalanced and then one vicious attack after another. Both players possessing an equivalent deck of cards doesn't mean that much: with relatively small hands (five cards) and playing out one card each turn to draw another one immediately afterwards it often comes up to what is available in the hand and what currently lies on the table - it's possible to keep cards for later on during the round, but planning in a more or less exact way is extremely difficult, and defensive play is virtually impossible.

The learning curve in Court of the Medici is long and rather steep - if the game isn't given proper thought but only played lightly it will possibly stay a glorious chaos. Otherwise it will (quite gradually) grow on the players.

By the way, the artwork is exquisite.

[b]Court of the Medici[/b] was sold via auction 4/25/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]The more I played the less interested I got in playing again. It also is an extremely cutthroat and confrontational game and that's not typically the kind of game my family enjoys. So finally after months of sitting on my shelf unplayed I decided to sell my copy. 

Since I have so many card games I love in our collection this isn't one I will miss, but if anyone ever wanted to play I would happily get trounced.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Awesome, confrontational 2p card game.
- This would make an excellent cafe game.
- Plays really quick (about 15 minutes per game).
- Excellent riff on trick taking, I love how there are only 3 cards with special abilities.
- Another game where you can play on your opponents side of the board (in their court).
- The tension is ratcheted up because it is very difficult to get a new card into the inner court in an empty space. You really need to protect some of those cards.[/i]

RATING: 6
A weird little 2 player, with almost a Cassino feel at the start which quickly morphs away, where you're almost marking time waiting for the special powerful cards to come out, killing off stuff as you go, waiting for end-game situations to emerge and manipulate. Basically, you can add any card to any pile, and if the total value of the new pile equals an existing card or pile, you can kill it off, which you especially might want to do if the killed pile contains only your opponent's cards or, if it's mixed, your opponent's contribution to that pile has been more than yours. Piles are either in the inner circle or the outer circle. If you have higher valued cards in the outer than your opponent, you want to kill off all the piles in the middle and end the game, as your higher score will win. If you don't, then you want to preserve and expand the number of cards in the inner circle until you get a chance to kill off your opponent's cards in the outer or play more high value cards to the outer yourself. All the while trying to ensure that your own cards aren't stacked in big valued piles by themselves that are easily killable - all of which can require some thought. There's a couple of special cards that allow you to manipulate piles, either auto-killing them or splitting them up, and keeping track of these is crucial. In fact counting down both yours and your opponent's decks is probably crucial so that you know exactly what they've got left and therefore what piles they can kill if it goes down to the end-game and all the cards come out. You're playing with identical decks, so you're aiming to make slightly better use of your cards if you can, or hope / plan that you have the right cards in hand when opportunities for a big kill emerge. The game has some things to think about, but the free-wheeling nature (play anywhere) and the need to count down (otherwise it's pretty random) drags it back down the entertainment levels for me and I'm not sure it fills neatly into a spouse type niche due to the lack of clarity as to what is good play from the get-go. Which could be an attraction to gamers, but not me in this case.

Nice game! Really enjoyed the first two games I played. It quickly revealed that there's a lot of strategic potential and the game is strongly inclined to very tense cut-throat gaming! Fast action in small bursts of 10 to 15 minutes which is an awesome playtime for this amount of fun!

After a few more plays I might actually up the score.

- Instructions are horribly tough to chew and are a great danger to this game being prematurely dismissed!

Awesome card game. Though this concept could be played with regular cards, and the game is pretty much just adding numbers, the court intrigue theme feels very appropriate. Do not play this if you are not into direct conflict, as this game is all about messing your opponent's plans while furthering yours, and weaving your nobles with his/hers nobles to attain supremacy.

RATING: 6
Well despite a simple ruleset and having a traditional feel in the way cards are captured (or rather disposed), the card play is mainly freefrom and as such there is no intuitive guidance on tactics: definitely after the second game (with the correct rules) this is a card counting, number crunching and speculating venture. So this looseness and continual numerical assessment makes it too opaque (thanks Pat) and hard 'left brain' work for the casual player (though the cards are nice and theme feels there), and the following game of Jaipur highlighted this impression.

Update: another play reveals some interesting elements underneath the simple mechanics but the maths still overides the experience.

RATING: 6.33
This is a small card game by the same designer as Lords of Scotland, and though I prefer Lords of Scotland (it's superb!), this game is still okay.  This is actually an earlier release, and can be quite a bit more mathy.  Hi-level, you can play cards to stack ontop of ANY cards (both yours and your opopnents) in this two-player game.  Everytime you make a stack that exactly equals the total of another card or stack of cards, you can force the other card/stack to be discarded immediately.  This leads to some only partially controlled chaos and quite a lot of twists.  There are also three special cards that really shake things up (one that discards any entire stack it is played to, one that unstacks all cards in a stack it joins, and one that actually has a varying value that can both help and hurt you in equal portions).

It's fun, but if you've liked this and haven't tried Lords of Scotland as well, I highly recommend you give it a try too.

For a lightweight little card game (that you can play with a normal deck of cards), this is s decent effort. The arithmetic is light and doesn't weigh you down. The problem lies in the gameplay - there's not a lot of interesting decisions to be made once you've cracked a sort of best play formula.

I've played many games of this and I still can't articulate why I feel it's so good. What sounds like a simple, though obtuse, card game is actually a fairly deep tactical slugfest.

First impression, excellent game of tactics strictly for 2. Lots of brain burning for its duration. Just wonderful. I like the color scheme, the illustrations and the whole looks of it. It's also very portable.

UPDATE> The thing I love the most about Court of the Medici is the fact that I get the feeling that despite it's a card game luck isn't a factor at all. It's quite an achievement for such a small ruleset.

UPDATE> After dozens of sessions, most of them one after another, I think that it's a great game. Hasn't lost its interest and on the contrary I am discovering more tactics the more I play.

Mathy 2p cardgame that makes me think of a watered-down Khmer. Each player has an identical deck of numbered cards which are played to the centre of the table, either alone or added to an existing stack. Cards added to an existing stack can be used to "conspire", i.e. eliminate another stack with a total equal to that of the conspiracy. Other special cards can be used to break apart or to destroy large stacks.

The result is a pleasantly opaque blend of bluff and strategy where playing on opponents' stacks is usually better than playing on your own. Play is surprisingly deep, though the requirement to match stack values can make the luck of the card draw frustrating. Good game.

[Z-man 2009 edition] {couple, Renaissance; hand management}  Count of the Medici is a nice 2p game.  Player interaction is very strong and planning is important.  It is too brutal for my wife's taste as players have to break or destroy opponent's alliance on and on during the game.  It's fun and full of surprises.  Luck of draw is minor and players are rewarded for their clever plays.  A nice game, giving its price.

The quality of cards isn't great.  However, the illustration is nice, which save the game from being abstract.

Renaissance themed two player card game where the gameplay is both simple and deep. From a hand of five cards you have to place 'nobels', each containing a numeric value. By placing cards onto other cards you can form alliances, which combines the cards' value, or you can form a conspiracy, which removes an alliance of equal value. By cleverly placing your own cards and removing your opponent's cards from the game is the route to victory as whoever has the greatest combined value of cards left in play at the end is the winner. Games vary greatly from one another, which is often a failing of card games, and strong tactical play is rewarded.

2 plays so far.  Interesting card play.  I wonder how many games to discover all the tricks.  A touch of a numbers game but you can jazz it up by using the card names to give it some flavor.

A really great gift from our Secret Santa 2010.  Been very well and considering replacing it as the cards are becoming tatty. 

****A keeper until it completely falls apart!

An interesting little card filler, that plays quickly and offers some interesting decisions.

I'm not sure exactly how much the game plays itself, but based on the first few plays, it has promise.

Another game where you duel it out with numbered cards (think Battleline, Lost Cities, Balloon Cup, Caesar and Cleopatra, etc.). I love the artwork but it doesn't show itself superior otherwise.

RATING: 5
It's a weird game.  From the rules, there isn't apparently much going on.  However, with repeated plays, the nuances begin to emerge and it's rather addictive.  It's a simple game of numbers and the theme is "pasted on."  However, somehow as the alliances form and break... as the ladies-in-waiting do their work in the inner court, the theme begins to shine through.  The quality of the card stock and the artwork make this one of the best values in gaming.  I picked up my copy from Tanga for $5.  Amazing deal.  One can play the game with normal cards, but why when it's so rich for $5?

I enjoy this, but the rule sheet isn't as clear as it could be.  The rules seem...maybe "lacking" is the right word.  There is a review on here that cleared most of that up.  Quick, but still fun.

Fascinating modern variation on the fishing card game mechanic (see also Casino and Scopa). You can play with a standard deck of cards, but the commercial versions adds a nice touch of theme.

It seems simple, even plain, but the more you play the more you see that this has tons of strategy and tactics.  An excellent game! And all in 10 minutes or less. Now, what games compare???

RATING: N/A
Nice theme which, a bit surprisingly, isn't totally pasted on but actually works with the mechanics quite well. Too early to rate but looks like a 7; this is basically a number-crunching card game.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly engaging little card game. Surprising in that it's a very simple numbers-oriented game where placing a card that brings the total of one stack to the same total as another allows the elimination of the second stack. Depspite this rather simple, mathy premise, the thin theme (aided by nice graphics and art) hold up and the special-power cards throw in enough wrinkles that Court of the Medici is quick, interesting and tense. A very solid offering from Z-Man, and one of the few card games that's been good enough to enter my play rotation in some time.

RATING: 7
So so graphics on very durable cards. Definitely a game that takes more than 1 or 2 games to get a feeling for the strategic possibilities. Avoiding setting up your opponent while increasing your options are key to succeeding at this game. Should have a good level of replayability.

RATING: 8
Court of the Medici is a brilliant tactical tug-of-war, bu it can be bewildering for newbies.  I was fairly bewildered as to what would be a good play my first few tries, so I was pretty much doing stuff on the fly with little thought to my next actions, pushing through my deck trying to suss out what differentiates a good play from a bad one.  But the game does blossom with experience.

Between this and Lords of Scotland, Richard James might be the most underrated game designer working today.

RATING: 5
Building up your own court's prestige and power while tearing down your opponent's. Simple rules with emergent strategies; lots of ways to use the card interactions to get what you want in the game.

Enjoy it more with a regular deck of cards with no theme. The Medici political drama theme is so poorly represented that nothing is better. Literally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Neat little two-player card game. It feels like an abstract game, something like Tzaar or Dvonn, but with cards. You're making stacks of cards and and trying to destroy your opponent's cards in the pursuit of having the highest value cards on the table by the end of the game. The catch is that nothing is safe because you each have cards that can destroy an entire stack or separate a stack, making the individual cards vulnerable to attack.

Such a great 2 player card game.  You really have to think about your next move.  It seems really easy, but it really involves a lot of strategy.  Great game in a small package.

Too early to put a rating on this after three plays, but it looks promising. First play was chaotic and bloody, but the next two where significantly more defensive and tactical. I see great potensial in this little big card game.

Update (rating: 8): This is great. So many options and ways to play. I haven't grasped half of them, but it's a great time.

One of those delicious little things. 15 minutes of concentration. As play started, that tickling 'oh' the brain makes. 

This could be as good as Khmer. Needs more play.

CotM is a terrific, tactical, two-player card game.  

In effect, it's a race to clear the table of certain cards and have the highest total points remaining on the table when you do so.  No two games are alike: some take the whole deck to finish, others are over in a few swift moves.  Delicious (dare I say "meaty?") game of back-and-forth, distraction, planning, and agression.

CotM does extremely well for 2P what [i]Condottiere[/i] does for 3-5P.  So well that I suspect as word spreads, it will supplant [i]Lost Cities[/i] as the go-to card game for gamer couples.  

As usual, Z-Man has done a fantastic job at production.

With fantastic art, a simple concept, and addicting gameplay, this is the best card game of 2009.

I may be missing something here, but we've played it a couple times and I'm just not convinced. If nothing else, I really dislike the destructive nature of the game. It makes everything feel vaguely meaningless, and I vastly prefer games in which I am able to build something.

An excellent two-player game that (as many others have said) requires a handful of games to appreciate.

After two games, we were unimpressed. After ten games, it has become a favorite. New tactics emerge with every play. My rating continues to rise.

(July 2014 - after 1 session of 4 games) - We were told it took 3-5 games for this one to click and the game to shine.    I think we got there.   Interesting concept.   A little more card counting than I like, but . . . .it has a place.

Ultra-short mean little game where you compete to kill each others' courtiers. Swingy, fun, and slightly odd. It lasts between five and fifteen minutes, which means it can't outstay its welcome.

This is another game to add to the tug-of-war 2-player genre, and while it may not take the crown away from some of the senior games in this category (Schotten-Totten, I'm looking in your direction...), it certainly has its own subtleties and challenges.  It's a simple, standard idea -- draw a card, play a card -- with a simple rule set, but the choices you can make are a lot deeper than the rules suggest.  There's a nice balance between taking the offense or defense, and there are interesting tactics to try based on those balances, but there's no way really to set up for killer moves, because there's always a way to break apart the sets of cards.  It's very intriguing, and thought-provoking, and I look forward to more plays of this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
OK game. The random setup makes it entirely possible that one player will be so far behind as to be impossible to catch up. Still, in those situations, the game only ought to last about 5 minutes, so that makes it more tolerable than other games where the setup can screw you. Its quick play is one of its greatest strengths, but when it comes down to it, if I have 5 minutes and a deck of cards, I think there are several traditional games that are more fun.

I got it because it was 5 euro and the guys at Z-man waved a shiny tote-bag in front of me. It is pretty cool though. Duelling card game that plays in less than 20 mins. I am trying really hard to see the strategy in it, but so far it seems quite simple and shallow.

Opposing families in Florence card duel for dominance. Identical decks with values and game play changing abilities. Play to the inner or outer court, play in opponents inner court as a conspiracy. When one side loses all inner court nobles, highest card value total wins. Interesting play choices and strategy for card game connoisseurs. Dig the renaissance portrait art. Advantage for card counters. Protect your high value cards with alliances. Takes a few plays to grasp.

I kickstarted this game because of the lovely watercolor art, and because it deals with tea!  I drink so much tea it would be a crime not to own this!  

While I know it isn't a game my husband would enjoy playing, I suspect that my mother and sister will love it both for the art and the simplicity.

I've played two games of it at my library board game night.  It went over well, and was a lot of fun!

I thought this would be a fun theme for my 11yo daughter (coincidence!). After one play, it's a cute enough little game. Basically a jacked-up version of the kids' game Trash that's played with a regular deck, with a sprinkling of Love Letter thrown in for flavor. We dialed the theme to 11 (no pun intended!) by playing with preposterously bad English accents, taking on the roles of Mrs. Nesbitt and Ms. Lilian Peru.

Quaint little hand management card game where you're actually setting up a spread, using various tea-related cards like biscuits and cakes to have opponents swap cards, look at their hands, etc. Not a lot to it, but it has a charm for my GF who is really into stuff like 'High Tea' and the period in which this is set.

What I honestly love the most about this game is that if you just see the box on the shelf, you might not be moved to pick it up, or buy it for that matter. HOWEVER once someone gets a copy in front of your face and you either play or see it played, you are hooked.

Who knew a game about an afternoon tea could be so fun. Glad to say that now I DO!

Some clever ideas, but not sure enough to be a game I would request.  The special guest cards sounded cool, but they just seem so random, as if you are going to be able to manipulate the board enough to complete them, you are probably going to win the round anyways.  Glad to have tried, but probably not something I would want to play often.  This is a pretty mean game btw...

It's a game about being a 1920s society lady and putting on the best tea party - what's not to like?

I think this is a pretty good little game, but it seems to be dwindling with my opponents pretty quickly.

The Special Guests are a pretty good addition to the base game.  They add just enough variety to be included occasionally.

RATING: N/A
Although cute and with a great theme this little beauty felt very unbalanced the times we played it and to much seemed to be based on luck in drawing cards for me to feel pleased with it. The Solitaire version is much better but has a short lifespan too so none of them will stay in my collection.

RATING: 3
While it's a fresh and cute thematic attempt, the game itself is a rather plodding, uninteresting affair.   Each round is pretty much the same, and there's really nothing much interesting ever going on.   No desire to play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I really wanted to like this, but sadly found the gameplay to be rather bland. The cards don't combo well together, and aren't varied enough to provide many different possibilities on your turn. For example, nearly half the cards tell you to either look at your opponent's hand, look and take a card, or allow your opponent to do the same to you. The end result is a game where it seems like you are just doing the same thing over and over again, which gets really old really fast. We ended our first play early because we were all bored. Too bad! I love the theme and the artwork.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

The art and theme are adorable (I'm not too proud to admit that's what drew me to it in the first place), and this game is almost certainly not at its best with 2 (when there's only one player to mess with, it gets that icky, predictable zero sum sort of feeling)... but I'm not really sure how much it has going for it.

I guess it just feels weird to me to have this light filler game so reliant on content memorization. I have no doubt that you could make some pretty clever plays if you were really familiar with the deck... but why would I want to put the effort into that when there are so many games of this type that feel clever and exciting from game one? 

Honestly, despite its simplicity the game started out feeling kind of like a chore - it just feels like there's SO much to consider when you take the content of the cards into account... I think for this "genre" I'd rather just have something with one really, really engaging choice per turn rather than something with this huge amount of forward planning. You could probably run into AP with this game, for real.

Anyway I would be curious to try it with another player but at this point I don't have very high hopes.

I do so love this theme and the aesthetic, though. It kills me. It really does.

A little like Love Letter...Deluxe? It's a fun, tea theme and really feels as dainty as the theme would suggest. I LOVE LOVE when the game feel delivers on it's thematic promise. I got this from Elevenses. I wanted to don my long white gloves and talk with sophistication. We played it again and again when we first had it. The backs of the cards are just a tad dizzying.

This game is a delight. My and my partner's first game ended in a tie. The rule book instructed us to "kiss each other on the cheek to celebrate your shared victory," and he said, "Well that's the cutest damn thing I've ever heard."

Only caveat is that the rule book refers to all players using "she"/"her" pronouns, which could be disturbing for male or nonbinary players who don't want to be misgendered. If that's not a concern and the theme appeals to you, however, give it a try!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
I'm considering my rating here to be preliminary as we've only tried it 2-player and I suspect it's much stronger with 3 or 4. In particular the swapping cards aspect doesn't click very well with just one opponent.

Regardless, this is an interesting game of memory, card manipulation, and deciding the right time to "go out" by ringing the bell. It's a sweet little theme that is going to be particularly attractive to the Anglophiles out there.

I like the quick playtime. This feels like it will make a nice alternative to Love Letter as a filler. Side note: there is no reason not to play the advanced version right away. It gives some real direction to what could otherwise be an aimless enterprise.

Well-themed micro game with humorous "high tea" theme, matching artwork, and "table spread" mechanics.  Interactive, light, and yet room for hand management decisions.  Cute little filler, can drag a little with 4, best with 2-3 players.

Second edition makes this change: suggested end score is now 5 cubes, not 7

Includes Special Guests expansion (almost essential, after you're familiar with the basic game; gives new objectives to work with, and the hidden information is welcome) which is a nice addition.

Athough it is seemingly a "light" filler, it is clunky and takes a while to get comfortable with how to use the card mechanics to one's advantage.  It also seems pretty easy to get bogged down or even locked by a bad initial hand or poor card positions. Would play again, but this is certainly would not be my first choice for a filler.

RATING: 5
This is a nice little card game however both myself and my b/f both felt its missing something. The game just bobs along nicely, not really taxing you or asking very much at all and then its over. 

Seven sugar cubes for a victory is also a little high as the game outstays its welcome somewhat.

Contains an essential expansion for Elevenses that adds a little hidden information so you cannot immediately tell if you are in the lead and thus should play elevenses. 
I never play without this, but it would be nice if there were more than the 6 characters

Initial Rating: 4.0 (September 2014)

I’m disappointed. I bought it because it had a very unusual theme, although, being honest, I really don’t care for it. Sadly the gameplay isn’t very good. 

At first I thought the game could be fun because it has a memory element and a spatial element BUT the best plays are painfully obvious, all players attack the current leader AND it has lots of uncontrollable luck (the player who drew the better cards and was attacked the least will win). The game was very boring for me, so playing it up to 7 VPs was too much time for me, that is, the game is too long for what it offers.

I never played with the guest mini expansion.

Good art though.

I will get rid of my copy ASAP. I don’t think I will ever play Elevenses again.

Elevenses is a really enjoyable, unique card game which has a lot of variety and things going on even though each person only has 11 cards.  I really like how the special powers and points are balanced.  The lower scoring points provide some great powers, but very few points...while the higher scoring points have awful powers that hurt you, but give you huge points.  It's a great, light weight card game.

The game of morning tea, each player is trying to put on the best morning tea within their social group. They do this by layout out their spread, which they do by playing cards to set positions. 

The trick is that they do not know where many of their cards start the game as they are faced-down and only by playing cards to key positions will they gain access to other cards. 

The game is largely driven by playing a card and then taking advantage of its power. High powered cards offer fewer spoon symbols and vice versa. Spoons are important because the total number of spoons determines who put on the best morning tea each round. 

The theme is very engaging and the gameplay is interesting but not so deep that you will  be exploring new things after 20 plays. 

A nice filler. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The special guests are really a mini-promo that sees each player receive a Special Guest each round. These serve as something of a 'round-based goal' as they will offer additional spoons to a player's total if certain cards feature in a player's spread. 

I wouldn't play without them as they add that little extra element to give the players another objective.

1920s tea party with cards! Also it fits in the pocket of my coat. 
(translation: addictive)

In my opinion it has a nice balance of completing personal goals vs. interaction with other players (and you actually end up with another player's cards very often because of 'pass to the right/left' actions).

A cute and quick memory game. The rules are not explained very clearly, and we ran into a situation where it wasn't explained at all. Also, it doesn't take long for everyone at the table to work out the only effective strategy, and then the game becomes very unvaried with each additional play with the same people.

A cutthroat competition to put on a respectable morning tea and collect sugar cubes?  Sounds about right, and a wonderful balance of messing with the other players or risking your own spread for a better chance at winning.

Brilliant stuff! A push-and-shove tableau-building card game, full of timing and to-and-fro. The real winners are the gloriously British theme (and if you're not British and play this game without pretending to be British, then you're not human) and the rule which states tied players must kiss each other on the cheek. This makes tied games remarkably rare in my experience...

It's fun.  A little bit of tactics and a lot of luck in which cards come up or you are forced to switch with others.  It scratches the same itch as Love Letter, but with more overhead and explanation.  So it's good for a change-up to people familiar with both, but wears out its welcome sooner than the extremely streamlined Love Letter.  I'll play it, but I don't need to own it.

RATING: 9.5
Cute, cuddly but nasty little card game. The theme is deceptive: 1920s London socialites competing for the best "tea spread," it can quickly turn violent. Simple yet thematic, Elevenses employs a balance between strategy and the randomness of the cards your opponents activate. Again, a nice break after big, heavy Euros.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It feels like a game that was produced because the core mechanic was of potential interest to players because it's a bit different. While true, that interest wasn't enough to bind me into repeat plays. Play a card down into its set position, pick up the card it replaced, and do the action relating to the played card's position. These provide various options of passing a card right or left, or re-arranging cards in your hand/tableau, aiming to keep a hand of playable cards with actions that will help you. Aim to get as many high valued cards out as fast as possible, and then get the round-closer out to score. Other players will upset your hand so sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. Play repeat rounds if you like, but I wasn't entranced.

Elevenses is somewhat of a Love Letter killer for me.  It takes a little longer time wise as well as a bit more table space, but it is still comfortably in the filler range.  It contains a little hand management with a unique twist along with a bit of deduction and a healthy dose of screw your neighbor.  I found it fun, but it does overstay its welcome by just a tad.

I enjoy this game but feel that each round requires "a lot of work"  to potentially only outscore your opponents by one point. I would prefer a scoring system which rewards 5,3,1 points each round for first, second and third place with a higher end game scoring goal.

A beautifully illustrated game, with fairly simple Love Letter's play one/pick one mechanics set in a fancy dinner party setting.  While I enjoyed it, the other players felt it ran a little long with the default rules, and thought it bordered on being a little too hostile for the seemingly dainty theme.  A good bargain for the price, however, at $15 MSRP, given the high quality components and easy travel size.  Probably won't replace LL or Lost Legacy as the micro game of choice for our group, but it is a nice change of pace, and I found the premise charming enough to justify repeat plays.

A successful round seems to hinge upon your elevenses card being in a position where you can pick it up by placing your fourth scoring card. If you have to fish for it you'll fall behind. If you are forced to turn over one of your scoring cards you'll fall behind.

Nice artwork. Nice idea. Just not much fun.

RATING: 6
Cute card game themed after giving a tea party. Each player has the same 11 numbered cards, 3 in hand, 8 laid face down in two rows. Playing a card into its specified location activates its ability and allows the player to pick up the card in its place. Face-up cards provide 0-3 spoons; the highest total spoon power when any player plays their "Elevenses" card and ends the round gets 2 points.

There are a lot of nice touches here, like the fact that the powerful 1 and 10 do not allow you to pick up replacement cards (reducing options in the late game). TJ Lubrano's artwork is gorgeous. There's enough tactical depth there that decisions take some thought.

That said, at this point I still can't tell whether the decisions are actually meaningful or merely provide the illusion of strategy. There isn't much control at all: the main reason why a lucky draw won't win every time is all the chaotic card swapping that goes on; the second is that an early leader will be punished by the card that turns one of theirs face down.

The included Elevenses: Special Guests expansion (each player has a goal, have the 3 specified cards face-up for a bonus) adds another element to card choice, but I worry that the guests provide enough advantage that chasing them could be a strategic no-brainer.

Goes a bit long.

Elevenses sure scores high marks on uniqueness of theme and game play - however,  it all sounds better in theory, than it works in actuality. 

The game has some merit,  but there are so many better card fillers out there,  that this one may remain in your cupboard.  In the end,  it is nothing more than average - but since it is different and it is called elevenses - I will give it a 5.5

I like the art and theme, but the gameplay has some minuses:

1. It seems the most important strategy is "draw the better cards." (2-3 teaspoon, or Tea Trolley).

3. Takes too long for how simplistic of a game it is, particularly with 4P.

I had never heard of this game before I played it, so that certainly sparked my interest in it. I'm indifferent about the theme. I like tea, but as a theme, whatever (but it doesn't hurt).

When it comes to gameplay, I would describe it as subtle and elegant in its chaos. I didn't have the idea I had that much influence on the game's outcome. Getting the '4' card (that allows you to peek at your face-down cards) on the table is GREAT. I guess there were tactical moments with cards that allow you to pass cards, but beyond that... It's really just a race to quickly play 4 'regular' cards, the '1' card and the '10' card and then finish it off as soon as you can, which is overall not that amazing to me. But it played quickly and didn't outstay its welcome that much, so I'm glad I tried it at least.

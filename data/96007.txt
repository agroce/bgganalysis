This is a dense game with high addictive factor. 
It's a brain burner, resource management, multiplayer solitaire that feels like a race ... type of game. 

It's a two player game. With more it would be insane (too long, too big, too much to track), I wouldn't try it.

- - - - - - - - - - - 

The expansion, [thing=128142][/thing], brings a few rules and some powerful cards that change the game dramatically. 

It feels like another game, because of the abundance of resources. 
It's not a struggle or a race anymore, but rather a pure resource management game.

In Winter you'll get the chance to do everything you couldn't do in New Era:
- incorporate insane amounts of locations
- maximize all the VP production locations
- use all your faction tokens

The game also takes a lot longer (150 min for 2 players)

Winter it's not an improvement it's just different. Maybe it's too much ... I can't decide yet which I like more: New Era (Base) or New Era + Winter.

Later edit:
New Era + Winter is the best way to play this game. Frozen City is a MUST. Only one small problem: there are 4 cards that are overpowered in Winter (the ones that give 5VP tokens). You have to remove these 4 cards for a balanced game.

Everything about this game. There are two cards with women on them, and in both they have big boobs. The English rules seem like someone used Google Translate from Polish to Swahili and then to English. The iconography is inscrutable and incomplete without reference to the rules and since rules are introduced with every expansion, we shuffle through pages of rules looking up most cards. It sat on the shelf for a year until we found a better ruleset at BBG. There are exceptions galore and many details of the rules that you often forget while playing. And still... and still my wife and I play this game and really enjoy it. The theme, the complexity, the length really appeal to us when we want a longer two player game with some complexity.

Solid game with some unnecessary fiddliness that holds it back at higher player counts.  Probably best with 3 players, though it plays well with 2 - it gets needlessly convoluted with 4.  A lot of strategies and adapting to changing situations, which is always nice.

Imperial Settlers go go go!

New Era is a tableau-builder in the style of Race for the Galaxy (RftG).  A major difference is that where RftG keeps it simple with cards as currency, New Era gives you four basic resources and then three more to purchase with them.    Getting the resources you need to play a card can be a little more involved in this game, adding interest but also playing time.

Speaking of time, New Era goes the same route as Wallace's London and is turn based.  I guess this was unavoidable in the case of New Era as it can be interactive in terms of destroying opponents' cards or making use of their production.  That would have been messy with RftG's simultaneous play, but, again, the result is a longer game.  Speaking some more of time; where RftG offers a choice of six actions, New Era presents eleven (plus pass).  More choices, more thought, a longer game.

The degree to which a starting faction favours each interactive option gives it an individual flavour.  Those options to build, conquer or trade are there on every location card too.  That's the nicest element of this design.   

Thematically, I like the game's post-apocalyptic setting, but have to say that the theme doesn't come through very strongly.  It may be heresy to say this of a Trzewiczek game, but New Era felt a bit of a cube pusher. 

Overall, I'm not convinced that New Era offers enough to justify its greater playing time.  When you factor in  the time a rules explanation will take, that's certainly so.  The English rules provided by Portal are dismal.  Go and download Legomancer's excellent interpretation of them.  However, even armed with a good set of rules, there is  a lot to explain.

New Era gives first time players a whole new set of icons to understand.  While some are easily interpreted others are opaque, just as in RftG.  RftG gave us player aids with the icons clearly explained.  New Era has just one player aid, the font is tiny and it is also the score track, so you cannot pick it up.  There are also discs for different resources in two shades of orange.  Those major gripes aside, production quality is decent.  The artwork made no impression on me; it doesn't bring the theme to life, but nor does it get in the way.

Lots heavier than I expected. But I think this is preferable to Race for the Galaxy (seems a bit heavier than that) but scratches a similar itch.

I typically dislike games with a lot of unique cards because thinking about those cards is necessary for important decisions but inflicts horrible AP on me (or anyone who wants to make the BEST DECISION). This is why I like San Juan a lot better than RftG. This game has a similar problem, but the "rule of 3" on each card, combined with higher player interaction and card drafting mechanics, make it so knowledge of the deck isn't as crucial of a skill as it often is in these games.

Also, nobody in my group likes the contact tokens... to my group they feel like a strange "extra step" to converting resources to actions. If it weren't for the way some of the production cards work (making contact tokens or allowing them to be discarded for benefits) I would rather contacts just be "Delayed" actions... I spend my guns now, and next turn I discard them and attack something of the appropriate value. I understand why it works the way it does, and it opens a lot of design space, but it feels kind of odd to have this middle-man currency.

A very good game indeed but demanding at the same time. First, you have to memorise quite a few rules and be able to recognise a lot of symbols. Besides, the game involves a lot of thinking and hard decision making. It is a tasty mixture of a euro type game with a pinch of fighting and attacking our oponnents. At the beginning you may find yourself a bit helpless but after a few games everything becomes clear and obvious. A game for determinated players, not for begginners, can turn out to be addictive.
Similar to Race for the Galaxy but better. If you are RftG fan, New Era is a must for you :)

Few changes from 51st State, so very similar in feel. Removal of Leaders, and their exceptions was a good idea. Attacking of others' cards is fine, if you are looking for that sort of thing, but very targeted, so beware of that.

This is the sequel to 51st state. It is basically the same game but brings in a couple of new mechanisms. It is break between 51st state and imperial settlers. I do find that it is quite a bit longer to play. And is not as easy and smooth as 51st state. I prefer to play imperial settlers or 51st state but it will come out on occasion. I don't see myself mixing new era with 51st state as it would make it a bit bulky. I would add in 51st State character cards though.

This is definitely an improved 51st State in these concrete ways: wooden components, larger cardboard chits, consolidated faction cards, a scoreboard that's separate from the box, no leaders which I felt unbalanced the game, increased interaction with the ability to conquer/create contracts with opponents locations, and easier to digest rulebook (well easier than Portal's 51st, not sure about when compared to Toy Vault's 51st State).  Here are things that seem like it's changed from 51st State but it's hard to judge after one play: it seems easier to get additional cards (big improvement imo, if it turns out to be true), it seems to be easier to get resources, I feel like they reduced the average distance of the locations, and it feels more difficult to acquire contact tokens.  The bad:  There is some errata that needs to be done, but I think it's only about two cards.  

Overall thoughts: Forget 51st State exists unless you already own and *really* enjoy New Era.  Even then I wouldn't necessarily recommend acquiring 51st State unless you really want additional cards to add to the main deck for variety.  The game still feels fiddly, but it doesn't feel quite as bad due to the component upgrades.  I think this game had potential but it's more fiddly and less polished than other card games I enjoy.

Stand alone or expansion. Nice. (I rated the base game, 51st State, an 8.)

I was excited for the addition of the new faction which increases 51st State to a 5 player game--a real bonus for our group, I thought, and increases the number of times it will hit the table. Also of interest to my group were the new rules for invading, which didn't interest me as much. 

Huge improvement: cardboard tokens are now twice the size (this was a major complaint of 51st State.) Nicely laminated Faction Cards & Rule Sheet with score track. Workers are now wood instead of cardboard, as are many of the resources. The rule book is printed on good paper and will hold up to use much better. It is also much easier to read.

The 51st cards can be added, but they are lacking the defense value, which was assigned to them in the new rule book. With my handy-dandy label maker (so it is neat), I added that number to the old cards. 

And some complaints:
Some of the card symbols have been modified--such as the Victory Points. I thought the symbols close enough, but there was a complaint.

Because for me, this is an expansion to the 51st State, I wish "51st State" had been included in the "The New Era" game title. When I am looking up here on BGG, it is not listed as I keep expecting it to be. (Have to open up 51st State, look for the expansion title, in order to access New Era. Wearisome.)

Everyone is pleased the score track is no longer on the bottom of the box. However, it is now smaller than it was and the new faction tokens are too big for the circles--the old, smaller faction markers work just fine (the one new faction gets to use the teeny-tiny 1st player token from the base game). As mentioned, the score track now rings the rules review--so, it's a problem if someone across the table needs to look at the sheet. Therefore, even though we didn't like the score track on the bottom of the box in the base game, we will probably start using it again.

Even though the four resources are now wood, they are incredibly small, difficult to handle, and easy to lose (and their favorite sport is rolling). Not only that some of the resources, and the people, ran out as early as the 3rd turn (5 players). Luckily I have The 51st State so we doubled the supply.

Yes, I was delighted to have another game for 5, but unfortunately, with reading new rules, it took too long to play (2 1/2 hrs, not 60-90 mins). Three players at this point, is the optimum number. Part way through the game we decided to cut out the attack capabilities due to the already lengthy game. 

I am afraid Portal Publishers skimped on the game with the score track and few too little resources. I would like to see the rules summary larger, and then the score track separate. I still do not think the attack capabilities improve the game, and I am lukewarm about the new rules for cooperation between two players. Luckily, the rules for attack and cooperation can be disregarded. I am still delighted with the game, consider it one of my favorites, and therefore am happy to just have more cards.

Sokat javult a 51st-hez képest. A szabály valamivel érthetőbb, de még mindig a borzalmas kategóriába esik, az ikonredszer szintén. Jó, hogy kiszedték a leadereket, mert imbák voltak, jó, hogy van valamennyi interakció, jó hogy sokat erősítettek a kék akción azzal, hogy távolra is lehet csinálni. Jó, hogy az interakció nem annyira kitolós (mégha elsőre annak is tűnik). Rossz, hogy annyira gány a szabály és az ikonrendszer, hogy csak profik felügyelete mellett élvezhető a játék, más esetben vért izzadva kell kifórumoznod minden szabályt, hogy huszadjára talán egyszer jól játsszátok. Kér érte, mert alapjaiban nagyon-nagyon tetszene, mind a mechanika, mind a játékmenet. Csak kellett volna egy tökös kiadó, aki gatyába rázza az őrült tervező zseni kicsapongásait.

I'm not thrilled. Indisputably better than 52. state - it's a mature version of it. The previous one was kind of prototype rather than full game.
Nevertheless, the game is good. The thing that separate it from being very good is the chaos that is generated on the board! Huh! It's a mess - tons of chips and meeples and (please remember that) it's a CARD GAME! If you'd compare this to Convoy you'll see that in the latter are almost no chips. Another thing - the rulebook is terrible. I mean TERRIBLE. :(
Anyway - I want to play it again, but I won't insist.

Excellent game.

After three 2p, one 4p and one 5p game. Never played 51st State or RftG. [Update: some more plays by now]

Weakest part of the game is the rulebook. It looks nice and gave the impression of being structured, but after being at the fair in Essen I was probably too tired to understand everything in the first read.

Other than that, an excellent game that probably will become a cornerstone of my game collection. Great fun. Clear recommendation for people who like meatier card games. Brainburny.

The estimated time might work for 2p or 3p games. The (first) 5p game (4 of them not knowing the game) took a good 3 hours. Everybody enjoyed it.

very well made card game on postapocaliptyc setting. this is actually a stand alone expansion that I consider better then the base game itself, a sort of new edition of the base game rater then an expansion. is basically a worker placement kind of game in wich trough cards(representing locations of the pre war world or even of the post apocalyptic one)and meeples and coloured discs(representing in order workers and resources, players, representing one of the 5 faction included, tryes to rebuild a society that can be better then the ones of the opponents. this is a diceless game in whic the card draw is the only little part of luck in the game, the remaining part, is all skill and smart thinking

The rulebook is the worst i have ever read. I do not recommend to learn it from that. If you do you will never ever want to play the game again, however im still interested. The theme is absolutely unique it feels like fallout from my childhood, ahh good memories! After the first game, finally i could catch somebody who knows the rules. The game feels okey but im not satisfied. You have plenty of choices which i think is a bit too much already, as it makes the gameplay time significantly longer. We finished our first game just a little bit under 3 hours with 4 players. I will keep on trying, but the game never will be in my favorite ones. The icons make the learning curve steep, but it can be played in any language at least. After we have finally cleared the rules it became a nice strategy game, but be prepared your brain will be burned. It is rather exhausting than an experience of pleasure and fun.

Pros / Cons:
-You have plenty of choices, which can be well combined together.
-The game theme feels unique and fresh out of the box.

-The number of choices can lead into paralyzis analyzis easly.
-You are just halfway when your brain already asking for a rest. The gametime feels long and harsh which just kills the fun for me.

Agreements with other players and attacking their locations introduce a new layer to the game.  There are even more factors to consider and decisions to make now.  Love it.

Playing New Era is a pure fun.
You can play it as a stand-alone or mix it with the 51st State and it's equally good.

Horrible ruleset, full of holes, unclear iconography and its CATASTROPHIC description spoil the joy of learning the game...  That's the f*cking publisher's - Portal's - trademark :-///

Just a very initial rating and comments here. Have played half a game so far after reading rules, and I don't think it is quite what I hoped, a good RFTG alternate, close maybe not fully sure. 

We play Race enough times that I wanted another similar option. So far, I am not seeing the same level of Strategy here, but it is early and I could be missing it. Also the theme is really not coming out like I hoped either, I love the theme but it does not seem that strong, more play needed to solidify opinion.

RATING: 8
Theme: Post-Apocalyptic
Gameplay: Tableau building, multi-use cards that make for interesting choices
Components: Unique card art, better wooden tokens now.
Replayability: Not the easiest game to teach, but the right group will love the interesting gameplay and want more.
Rulebook: Better than re-implemented 51st State 1st Ed. but still not a great presentation of the rules.

Simple and great idea for the core of the game. But the game itself - not that simple ;) It's not very hard to learn, but the amount of choices and decisions makes my brain starts boiling... No need to say much - just VERY well designed economic game set in the amazing postapocaliptic theme.

RATING: 7
- Some inconsistencies or problems in the iconography (incorporation action sometimes represented with a house, sometimes not: why 2 icons?) (tokens represented on cards in a way that differs from the real cardboard tokens) (Pickers/Gatherers: discard a token of value *at least 2*, not written on the icon, where a "2+" would do) (Tank with a Factory+Weapon icon that means: when you produce Weapon during Production *or Action*, whereas the Factory icon means Production, normally, *not* Action [Action cards do not have it]: why not simply put a Weapon token instead?)

- English of the rulebook: not so good (but understandable)

- Not all icons explained (example: Armory: red token => blue token: I guess that they have the same value)

- Inconsistencies in the wording (Truck: for every "complete" conquest", Gang Hideout: after a "successful" conquest: these are actually both successful conquests)

- Rules not fully streamlined. For instance, conquering a location from the opponent can only be done with tokens (not actions): this is an exception. Or: Reconstruction requires building material, but this is not represented on the cards (in Race for the Galaxy, the number of "hidden" rules seems smaller, or they are easier to remember). Or: renovation gives you 2 VP, but this is not on the cards or the playing aid.

- Quite fiddly (scan one's cards for Productions, opponent cards with an agreement, move tokens, etc.). There are card games in this time frame that are much more streamlined: Innovation, Race, Magic,… Or even Puzzle Strike.

- We are encouraged to redevelop, but this shifted the "economy" in discrete directions. Plus, destructions are hard to prevent. As a consequence, I could not really have much of a strategy, and tactics were limited. I mostly incorporated, and incorporated, and fetched a few VPs here and there.

- The icons are quite numerous (more than in Race, I would guess).

* Conclusion
- Too fiddly for what it is (compared to other games in the same time frame).
- Board situation too unstable (redevelopments, attacks) to create a real strategy (after a single game, though), and too general/similar to create interesting strategies (unlike Innovation, for instance, where effects can be crazy). Added to the many "currencies" (fuel, scrap material, weapons,…), this makes cards that are hard to make work together (contrary to the tableau building in Race for the Galaxy, or the deck building in Dominion and Puzzle Strike).

51st State just got bitch-slapped down from a 9 to a 7 and this replaced it.

Ignacy does it again with a 2.0 of another design, really a 2.5, and makes a great game perfect.

This version has extreme balance across the board, more comboliciousness, and a wonderful new faction.

They claim you can combine both games but I say WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO??

The game by itself, is not bad. However, the graphic design on the cards is the worst I've seen in the past 10+ years of boardgaming and the designer tried too hard to pack additional information into a tiny card.

New edition of 51st State is slightly better but still not good as it could.
Players have options to interact with each other and finally there are good tokens.
But the game have the same old problems:
- not enough cards to accomplish what you plan or even do small improvements in your tableau
- rules, especially icons, are definitely too complicated, I can't imagine to teach the game to some inexperienced players

It's 51st State, done right. Dropping the leaders is fine by me, it was a bit out of place to begin with, but more importantly the player interaction is a working and significant addition, unlike in RftG. The gameplay is more streamlined, more intuitive ([i]but could still be overwhelming at first[/i]), and the thematic feel of building a struggling post-apocalyptic community is strong as ever. 

You can skip 51st State, but if you have it, you can add some of the cards, or bring back the leaders- we haven't. It's complete as it is.

This is a great game system, but they really dropped the ball in making so many wholesale changes to the graphic design / production. This should have been re-themed as an entirely new game.

The tokens in the original were fine, they only needed to be a bit thicker [not larger]. The combo of wood bits + tokens for larger quantities is confusing [like Agricola's awkward x4/x3 tokens].

The icons were perfectly clear in the original. Way too many changes have been made here, to the point where the cards don't make sense next to the original cards. It's like Spanish vs. Portuguese.

RATING: 9
Very good game.  Have only played 3 times, but there are plenty of tough decisions and routes to victory.  I described it to my son, and he said "oh, it's just like San Juan".  I suppose in the fact that you are building locations it is.  However, there is a lot more going on.

Rules were a little tough to decipher at first, but it all clicked together in the end.  This game is right on the edge of my tolerance for icon loaded cards.  One of the reasons that I didn't get Race for the Galaxy is due to it's icon loaded cards that need to be constantly deciphered.  This game is just a notch below that.  Rules explanation took a while, but it's not as bad as RftG.  And unlike RftG, I always had at least a couple of good cards in my hand to make use of due to the way cards are drafted at the beginning of each round.  It was easier for me to see how I could use the synergies of different cards.

Managed to play it with my son (13).  It was a good close game.  Very interesting how in the beginning of the game you don't have resources to do anything, and towards the end you have too many of the wrong resources.  Planning your growth is critical.  Very much looking forward to trying this again.

RATING: 9
This is one of my favorites. The card tableau building game that you actually make use of. A little bit of resource management, just the right amount of resource making, all to make that efficient VP machine. The interaction in this game is perfect for me. It's present, but not too direct or conflicty. And you can still feel the theme in the game.

I really like the changes.  I love the agreements and offensive actions you can take against your opponents, added much neded player interaction.  New cards are good, and the race is great.  Nice to have a fifth player, but dunno if it is much.  I have to say I hate the rulebook however.  Terrible.  I will say that having 51st state makes it better though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
It includes a few changes that are supposed to improve 51st State. I can't disagree with that. It provides some interaction that is certainly welcome and that also opens new tactics. I'm fairly neutral about the rest of the changes and in any case, I still find 51st State very attractive.

It is said that it can be integrated with 51st State. I don't see very well how to do this; the cards of 51st won't work with the The New Era rules, and some of the New Era cards do not make sense with the 51st ruleset (or are much less interesting).

When compared to the original 51st State, this is two steps forward, two steps back. The new components and scoreboard are nice additions, but the removal of leaders was a poor choice.

New Era's main attraction comes from the new rules that allow you to form agreements with or attack other people's cards. This replaces the upgrade cards from the base game that allow you to attach extra blue cards to your race. I like the idea of attacking, but forming agreements instead of upgrading just means you have to look all over the table during production instead of right in front of you.

I feel I should mention how terrible The New Era's rulebook is. It is meant to be both a stand alone game or expansion, but if you have no prior experience with 51st State this rulebook will give you problems. Our 1st game took 3 hours due to so many questions that were poorly answered in the rules.

Overall: The New Era is a fun game, but I think I'd only recommend it if it's being mixed with the 51st State base game.

One of the best card games I have played. The sense of progression and building your own faction has a thematic feel. Each card can be used for different purpose, so there is a lot flexibility is strategy in this game. Finding out the different combos and working out the best way to use each card makes the game highly enjoyable for me. I don't feel so doomed by luck than in maybe some other games, for example Race for the Galaxy. The lookout phase adds a lot to the game since you can take what you want or take a card that your opponent wants. Attacking and co-operating with locations adds nice flavour to the game. Amazingly well balanced game and I like the bold take on the unique factions. Each playing time feels always a bit different and you have to play a little differently with each faction. There is a lot of interaction between players and it's not a multiplayer solitaire.

Learning all the the different symbols takes a couple plays. Definitely on the heavy card game department. Rulebook is still a bit confusing and unclear at times. Basically a 2-3 player game since 4-5 player games just take too long and paying attention to the cards of other players just becomes quite impossible task. Hopefully we'll get new expansions for this game and make it even better, at least more variety in the draw deck wouldn't hurt. Overall it's a great card game and a one that I can highly suggest.

51st State - 2. Not an expansion, this is a follow-on game which solves many of the issues of the first game, adds a few new features, and updates the graphics. 

Kinda like a computer game.

I'd definitely recommend that people pick this one up - either as an introduction to the world of 51st State, or as an enhancement of the original, but I don't think that this should be seen as a true expansion.

I have played Imperial Settlers a lot. Later I tried The new Era a couple of times. In comparison, its terrible! Full of limitations. Basically, you can build only one building per turn ( if you are not lucky). When you make deals are conquer locations, you don't get the rewards immediately. Therefore, there is not much to do. Very slow progress. All this beautiful resource juggling of Imperial Settlers, is not happening in this game. I don't even see any need for all these limitations. 
My Advice. Buy Imperial Settlers of the newest version of 51st State.

 I do like these kind of more complex card games. I like the engine building of a euro game combined with the randomness that cards naturally creates. This allows for a very tactical game where making the most of every turn is important. There is a lot of synergy that can be created, and it seems that every card has multiple worthwhile uses. I feel like there is a lot of depth to this game, and it is fun to play.

The best changes to the 561st State system came with this game and because of The New Era there is the Master Set and Imperial Settlers as we know them now.

Unfortunately with Master Set this one won't hit the table anymore but it will still keep a special place in my gaming hearth.

RATING: 4
Now that I finally learned the game (no thanks to the impenetrable rulebook), it's not that good. Too fiddly, too limiting, and too dependent on good card draws.

The fiddliness has to do mainly with all of the different symbols. Countless symbols. "Well, Race for the Galaxy has tons of symbols, and you like that game" you might be thinking. True, but New Era also has quite a few wooden pieces, contact counters, and victory point tokens all over the place. The symbols, when combined with all of the other stuff, are just too much.

The limiting part is because you lose all of your extra resources every round and have to build back up. If you don't get the right cards, you can end up with turns where there's just not much you can do.

Will be selling on eBay.

Update: The new 51st State Master Set fixes most of the game's issues and just improves everything. The New Era is now obsolete.

Sold.

I had played 51st State back in 2011 and for whatever reason it didn't click for me.  I couldn't tell you why... to be honest I barely even remember playing it.  Which is why it's a little surprising that I enjoyed New Era.  New Era seems to be most of what I remember 51st State being... in fact, I'm not sure I could even tell you how they're different.  But I really enjoyed New Era. 

It was a little overwhelming though and I could feel myself getting lost trying to figure out what to do.  I think it's a game much like Race for the Galaxy where you really need a couple of plays to get the hang of it and get a feel for the cards and the combos.  But I'm pretty sure that once I have a couple of plays under my belt, this would be something that would be just as much fun as RftG.

Excellent game. There are tons of ways how location cards can be used. Randomness of a deck of cards is mitigated by the "look-out" phase in which players have an opportunity to pick locations cards that suite their strategy the best. And if somebody manages to build super powerful engine, key parts of it can still be destroyed that levels chances.

wow, this needs more plays to be rated...
First play, I can immediately tell why people compare this to RFTG. It shares a lot of the same ideas (hand management, multiple card usage, diverging path to victory, a strong "racing" element) and the same barrier to entry (TONS of confusing icons!). Each turn, the possibilities are huge and they grow from one turn to the next (which can lead to looong turns in the end game).
I like having different factions, and Portal is known for supporting its games with more content (new factions still coming up).

Good first impression (even though it dragged a bit too much in the end), defenitly need more plays.

PS: having seen rules explantaion & gameplay video for Imperial Settlers, the descendence is obvious and IS just seems more accessible, more beautiful, faster, with an easier theme, clearly a must-buy for me.

I enjoyed this in my one play, though I would say there's plenty of games like it.  I had a helluva difficult internalizing all my choices, an understandable dilemma considering that there are four different resources which convert into three different currencies, not to mention workers and actions to track.  Once I got past that, I found it a cool little system with a great postapocalyptic theme and wonderful art.  And, as a side note, I've never played [gameid=73369], so I can't compare the two, though I'd be happy to give it a try based on the positive experience from this game.

Very good game, played this one a lot with all the expansions and must say it's very satisfying. Artwork is very good and the game is getting better and better. It's only weakness it's the manual and a lot of symbols you have to remember, witch can be very off putting for lots of people.

I would never expect i'd think that much playing a card game. I love the complexity, the theme, the engagement. It's an absolutely perfect game for 2 players and almost perfect for 3 and 4 since it just takes too long then.
And the more card the better, so I always play with all the cards from 51st State, New Era and now Winter. I'm loooooving it :)!

RATING: 5
I really like the post-collapse theme, but there's a pretty high barrier of entry into this game, and after two plays I'm still not sure I've passed it. A lot of rules are unclear, some terms sound way too much alike and have similar (but distinct) meanings in the context of the game, and there's a huge number of symbols to familiarize yourself with. The broad strokes of "settle, conquer or trade" are easy to grasp, but the implementation is sloppy. The differences between factions are easy to work with, though.

Just two plays so far, 3 months apart, and the second was as confusing as the first. Hopefully if I can get repeated plays with the same players it will become more streamlined, but teaching it to new people is painful.

Third-party rules summaries and cheat sheets are extremely helpful in this game, and almost necessary to play at all. Even the quick reference card provided in the game also inexplicably acts as the score board. With its tiny print and tokens on it at all times (which don't properly fit on the score track spaces), it doesn't make for a good reference.

Basically this is 51st State 2.0 where you are able to interact more with your opponent by destroying his buildings or profit from his agreements. Is it better than the original. My score says it all. This is by far my alltime favorite!

RATING: 10
While it's not as good as Race For The Galaxy (which it resembles a little), I appreciate it for being a bit simplier, really deep and captivating like RTFG. Only one bad side - rules are somewhat poorly organized so learning just from reading rules is difficult.

Een nieuwe stand-alone van 51st state die ook te combineren is met zijn voorganger.

Alles wat 51st state zo leuk maakte wordt hier nog eens dunnetjes over gedaan. Deze ronde is er gelukkig wel genoeg spelmateriaal. Daarnaast wordt er een mogelijkheid geboden voor meer interactie, maar in de praktijk zal dit niet veel voorkomen.

51st state is een leuk spel en daarom is dit ook een leuk spel, maar verwacht geen grondverschuivende veranderingen.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Bien que ceci n'est nullement mentionné, je considère ce jeu comme un placement d'ouvrier, différent, ou l'on doit avoir un certain contrôle sur certains édifices. Ce jeu pourrais être joué comme un jeu de guerre, à condition bien sur, de ne pas adopter de stratégie politique ou tous et chacun ne se tire pas mutuellement dans les jambes. Plusieurs mécanique du jeu m'ont intéressé, bien que l'ensemble du jeu ne m'a pas nécessairement émerveillé. J'aimerais bien le ré-essayé pour me faire une idée plus globale.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] This is a different kind of worker placement game, where you must try to control some area's. It could be played as a war game, unless no-ones cares about going after the other ones... political strategy I suppose! There's a few mecanism I did appreciate in the game, but I'm not so sure about the omplete thing. I'm looking foward to re-try this one.

I really hoped that this standalone expansion for 51st state would streamline the rules and gameplay. It does to some extend, but unfortunately, they also introduce new rules and every card has a different powers. I guess this is great for the number of possibilities and the immersion, but I really dislike ambiguous rules and the confusion interactions that might arise. 
Also, in both games I played, at a certain point one player hit upon a great engine, and they were able to ride it to victory by a great margin.

I'm a fan of the original 51st State, and although I'm leery of buying directly from Portal due to being burned in the past, I once again took the plunge (and I also got Pret-a-Porter). The production values are much better this time around.

Now having played the game, not only are the production values better, but the game's much improved by the fun rules that allow you to make deals with opponents' locations, and even conquer them. Great game.

If you haven't played with the Winter expansion though, you simply have to give it a try, it's amazing!

An excellent follow-up to 51st State that streamlines the mechanics while offering a slightly different experience (meaning it doesn't replace 51st completely; I enjoy playing both games equally).

Everything that can be said about the first game can be said about The New Era.

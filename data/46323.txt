In hand at last!  Wherever these folks got their components manufactured, I wish more companies would use the same.  Beautiful game.  First game (two-player) ran smoothly; the rules are very well-written and the detailed presentation of the importance of early expansion helped both of us get off the ground on a good footing.

Looking forward to the next game. I'll be playing this a lot.

Nice game, very reminiscent of the Gamesmaster games of yore, especially Samurai Swords/Ikusa.  My problem with it is that it just goes too long, and there ends up being too many units on the board.  I would have liked a turn-limited victory point variant and a hard cap on units.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very solid, 3 hr(ish) 4 player wargame set in medieval Europe. Terrain value and benefits differ, units have differing values and costs, game play surprisingly streamlined in the vein of Samurai Swords/Shogun (in Europe!) Combat is strategic, large scale, and satisfying despite being not overly complex.

Just missed this very nice looking game at TN. Game days this year, I will make it a mission to sit in front of a copy and give it a go, soon, it looked wonderful and I heard good things from those who DID get to give it a try!

Update: Got to meet one of the designers, learn the game and then play it with a great group at Nashcon. I purchased it after the play, not from obligation, but because I really like the game. It has a nice feel to it, and does present an entire sessions worth of playtime depending on the group. The battles are brutal and the wild swings in momentum in our three player game were both thrilling and disheartening at the same time. A high testament for a board game of ANY theme. If you like Axis and Allies and similar playing games, try this one, it may not be for everyone, but I have given it my vote of confidence from my wallet, so that speaks a lot!

A meatier more strategic version of risk that requires a bit more rules checking. This is a great game for a group of friends that like war games like Risk but that want more than just a few dice rolls. Risk is almost all luck. Where this one it has luck but less than Risk.

The pieces are beautiful little medieval lords, knights, archers and spearmen. They are sterdy and flexible. The game just oozes well designed medieval theme.

You may be going back to the rules to clarify things.

This game has been a great deal of fun so far.  Really like the way that the board is setup and the ease of play.  It can turn into a dicefest depending no how people are playing and there is a certain amount of luck involved due to the randomness of using dice for combat resolution, but it is a solid, enjoyable game.

Solid game, but I think I'm getting burned out on these conquer the world with mini's games.  Still this is one of the better ones of the genre.  I particularly like the three types of cards that add variability to the game:

Pope cards each player gets one per turn automatically
Conquest cards are earned for conquering at least one territory per turn (ala Risk)
Merchant cards can be purchased for 4 gold each

Dicefest econo-wargame of the sort I tend to enjoy playing maybe once or twice a year. Suffers to some extent from the usual problem of "When A and B fight, C wins", though the benefits of capturing a castle can help mitigate it under some circumstances. Our game ended in a timely fashion because (a) one player was substantially more skilled than the others, and (b) someone had to leave, so we called it, but it seemed like it'd be tediously drawn-out among players of similar skill.

This game does a good job of what it's designed to do, but it just isn't my thing.

With player elimination and no mechanic to keep the game from going on for an extended period of time, I doubt I'll be giving it another play.

That said, if you like Axis & Allies, you should like this game.

RATING: 5
Respectable attempt at a Gamemaster series style game. It's the Medieval Europe version of Shogun/Samurai Swords/Axis & Allies/Conquest of the Empire (or a variation of Castle Risk). Produce units & send them to attack & conquer enemy castles to win. Nice mapboard & minis. The cards make it more interesting.

Update: Sold. Although the components were very nice, I didn't see any need for the game since Ikusa, Axis & Allies, Conquest of the Empire already fill this niche and do it so much better, and there's only so much time for these types of games. Had this come out 20-30 years ago, it would've been a huge hit in my gaming group at the time.

Game has beautiful board art, nice muted colors.  Almost looks like it could have been a hand drawn period piece.  I appreciate the little flourishes like the drawn cities and sea monsters.  The plastic figures are nice, perfect for a board game and stable enough to stay standing.  I can think of some Risk figures that weren't so stable for example.  

Overall this is a nice reimplementation of the classic conquest game set in an overlooked time period.  Instead of sweeping the board like so many earlier conquest games, you win by controlling a majority of completed castles.  

Cards can offer wide swings of fortune, and most are useful at the right times.  To an extent this keeps the game from being always a straight man to man battle as with the right conditions a smaller force can defend against, or even conquer a larger army.

I had one 2p game where I was clearly going to lose if the goal was to simply annihilate each other.  However, I'd managed to complete and hold a majority just before the hammer fell.  I like the possibility of an unexpected or alternate way to win.  I suppose you could consider it as though you had consolidated enough political power with the nobles or something such.  

Only quibble is the super cheap dice.  The d8's are at least indented, but the d12 and d10's are sloppily painted instead.  

I have yet to be able to table a 4p game.  I am expecting and hoping to expand my rating, if I like the experience.  2p is fun, but a little limited.  I suspect this really needs more players for the full impact and value of the set to be revealed.

RATING: 7
I found the combat to be a bit tedious, but I really liked the cards (some nice flavour there) and the victory condition of controlling a majority of castles which you need to spend time and resources building. The game is fairly balanced and has some good surprises, flavour, variability and catch-up possibilities. The rules for conquering castles are also smart because they allow someone to build some momentum and move towards some conclusion for the game. All in all, I'd say this is a nicely done game. The combat system drags the game out longer than it should be, but that could probably be mitigated a bit by using a bunch of different coloured 8-, 10- and 12-sided dice so that you can assign one die per unit and throw everything at once.

The production for this game is great but it is EXACTLY the kind of game that gives Ameritrash a bad rap. It's taken parts of AXIS & ALLIES, SAMURAI SWORDS and RISK and like it's parents is overly long. The best part are the different cards that upset the balance of power. It has that unending feeling because as soon as someone gets too strong everyone else knocks him back down. It really makes me appreciate RUNEWARS and EMPIRES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD so much more.

Pretty good fun - the best of the Risk-a-likes I've played.  Nice figs, terrific board & just the right amount of unit variety.  Best of all, tho, are the spicy card decks & the focus on castle-capture for victory.  And who doesn't love a tide of dice?  Best if you buy more so you can roll a ton simultaneously...

RATING: 5.5
This is a beautiful game that I have played twice. I originally gave it an "8" but now it is a "5.5".  I believe the 4 player game has a fatal flaw for Britain. Exact same game with 2 totally different groups. A possible fix is removing (icing) the sea lane in Sweden thus making Denmark the key. Otherwise, Russia & Britain go after each other to their deaths after turn 1.  Game is WAY TO LONG!  We quit each time after 6.5 hours with the outcome in question.

I love the Game Master series and this fits right in that collection. It is fun, but never ending. I prefer Shogun even though medieval Europe is my favorite time period.

Not that I didn't have some fun playing, but the game got ridiculous.  I'm not sure the economics were ever worked out.  Here I was in turn 5ish making 50 coins/turn and I get a card I can play on someone to force him to pay me 1/turn?  Stacks of 35 spearmen?  Buying warlords just to get the money spent?  A nice effort, but didn't seem to work.

RATING: 6
Though it looked promising and well-produced, WoE was a "meh" experience for me, though one with many flashes of fun.  Ultimately the game needs some mechanism to break up non-aggression pacts that become power blocks extending over half the map.  If one of these powers is based in a corner of the map (Kiev and the Latin Kingdom), with very limited approach routes available to the other players, they can become unstoppable juggernauts.  I know, alliances are not supposed to happen, but I fail to see how non-aggression pacts can be prevented.

Manipulating the number of powers might seem to be the best place to start.  Even if there wasn't a true additional player-controlled force, but instead an unpredictable neutral the players might seek to influence or gain control of for short periods it might help.  The Germans and/or Danes seem made for this role.

There could be other fixes: limit the ability of a player to collect multiple gold bonuses for controlling multiple kingdoms, provide cards that allow players to attack one another's power bases by starting or subsidizing revolts (the card that tries to do this is much too weak), create a requirement that some huge armies must be split up occasionally by having some kind of Winter turn or card event that puts supply or attrition pressure on monster steamroller forces (again, a card that gestures toward this is way too weak).  Any or all of these would help.  

We'll certainly be giving this a few more tries, but the end-phase of 2 or 3 overwhelming powers having a luck-dependent showdown begins very quickly in this game, at least for my group of four.  If we can't house-rule WoE into being a bit more open and less predictable (a different thing from luck-dependent, BTW) it won't hold interest much longer.

Another failed Axis & Allis clone. I really must stop playing them. It's actually far better than Conquest of Narath. Bit more strategic, the event cards are powerful and, more importantly, the downtime is low. While there's loads of men spread across the board, you won't be attacking with them all each turn, so it's not insane.

What is crazy, however, is the winning condition of owning more than half the castles on the board. We played three hours and it was 3 castles each - with no end in site. It was like a merry-go-round of capturing castles/losing castles. It does encourage the attacker to go mental, but it also means a 4-5 hour game. Can't cope with that. If someone could come up with a reasonable winning condition and guarantee this could finish in three hours, may play again.

Spiel im mittelalterlichen Europa: bis zu vier Spieler versuchen, Fürstentümer („fiefs“), ganze Königreiche und Burgen zu erobern, um vom Papst zum Kaiser gekrönt zu werden. Sehr simple Regeln (12 Seiten), spannende Kämpfe mit überschaubaren Würfelmodifikatoren (im Grunde spielt nur das Terrain eine Rolle) und natürlich vor allem jede Menge bunte Plastikminiaturen machen das Spiel zu einem unkomplizierten, strategisch aber nicht anspruchslosen ‚Schlachtfest‘ von relativ kurzer Dauer (ca. zwei Stunden). Und man kann sogar gegnerische Fürsten gefangennehmen und Lösegeld verlangen.

It seems wrong for the designer to rate his own game.  Of course you're going to think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  And the 1 rating without comments is not helpful.  Have you played the game, seen it up close?  The concept is appealing, but not much news or buzz on this one.

As others have commented this is Axis & Allies meets Risk. It's way too long for the enjoyment, the components are not particularly good for a modern game and it's a huge dice-fest. If someone (as I did) starts to lose territory/income then you are only ever going to go downhill from there. Could be a tortuous death by a 1000 dice unless you cut your losses and quit the game.

[2 plays] 2 player rating 5. 3 player rating 6 for naturally incorporating more diplomacy, deceit, and guarding multiple fronts. I was immediately impressed by the quality of the plastic minis, cards, mapboard, and tokens. Tremendous work for a self published effort. However, this is no longer the style of game I want in a multiplayer experience. Too lengthy, too much downtime, too much chaos. Perfect for teenagers with long rainy weekends to play 11 hour epic games with lots of bickering and escalating battles.

I've rated Warlords of Europe a 9, the same as I give to Samurai Swords. It's designed in that same tradition - if the MB GameMaster series was still being produced, this would fit nicely. (Note: I've only played 2-player so far.)

The designers obviously put a great deal of time and attention into making this the best game it could be, and that effort shows. Even the physical quality is excellent, which is amazing for a first release from a small outfit. The dice are only so-so quality, and the different money token denominations are a bit hard to distinguish, but that is small stuff, and the only fault I can find. The rules are tight, and include excellent examples of play. The cards add a lot of excitement, with three different decks (Combat, Trade, Pope) adding a great deal of variablity. I [b][i]love[/i][/b] the Pope Deck!

If I had one wish, it would be pieces for a fifth player, but maybe we'll see that one day in an expansion. Whether we do or not, I look forward to playing this game many, many times in the coming years.

Homage to the "Dudes on a Map" glory days - Medieval Style! A time period I wished the MB Gamemasters Series had produced.  Just as well done here, though.  Even with a victory condition to combat the "eternity syndrome." Still, can be a bit longish which may restrict when, and with whom, it is played.

RATING: 6.5
I've been waiting pretty much my whole life for a big game of medieval conquest involving the building of castles and the battling of many plastic knights!  In fact, I've been working on designing my own for the past couple of years.  So I was absolutely delighted to discover this game, even though it had very large expectations to fill!  And for an independent company, it's certainly a wonderfully-produced game (the box cover art is perhaps the best I've seen in ANY game).  It might have been nice to see some art on the cards too, but their simplicity makes them that much more functional I guess.  The game play is simple too (and is aided by the FAQ... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/54912/woe-faq-and-errata) in comparison to other large games of conquest, however an excessive game length offsets this advantage because there simply isn't enough to keep players interested for 5 or 6 hours.  And powerful cards which are meant to keep even weak players competitive in battles are offset by an economic system that allows those advancing the quickest to get richer (which is unfortunately necessary to help the game progress towards an eventual winner, with the victory conditions as given).  I do expect a lot out of games that are released nowadays and that have the experiences of years of games that came before them to draw upon, and in this respect I feel that Warlords of Europe didn't meet these exacting standards.  But with some tweaking of the victory conditions and the rules... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/526714/victory-points-and-other-variants ...it's not too hard to make this a simple, fun addition to your conquest games collection.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 7
Generally solid conquest game. The combat mechanic, which is styled on the one featured in 'Shogun/Samurai Swords' where ranged combat strikes first followed by units of varying strength, is particularly impressive and I like how defending a castle or different types of terrain effects the type of dice you use (d8, d10, d12). To win you need to have control of the majority of castles on the board. The one downside for me is that there's too much randomness introduced into the game by the combat cards, which often modify dice rolls. If you're unlucky to repeatedly draw underpowered cards in this department compared to your opponents, the game can become too frustrating an experience.

Lots of lucky dice rolling and card drawing. It's risk on steroids. It plays a little long. It's begging for a 5th player. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the different kinds of armies apart. I really enjoy this game and it's the game risk could have been. I don't like to make comparisons to other games, but in this case it's hard not to make the comparison. Overall it's still much shorter than risk.

Very good game. Like a combination of "Samurai Swords" & a couple of other war games. Well done!

I really like this game. The rules are written very well and the game pieces are quality. Game play is similar to other games in this genera. I like how the papal cards bring in the flavor of Medieval European politics. If I had to change anything, I would add a different color chips for mercenaries and have different backs for the different types of cards.

Played once.  Axis & Allies in fuedal Europe, but with cards that can really turn the game.  One comment was wondering if every game will play out the same?  We did 3 player with a triangle set-up (Hispania, Denmark & the other one in the bottom right corner.

An Area movement, epic strategy game of medieval warfare set in 13th century Europe. Players compete to militarily dominate the fiefs and castles of Europe and thus be crowned Emperor by the Pope.
Warlords of Europe features nine major kingdoms of the time period, each subdivided into vassal fiefs. Each fief has its own terrain that affects its economic and defensive value. The Pope, Merchant, and Conquest decks of cards keep the action unpredictable. But, good fortune is no replacement for solid strategy, cautious planning and an excellent sense of timing. Players may start in any of the nine kingdoms making each play a unique experience.

Here's a good war-boardgame. As many ones in this category it's a little bit long...even with VPs conditions added on BGG. I like card which make the game chaotic.

fun first play; a wargame like Ikusa but with special power cards that can come into play to sway the flow of the game; conquer medieval europe with your playing pieces; good fun

A spectacular return to the MB big box games of my youth. Thoroughly enjoy myself every single time I bust this out, it is only a shame that I cannot do so more often.

The only reason I have rated this game an 8, & not a 9, is because it is only 4 player maximum. When Conquest Games comes out with a 6 player variant, (& I know you will-hint hint!!), then I will change my rating.
GREAT GAME, GUYS! Keep it coming!!
(Oh, & if Conquest Games wants a 10+, add in a fantasy element. Like Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Trolls, Draconians......Sounds like some great expansion ideas to me.)

Risk, but with an economy. As a result it drags along and any enjoyment that could have been had is lost.

They really should rename this to fist full of dice.  Rolling all those dice in Risk was cool when I was 8, not so much now.  Maybe call it dice of Europe?

Solid game. Borrows mechanics from some of our most favorite boardgames. I got to meet the creator and that was really neat.

Area control in medieval europe with lots of plastic figures, and plenty of dice rolling.

Played both 2-player and 3-player scenarios. Players need to decide where to attack and where to defend, as wrong decisions here will cost you the game. Individual battles between evenly matched forces are a coin (die) toss, so get your best troops in large numbers and good cards if you really want to win a particular battle. I'd rate 3-player game higher than a 2-player variant as watching out for that 3rd guy adds extra depth to your decision making during the game.

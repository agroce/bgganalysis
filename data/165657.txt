1st play: Very light filler game with lots of variable powers.  Played with 3 and with my kids, and may not be the ideal setup for this game.  Very tight micro attack game, and I like the idea of economic attacks.

2nd play: The combat system in this is unique, and I think a really solid game could be based around it.  In this game's case, it's a little too tight, with only 5 actions, it's hard to get anything going.  Still tho, better than I expected.

Single play, 2P. Enjoyed the pixel art. Played well enough with two. Rules seemed overwrought for being as light of a game as it is, and the combat system is a bit comical in its resolution. More or less feels like a "big" box microgame to me. Expect the game to be decided by single events.

I have to say, I am not a big fan, so far, of this game. The combat is a huge turn off, for me. Guessing the number of coins in the other player's hand? Getting it wrong is very costly. I much prefer the fate of the dreaded Space Hulk Death Angle die than this guessing game.

I do feel, however, that my rating of the game MIGHT be a little premature. There are a lot of cards in the special abilities deck to bid on from the start. I will admit, I could have tried harder in the initial bidding stage. If I had worked harder to get a good ability, I might have enjoyed my first game more. But, overall, I know for certain that I can get a similar and far better experience from Eight Minute Empire Legends.

This game revolves around an interesting mechanic where you battle by picking how much gold you want you want to spend, and the defender gets a chance to guess how much you are spending, and if they are right, they defend successfully. While intriguing this game is too short and needs more, but this combat system would be very interesting in another game or a modified version of this one.

Not really what I was expecting from a game called Melee... 

This game has some neat mechanics going on and it appears to be a decent if quick area control game. Unfortunately this is thrown together with an attack mechanic where you have to guess how many gold coins your opponent has in their hands.

Seriously who thought this was a good idea for a game. I guess its about what I should expect from the 13th newly played game this year.

I get that there is some level of double think required when attacking, however, the game felt like it was more about destructive interaction. I played it and wondered why I wouldn't play Small World instead.

It should also be noted, that the game can take longer to explain than it does to play. The rules are far too complicated than I want them to be for a game of this length. People can and will win on their first turn. Someone may sit through a ten minutes of explanation and not even get a turn! Ouch.

A very quick wargame that looks like it distills a lot of the feeling and tactics of far more complex games. It doesn't have the same feeling of "I've got to play another game" that [thing=131357][/thing] did. Lots of blind bidding, guessing and trying to outthink your opponents.

"Brutal and short" is right :-)  The four-season limit means that you have to have one eye on the tiebreakers while you keep the other on possible attacks (both by and against you).  The special ability cards take the replayability to another level.

RATING: 7
Fast fun game - bidding and bluffing and combat.  See my pictorial review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1493732

Some thoughts:
- The battle resolution mechanism (guess your opponent's blind bid) is especially great.  Your military strength is tied to your economy, and you need to combine probability and psychology with your economic strength to win combat.
- Best with 3 or 4.
- Special actions cards ensures replayability.
- Very short: given some fiddly rules about how different units operate, feels a bit too short.

Note the designer's explanation about how and why Catapults have changed in the new edition: [thread=1379712][/thread]
See also: [thread=1456544][/thread]

Rule notes easy to miss:
- you cannot bid 0 when attacking (unless you have a card giving you that special ability)
- your castle has a permanent garrison and thus counts as an "occupied province" when determining the winner
- camps do defend and need to be attacked, and become yours if you defeat it
- catapults do not defend and become yours if you enter a region (but not used immediately).  They only get one attack and then disappear.

A charming game that takes very little time to play, will appeal to wargamers and novices alike, and has a completely unique take on attacking/ defending.

If you're expecting or wanting a more traditional wargame, stay away.

If you're looking for a party game that happens to involve war, then you may enjoy it a lot.

Fits nicely as a palette cleanser between playing other games on a long game night!

I've had to keep the rules in my lap every time I've played this. Though the game is short in theory, the amount of pre-reading and explaining of the rules drags it out. I feel like this game would go over better playing longer sessions of it so that the rules become better internalized. Fun concept but spoiled by rules that are too far reaching for how simple the game is (should be).

Guessing is generally fun, but we've reached a point where the best strategy seems to be figured out, and the games are just about betting with a random number generator.

Interesting idea; but it's really too short, esp. since the setup (bidding for start player, bidding for special powers, initial deployment) is already half of the game.

* Kickstarted! *

8-bit graphics game in which your goal is to control more territory or claim a castle. However, in order to win a battle, you need to guess how many coins your opponent has in their hand… and that's where it gets difficult because you rarely have a decent number of coins AND a decent army.

PLUS: simple to grasp, lots of ways to get an advantage
MINUS: not enough rounds/coins to really get going

This is a great game! The immediacy of Melee's game play demands assertiveness in order to succeed. This game is really all about the bidding and guessing anyways: its short play time emphasizes that point. One must bid wisely at the start and then quickly outwit and outlast opponents in the risky endeavor of laying claim to territory and defending it. The payoff comes not in the area control, but in the guessing duel which works towards that purpose. It's not a game for the faint of heart, and yet the tension that arises as a result is what makes this game shine.

Made by the same mind as Coup, this is a grossly underrated filler game with a focus on deceit and area control.  While the game can be a bit annoying to teach (since you need to do it in reverse explaining second half of the game before explaining the first), it is an enjoyable and balanced experience that scales well between all player counts.  

However, I feel the game wears out it's welcome quickly.  After about 5 plays, I don't feel there isn't much variety besides the power the players can get.  The foundations are great and I think this would work on a game with a larger scale.

I'm afraid it did not do much for me.  While interesting, the decision on what number to guess as an attack value fell very flat for me: it gives more an illusion of choices, although a bit more control than a dice roll.  The advanced cards would only extend play time, but I think you have the same level of control or lack of it.  Looks pretty nice, though, at least in the black and white box.

Possibly one of the most vicous area control games I have ever played! It is fast, it is furious and death comes swiftly. 
I can see how the combat system will upset hardened gamers as the defender only has to guess how many coins the attacker has in his hand to win. But that is the fun of it, if you only have 3 coins....it is unlikely you will win!
Great fun!

Based on one play: A true filler battle game. It only lasts 5 rounds so there is no holding back, try to either capture another players castle or control the most spaces at the end. Each unit has a cost and ability, plus at the start you bid for special powers. The battles are the most interesting since the attacker places a bid and the defender must try and guess so the  more money you have the better odds of winning as an attacker. Interested to try again to see if the mechanics has lasting appeal.

Finally got a chance to play this one.  Definitely a super quick area control game.  Not sure if it was because I didn't play with my typical group, but this felt kind of flat.  The game was over before we knew it, you only had 1 opportunity to grab a unique power or two, and I think we already found the best strategy within the first game.  Basically you sit out 1 round to gather money, then you have the knight run through an entire army.  If you have 9-10 gold and need to run through 3-4 guys (including the castle) then this is VERY possible.

I'm going to give it a chance with my main group, but if it falls flat there then this game will gather dust.

Like Coup, it's a fast-paced (15 min) battle of wits and bluff. This time that comes in the form of a stripped-down dudes on a map game, with conflict resolved by the defender trying to guess the number of coins the attacker has placed in a closed fist. If you dislike blind-bidding and bluffing, stay the hell away, but otherwise it's another fun contribution to the microgame genre.

15-04-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Melee is an interesting game from the maker of Coup. 

You win Melee if you at the end of the game have most areas under your control OR alternatively, if you take over a castle from an opponent. 

Basically, the game lasts 4 turns, which each start with an auction for starting player. All players play one action card face-down. The start player then resolves his. He can move his units, buy new units or get 3 gold. Units cost 2 typically (soldier, trebuchet, camp), or 6 if you buy a knight. 

Combat works incredibly easily, and is triggered if you enter an area with enemies. You basically hide your money, take a couple as motivation for your troops). Your opponent than gets a guess. If he guesses correctly, you lose your troop. If he is incorrect, he loses a unit. Trebuchets kill everything in an area in one go. Knights may move and attack multiple times.  Attacking castles works a little differently, your opponent get's two guesses for each troop in his castle. 

I do like the game. I only got to try it with 2 as learning games and I think it works A LOT better with more. The rulebook is bad, but ultimately I think I got the rules correct. I see a good game here, but I think it needs some polish to shine (ie. more icons and important information on the board and ref-sheets).

I'm always irritated by the suggestion that dice are necessary for engaging, uncertain combat resolution. One of my favourite systems is Dungeon Twister's, where each player has a set of combat cards, one of which will have its value added to the unit's base strength. These are selected simultaneously, so battles become about second-guessing the opponent's dedication to winning a given battle.

Melee, a 20 minute wargame from Rikki Tahta (Coup), adds an even more genius twist: an attacker must offer a blind bid with each attack; if the defender correctly guesses the amount then they win. Money is also used to recruit units, so a player with a large army can spend less on attacking. 

There's certainly a lot of uncertainty in this, but the resource-management decisions are delicious (no-one wants to spend a lot of money on attacking, so the blind bids are likely to be low... but this is an important attack, so...) and the tense moments are better than anything I've ever seen with dice. Who wants to pray for a six when they can agonize over how well they've read the opposition?

The rest of the game is blazing fast and with tension in all the right places. Another instant classic that deserves a wider release.

[Indie boards and cards 2015 edition] {Fantasy; double-guessing; optimal 4p} This filler is a surprise: it's more fun and interactive than I expected.  The game is short enough for multiple plays in a day.  However, replayability may be low.

It is easy to teach this game but there are some minor rules / exceptions to remember.

Gold is important but it is very tight.  How to maintain a good flow of coins is important.

You really need to play Melee twice; once to learn it and once to actually experiment and poke around in the game system to see what you can do. In total that should take you less than 40 minutes.

We enjoyed it so much that we immediately played a third time.

From a simple ruleset, a tiny board and very few pieces, there is a huge amount of gameplay here. And with the 'advanced' game there's also a ton of variety here.

Coup redefined microgames a few years ago. He might have just redefined dudes on a map with Melee. With each play this gets a little better. This could easily go up a few rating points in a few plays.

2-4 players.

Super quick area control tactics game, where you attack using money!
Players bid for first turn placement and for unique special abilities. Only 3 actions to choose from so its dead simple but has great instant tactical merit. The best part is, attacks are made by secretly bidding an amount of your money, if the defender guess wrong you kill their unit, however if their right you lose the money AND your unit!

I really enjoy this game. The artwork isn't for me and it isn't as well balanced for 4 players (almost 2 1v1 battles) but the game is laugh out loud fun and not many strategy games can provide that. I love the bluffing aspect and the way you put a certain amount of coins in your hand to go to battle. I wish the game had metal coins though because holding the cardboard ones in your hand for periods can be a little gross. Really enjoy this game at 3 players and will play any time I am asked!

Jogo legalzinho, dá umas risadas boas por conta da mecânica de atacar com dinheiro. Mas é um pouco parado e isso quebra muito o jogo.

Surprisingly meaty for a very quick game.  I think if you have a group that enjoys it, there's a respectable amount of depth and replayability to get out of this game.  Some people I've found however, are really turned off by the bidding/guessing mechanism that I find very fun and unique.

A quick game with interesting decisions. Nice mechanics. I might raise the rating after more plays. I would play again.

Really requires everyone involved to get into the "battle of wits" mentality. Not thrilled with it, but good in that specific scenario.

Micro hack-n-slash. Good for what it is. Nice that it has boards for 2, 3, or 4 players.

Tactical combat game with special powers boiled down to its essence and then boiled down some more.  Fast-playing.  Whimsical art.  Some combos might be unbalanced.  Easy to teach and play.

The Indie Boards & Cards version looks cute, with good components. However, the game seems a micro game at best, and with quite limited replay value. Perhaps it will be helped by the large deck of skill cards.

Backed this on KS. I feel like it ends before it really start. Previously was a 5 but after a few plays the game wore very thin.

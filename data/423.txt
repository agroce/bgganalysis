Our group gave this a chance over the past two weekends.  Even with a player who has played these 18xx games before it kind of ended up as a long, long mess with folks not getting along and not really any fun generated.  Maybe a 3 player games would be ok, but with 5 or 6 players it's just a mess.  Don't think I'll ever be talked into giving this game any more plays.

After playing more 18xx somehow this one no longer attracts me as much as it did before.

2011-05-27 (rating 9):

A very interesting game. Usually I prefer 18xx with real bankruptcy danger while in this game it is unlikely except for some fatal mistakes during CGR starting. But still game is very interesting.

After playing it twice (with above average results), I still like the game, but prefer other 18xx games. Why? Because the idea of having to build to a certain spot to be able to capitalize does not appeal to me. It limits development of new strategies and ideas severely, too much paint-by-numbers. But it's still a great game.

RATING: 5.5
I really enjoyed this at first but it seems like there is less variability than you would first expect, the real crux of the game is how the CGR will form, either you want to aim for dumping a company in or avoid it and it's too long for just this. I prefer the nationalisation in 1861.

:cry: :what: :) :) :) Played once as 3P. Initial reaction - much more interesting than 1830, although it does suffer from the share-trashing problem of that game. Apparently its replayability suffers, but I feel like there is more mileage to be had. 

Still doesn't beat the draft and two track builds of 1846, though. Those really open the game up and make it different every time.

The last hurrah of the days when I used to play 18xx games regularly.  The loans and nationalisation add interesting new features (and some complexity) to the base system.  The poverty and reliance on loans of the companies during the early game give this one a different feel.  Aside from that, 1856 has the common virtues and vices of 18xx games.

Production quality is what we've come to expect of professionally produced 18xx games.

One of my favourite 18xx games, though the strategies are a little degenerate.  Essentially you want to use the loan mechanic to extract as much cash as possible from the Canadian government.  The result is a game that starts out with a focus on grabbing a couple of three trains (with loan money) and running for big money.  The key point in the game is the formation of the CGR, where you are trying to extract as much as possible from your companies that are falling into the government, while simultaneously trying to keep the other players from doing so.  The SR before the CGR forms is usually rather long and rather tense, as it basically determines the rest of the game.

I enjoyed the game immensely, but feel like I caught about 40% of what was going on, while playing against 5 expert stock manipulators.  Looking forward to more plays.  It's a good introduction to train games.  One of the experienced players had a notebook PC on the table with a spreadsheet to keep track of dividends and payouts which significantly reduces the downtime and game length.  The downside is that you can't see at a glance how much money the other players have in front of them.

Oh yeah, and the best part.  One of the players went against his normal strategy, dumping a couple of couple of companies on the two expert players unexpectedly, and hosed them most delightfully.  Yeah Cavedog, I'm talking about you.

I liked some of the new things this games brings to the 18xx formula, particularly the loan manipulation and the way the big nationalization is handled. I found, however, that when played on the table (as opposed to via rails, for example), it gets extremely cumbersome and drags a lot towards the end game, with very long diesel runs that need to be updated often. Apart from that, I quite enjoyed it.

This 18XX game plays a bit like 1830 (more then for example 18EU or 1861 etc...). Although it's harder to get your money in your company. So in the beginning you can play for a while with your first trains, although the 2-trains are mostly sold out in the first operating round. But when the first 5-train is bought the game rushes to it's finish. 

I raised my score to 9 : it is one of my favourite 18XX-games

The components are very thin pieces of cardboard.  To preserve my game, I've laminated all of the track, trains and certificates.  I probably will not purchase any other 18xx games due to thin cardboard.

Unfortunately, this is one of the longer 18xx titles.  Perhaps I can use the track tiles for a shorter print-n-play version found on BGG.

Do you like Acquire? Do you love Age of Steam? Do you find yourself wishing those two were longer and more involved? If so you may like 1856, a game of investing and managing Canadian railroad companies. Everyone else will be bored out of your wits! One of the few times I have ever quit a game.

One of the best 18XX title. Players can easily start their company, but need a lot of care to make it survive train development race and canadian government asking back loans. CGR apperarance make every match different. Even game lenght is moderate, for a 18xx.
The only real weak point IMO is the unbalance in private companies powers. 1870 ones are better mixed.

I was totally overwhelmed on the first playing...information overload. We didn't even finish the game, even after 6 hours of playing. I thought it sucked.

But I kept thinking about it afterwards. Moth to the flame.

Played it again, 3-p. Again, wasn't able to finish due to time constraints...but still had a great time, now that I understood the rules better. It's complex, it's big, and I suspect I will not be terribly good at it...but I like it very much.

I hope I get to finish a game soon!

My Canadian bias, coupled with finally obtaining an 18XX game of my own, probably accounts for my enthusiasm for this game depicting the early days of railroad development in Canada.

The 18XX engine is fully intact (track-laying/stock market/engine progression etc.) and humming on all twelve cylinders. Arguably somewhat more complex than 1830 but perhaps less cutthroat at the same time. One downside is that, like 1830, it is a long game. Otherwise, the mechanics of government funding of early rail expansion (loans) and the eventual founding of a national rail-line is realistically portrayed.

For fans of 18XX games, this is a definite must!

I've only played once so far and that was only a very early play (I think I had played 1830 2 or 3 times and 1825 twice).  That said, I really enjoyed it and look forward to playing it again.  It's got the 1830 stock manipulation along with a conversion to the Canadian National company.  Our game was strange with me gaining the Canadian National with only 1 share.  I doubt that will happen next time :)

A good game and one I'd happily play again.

First: I love the aesthetic of this game. The thick cardboard, the pastel colors, the clarity of the board. Beautiful stuff.

The CGR is the focus of this game for sure. I think I like it but I'm not sure. One thing I don't like is the clear demarcation between companies to start early and companies to start later. That may be historical, but it grates on me.

Fantasticaly meaty 18xx. The formation of the CGR makes the game a little confusing for some. It's a little disappointing that a slow burn strategy simply doesn't work, would have been nice to see multiple paths to victory.

My rating kept going up the more I play this as this is definitely my favorite of the 18xx games. And now, finally a 10 rating because after 5 plays there is no doubt that this is worthy of that rating. Not as mean as 1830, but money is super tight!  The fact that the game unfolds differently every time and that there are so many dramatic moments during the course of the game means that the replayability is higher than say 1830.  This game is light years ahead of Age of Steam if you like tight money rail games with a debt element but I can't recommend this game enough if you think you might like the 18xx system and games.  Fast and fun with three, stately and tight with four, and a real bloodbath with five or six players. Also works well as an intro to 18xx and is one of my all time favorite games.

Played this again recently, and while I basically enjoyed it, I couldn't also help but be a little disappointed. I think it does a ton of stuff right - there is a lot more nuance to a lot of the decisions in 1856 than there are in most of the 1830-derived games. The money management with the loans and the large number of available companies, along with the CGR, make for interesting decisions on most turns.

But, like 1830, this is still ultimately a game that turns on only a few major decision points: getting a permanent train and timing the couple times you'll have to withhold earnings. As in 1830, if you can get a good company (CPR, GT, GW, maybe LPS) to start on the first turn, acquire a permanent train, stay out of the CGR, and withhold only one or twice, you should be in it to win. There is more nuance to this than there is in 1830 - you have the loans to play with, and you have to manage partial capitalization and destinations - but I just don't think there is *enough* more to justify the rather long playing time. I enjoyed playing 1856 again for about 5-6 hours, but the 8 hours it actually took was just too many I think.

Bill Dixon was an interesting designer but he needed a stronger developer. There is way too much rules grit in 1856 (and 1870 has more still). I thought it was a little finicky at the time it came out, back in 1994, but today all the rough edges and gratuitous rules really stand out. Why the odd rule about deleting small towns at the end? Why the somewhat tortured rules for three different phases of capitalization? And why the weird flotation rules? There is room here for an enterprising gamer to turn the screws on this and improve it.

Very good game, but more involved than 1830 even and not for the feint of heart. Somthing to move on to after becoming proficient at 1830.

I was originally disappointed with this one, as a model railroader I was wanting to run trains but this is more of a business game. Looking at the BGG entry, it really has a lot of fans.

At the outset, I should note that I think my ratings are harsher on 18xx games than they should be.  I'm intrigued enough with the core ideas in the series to want to continue playing, and they certainly succeed in satisfying my desire for meaty, meaningful games. But because of the time commitment and brain burn involved, I'm rarely "itching" to play, as I am with so many good Euros.   

The big lesson this week is that I strongly prefer incremental capitalization games with low floating requirements to full capitalization games requiring the standard 60%.  Perhaps I just find the former more intuitive and haven't figured out how to play the latter well.  1856's big innovation is the Canadian National Railway system, which we got to see form, but only barely (a player went bankrupt on the same operating round).  I'm not sure how I feel about this.  As with everything in 18xx, it can be viewed as simply another feature to plan for, but I can't decide whether planning for that feature actually adds anything meaningful to the game.  In our game, I would have taken control of the CNR with a 5 train, two 6 trains, and nearly exclusive access to the best routes on the map.  It would have easily been the most profitable company on the board.  Certainly, our play was not great, but it was interesting to see so many small, struggling railroads consolidate their power into the hands of a single player.  I'd certainly play it again.

I love 1856 but it suffers to the point of being broken due to cross-financing collusion. In short:

PlayerA buys 20% of CompanyX.
PlayerB buys 20% of CompanyY.
PlayerA buys 40% of CompanyY.
PlayerB buys 40% of CompanyX.
PlayerA sells 40% CompanyY.
PlayerB sells 40% CompanyX
PlayerA buys 40% (initial) CompanyX.
PlayerB buys 40% (initial) CompanyY.

The result is that both CompanyX and CompanyY are fully capitalised and both PlayerA and PlayerB have an enourmous advantage over any player who didn't so collude. There is no reason at all for PlayerA or PlayerB to not do this as there's no penalty for defaulting and all the benefits in the world for carrying through. The general result is that 1856 doesn't get played any more...

Track building around the center of the map is surprisingly subtle.  Track building itself is surprisingly important in this 1830 derivative.  Notably mild train rush.  Never forget to plan ahead for your diesel runs!  Plays surprisingly well with three.  Partnership interactions with different (larger) player counts are delightful.

This is also the 18xx with which I have the most difficulty timing the speed of the game.  My tendency is to either play for a very short game where the diesels die almost as fast as they come out, or for the long game where the diesels run for a long time for big money.  But so far I'm bad at controlling or predicting how a particular game will evolve.

Picked up on spec because I saw it at a reasonable price and I love 18XX.

Loads and loads of companies, without loads and loads of space on the board. Haven't played yet but it looks like a knife fight in a phone booth. How ... un-Canadian.

RATING: 9
The only real 'problem' with this excellent title is with the effects of its capitalization scheme. The fact that investing money in other players' companies means giving those companies money leaves the door wide, wide open for metagame considerations which are not interesting to me.  The degree to which these considerations affect the actual game is still relatively small (given even remotely reasonable players), although larger than in the other 18xx titles I've played that feature full capitalization upon floatation.

Other than that minor quibble, this is practically a masterpiece, with a great, interesting board, a wonderfully responsive, dynamic stock market, and a mid-to-late game twist that requires diligent planning and promises great drama. I'm somewhat in the minority here, but I think this is a much better 'intro' 18xx than the so-called 'intro' 18xx titles. I have successfully introduced it to friends who haven't played anything beyond Monopoly. Make sure you know the rules, make sure you can teach them well, and play with poker chips. The stories that unfold over the course of a game, even with brand new players, are epic and rewarding.

I'm a big fan of 18xx, and have been trying to play more an more of them. 1856 was very enjoyable.

It seems like the strategy of taking out lots of loans and dumping an early company into the CGR is going to be pretty common. I've seen players try to do other things, but it hasn't usually been very successful. After all, its free money that you can get by taking lots of loans...and you want to get it OUT of the RR and INTO your personal funds. The CGR kind of bails players out of presidencies of these dying companies, although they still can be running lucrative routes.

The nationalization of the failing RRs is a neat twist. I know its been done in other 18xx games, and I'd like to see how it worked in some others before I fully form an opinion.

As it is, I'd play 1856 any time. There are enough companies to make it pretty replayable. The board can develop many different ways. I'm not so sure I like the privates, or at least their initial values seem quite a bit off...which can kind of goof up the game if inexperienced players let the Port go for cheap (for example). 

I'd love to play this one again any time.

The CGR is a problem for face to face play. This game runs a bit long, and should not be played without a moderator. There will certainly be batches of nearly identical ORs. Great tile-set.

It appears to be complete. (The correct number of tiles are there, but I did not match up each tile number.) (There is not a breakdown of the additional "die cut tokens" in the inventory, but every special token I could find referenced is there, and there appear to be a few extras.)

The game is in very good / played condition with a few exceptions. The board does not quite lay flat and there is a ripple down 1/4 of the board. The tokens show some wear. Parts of the rulebook have been highlighted in pen and there are notes in the margins. The box is showing notable shelf wear, but is in overall good condition and is sound.

Rumored to be the best 18XX in 1830 branch, well, maybe at the time of release, but certainly not right now. But it's still a nice game. There are a lot of companies, so each player will at least get one. But it's true, player bankruptcy is a real risk! So it's brutal. The interesting thing is the ability to take loan and forming Canadian Government Railway. It makes the game fresh and so many dynamics.

Specialities:
- 11 Companies
- 1 of the Companies is the Government
- Can take loans for the companies
- Not fully capitalized, companies get money from selling shares
- The requirement to float is different on each phase
- Can upgrade or downgrade town.

Definitely a departure from simpler fare such as [i]Rail Baron[/i] or [i]Iron Dragon[/i]. This game works as advertised - the mechanics are fine and the tactics are subtle - but the accounting is grim and the playing time is about an hour longer than I like my rail games to take. Just not my kind of game.

A little more chrome than 1830. It's interesting to see the 18XX system in a Canadian context. Managing the whole transition to the formation of Canadian Government Railways takes a few times playing to master. I still haven't completely gotten it. Recommended.

RATING: 9
A lot like 1830 except much more going on.  There's not as much slash and burn as in 1830, but it does have some good stock market action.  Because corporation capital comes from IPO purchases, there is a tendancy to invest into your own corporation a little moreso than in 1830.

Like in 18GL, there is a big nationalizations of railroads in the late game.  I think all players should study the rules for the nationalization prior to their first game.  It is difficult to understand the implications of this w/out knowing the rules well.

In our game, we didn't have many rr's fold into the government.  I think we probably played it pretty conservative though.

I would recommend becoming more familiar with games like 1830 or 18AL before playing this one.  After one play, it feels like the intent was to offer something unique for those who had played 1830 to death.

RATING: 7
A wonderfully fascinating game of operational and financial manipulation. The tools you have against your opponents are varied and interesting, and can be almost shocking in their brutality. 

It is quite different from many of the other 18XX games both in how companies are floated as well as the presence of a national railroad which you can fold your companies into. I think the thing I like most about is its expansive nature. The sheer number of companies and potential starts is fun to explore, even if a few of the same companies get started every time. 

I have heard various perspectives on how 1856 is broken, but that does not change how enjoyable I find the game.

RATING: 8
As i am making my way around all the 18XX games that i own, i'm noticing that my player group is getting more and more mean and that's a good thing. 1856 seems to fill that need to be mean quite nicely, with some pretty crazy stunts that can be pulled and some enormous reversal of fortune when players band together.

Will need to play this game more often, for the pleasure of discovering its depth.

RATING: 7
An epic luckless business management game. Players alternate between stock rounds and train company operating rounds. Money is tight and the Government is happy to loan out a lot of funds... at a stiff price! 

There are a lot of great marginal decisions to be made throughout. However I think that 1856 has a few critical moments that really really impact geme, such as the obsolescence of the '2' trains or the creation of the Government rail [forces companies to repay all loans or fold!]. Experienced players are likely playing for those moments, as they are vastly important events. The fallout of these has an effect can outweigh hours of gameplay, so beware and plan! An interesting bit to the stock game is the sell rule: if you part even a single share, you can no longer buy shares... so insider selling is an invitation for a hostile takeover! But then again money was quite tight, so the stock market phases are not as wheeling-and-dealing as I was lead to believe. 
 
It was my first 18xx game, and I am very interested in trying out the original 1830 now.

RATING: 4
A larger-scale 18xx title with a big map, large number of companies, and big bank.  The formation of the government rail company, loan rules, and weird staggered partial capitalization adds a lot of unnecessary "rules grit" although I'm sure the intent was to throw some wrinkles into the system in order to differentiate this title.   As a result, there are some very coarse jumps in the rules when the phases change.   The timing of this will be up to the whim of the players and it just feels way to "gamey" to me.   Turn order can make or break you, and in a game of this magnitude, that's not an attractive feature.   (My comments are based on PBEM.  The staggering amount of banking and bookkeeping involved would be enough of a deterrent that I wouldn't ever want to play this incarnation in a F2F setting.)

Played a second time, this time a full game. Might be my favoured 18xx. The train curve hits fast and some companies will not survive. There are good moves to make both on the stock market and on the board. It is also a little shorter than 1870, but possibly with a little less variety in routes.
--------------------

This 18xx has its own flavour. Everything appears to be cheap and its easier to get companies up and running due to not needing to sell half the shares. Its a decent entry in the series.

We managed to play the game till the end lately. Based on this game I'm sure it's a bit too long as for my taste and there's too much chaos in the game to make it fully enjoyable (I prefar games where I have more control over the other players' actions and do not have to watch their hands all the time). My eyes were soaring in the end. I will play it from time to time and the rating reflects mostly the playing time. 
I prefer 18AL while it lasts half the time 1856 does.

One of my favourite 18xx titles. There's little added rules complexity over 1830, but the changes that are there make for an interesting game which rewards long term planning and the ocassional bit of brutal stock play.

RATING: 9
I feel that 1856 is the most dynamic of the 18xx games.  Some people do not like 1856 due to the fact that its structure lends itself to a high probability of bankruptcies.  This is the very thing that draws me to the game.  Multiple strategies are possible (work on individual company solvency, try for the CGR, open many companies, open one, investor strategy)  It's definitely a dynamic game without any dice.

RATING: 5
Interesting but stylized (I admit some of my favorite games share this property.)  There is a huge focus on managing the CNR formation process, given modern play patterns.  This isn't attractive to me in this game, at least.

And now, if I want a game set in Canada, I can play 1867, which I like quite a bit.

I cannot find anything wrong with the mechanics. In fact, everything works well, and it's a clever game.

EDIT:  After a couple more plays, raised my rating a tad.  I'ts more fun once you start figuring things out a bit, but all of my above criticisms still stand.

RATING: 7
Lots of options, lots of variability, lots of opportunities to make mistakes, and just not a lot of forgiveness.

The Canadian Government Railroad that gobbles up all those companies which couldn't (or wouldn't) buy their bonds back is an emergency parachute of sorts. Or maybe strike the emergency because this exit can (and will) be so excessively gamed that you can see the crash coming from the other side of Canada.

The partial capitalization system used is discouraging cross-investments until later in the game which places extra importance on the track building, along with a very restricted tile set.

Many good ideas etc. but where is the game. Thank god, there are many streamlined train games.

For the more than 4 hours you would expect much more decisions but this calculus exercise just kept dragging on and on. In our game (4 persons) the play got nearly stuck as companies controlled by 3 players had all max. number of trains and fourth player didn't want to trigger the next phase.

IF all the manual arranging and basic calculation were done by a computer or non-player, the playing time would be closer 2,5 hours and I would rate this at 8.

1856 is a very solid 18xx game, and an excellent introduction game.

It has the advantage over other titles of a much lower capital requirement to launch, and this also makes it easier to play with more players.

The board mechanics and company options however make it a limited game for extensive play with experienced players, and there are better 18xx games.

Can be very long. (Our first game took about 8 hours, and we didn't even finish!) Normally, a game must be great to sustain interest for that length of time and while I think 1856 falls short, I *did* enjoy it the entire time. It's most definitely a brain-burner and not a game to approach casually.

From all those outstanding 18xx games I like this one best.  Agressive stock market, lots of track building and nice climax with the forming of the Canadian Government Railways.  The best thing however is it's high playability with different number of players.  I really love 1830 too but it only plays really well with up to 4 players because with 5 or 6 players there will always be at least one player who will not be able to start a corporation.  And - frankly - running a corporation is what makes the fun in these games.  In 1856 however, you can start a company with as few as 2 or 3 shares, leaving everyone enough room to grab his own railroad.  Excellent components, high replayability.  Recommended!

RATING: 8
First 'conscious' decision/attempt to play an 18xx game. Other times, I have been blindsided by these games, resulting in an unfavorable gaming experience. If I am not mentally prepped, this can be a torturous game to learn to play. (1870 and 1835 have been the only other variants I have played in the many years of gaming.) The stock market definitely has a 'feel', allow players to manipulate share price, control, as well as turn order. The feel of running a railroad, **really** running a railroad from a corporation perspective is unmistakable, where one is constantly balancing income flow into the company coffers, thereby reducing the value of the stock, versus issuing dividends to shareholders, thereby increasing the value of the stock. A player could suddenly and unexpectedly dump all his shares, grabbing a huge profit, crashing the stock price and leaving other shareholders holding the bag.

The learning curve is very high, because there are a lot of things that do not make immediate sense, but I believe the payoff is equally high in the immersion of the theme as well as complex, rewarding play. I don't feel like I'm treading water, trying to survive, like I do in Age of Steam, nor do I feel the openness and fluidity of Railroad Tycoon. It is a slowly evolving game, yet it feels good to see one of my companies expand on the board and getting more income.  The economics is fascinating, where the players' money is separate from the companies' money. The puzzle is how to get money into the companies, and then extract that money out into my own hands (and not my opponents). In that vein, Chicago Express is a streamlined version of this process. The only serious drawbacks to the 18xx games is the very high learning curve and very long playing time--6-8 hours or more? We played a 3 player game, and took three hours to just get to Level 4 trains. There was still much more to do when we called it quits. I'll definitely have to try this again... albeit with player aids and more mental preparation...

I'm rating this a '7' for the time being... with potential to upping it to an '8'. It's just a game that I would need to mentally prepare myself for, and not just some game I'd play on the spur of the moment.

Update (02/08/2104) 2nd play: It took over four years to get this to the table. 4-player game took about 9 hours, with 1 hour rules explanation. Two were 18xx veterans, and two were 18xx players with intermediate experience. In my first play, we only played up to Level 3/4 trains because of time constraints, so never had the chance to experience all the fun and chaos of the mid and late game. Because of some rules misunderstanding, the mid-game sort of dragged longer than it should have. Still, it was an enjoyable experience, although draining near the end. With so many companies available to start, the initial number of possible plays is staggering. There are a few rules "gotchas", but these are minor and easily comprehended for the next time. There is plenty to do here, and with the existence of loans and the possibility of being bailed out by the CGR, this has a unique story arc compared to the other 18xxs. I am looking forward to more plays. It simply begs to be played more often, so that we can begin to understand it, but it takes much longer. Compared to my early 18xx plays, I no longer require getting prepped up mentally. I'll raise the rating to an "8".

RATING: 9
This is a very nice game with one big problem:  It is too long!  My only game (3 player) took 8 hours to play.  That is just too much of one game.  I don't see why the play time couldn't be cut significantly.  The game was repetitive, especially at the end, and some of the fat could have been trimmed in the length of the game.  Otherwise, the game itself is beautifully designed and crafted.  The track laying was similar to Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.  The stock market mechanism was one of a kind and very cool.  There were a few things that annoyed me though.  1)  When players dump a certain number of shares of a stock, that stock price goes down that number of spaces in value, but when players buy the stock from the open market, the price doesn't go up that number of spaces (or at all), so there is a bias towards depressed stock price, which makes it very difficult for a company to recover from a stock dump.  2)  Each player can only hold 6 shares of a particular company's stock.  Once again, not realistic.  This prevented the majority holder from profiting after his stock was dumped.  . . .  I am glad I played this game and I would like to play it again.  The components are awesome.  It was a once in a lifetime experience to play it because it will be a long time until I am able to play such a long game like this again.  I don't think I could convince anyone to play it with me, except at a game convention.  I found myself thinking about the game all day, the day after I played.  That is the sign of a great game in my mind.  Oh, and by the way, I won!  Howard - $11,528, Peter - $11,193, and Tom - $9,311.  Not bad for the first game, although they did have to help me a lot throughout the game due to the complexity.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of a number of games that seem to have been designed as an antidote to the stock shenanigans in 1830, this uses incremental capitalisation and has a generous government to bail you out when your first company runs out of money. Startup companies are poor, which reduces the potential for a multi-train opening and a fast ramp up into mid game. This means that the game runs longer than 1830 while the excitement is reduced. Not a good combination. Tom Lehmann is also right in his criticism that this is a single strategy game. Discovering that single strategy can be fun, but the game is pretty much dead from then on, it isn't amenable to variants in the way that 1825 and 1830 are. It also takes an insane amount of time, allow 8 hours when playing over the table. A noble effort, but more recent designs have extended the 18xx system in more interesting ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was and is my first 18xx game. It was manageable to  learn and teach for our group, but I could see it being an issue for others. I really enjoy the 18xx system, the share trading is fascinating and running the companies isn't half bad. I agree with many other comments that running companies into the ground and making the government buy them is way too good. It ruins much of the feel for the game and makes the whole thing arbitrary. You can tell playing this that 18xx is a truly superb system, but this game doesn't quite do it, still I love to play it, I feel it isn't broken, but the goverment entering the market does dominate strategy. Anyway more play may ruin it, but I'll hold out for a few of the others.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

4 players, none of whom are slow although 2 were new to 18XX, took 8 hours. I knew by hour 5 that I was winning. There are elements that I'd like to learn, but overall it felt like I was doing the same thing each round, so it got tedious. I really think the game could be shortened by cutting out some of the repetition. I would be willing to play again & definitely want to try others in the family, just not anytime soon!

Not as daunting as I'd first feared. There is some flexibility in the beginning, as companies float very easily compared to 1830.

I don't play cutthroat, even though the 1830-branch is by far my preferred type of 18xx.  Which isn't to say I won't try financial shenanigans if I can get away with it, but I'm not in it to crush my enemies, etc.  I play 18xx games for the story arc.  In the beginning there are cities and potential, and in the end the board is filled with track tiles, some companies having done well and others less well.  1856 has the grandest story arc of any of these games I've played so far.  I won't dispute the contention that it's prone to player collusion, but since the win isn't important to me, I don't worry about it.

Works well with both 3 and 4.  I think 1856 would also play well with 5; there are enough companies to support a higher player number.

I'll skew the rest of these games lower until I find a version I like more than 1856. This, of the few I've played so far, is the best.

You begin the game by bidding on a handful of private companies that each provide a bit of direction for your early game (slight special powers, I suppose). In fairly short order players float huge corporations and set the initial stock offer. Into the mid and late game, you manage a portfolio of stock in several companies, looking at a.) value per share, b.) dividends generated per share, and c.) likelihood that the director of the company will try to loot the company and dump it on the minority holder (you), which might be fine or might bankrupt you and end the game. On the board, track is added or upgraded at the rate of one tile per company per operating round. Trains come in various types numbered 1-8. These numbers tell you how many cities you can run on a single route for profit. Trains also "rust" out from under you as the game goes on, creating a "train rush." If other players beat you in the rush, you will be hurting. Companies also lay a couple of stations on the board that can restrict your opponents' runs.

Most money wins.

1856 is all that but really long, with 12 public companies (a huge number for an 18xx game) an interesting map and some much-appreciated flexibility via the loan system. In the last third of the game, companies which have not paid their loans are all folded into the national railroad (Canadian Government Line). This is interesting because during the first two thirds of the game, everyone is positioning for the arrival of this massive company (one player will be the director, and other players will have some number of shares). 

18xx just isn't for me. Way too long, with the vast majority of effort spent on the hunt for simple error. What a waste of time.

Don't like it anymore due to the incremental capitalization.
---
The incremental capitalization can cause an odd dynamic as we are playing a gentlemen's rule that nobody buys stock of another player until he's fully capitalized to avoid collusion. At some point this rule has to be cancelled but usually not all players have the same understanding when this should happen. For that reason it's not my favourite 18xx anymore but I still like it.
---
Upgraded to 8/10. Probably my favourite 18xx so far now that I've played approx. 20 games of 18xx.
---
This was my second 18xx-game. Having only played Steam over Holland before, I didn't notice some changes from the basic system which the experienced 1830-players among us had to get used to, e.g. the partial capitalization of companies or the quick setup of operations. The two outstanding features of 1856 are loans and the Canadian Government Railroad. While the first feature can take you out of the race when handled wrong, I really like the merger of undercapitalized companies into the CGR as a second chance for some players. It can give some motivation to still do your best to compete even when the situation looks hopeless. It didn't work out for me but I could imagine that it does. With two 1856 newbies it took us six and a half hours until the game was ended by a bankruptcy.

RATING: 7
This is a major-league heavy, deep game. So much to keep track of, the screwage is thick, awesome integration of trains and stocks. All in all, I love what this game is doing. Major down side is the game length and it's inaccessibility to any but the most hard-core gamers. Given the time commitment, you have to make sure that your group's gaming style is consistent with your own; down time and analysis paralysis loom. But if you're up for it, it's awesome.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite 18xx's, and definitely the one I've played the most. 

Possibly the best use of simple mechanics to get the feeling of outrageous robber baron dealings (unlike 1841 which almost collapses under it's own weight of rules). I love teaching new players 1856. At some point they'll be asking "so, how do I pay back these government loans", answering "you probably won't, instead you'll loot the company, and let the government take over the insolvent shell that's remaining". You can just see the lightbulb going on above their heads when they realize what kind of a game this really is.

Initial rating based on solitaire play to learn new rules.

This game brought back fond memories of the old AH game, 1830.  There's a bit more flexibility with loans available, but the same potential for backstabbing and passing off a bad railroad to another player through the stock market.  I still haven't figured out how the Government railroad works yet, but it looks like it's a good twist on the old 18xx formula.

The 18xx series does have a couple of potential pitfalls.  Newbies are almost always going to be out of their league for the first few games as they learn the tricks (probably as victims of more experienced players) and the games can go long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've played once.  Nicely produced game, and a chip off the ol' block from 1830.  Enough changes to keep you on your toes.  The whole government loan thing is a major twist, and one I didn't effectively manage as other players did.  This is a game worthy of study, and I will look forward to playing it again.

A great game of railroading in the Ontario penninsula.  From Detroit to Oshawa.  Railroad companies can take out government loans, but if they are unable (or in some cases unwilling) to pay them back, they are pulled into the Canadian Government Railway.  Also allows players to "float" railroad companies with as few as two shares sold.

RATING: 7
In overall, it has a lot of interesting mechanics but it's a bit too long to play and it has some downtime.

I like the fact that plays in multiple phases which are played differently and that events triggers these changes of phases. This is how you can screw people over.

The other thing I like is that you can try to convince other player to invest in your company.

I think the problem that I see with this game is that there is a lot of unjustified exceptions and restrictions that they could have been removed to make the game simpler. Ex: restricting the number of certificates you can have, the number of train per company, etc.

I like the fact that after the middle of the game, the stock market part of the game should be more important but the problem is that even after going through half the game, many companies did not sold all their stock yet. So you get situations where 4 companies out of 6 have their share value below their starting cost. So buying these shares mean losing money. So if all the shares could get sold out faster, there would have been more buying and selling afterward.

I also don't like the fact that the number of trains reduce by increasing level. Having like 5 trains of each type would have been OK. Since the new trains are disappearing faster than the old trains, since there are less of each, you never have the time to truly benefit from them. So you always end up having an hard time running your company because you lose trains and end-up not making money.

The tile placement is OK, it's just weird that you don't pay for the tracks. In fact you are just spending time.

I also don't like the fact that later in the game, you play much more company operation rounds than share buying. Why add an exception. Eventually, there will be no shares available and this phase will get shorter. No need to do it artificially.

The learning curve is like chess: the few first time you play, you always try to make the best move every turn. But you don't know any strategic moves until you become and expert.

18xx are railroad wargames with financial themes.  I like the ideas and mechanics of this and several 18xx games, but I find the gameplay not very fulfilling.  It also takes way too long to finish and with so many good games I just simply don't have the inclination to invest all that time into 18xx.  I prefer Age of Steam as a railroad much, much more.

My rating for this game presents a problem.  I have chosen to rate this a 6.5 because I like many things about the design but this is not a game I would like to play particularly often.  It is a design that I respect for the richness of gameplay but I don't enjoy it as much as many others.  I find the stock manipulation a little cumbersome and I have found myself screwed by my lack of knowledge of the tile manifest.  I enjoy how the rules build upon the engine of 1830 and provide for some thematically variation with the government loans and possible state owned railroad company.

My first real 18XX, as my previous experience consisted of Poseidon. It is not very elegant, but that's the price paid for the realistic touch. Need more plays to see where my rating will settle.

Very solid 18XX variant.  It brings in debt but also the way the companies float is totally different than 1830.  When the first 6 is purchased the Canadian govt railroad open where you get 2 shares for each bankrupt company that cannot repay debt.  I liked the game a lot and would play it again.

It seems that many of the companies way play similarly but there are so many different companies, it would not get stale too soon.

After 3 games, I'm still hopeless at this one. I find the timing incredibly hard. I'm always broke and sad, no matter my actions. Can't really say I've enjoyed a game yet -- Not sure why'd I'd pull this one down over 1880, 1846 or even 1830... aside from the Canadian focus!

1856 has lots of fun variations from 1830.  The cash is much tighter as corporations receive funds only as shares are sold.  Building towards a destination city is another interesting concept similar to that of 1870.   The Canadian Government Railway (CGR) is a fun addition that can be used and abused.  In many of our games, the player who sent the most nearly bankrupt corporations into the CGR, won easily.  Other times, the CGR was a complete bust.  Many, many ways to successfully play this game.

3 players, 6 hours.  Watched the clock near the end, but otherwise the afternoon flew by, with a definitive 3-act structure that would put any thematic game to the test.  The benefit of 1856 and the 11 possible companies means that even if you make an Act I mistake you're not out of the running.

(Rated 9 for long-game days, significantly lower for regular game nights.  I haven't played the game with more than 4 players; I'd like to see it with 6.)

2017 UPDATE: Haven't played as much with my freetime for long game nights is virtually zero.  But the rating remains.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (5 players) : The game is on par with other 18xx games meaning that it offers interesting decisions. Plusses for this particular game is formation of Canadian Goverment Railways that gives loans to companies in early game and later absorbs those companies that cannot repay loans. But all these minor details add more rules and there are too many tiny things to remember (especially without too much 18xx-experience).

The big minus is the length of the game that was 8,5 hours with 5 players (no one had previous 1856 experience and all but one had prior 18xx experience). This could go down 1-2 hours with experienced players and/or 4 players total but it is still long. Perhaps a bit too long because even though I liked the game there are other 18xx-games that give (to me) enough of the same with much less of playing time. I think I'll give the game at least another try because at least 3/5 players wanted to try it again.

update: Second game took 7,5 hours with four players with 1856-experience and played till bank was broken. Still a bit too much although the game didn't felt that long at all and was actually a good experience. My rating for the game would be higher if it could be played 2-3 hours faster in our group but it doesn't seem to be possible.

Notes for faster playing: We used poker chips and run/stocks-lookup tables in both games to speed up the game a bit. For second game we also used "train run value in last OR"-table that really was helpful, no need to remember those and you could use it to keep note of the highest one if you have to calculate several different routes. You could keep this thing on paper but by having a table for it also helps a bit on stock rounds when you can better calculate/estimate value of stocks at glance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1856 is a splendid historically themed stock market game. When playing this you need to think hard because every decision counts. That is just fantastic. There is no luck in this game and absolutely no catch up mechanism. 1856 takes hours to play and that is why it hits the table much too rarely.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.15
A very fun game, though recommended for 4-6 players.  Watch out though, some companies can really destroy their own stock with their need for cash! 

Tough for new players to see the nuances in this game.  Perhaps try starting with an 18XX game that's a little more simple (1860?).

Canada. Incremental capitalisation, using Par values (like 1830, unsold shares do not pay, pool shares do). Otherwise similar to 1830 but with loans. Corps can take 1 $100 loan per OR at 10% interest, but on the 6T all loans are called in. Presidents might use personal cash but may not sell stock. If loans are not paid off, the company merges into Canadian Govt Railway and you lose half your shares.

The map is slightly larger than 1830 and there are 11 companies + CGR. Yellow dits can be downgraded into regular track or upgraded into circle cities.

I finally decided to give an 18XX game a try. I knew that it would be long and take time to learn, but I must say, it was worth it. There is a lot to think about and a lot to calculate. Be careful not to be left with a train that will become obsolete in the near future, something I learnt early on. Also, even if you are behind, you can always come back. Surely not for everyone, but if you like a long, calculated, back and forth game, with a screw over others factor (sometimes to help you advance, but sometimes just for fun), this is a great game. Have now played several times and it was always well worth the time.

This one is an interesting one. I'm not sure how much I liked the end game of this one since it just seemed to be who could run the longest D train which just felt really long. I did however like the loans and the companies merging into the large Canadian company was fun. I didn't know exactly how it worked, nor did I understand the loans fully till it was too late, but I enjoyed the game well enough.

I feel like there are much better 18xx games that take around 4-5 hours. This one was rather relaxing, but it just felt about an hour too long.

Dec/17 - played in 2016, and now again in Dec/17.  Played 18AL(?) before too.  Recalled today why I struggle to really enjoy this game, and it is the repetition of doing almost the same math over and over again.  Would be better with: a) clear rules, b) mini whiteboards to track each company's train run value.

RATING: 9
My first experience with the 18xx games. My first impressions at the start of the game were that it was quite abstract (hey where are the cubes to deliver?), not so pretty component wise and overwhelmingly complex, but I started to like the 18xx series so much after that full game and especially after playing 1870 also - no luck factor involved and so much company scheming and stock market speculation/manipulation possibilities. I don´t think 1856 is the best of the 18xx games but it is very good one. I think I would like it even better if there were no diesel trains in this.

edit:
So, after 2,5 years and 22 plays of other 18xx titles we meet again, 1856. Great game, very dynamic, tight map. Loved the play - rating: 8 -> 9.

[floatleft][ImageID=162206][/floatleft]This was the 2nd game in the 18xx series that I have played. I played this game before playing 1830 and I did not fully appreciate the nuances to this game the first play through. I wish I had played this after 1830 because this game is so different in comparison. 1856 has a lot going for it and this 18xx derivative surpasses its predecessor in more ways than one.

Check out my comment on 1830 for the full details.

With respect to 1830, this game takes a few more hours to play and has more emphasis on screwing over the Canadian Government, as opposed to your own company and other players.  Depending who you play with, there can be significant downtime between turns, but it's not bad because you usually need the time to think of your strategies.

My least favorite 18xx by a fairly comfortable margin. My issues largely stem from how there is now a default/standard way to play the game: you start one out of just a handful of the available companies early on, you take loans every chance you get with no intention of paying them back (maybe you even do this with your second company too), and then the bulk of the game comes in the SR immediately before the CGR forms, as everyone jockeys for position. My personal opinion is that the game lasts entirely too long given the number of false decisions in it. One of the rare 18xx games I will never suggest and even lobby hard to not play in person.

December 2011: Dropped from a 10 to a 7.

Simply too long. The game is interesting up until the CGR forms. By then, all the corporations have permanent trains and should be simply draining the bank until it's empty. However, during the end game, players are trying to squeeze every dividend from their corporation, which makes it feel like an exercise in optimization.

What I really enjoy about 18xx is capital management and the risks involved in doing so. Once all players have paid off their loans and have acquired their trains, all the tension in the game disappears.

December 2009: UPDATE: Still a 10.

After repeated playings, you realize that to play well, you have to take a lot of risks. Also, you learn how to manipulate the game system, then in turn learn how to really screw people over, especially in the stock purchasing round.

You also realize how timing is a very important issue; you might not want to do something as fast as possible; you might want to, for example, postpone that stock purchase and save up money to do something more effective and nasty, like taking over an opponent's corporation when he is short on money during the stock round.

This, however, might not be good for six players simply because the competition is very, very tight. With relatively experienced players, you have to play the beginning rounds almost perfectly to prevent being really, really screwed over and end up having a crappy or not even any corporation to run. This game is frequently over after 90 minutes, for example, because someone goes bankrupt before the 5, even 4 trains are available. Also, there's a greater chance of players resigned to playing only the stock market, which might be a viable strategy, but really, really boring. Even the formation of the CGR, which adds a huge layer of strategy to the game, is frustrating for those players who end up part of the CGR, but not the president. Those players probably had only one corporation to start with, so that they end up simply as the audience of the most spectacular part of the game when huge dividends are paid out.

That said, 1856 is a very interactive game; it almost feels like a negotiation game since players can't resist themselves from discussing (or rather prognosticating) the strategies of other players. Players frequently want to co-operate: track may be used by all players, so players starting in one area of the map may want build a profitable network together. Also, some stock market manipulations are more effective when more than one player is trying to do them.

Anyway, 1856 rewards repeat playings because (1) games will go by much faster and (2) players will know how to implement the sneakier tactics in this game.

RATING: 7.25
This is a mediocre train game, but an excellent robber baron game.  This game almost certainly will require additional plays to formulate an accurate assessment.  However, my initial reaction is disappointingly mixed.  The train portion of this game felt very scripted (like it was on rails).  The company management portion of this game is very complex, particularly in perfecting the timing.  The stock portion of the game was the most impressive part of this game; very interesting and well done.  I guess the biggest surprise was that no part of the game seemed particularly fun, and for a game of this length, I wanted more than an intellectual payoff.  Of course, part of that may have been due to having little time and attention to divert away from figuring things out to focus on having fun.  Even so, I definitely want to play this again.

RATING: 9
Loved the first game - was only three players but it took approx. 7 hours (and we all had 1830 experience).  Would definitely go faster once familiar with the added rules and map.  The Government bailout mechanics add a whole new dimension!  For biz sim geeks, the 18xx system is just so fulfilling and plays unlike any other board game.

Played the full game twice now. It's a great variant of 1830, but it tends to be on the long side. Last time it took more then ten hours after reading the rules. Therefore I lowered the rating by 0.5 point. Maybe we try again but with a limited amount of money for the bank.

Also played the short introduction once. Which was a good game to get my two sons (7 and 8 years) familiar with the company actions during an operationg round. It's a great way of learning the game.

RATING: 9
Played only once (4p) and have yet to establish whether this is just a good game or a very good game. My playing group likes the idea of a stock market system, and the aspect of screwing each other, so it should be ok. Have yet to play 1870 (which I bought in the same deal as 1856) te know what differences are important and which of the games we like best.

UPDATE: Have since played 1870 twice and 1830 numerous times. Have played this one for the second time just now, and my ranking of the three would probably be 1)1856, 2)1830 and 3)1870. The choices in 1856 seem to be tougher than in the other two. 1830 plays more instinctively, and 1870 has a strong focus on tile laying and destinations. 1856 IMHO has the best balance in strong points, being destinations, financing, tile placements and stock management.

My first experience with 18XX, I had high expectations with 18XX games.

It's a great game, no doubt about it, lots of details and lots of options, with that, comes a lot of rules, and I mean way too many rules...It's definitely not a game that a 1st timer will enjoy as much as the other more experienced players, I saw players thinking and playing in a way I didn't even knew it was possible, I was always lost in the game, not knowing what I should be doing. I think 1st timers should play lighter 18XX games, I hope I'll learn the sistem by playing 18AL or 18GA and then get into the heavier ones of the 18XX family.

Important Note: Not to be played in a week night when you have to work the next day!

----------

Tom Lehman says everything that I want to, but he can say it far more eloquently than I.  So without further ado:

"A game that seems pretty decent initially, but don't look behind the curtain: not only is the game badly designed, but it's actually broken with more than four players.

I strongly believe strategy games are about interesting decisions. 1856 presents players with a plethora of false decisions: Should you take loans for your first company? Hell, yes, snort them for as much as you can. Doing anything else is just silly. Should you invest in other companies initially? Hell, no, that's just solving their initial cash flow problems -- what do you think this is, a stock investing game? Should you withhold dividends or try to pay off your loans? Are you crazy, man? Your first company is just to buy in your privates, pay out dividends, set up your second "real" company, and be tossed into the national RR. Should you hold on to expensive stock? No way, man, the stock track is linear, so as long as a company looks to be someone's real one, dump your high priced stock and buy more shares of the cheaper, real companies. And so on..."

And this is my problem with 1856:  the optimal decisions are obvious, so play becomes completely scripted.  The game doesn't really start until after the CGR emerges, which is typically around 3 hours into the game.  Why play a game where the decisions are already made for you?

RATING: 7.3
--Oct2014-- The partial capitalization (with loans, and a holdback until the company hits its destination) adds nuances to the game that I'd not seen previously.  Add in the formation of the Canadian, and there are some intriguing decisions to navigate.  I'd be delighted to play again - but the time slot is a bit on the lengthy side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of those games that you will think about for a day or two after you play it.  With the depth of decisions and options to mull over, this one can drag into one of those monster 4+ hour sessions, which is about the only negative thing I can see about it.  The resources are achingly tight and there are several moments in the game where a bad move can cripple you.  For me that is where the fun is.  I liked that I had to out manuever my opponents during the Stock Phase, and carry that through into the action phase, deciding wether or not to run one of the train companies into the ground.  Don't get trapped into thinking this is about running the companies well...  think about what you can profit from regardless of how fiscally responsible the company is.  Great game.  I definately want to try this one, and other 18XX games, more in the future, but because of the huge time commitment, it's not going to hapen a lot, and even then only on 'all-day' gaming saturday.

A solid game, but several ORs too long. I would like to try this with a $9000 bank next time. Takes about 5 or 6 hours with the default bank, and the last hour or so is just endgame grind.

Decent game, but it does have an early game winners/losers situation depending on which companies are able to sell extra shares and thus get more capitalization which can be used to take out more loans and buy more trains.  These early game companies which manage to get two 3 trains are then are just dumped into the national railroad when the 6 is bought, preferably after making their destination and looting all of the company's money by buying a train off of another company owned by the same president that is in better long term financial condition.

One of my preferred title in the 18XX series and the one I got the better score over the years.

I like route building and improvement and if you play at the right table there is a lot of railroading to do.

The game pays something to his age, the rules are surely an improvement to the classic 1830 for example, but still does not includes any minor-mayor conversion or merge, apart the end game nationalization, that makes the more recent titles of the series richer and less static.

Enjoyed my first play, the CGR didn't seem to be that great.  I really wish I had both the time and the people to get in plays of 18XX and other train games more often.  I am not a 18xx veteran but this one is rather difficult as the train companies all start out severely undercapitalized.  You can take loans but then risk the company not being able to pay back the loans and be folded into the CGR.  Will take several plays to figure out strategies for this game.

A game that seems pretty decent initially, but don't look behind the curtain: not only is the game badly designed, but it's actually broken with more than four players.

I strongly believe strategy games are about interesting decisions.  1856 presents players with a plethora of false decisions:  Should you take loans for your first company?  Hell, yes, snort them for as much as you can.  Doing anything else is just silly.  Should you invest in other companies initially?  Hell, no, that's just solving their initial cash flow problems -- what do you think this is, a stock investing game?  Should you withhold dividends or try to pay off your loans?  Are you crazy, man?

No way, man, the stock track is linear, so as long as a company looks to be someone's real one, dump your high priced stock and buy more shares of the cheaper, real companies.  And so on...

And, in 5+ player games, when everyone does this, then there aren't enough national RR shares to go around, so then the game devolves into hot potato and a 2 hour stock round as everyone tries to wiggle out of being the player who fails to get all his shares redeemed when the national RR forms (as that player is guaranteed last place).

There are far, far better 18xx games out there, such as 1830, 1861, 1826, or 1841 (first edition).  1856 is ok, if you are just learning how to play 18xx, but that's it.  Once you truly figure it out (and play with other competitive players who have done the same), the game becomes far less interesting.  I would give it a 4, except for being broken with 5+ experienced players.

(Full Disclosure: I have designed some 18xx games, none of which I mentioned above.)

I especially like the incremental funding and the government loans which cause a sort of financial bubble that everyone can see growing but you just need to ride it out and sacrifice some company to keep the others from falling into the CGR when the bubble bursts... but then again the CGR might become highly profitable as well and is a low-risk stock to hold.

Seems like more options than 1830. Too long for most eurogamers.

In our games, the stockmarket was quite stagnant compared with 1825.  Also, the endgame dragged a bit - trying to figure out all those Diesel runs and if there was an upgrade for another $10 anywhere.  

Still, a good game, but not in 1825's class.

One play of the base game.  Looks promising but no verdict yet.

1 play. 5 players. This was a very enjoyable game but we didn't finish after 5 hours. It was long but I keep thinking about this. I like the stock market manipulation and it is more business-oriented than the other train games. I am not sure that this is an appropriate introduction to the 18xx series though.

2008-01-27 - Wow! I finally finished a game of this. It was a 3 player game and we finished in about 6 hours! Wow, I am moving the rating up 7->8

Commented after one 7 hours and 45 minutes (including the rules explanation) game with three newbies. We calculated each round using chips, would have been faster with Excel or pen and paper.

The start of the game felt good as well as the mid-game, but when the diesel engines hit the board I was generally just waiting it to end. I'm not saying it was a bad game and the next game in this family might be better, if we use some Excel help. Of course the number of newbies was stalling the game down a little bit, but I don't think I want to play another game this long again.

Rating based on one play. Way too long for my taste. For the first two hours I didn't know what I was doing, then I was hopelessly in last place. Not an experience I want to go through again.

I enjoy 18xx games, but I can't get them to the table with my group(s). 

Sold it.

The Canadian Government Railway is the big thing here. How to manage the loans and drop bad companies to CGR. Otherwise straightforward 18xx.

Haven't played this or 1870 in many years.  I recall enjoying the many angles the game offers:  buying/selling stock, laying track, and running trains.  A very satisfying experience.  Unfortunately, the game is rather long and that makes it difficult to get to the table.  I acquired this unplayed copy in 2012, but have yet to play it.

My introduction to 18xx. Have only played one PBEM game. Got destroyed. A lot going on, and it's going to take a few plays to figure out what is best.

Claustrophobic map that is just narrow enough for companies to rub shoulders with each other very early in the game. Competing for track space and stations keeps this game interesting. The loans can really add salt to the wound if they're stacked onto a penniless company and dumped on an unsuspecting player. However the CGR could've been more refined and implemented like the national railway like in 1861 instead. Otherwise a very solid 18xx title.

While I did not encounter the problem of collusion many seemed to have alluded to, 1856 did prove to me that I much prefer the rail building over stock manipulation in 18xx.  I am not sure whether the loans is a good idea or not, but it did add an interesting dimension to the company's treasury.  Unfortunately, no corporations got nationalized during our session, so I can't really comment on that aspect of the gameplay.

I'm also not very impressed with the strategy that you are suppose to bleed as much profit as you can from your first company only to dump it on someone else or let it be absorbed by CGR.  This means to an end feels awfully convenient and somewhat anticlimactic.

A lot more cutthroat than I had expected.  There were many instances where the tile laying got very competitive and sometimes even disastrous for certain corporations.  Unfortunately, due to its length and the aforementioned issues, it's unlikely I'll pick 1856 over other 18xx.

01/27/08 - From what I can tell, this game really seems like the next logical step forward from 1830.  I'm really looking forward to this, but would like to get a little more mileage out of 1830 before graduating to this one.

there's much more game here than on first sight.

I am atrocious at it, and played my first game to the almost constant sound of "you can't put that there" when placing animals

Worth checking out, it concerns the need to get all animals onto the ark but with even weights and keeping certain breeds apart (and large carnivores from eating everything) AS WELL as being the person who placed each type of animal the most.

This makes it a weird combination of rcard game and area control, and it was good fun

[ESP] La idea del juego es ir subiendo animales y comida al arca de Noe antes de la llegada del diluvio universal.  Sin embargo, no es tan sencillo. No pueden mezclarse animales de clima calido con clima frío, y más aún, no pueden ponerse animales herbívoros con carnívoros que los superen en tamaño. Y como si eso no fuera poco, hay que preocuparse de no desbalancear el peso de los animales en el arca.
Hay 4 tipos de animales: temerosos, útiles, peso pesado y lentos. Además se puede subir alimentos al arca. Quien haya subido más de cada una de estas variables será quien gane el juego.

urg.  one of the best-themed card games i've ever seen, perhaps the best.  started out as one of the best card game rules explanations, too.  loved the bits about carnivores, not tipping the boat, etc.  it began to wade further and further into the exception territory, though, and soon arrived at a point where i felt one was playing the exception system more than the game itself.  can i place here?  no.  here?  no.  here?  yeah.  so much rules analysis just to determine potential placing before an actual decision is to be made.  it seems like house rules could rein this one back into being something fun, but i don't like it at all as-is.

RATING: 7
Has hedgehog, must own.

We played this for the first time last night and whereas I'm usually quickly able to pin my likes and dislikes down, for once I'm not sure one way or the other. Throughout the game my ongoing impression proved to be as stable as Noah's tub, and even the very cute Meercat on the front cover doesn't decisevly tip it over. Which, considering how much we enjoy our Doris & Frank over here, makes me wonder if there are clouds gathering on the horizon.

Making someone explain the do's and don'ts of this game is murder, and not supplying a quick reference card to newcomers should be a criminal offence all of its own. Print out that BGG aid, don't board this ark without keeping that life-jacket close at hand.

It then quickly transpires that the loading rules are actually superbly obvious, and the symbols on the cards to keep you right are second to none. However, each played card has so many implications that overlooking at least one of them will frequently lead to trying the impossible, or worse, getting away with it, which no doubt will force you to accept an impossible situation later on, til it sorts itself out. I wonder how many people realized in their first game, well after the event, that Noah's feet should have been sticking upside down out of the water as at some point moving the dobber was forgotten, and then had to deal with an impossible  situation until it straightened itself back out.

Just accept that the first time you play this, the game will be riddled with situations that break a rule or two, something that will probably become less of a problem with replays, the same way as the obviousity of placement restrictions quickly transpires.

It's not a quick filler in both senses of the phrase, and maybe I just hoped we had another "Zoff im Zoo" on our hands.   However, these are also the people behind "Ursuppe", and when it turned out to be much denser than Zoff, and also not a card game in the truest sense, I had high hopes that strategy and decision making would be as challenging as in that one. With appealing elements like boat-balancing, restrictive placement rules that offer all sorts of strategic options, uncertain turn amount, special abilities that allow for interesting alternatives, and a genuinely strong theme that fits like a hand in glove, this gain-most-influence-across-5-scales cutie could be a gem.

So what's troubling me? The luck of the draw can really favour certain players, and since this isn't a quick game that will see the many instant replays that Zoff does, committing players for roughly an hour that can easily be ruined by unlucky draws isn't an obvious  vote-winner. But maybe more frustratingly, quite often it is hard to find even one legal placement option in your hand, let alone have a choice. In which case the game dictates play, rather than offers it, even more so as the cabin-situation for your next turn is utterly unpredictable. A lack of choices I find much harder to forgive in a game that aims to be more strategic.

I fully suspect our next games to be quicker, cleaner, more strategic, and more enjoyable. I'm sure we'll get better at using the cards we have to great effect. I'm not sure however that when all is taken on board, this will change many lives. But after eleven releases d&f are getting cuteness down to a fine art, and for that reason alone I can see it become a persuasive suggestion as an attractive filler, even though it probably isn't. There is a lot here that hints at potential, but after one play it hasn't become immediately obvious if this baby floats. Nevertheless, this Ark at least will get a welcome second outing.

RATING: 6
Ark is called otherwise Arche Opti Mix in German, I think it's a play on the phrase "ark mix optimization", fitting for this game.   The illustrations are quite cute, and the rules for putting animals into cabins (weight, temperature compatibility, and eating habits) are quite clever.  Combined with a scoring mechanic based on placing certain types of animals into cabins successfully, and you get a moderately quick game with a good slice of puzzle element.

Like any puzzle game, some people could get hung up on deciding what animals to place where.  Playing the game in stride (like you would play Tikal in stride) helps a lot, and makes this a very pleasant outing.

This is definitely not a kid's game.  The rules are fairly involved, but they are very consistent with the theme.  It takes a few plays to get the rules down pat.  It works quite well with 2 players even though the box says 3 or more, and we like our Shem variant with two.  Great fun.

Great components.  Fun artwork.  High quality cards with a linen finish.

RATING: 7.5
A strange one this - rather complex for a filler, and requiring much thought. Also rather long for a filler at about 45 mins, yet ultimately the scoring, theme, artwork (which is reminiscent of Frank's Zoo) and card play is very filler-ish.  Seems to fall between two stools.

Another Fun Doris & Frank Game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yes, there is a lot of fiddly rules - but they all make thematic sense so can be internalised quite quickly.
Yes, it can be chaotic with 4-5 players - so stick to 3 player
Yes, luck of the draw can matter - but its a game of risk management and in any case only takes 40 minutes tops.
Yes, its prone to AP -  so agree to play at pace.

Despite all that Ark is a fun, quick game that fits ideally into a lunchtime game rotation, well worth the investment in getting familiar with the placement rules.

This game looks warm, cute, and fuzzy but as you know, looks can be deceiving. I am really not sure there is a game here, basically all you try and do is play against the system of animal loading requirements. While this may seem easy in theory it is frustratingly difficult in practice and mind boggling boring. I want to load this cute animal on here but wait, he cant go there cos he will be eaten by the one next door. Should I care? This animal is to fat to go there, this one is to hot, to cold, will fart, will eat the vegan one, scared etc...and so it goes on. Arrgghh..get me off this cursed Ark!. It is a great idea, great theme, but the execution falls flat and is hugely claustrophobic. Could have been so much better.

RATING: 8.5
Clever mechanics (I especially enjoy the added difficulty of keeping the ark from capsizing), fun artwork, and neat little creaples (creature meeples) combine to make an amsuing and enjoyable cardgame that is both fun and strategic.  Also, you can save the Dinosaurs, dragons, and even a unicorn.

A cute, decent filler with a somewhat confusing ruleset that might hinder me from playing it much with non-gamers, which is a shame since there is a lot of other stuff I'd rather play as filler with gamers.  The exceptions as to what can be placed where are just too convoluted sometimes.  The balanced boat rule is cute, but also adds another exception to placement that's easy to overlook and screw up.  Overall, a fun little game once you get everything down, but ultimately maybe a little more work than its worth.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play: Disappointed. I'd read this was a puzzely sort of game and found it to be... well, less than puzzely? This really felt like a game where your hand completely dictated your plays. Most of the game was looking at your hand and realizing that because of all the little rules there was really only one card you could play so it seemed like all the plays were pretty obvious. Since there's only two real ways to score (and one is clearly better than the other), choices aren't that interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Other people seem to like this more than I do.  Really seems like a puzzle to figure out the best placement of an animal.  I like puzzles a lot, but with this one, the challenge is remembering all the special cases of who can & cannot go with who.  This would suit me better as an online game where the computer figures out the "what works & what doesn't" options for me.

RATING: 6.5
“No!” This is what the game is called where I play… Because people always scream “no” when somebody tries to place an animal in a wrong location because of the huge amount of restrictions! The restrictions are what make the game I think. It’s actually quite a brain burning card game because of this as you try to get your animals on board the arch. 

I love area majority games, which this one actually is, though it certainly plays out much differently than any other area majority games I’ve played! This is because of the spatial element of the game in which you are trying to place the animals in their cages which all of the playing time is used on; when playing a card which can fit in a position you just place one of your animal disks on the corresponding type of scoring card – and at the end, the players with the most and second most get points. It’s actually a quite ingenious design as it’s such a totally different game than any other I’ve played before! Fans of area majority actually might not like it simply because it doesn’t feel like such a game at all. I liked it quite a bit, though, and I’m considering buying it.

Pretty fun game.  Have heard that it bogs down with five players, even four.  Jeremy Avery says that one should never play just one card, if it's a type of card where two COULD be played--draw instead.  Omnivores SUCK.  It's good to have a decent hand at the end, if you have enough chits for extra turns.  I got stuck with a bunch of chits, but only one card.  At least the extra chits are worth points ...

RATING: 7
This is one of the cutest games I've seen; it's up there with For Sale and maybe cuter than the other Doris-illustrated games I've played.  I made the mistake of trying to teach this game at 10:30pm without the rulebook in front of me and without having played it...player aids are useful for remembering the little exceptions!  (Next time, next time.)  It can suffer from analysis paralysis when players try to figure out where they can stick their animals legally.  The rules aren't complicated, but there are many things to keep track of--scoring, whether animals will eat each other, whether the ark will capsize, and so forth.  However, I don't mind the AP so much in this game, because the animal cards are so cute that I can stare at them while waiting for others to play.

I enjoy this. I just prefer a bit more control than the rules allow as written. My proposed house rule is to allow either/both card draws to be from the face-up and/or face-down pile (e.g. TTR, China, etc.), rather than restricting the 1st draw to be from the face-up, and the 2nd form the face-down. It's ultimately a majorities game, so having a bit more control over which areas you exert your influence is a good thing to me. Love the art. Like Frank's Zoo, all the various relationships between cards makes things take a bit longer than one would expect for a game of this weight. At least for the first game or two.

Components: Wonderful illustrations, and good iconography. The only thing that could make it better would be something on the special cards describing their actions.

Experience: What a bizarre game. It's an area control game, but it's quite difficult to play even a single card at times, and so I almost find myself wanting to play cards whether I'm competing for their areas or not. I'm not sure what the strategy should be here; without knowing what's in my opponent's hand, there's no real way to block someone.

Bought this for about $20.  Noah's ark, trying to fit all of the different animals into appropriate cabins in the ark.  I think of it as a game of things you can't do - you can't place an animal here because of this reason, etc.  It takes some thought.
Darryl Thiessen and Jason Hill like playing it.  I have to reread the rules each time though.
Ark Extra Mix adds in some new animals, some with some twists to them.

It's a game I like when I play it, but the rules take a lot to explain, and at least one game to understand, and it's just hard to get to the table.  But once that happens, it's an enjoyable majorities game.

A quite deep game despite the Doris artwork. There's a lot of conditions and exceptions to be observed and the whole thing is a 3 dimensional tile placement problem which then feeds into a whole separate subgame of influence-in-areas. Its quite tactical, rather than strategic, since your best play will be heavily influenced by your upstream opponent.

RATING: 6
Players assist Noah in loading animals onto the ark, attempting to build majorities in stuff loaded in five categories (heavy, slow, useful, food and shy).  On a player's turn you can either draw cards into your hand, or load cards from your hand into the ark (and build those majorities).  Rain is forecast, but of course you don't know exactly when that fifth rain card will appear and begin to end the game.  The first game is rather bewildering, as animals and food have to be carefully loaded as to not upset the delicate balance of the ark, and the card play is rather constraint-based.  It all begins to click pretty quickly, and Doris' art is stunning.  Good game.

Cute game where you are loading creatures onto Noah's ark.  Neat ark balancing mechanic (to make sure the ark doesn't capsize) and interesting rules about which animals can share rooms inside the ark.  After some plays this has lost some appeal.  It's a little too technical and rule heavy for the cute little game it promises to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Harder than it looks, because your cards are so tightly constrained that you spend most of the time puzzling out where (if anywhere) that you can play them.   Can be frustrating.  Due to the heavy constraints, I don't think there is very much strategy here.   If you like working out the card play, you'll like this game.   Also makes a good family game and the art is excellent.  The more I play this, though, the less I like it...  it's too frustrating not being able to play many of your cards.

A strange game that will regularly baffle a few people. I think the problem with the game is that much of the time you are mainly playing what you can, rather that going for the majority scoring cards. Interesting and inventive card play, as well as great art, but the scoring is an issue.

RATING: 5
Area control in a card game?  It works better than I thought it would.  The mechanisms are clever in that you have to balance the weight on each side of the the Ark so that it doesn't tip over.  In addition, you usually don't want to put carnivores in with other animals as they would probably eat them.  The herbivores shouldn't be placed with grain rations.  These rules feel fiddly at first but then start to make sense.  How does the area majority fit in?  Well, when you play an animal or supply you get a point in the category related to the animal/supply (ie heavy animals, slow animals etc).  My biggest issue with the game has to do with the card display (kind of like TTR) where players can take cards from.  There are some special cards in the game with some powerful effects and the randomness on whether you can take one has a big impact on the game.  I think a good variant would be that you're not allowed to take special cards unless you're open a pen.

Learning Curve in having to memorize the card placement rules. I often spend more time double-checking where I can play a card rather then why I'm playing it.

Definately starts at a nine.  I can't see my rating shifting more than a point downward, and I can see it going up to 10 as well.  We'll see.  Some luck yes, but great theme, funny, and a good quick filler in general.

Edit:  Boy was I wrong.  I'm not sure if it was just the expansion or what, but the last game I played of this was excruciating.  It's frustrating that certain players can dam up the stream of orange disks.  It's painful to figure out all of the miriad of possible combination violations to place any given animal ANYWHERE.  I can see this dropping much more than a point.  In fact, it's a 6 currently and I could see it dropping further.  I'll try it again without the expansion.

Edit: It dropped further.

I love the "cute" artwork but the game has a "heavy" feel not commensurate with its cartoon images. There are many things to take note in the game, which accounts for its "heaviness" but the "heavy" decision-making in the game comes mainly from the constraints imposed on players from the rules and card draw - not much interaction in the game. Still, the theme is fun for those who dig it - helping Noah load up the Ark - and my high rating rests primarily on this premise.

Played 5+ times.

2008 JUN 04 - A simple, delightful placement game where players are trying to load animals onto Noah's ark. Each animal has different requirements for diet, climate, and weight -- not to mention that Niah has to make sure that the animals don't eat each other or the provisions. The rulebook is a tad intimidating fdor such a little ga,e but I think it's well worth the effort.

2013 AUG 30 - Revising ratings, this has since become more obviously fiddly and doesn't get played as much.

2011

A card game with charming graphics, nice wood components, and is delightfully thematic.

Rules are easy and clever and pertain to loading animals according to their threat to others, diet, weight, special needs (speed, shyness, etc.)  It's educational by referring to these characteristics. 

It is thematic to the end, when a deluge triggers the game end and slow animals can't be in the last load. 

The rules are easy because they are pretty much intuitive.  My complaint is that when placing a card it is very hard not to make a mistake or to forget something because there are a dozen things to check & remember.  I am considering making a check list--something I have never done for a game.  Instead of concentrating on the upcoming move, we were all making sure placement, payment & scoring rules are followed.  This slows the game up.

It is very satisfying play even with the luck factor in the draw of cards because the luck is seasoned through card selection and scoring flexibility.  I originally rated it at 7.5, but lowered it just because everyone continuously made errors and each play required everyone's attention, even after several games.

A fairly complicated game of placing animals on the ark in such a way as to get the most points while avoiding tipping the ark by putting too much weight on one side or having the animals eat each other.  Despite the cute artwork, there are enough special rules that only real gamers would consider it fun.  There are some interesting decisions once in a while, but much of the time there are not many valid options either.

Fun hierarchy card game. I like the 'balance the boat' mechanic (you can't put too many animals on one side) and animal cartoons.

A good card game with a fun theme fit. Fairly easy to teach but the various placement rules can be confusing for new folks. I recommend open hand play for several rounds as a teach aid. It doesn't really affect the fun of the game. The game also works well to help kids learn to evaluate multiple choices and weigh out their results in a theme and game that they enjoy.

The artwork is classic Doris. Though we do have discussions each play as to what exactly the meeples are. most agree dinosaurs but some interesting things have been spotted by folks when turning them.

RATING: 8
The situations in the game are so transitory and your hand is so small that it's pretty difficult to do much planning.  Even planning for your next turn is dicey.  However, the game is great fun and offers a constant stream of tactical puzzles.  Additionally, there are ways to set the odds in your favor for future turns.  This is the sort of game where you must be ready to seize whatever opportunities present themselves.  I enjoy the multiplicity of interlocking factors to consider, the urgency created by the briefness of the game, and the spectacular and whimsical card art.  All in all, a wonderful experience.  As others have mentioned, you'll want to have a player aid available to any new players.

Ark is not a serious game, but it requires serious attention to detail. Simply seeing what plays are legal turns out to be not so simple at all. You must play your animal into a cabin of the correct climate that is not already full and that contains no animal that will try to eat the new animal and that likewise contains no animal that the new animal will itself try to eat, taking care that the new animal’s weight will not unbalance the ark, and so on and so forth. Whether you enjoy Ark will depend largely on whether you enjoy grappling with the multitudinous restrictions on placing your animals into the ark. More specifically, Ark is a good choice for someone who enjoys devoting a fair bit of thought to a game, even if that game has significant randomness that can upset all of your plans and analysis and puzzling. If that sounds like a frustrating style of game, then you’ll want to give Ark a wide berth.  My guess is that you might enjoy Ark if you're a fan of games such as: Babel, Attika, Goldland, Himalaya, Cafe International, Australia and Expedition.

This is a very fun game, albeit it isn't as cute as you may discern from the cover. 

The water is rising and you need to load up animals to the ark. But you can't do it willy-nilly!! There are rules!! Carnivorous will eat meat, so can't put them together. Omnivorous will eat your provisions, so can't put them together either. Now watch the weight of the animals, otherwise you'll capsize the boat. Oh, mercy, how will we ever get all these animals on the boat?? You will. And for each type of animal you'll get a chance to fight for a majority win of that type. 2nd and 3rd in line count as well, so the fight for points is great. 

Cute pictures of animals, yet pretty vicious game if you want to win. And it's not easy!! And in my book, that spells a great game. I recommend it wholeheartedly.

(After one play)I was mostly disappointed with this one. The cute art and theme suggest that this would be a light, fun game. Unfortunately, the nit-picky rules bog down the fun-factor. 5 "types" of cards, each with variables for size, climate, and diet make for too many factors to track casually and easily. I think once you're past the learning curve it's probably okay, but I didn't have enough fun to make the voyage. **UPDATE** Played again, and my impression hasn't changed. Neat idea, but not as intuitive as it should be.

Fun pictures and I like the mechanic of heavier animals tipping the ark to one side or the other. A bit too many restrictions on where and when cards can be played to really present a lot of strategic choices. Much of the time, there was only one card in my hand that could be played in only one place. For learning this many rules and conditions, it should be a deeper game. Still, it's not bad, and once you get all the conditions memorized it can be a fun diversion.

First played this on Feb 22nd, 2007.  The rules started out sounding lengthy as I remember looking down and seeing R.... on page 10 with some to go.  After the rules were finished, I had the feeling of, what are we suppose to do?  During the game I reference the cheat sheet (which was very helpful), yet I still was asking, "can I play this here?"  After the game was over, I had the feeling that I still didn't know how to play.  I would have been totatlly lost without the cheatsheet.  Having said that, I enjoyed the game (I actully won as well) and would like to play it again.  I'd recommend giving this a shot, however plan to play your first game as a test round so everyone can get the rules down.  This game is probably not for everyone as there seem to be a lot of rules to absorb.  As for the strategy, there appears to be some in there as well as lady luck (in cards drawn at the right time).

Ark is a cute, light card game about the ethically questionable bible story.  The cards are pretty restrictive, perhaps a bit too so, as carnivores don't like rooming with other carnivores, herbivores will eat rations, warm-climate animals must go with other warm-climate things, the boat must be balanced on each side, etc, etc.  The game provides an interesting perspective on the genre, but I think the drive-out special ability cards are overpowered and the cards, in general, too hard to maneuver with.

I hate the word fiddly but it definitely applies to this game. Tracking the balance turned out to be a pain! Anyhow, this game languished on my shelf for a year and a half because I just didn't like the sound of it after reading the rules.  I should have left it alone. Cute but not fun.

RATING: 6
Definitely a Frank and Doris game. This game seemed OK, but not exactly exciting. Pick up the cards, put them in the best spot, try to not pick the same type as everyone else. Mostly boring. The only fun aspect was getting to save the Brontosaurus from extinction. Alas, due to the shy nature of the Unicorn she was stuck in my hand at the end and disappeared into mythology.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (May 2014)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game so I wasn’t disappointed. It is a cute tactical game with some interesting choices. It is harder than I initially thought though. The rules are very easy to teach and the gameplay is (generally) fast so it is perfect as a family game. I think it plays best with 3, with more, the downtime can be excessive for me. Ark feels very thematic, the game mechanics makes sense within the game context making easy to remember the rules.

The game situation flows and change very quickly so you can’t plan ahead, still you find hard choices each turn. It is not easy to place your animal as there are lots of restrictions. Ark is a majorities game and you have little control over which categories you can play as many times lady luck is not with you (lots of luck on the game), also there are some special animals the break the rules, they are neat to play, but it is mostly luck if you can play one or not.

Perhaps the playtime is a bit ling for such a light game. The art is great.

I will play again if requested, but for now Ark is off my wish list.

Draft the animal cards that best suit your needs. Play the cards into cabins (max three animals) in the "ark" ... but make sure none of the animals eat each other, and that they can share a climate.

We've had a number of games of this now, it's one of our regulars and it's gonna get lots more play. Had some games with "non gamers" and although there's still a warmup time with each it's been enjoyed all around.

More depth and brain burn than you might expect.

Be aware the rules are more complex than you might expect too... somewhere between Settlers and Puerto Rico for complexity ie much more than Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride for instance.
---------------------------------
After one play with two players (not spec'd on box or in rules)...
Very neatly integrated theme and play. A little slow to get started the first time as you pick up on who can't go with what, but well balanced and definitely enjoyable.

It could be because I own the game, but I think that there is a fun game hidden in here, but it requires a few plays to get down into the meat of it.  The rules are quite overwhelming and initially it is difficult to find legal plays.  I bet that there is room for some clever card play and hand management skill, but I don't think I'll be able to convince anyone to play this with me.

Strange little game.  Seems fiddly rule-wise for the experience it offers.  Somehow the silly theme and pictures don't go with the (in my opinion) rather complex ruleset.  It is falling into the category that makes me say `let's play something else,' but I'd be willing to try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An interesting enough game, but it needs a little more. There's a few mechanics I like, such as how the weight shifts around on the ark, preventing further/restricted placement of animals on one side until it balances out or swings wildly to the other side. There's a bunch of fiddly rules about placement to keep in mind, but I suspect they would become more intuitive. What's not intuitive is some of the illogical pairings that arise...like mosquitoes chasing away snowmen. Wha??

After 2 plays, I'm not quite sure what to make of this game. At its root, it's just a horribly simple "area" control game. The twist is that placing in the "areas" is complicated by the limits that are set on boarding animals into the ark. It sounds interesting enough, which is why I bought it. But, there's very little if any strategy to placing animals on the ark. You do the best that you can turn to turn while following a thematic, but fiddly ruleset. I really don't think there's anything more to it than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played couple of times. First games are a very challenging ones, because of all the placement rules: "you can put your omnivore here and here, but not there because of...". I also made player aids (in finnish) to make playing the game little easier and I found it really helps. Still, the rules are too difficult compared to the game which is quite light - so something has been made wrong? That's sad, because all the components and the card-design are well-done. Conclusion: sold my copy (which had the autograph of Doris Matthäus).

Ok, everyone, the big storm is coming so start loading all the animals and provisions two by two onto the Ark.  It's quirky fun and fascinating with fabulous art by Doris...  It takes a little while to adjust to and understand the "flowchart-like" rules between the inter-relationships of all the animals & provisions cards and their effects on each another in the Ark.  Also, don't tip the boat over - no overloading allowed.

Not a profound game in any tactical sense but dripping with theme.  I found most of the positioning rules are obvious if you think about them (with the possible exception of shy animals)- you don't need a reference card to remember that herbivores eat plants.  A few semirandom rules (such as drawing a card when you start a new cabin) that were hard to remember though.  And a beautiful llama card.   I had a bit of trouble not picking my cards on the basis of attractiveness- who wants to take vegetables when you could have a dik-dik?

What you do is: determine where you can place your card according to the several limitations and then choosing one of the few allowed spaces. The first part is long and boring, the second should be interesting but is often obvious.
There's some tactic; no strategy is really possbile.
Scorekeeping is a bit fiddly considering that's simple a "majority" system.
A reference sheet would have been nice.

RATING: 5
It's actually a kind of area majority card game, but with a very nice and unusual theme. I do feel there are too many placement rules though. It's a lot of work to figure out which card can be played where, and then you haven't even begun to think about a strategy.

Unique card-laying game with area majority feature. You need some clever strategy and careful hand management. There is a little room for bluffing, too.

At first rules can appear too complex, but in fact there is no arbitrary rule, all fits the theme well. After a couple of plays you'll be used to those rules.

Love those animals!

Another fun game from Frank & Doris. This one can give you a headache while trying to figure out which animal CAN go in a cabin with the ones already on the table, but I like it.

NL: probeer de Ark van Noach vol te laden. Alleen mogen de zware dieren niet allemaal aan 1 kant, want dan slaat de boot om, koukleumen mogen niet in 1 hok met kou liefhebbers, de carnivoren mogen niet bij de kleinere omnivoren, anders vreten ze die op, etc...

Well, I think I like it, but the badly translated English rules on BGG and the cards in the box and the convoluted game play make me not totally certain.  Hope to play again with a better grasp on things, but sometimes placing a creature is really trying.

12/2015:  Another play and similar feelings.  The placement rules are very convoluted which makes it tough to see what to do, and many moves are taken because it is the only move that will work at that point.  However, there are some good moves to make, and some bad moves to make and thus some strategy for winning, so it probably will stay around a while longer.

I would like to give this one another shot as I think my initial "5" rating may be due to the fact that it was late at night and I thought it was going to be a quick/cute game.  It's a brain burner.  You're trying to place animals in the ark and there are a ton of placement rules depending on whether they're carnivourous or not, etc... to top it off you need to balance the ark so it doesn't capsize.

An interesting concept for a game.  There are a number of requirements to put animals on the ark.  Too much wieght on one side will tip it over, carnivores will eat herbivores smaller than them, animals who like it cold can't share quarters with those who like it hot, and more.

The first game will have many humming and hawing over moves as everyone invariably forgets one or two of the conditions when they try and place an animal.

This is a neat little card game about trying to fit animals with a number of different preferences in limited stalls on Noah's Ark.  For example, you can't put carnivores with animals they'd eat, you can't put herbivores with your fruits/vegetables, all critters who like warm temperatures have to stay together, etc.  Plus, you have to make sure the boat isn't heavier on one side than the other.  It was fun trying to puzzle out which animals could fit where.  That said, there were a LOT of little rules that were very hard to remember, causing a lot of confusion.

Some nifty ideas, but this is more of an excercise than a game.  Each turn you have very few (if any) moves, and it takes you a hell of a long time to figure them out.  A kids game that makes your brain hurt.  Then the end is just typical "majority rules" scoring.  Yawwwnnnn....

Sure it's cute with all the "liddle aminals" (and the big ones too) and refreshingly thematic, but the inherent stumbling restrictions makes the game painfully slow. I do like the pet factor to spring a surprise on certain majorities, but again the fractured status washes away all feeling of competitive tension. Sadly, not a game I wish to board again in a hurry. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Adorable artwork. Gameplay is fun but can be frustrating if you're unlucky with the card draw. A small amount of strategy in judging the best areas to play into, as well as trying to keep a balance of how many animals of which type you have played so far. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hates a significant degree of luck in their games though.

Improving with repeated plays.  It seemed overly complex at first, although a second game (and Franke's reference card) helped.  I'm not sure just how much control the players actually have, although once players grasp what can be done I've seen some neat moves planned and executed.  Long-term, I'm not sure how it will hold up, but it has the cutest Koala in gaming. 

Long-term, the answer was "trade it away".  Too complex and brain-burny for the A-prone, and coming back to it after a year (or three) meant re-learning the game each time.  IMO, not worth the effort.  Not a bad game by any means, just not one I needed to own.

It looks like 'a kids game' but plays a LOT tougher than typical kids games, with many opportunities for clever strategy, keeping your eye on what cards you need to take and how to play them to make things difficult for your opponents and barely outscore them in the payoff categories. If you could get them to play it without looking at the pictures on the cards, this game would be deep enough and satisfying enough for many Euro-gamers.

RATING: 6
There are some interesting ideas rolled into this game, but it feels too long and complicated for what it is.  The theme and images are meant to appeal to younger players, but the restrictions on playing cards are so nuanced that even adults will be constantly violating them and consulting the rulebook for clarifications.  If it were streamlined a bit, it would be worth playing on occasion, but it just doesn't play smoothly (which may be why the game can take more than twice the specified 45 minutes.).

RATING: 6
A well themed card game and wonderful bits give this a 8-9.  But often the little rules here and there get people mixed up and I'd rate this as a 5 then.  But averaged together I say 6.  If played a lot with the same people who all understand the "little things" this would be rated higher.

The charm of this game is definitely the originality of the graphics and the easy mechanic. It is fun to play and within everybody's grasp. The one (major) difficulty is that its application can become quite complicated. The various forbidden combinations can quickly discourage people. In fact, even for people who have already experienced the game, it is expecially difficult to get them to try a game because they know they'll have a headache by the end of the game!
Therefore, I decided to lower the rating from an 8 to a 7, based on comments attached to ratings.

Compreendo a história por detrás do jogo, bem como o trabalho que o deu a conceber, a arte é engraçada e ser uma produção independente tem de ser valorizado, contudo, o jogo está credível mas pouco jogável, pois é muito complexo para aquilo que deveria ser, ou seja, muitas são as jogadas em que é preciso os jogadores se juntarem para verificar se é ou não legal o movimento e é muito fácil um jogador se esquecer de mover o indicador de equilíbrio da arca, por exemplo. Não me vai apetecer jogar muitas vezes...

An area control game where the areas you can play are limited by the cards already in play.  But nicely (in my mind) the restrictions make sense within the theme of the game so are (to me at least) not that difficult to remember.  What is a bit trickier is learning how to play the cards effectively and not getting stuck with a hand that is hard to play out.

RATING: 6
Wonderful artwork and slightly-above-average gameplay.  With five players it's much too slow, and even short-term planning is impossible.  I'd probably rate the five-player game a 4 or 5.  With three players it plays much better, with interesting decisions about what type of animal to vie for majority-wise, and the possibility of planning more than one turn ahead.

Ark is heavier than you'll think when you first open the box, but still not that heavy.  And while it's a pain at first to keep track of the various animal-placement restrictions, we found it manageable before too long.

Fun and cute little game.
But, to be honest, there are way too few decisions to be taken. Typically, if you can place one or two cards, you go for it, and if not, you draw. Drawing one card face down each time gives little control on where you will eventually place your dinosaur markers, and how many points you'll score...

Clever area-majority game with the unusual feature that the ruleset largely consists of conditionals (it's almost all "you can't play card X here because...") which takes a while to assimilate.

Ultimately, an experiential game. The cardplay mechanic, with various limitations for loading animals onto Noah's Ark, is enjoyable and thematic. It really makes the game. However it's also complex enough that many 1st- (and 2nd- and 3rd-) time players have problems. And, in the end, the scoring system feels somewhat chaotic, hard to control, and not entirely in tune with the main gameplay. I've really enjoyed this every time I've played, but as a gaming experience, not something that someone was trying to win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First off, Doris' artwork here is one of her best: whimsical, fun and suitable for the theme.

In essence, the game is an majorities control game: players draft animal card and place them on Noah's Ark: this gives them control in one of the 5 majorities.

When the game ends (triggered by the last rainfall card), players score points for control of majorities.

The headache comes in placement rules. PLayers have to manage the animals (weigh, type, food, etc).

Please, please print yourself the reference card!

RATING: 6
A little clunky to learn given the specificity of certain rules (Shy animals will only board the boat on Tuesdays while carrying a green umbrella, but not if Survivor is on telly because they'll be watching it). But I suspect worth the effort in the end, because its a tricky little number, but it ultimately amounts to 'area control' (of the different categories). I just can't get excited about area control games, but I think this one is fun enough to play sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As much as I like this game, and I do, I think it is going to be hard to find people to play this with.  First of all there a bunch of rules and conditions, that, while they make sense logically, are just tough to take in at once.  Often, we were caught having to go back to the rules just to make sure we were playing the game correctly.

I feel, that beyond this learning curve, that this kind of game is only going to appeal to serious gamers, but not just any serious gamer.  The game relies on a large growing logic puzzle as its foundational meme.  So if people can't wrap their head around it, they are going to have problems.  In addition, the downtime can be irritating, but the fortunate thing is that I wouldn't want to play it with more than three otherwise it would go too fast and would be way too chaotic, so with three the downtime isn't awful.

If the stars are aligned the game is lovely, complex, multifaceted and beautiful.  A master design for a niche audience.

I liked the game and would definitely play again. Much more of a brain-burner than I thought it would be. One complaint is that there are alot of little fiddly rules (shy in this cabin? what is this creature's special ability?) and should come with a player aid. We played a rule wrong as well in that if you start another cabin you can pick up a creature. Probably best with 3. Can't see it working at all with 5.

I remember seeing Ark at the game store and wondering if it would be fun for my children.  It's so rule heavy that even an adult has difficulty placing the cards.  I think many of the best game designs have simple, streamlined rules that are easy to learn yet the game is very challenging, games like Acquire and For Sale, to name just a couple.  Ark is the opposite.

This really is a very good game.  Simple enough for the kiddies, enough strategy to keep the adults going and possible to mix the two (if the kids show some mercy and gamesmanship).  Also, you don't need to teach people how to play, just shout at them when they make a mistake and they'll soon learn.

RATING: 6
[RGG 2005 Edition] {Animal, religious; area-majority, secret-goal, drafting; optimal 3-4p} Ark is a tactical card game with a good theme. It's a deep game, not a filler and is more suitable to experienced players. Player interaction is indirectly strong and luck is low.  It is not highly fun for me as the game turn is not efficient enough - players tend to think long in placing the cards.  The card placement rule is not intuitive but it can be mastered with a few games. Player aid is needed for effective play. The "Pet" rule is quite nice: it adds minor strategy value to the game.

The graphics are cute and nicely illustrated but it may be too busy for some players. I am still annoyed by large boxes :angry: The dinosaur pawns are clearly reused from Trias. I think ship-shaped markers fit the theme better.

[Expansion] I don't think there is a real need to buy the expansion cards. The basic cards are already good enough and have nice replayability. Comparatively, the expansion cards are expensive. Besides, I don't think a Snowman is thematically sound. Finally, it's provides only 1 reference card - Ark supports up to 5 players, why not providing 5 reference cards?

Don't put this off as a simple kids game.  Yes, it has kids appeal because you're putting animals on an arc, but there is so much more to this game.  It is a very nice hand management, area control game with a pretty solid theme and great artwork. The rules are more complex than one might think, and the initial play may seem a bit overwhelming with the varying placement rules, but the placement rules make sense and the rules are not that tough once things sink in.

I've played this 3 times now, but each time with a different group of friends.  Explaining the rules has become a chore.  But, the cards are quite cute, and the game does usually work out pretty well.    The rules aren't too hard to learn, but you have to run through all the rules in your mind for each play.  I've noticed that this can be difficult for some people.

It seems to work ok with 2 players too, even though it is not specifically listed in the rules.  

Update: I've played this many more times now, and am still keeping my rating at 5.5.

Simple game, yet causes a ton of brain burn with trying to arrange cards that can all co-exist. "Ok, the carnivore can't go here because of that animal, but it can go there, but that means I won't be able to get this card into play..."

We use an unofficial two player variant of dealing out 12 cards for an imaginary 3rd player, two per rain card, and then two final ones as pets. Worked fine.

OK, so *I* like it, but the second group I showed it to couldn't wait for it to be over.  It was late and I think they were expecting a really simple card game from Ark.  Folks, this is the card game version of Siena, if that makes any sense.  It's a good game, but there are so many little rules that you have to remember that it takes a full game playing to actually have them all down.  Remember, first game = learning game.  Play your second game of Ark for real.

Quick and fun, usually.  It does have problems with too many non-intuitive play restrictions that force players to constantly take back illegal moves.

Feels a bit too chaotic and dependant on the cards you get.

A bit tricky to understand and teach, but once you've played once, the play barrier should go away. If you enjoy puzzle-like games and having to puzzle out a situation when it's your turn, you'll probably like this.

Need to play more.

Debes embarcar tus animalitos en el arca de Noé. No es tan simple ya que por ejemplo carnívoros y hervívoros no conviven bien. Además el arca debe estar balanceada en peso para que no se hunda..

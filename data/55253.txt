130929 This is a game caught in the netherworld of being good but not great.  I enjoy playing the game but I don't have any interest in going out of my way to obtain it -- or even playing it in the future.

111021 Fun light euro...I'm not sure if I love the game or not, it could go up or down.  I maybe liked this enough that I will  try this on BSW even though I generally dislike playing online...but obviously not enough to run off an buy it.

After second play, I think I like it more...if I get more plays I can see this going up to an 8, but at least I don't see it ever going down to a 4.  I will definitely need to play it again and see if the get two guys in and walk the third guy in slowly strategy is a surefire winner (hopefully not for the sake of the game replayability).  I've never played Keltis, but I like to think of this as a chaotic boardgame version of lost cities in that its abstract and numbers based and the mechanic allows you control the pace of the game.  Apologies to the folks who actually know of what they speak (ie actually played Keltis).

update:  I doubt the lost cities analogy really makes sense, because its a bit more random than what I suspect Lost Cities the boardgame works (I haven't played it).  But that said, I'm really enjoying it.  I doubt it would go higher than 8 cause its a very fiddly setup and I suspect that it is a game that may well be solved (if not already).  But until / unless I find out the solution, I think I'll have fun with it.

If it had interesting art it would go up to an 8

Played once at Essen, not terribly challenging and a bit chaotic, especially because I felt that the rewards for being first off the island were not compensated for enough by extra cards...plus the luck involved in the card draw dominates the final points. So not good enough to buy but I'd play it again.

Atlantis is sinking and players are frantically trying to travel his meeples safely to another city.  Players play cards (colour coded) to help their meeples travel along the long treacherous road.  As meeples travel, they pick up treasures behind them and create rivers as they travel.  As rivers are created, players have to bear a cost as they travel across the rivers.  Players have to strike a balance beteeen collecting treasures and helping their meeples across to the safe city.

Good points: The game is easy and yet needs strategising to win the game.  Players definitely need to strike a balance between collecting valuable treasures and moving meeples.  The game tries to add replayability as the board is formed only at game start and players will face a different board as each game of Atlantis is played.

Bad points: The first player to send all his meeples to the safe city is most likely to win due to the way of counting points.  So a good strategy may be to move meeples to the safe city as fast as possible.

RATING: 7
This is a combination of a hand management and race game.  the race is about staying together with the other players.  If you let one player race ahead, you'll get caught out in the trail and lose... badly.  The hand management part is tied to the cost of the gaps.  If you get only high point tiles, you end up overpaying for every crossing.  Combine this with being slow and you'll be looking at a negative score!  While often compared to Cartagena, the game really stands on its own with a very different feel.  The movement mechanic is related, but is not identical in any meaningful ways.  Likely an under appreciated game that should get more plays.

Very compelling little game despite being fairly simple.  Players are trying to escape the doomed city of atlantis by sending their meeples down a constantly shifting path to dry land.  

You are essentially juggling points for speed as each player races to get all three of their pieces to the end of the line.

While being first to clear your meeples from the board doesnt gaurantee you the win, it does give you a huge advantage over the other players.

Despite it's appearance as perhaps a relativly straight forward and abstract game it playes wonderfully and feels quite different from other titles in my colection.  Happy to own this one.

First play: Set up is long winded and very fiddly. Initial impressions are this has huge similarities to Cartegena (which I really dislike). Start player seems to be at an advantage despite the cards added to the following players. Player 1 leaves an early patch of sea to cross and following players chances are can't afford to burn cards to cross. start player skips away collecting point tiles whilst the pack scrabble around to make small gains.

Perhaps there is more to this. It's over quickly so I'd be happy to play again but it does seem to be hugely influenced by start position and cards drawn.

Super quick.  At first, I thought it would take a bit longer but I did not do a good job at looking ahead for big jumps.  I like games like this...reminds me of Big Points and Cartegena.  Watch where you are moving and what you are opening up for your opponent.  This would be awesome with 3 and quite probably 4.  This was good and looking forward to playing it again.

Decent 30 minute "super filler" with a strong luck element in cards dealt, but some clever strategy in deciding if it is worth racong ahead and possibly being bounced over by other players or staying behind a little to pick up some more high value tiles and making more gaps to stitch up other players. The key might be to get 2 meepples to the end asap to get more card pickups per turn and then take a long time to get the last guy around, making lots of gaps beghind you and picking up a lot of points from high value tiles.

Very simple rules and game play.  It seems to really favor the start player (or any player that can jump ahead to get to the mainland first).  I actually think that the start player advantage gets more pronounced in 4 player games than in 2 player games.  It does seem to be a fine 2 player game, which is nice.

My most polarizing game. Folks either love it or hate it. Leo Colovini seems to have a track record of this, but I think this game is cool and I want to smack anyone who disses it immediately (which happens at least half the time I introduce this to new players) I don't get the detractors because the artwork and gameplay are top notch in this. A fun filler that is kept dust free if only because of the incredible Michael Menzel cover art.

Juego de reglas sencillas,pero con cierta profundidad a la hora de planear una estrategia. La mecánica recuerda un poco al Cartagena 1 (es del mismo autor). Se trata de huir con tres fichas desde Atlantis al contienente, a través de un camino en el que se van abriendo grietas que hay que salvar. El movimiento se realiza por coincidencia de losetas con símbolos en cartas jugadas. Al moverte, te quedas con la loseta libre inmediatamente posterior al lugar ocupado por tu ficha.

Partidas cortas y entretenidas.

Es un juego que tenía Patri por casa muerto de risa y que no utilizaba y me le dejó allá por el 2015 o 2016 y acabó diciéndome que me lo quedase.
Es un juego sencillito en el que los jugadores tienen que huir de atlantis hasta el continente a través de un camino en el que se van abriendo "brechas". La forma de avanzar es con unas cartas y saltando de símbolo en símbolo.
Tiene reglas sencillas y es corto de explicar y de jugar. 
Es muy sencillo y perfectamente apto para no jugones. De hecho, para los jugones es bastante probable que se quede corto.

RATING: 6
This is a superficially simple game with hidden levels of subtlety. Very similar to Cartagena, but more enjoyable, and more rewarding for straightforward play. In Cartagena, you kind of have to move all your pieces along the track together or it gets too expensive to advance; in Atlantis, there's a definite advantage in rushing one of your pieces to the end. You can be punished severely by letting your opponents create gaps in the track ahead of you, however, so you still need to be racing the opposition with all your pieces if you can.

The negative reviews made me a bit hesitant on this one, but Cartagena is one of my all-time favorites so I took the plunge.  As others have said, this is reminiscent of Cartagena with a little bit of That's Life flavor thrown in, and I think it works pretty well. We played 2 player which worked very well - I have some concerns that 4 player might prove too chaotic, but only time will tell.  For now I prefer Cartagena (easier setup, less fiddly, feels a bit "cleaner"), but I'll gladly pull this one out too.
Edit:  Can turn into a real brain burner if you let it -- I'm a little fearful of pulling this out with my AP prone husband!

RATING: 6
Update: After a dozen plays or so, I'm beginning to think the winning strategy is to get dealt the cards that let you go farthest on turn 1 creating a gap behind you so that others can't pass you without paying for gaps that you created. Once gaps are created, go for the valuable tiles, and be the first to get a guy to the end. Feels kinda automatic. BSW is a good place to experiment and try different things. It's well under 10 minutes per player.
---
Bought it but it showed up on bsw before I had a chance to play my copy. Only played on bsw so far (which has a pretty nice implementation). After bsw, it's hard to imagine playing this face to face due to the setup and trying to look at your cards to figure out where you can go. Not sure how this got away from having Cartagena in the title, as clearly that's what it is. But you get cards automatically rather than having to reverse. And symbols on spaces disappear after use, revealing either another tile (some are stacked two-high) or water underneath. Water then has a cost to cross. Seems pretty tactical so far.

(Played 1 time during Spiel 2009.) Atlantis appeared on my to try-list because of the similarity to Cartagena. It would be wrong to think of Atlantis in terms of 'Cartagena 2' (or even 3), but stating that both belong to the same class of games would be quite correct. In Atlantis, the players try to get their meeples across a rather unstable road. The road is made up of tiles showing an image and a point value. When making a move, a player plays a card from his hand, and then moves one of his meeples to the first tile showing the corresponding image. If that tile is not occupied, his move ends there, otherwise he must play a new card. After his moving is done, he takes the first tile located immediately after him—and that may be several tiles away as the tile pickup creates 'holes' which represent the waxing seas in which Atlantis reportedly drowned. The catch of the entire affair is that in order to cross such an open stretch of water, the player must pay a number of points equal to the lowest point value of both tiles neighbouring that body of water. Then there's a few rules in place about redrawing, about bridges which allow free passage for everyone, and what happens if your meeple reaches the mainland (and safety).

In theory the game sounds rather nice, like a more complex Cartagena, in fact. But in practice... I'm not so sure. We played with four, and saw nearly all of our meeples bogged down in the first stretch of road. There were so many little open spots that crossing them all in a single swoop would be terribly expensive. As a result, the game locked up bigtime, and saw one player who was lucky enough to escape the quagmire walk away to the mainland, a higher card redraw, and eventual victory. I don't know whether we played a rule wrong (although we didn't utilise all options offered to us by the rules) or whether this is something which just happens with 4 players. I can think of no way in which the near-stalemate can be avoided, really.

As a result, this game fell very flat. Leo Colovini has been known to release horrible crap onto the market before, so at this moment in time I'm not sure who is to blame for our mishap: rules error, groupthink, or designer. I might play again, but I'm not actively searching out the game for the time being. As it stands now, I much prefer original Cartagena: the movement rules are more streamlined; in addition the mechanics of that game feel less 'hammered' into place. And there's less of a computational burden, too.

[b]Update[/b] Thanks to a lottery I was given this game for free, and could play it a bit more. It was quickly established that the strategical space of Atlantis is very limited: one player rushes towards the finish line, creating expensive gaps in his wake; the others try to grab as many expensive tiles as cheaply as possible so that the final passage to the mainland does not disrupt their score too much. But that last malus is a painful one, and to date I haven't seen anyone winning that way unless, perhaps, the lagging players cooperate by not placing their bridges until the very last moment. It makes for a somewhat pointless whole which I'm not altoghether keen on. I wonder what would happen if I curtail the rather and likely too powerful double- and triple-card draw bonuses: you would still be able to rush towards the mainland, but at a price. Alternatively, an extra point bonus for collecting sets of tiles would strengthen the slow folks' path. 

Whatever the outcome of this tinkering: it is clear, to me at least, that Atlantis with the rules as published is not a good game. The rating stays put, which is saddening: I think it is not that difficult to have squeezed more from the design.

Obtained in Math Trade, May '14.

The game is a delight. I have mixed feelings about Colvini designs but this one is a delight.

It is certainly a race game. It has strong elements of suspense. the set-up means each game will be different.

It looks as though it should be a very light game but it feels meatier than you expect and, expecting a short game, it runs longer than you would expect.

This race to the end game has a simplicity that I like.  The rules are easily learned and the play is fast.  The basic idea is to move your meeples along a path from Atlantis to the mainland as everything slowly sinks into the sea.  Crossing a gap between tiles requires "paying" more, which gets increasingly expensive as the game goes on.  Along the way you pick up treasures (as a memory of the island?) to earn VP at the end.

There are multiple strategies to victory, which I appreciate.  Do you run ahead in order to have more cards each turn?  Take it slow but focus on high-point tiles?  Try to keep cards that will move you quickly?  The bridges seem a little unnecessary for 2 players, but become vital in the 4-player version where gaps open so quickly it boggles the mind.

It may take a few extra minutes to set up, but for such light-hearted fun I think it's worth it.

First game was 2-player and it was okay.  Second games was 3-player and alot more fun.  Kind of like "Maori", only there's a start and finish and you're trying to get all 3 of your pieces to the finish area (which is a very basic way of describing the game).  Played a third game (2-player with Mr. Billington) and won this time (4-23-2011).  I still think 3-player would be more fun, though.  Maybe next time.

Atlantis is kind of the evil twin of Knizia's Tutankhamen. In both, you basically race along a one-dimensional track, but in this case instead of just picking up the best scoring tiles you also create obstacles for everyone further behind.

The calculations can get a bit tedious for a game of this weight.

I found this game to be surprisingly fun for what it is. It's very easy to learn. It's a race to get your 3 meeples from Atlantis to the mainland before the other players do. The tiles you pick up along the way become money to spend on more card draws, but also leave water gaps in the path to the mainland. It will cost either in cards or tiles to get across the water gaps, so the players out front can really mess with things. But, you can bounce off other players to move faster along the path provided you have the money to pay for water gaps. I thought it was great!

RATING: 4
Revamped Cartagena but not as ultimately clever.  I like the ever diminishing path that makes costs of movement vary, and there are some clever plays to be made, but the strategy seems limited.  

In my plays it has always been the case that the first player to get a pawn to safety wins based largely on the card draw benefit. 

However, my wife enjoys it and I am not about to turn down the experience of playing a game with her. Not the best Colovini has given us, but mildly amusing.

UPDATE: Even though I love playing with my wife, the absolute lack of any control is annoying. Usually the luck element in a Colovini title leads to a thoughtful tactical decision, not here.  Atlantis is totally luck driven.  It appears the opening hand can make or break the game.  Get a hand that delivers you to the end quickly while the other players plod along, victory is immediately assured.  Colovini games are usully so much more clever than this - not one of his highlights. Play Cartagena instead, similar game stronger mechanics.

A sort of "Cartagena on steroids", with the added bonus of being able to really mess up your opponents' plans. However, if you get more than around 15 points behind the leader, then you're in trouble and unlikely to catch up and/or win.

An intersting racing game with nice artwork but with no real depth and a bit too obvious/biased choices to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best way I can describe this game is Atlantis = Cartagena: The Deep Thinker's Edition.  Cartagena may actually have just as much strategic depth, but Atlantis is more difficult tactically.  It's also much crazier, and can sometimes swing out of balance if one player gets his first Atlantean dude to shore well ahead of the other players.  Atlantis also appears to be more susceptible to the luck of the draw, although I'm not certain.

I enjoy both games. Right now, I'd rather play Atlantis than Cartagena, but mostly just because it's newer.  Ask me again in several years, and I think I'm likely to tell you that I traded away Atlantis but still own Cartagena.  Or maybe not.

[b]UPDATE[/b] - Yes. I would still happily play Atlantis, but I prefer the more elegant Cartagena. Sold to a friend.

Four plays with two, two with three, and one with four. It's a fun and interesting game, though it definitely takes longer than the 30 minutes printed on the box (particularly because the setup is a pain in the ass). Do you go for speed, or collect lots of points, or screw the other players by making inconvenient little gaps in their path? A little of all three, probably. Don't ask me, because I always lose.

I surely am not the only one who is slightly remdinded of Cartagena (also from author Colovini) when playing this. However this one is heavier then it's ancestor, but still easy enough to be played with casual gamers. I quite like it as it has no obvious winning strategy. It always depend on how your fellow players are acting.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game you can run in about 30 mins or so.  The lay of the cards and tiles determine much of what you can do, but you still need to decide which prices to pay in treasure or cards to reach the other shore.  Also you must choose carefully which cards to play and when.  Like to play again.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favorite race games thus far. Run away as fast as you can, but don't forget to stash yourself with goodies on the way. It's not as easy as it sounds. The more the land goes under the water, the more costly it gets to come across it. With more players, the water shows up a lot quicker and cost calculations start to become math practice and efficiency since you don't want to give up too many points before getting to the safe land. 

Excellent game! Very interactive and quick to play and set up.

Set up is a bit annoying, but the game is fine: easy, fast, with some tough choices (beware of the frustration of having to give up a valuable tile to pay the crossing of water!).

I like the presentation of the game. The gameplay is simple but there's a couple of choices to do and not much thinking, at least no over thinking, encouraging gameplay for less skilled player. Family friendly game. It's fast, almost no down-time. I liked the game! The next day I tried Cartagena by the same designer and its similar gameplay. I liked both of them but the theme of Atlantis was more appealing to me and the changing board gave us a couple of surprise. I think I prefer Atlantis over Cartagena but since Cartagena is somehow more strategic I think that winning the game is more satisfying.

Move like Catagena to the next place with a matching symbol.  Pick up the tile you moved from for points, creating water gaps that are over come with bridges or paying points.

A highly derivative Cartagena look-alike with a point collecting mechanism tacked on. With the track changing on each player's turn the chaos factor is huge, even by the standards of a Colovini game. There's really only one strategy, race one man to the finish straight away to get the extra card, then do the rest. Not the designer's best effort.

Atlantis reminds me a lot of Cartagena (Leo Colovini being the designer of both), though there are definitely more differences than similarities.  I like the idea of moving to the next closest color of a played card, and that multiple meeples cannot be on the same space.  I also think it's great that players take the tile behind them to slowly sink Atlantis.  There's good strategy either rushing to the new land or slowly working your way, picking up big point tiles on the way and I can see either working depending on how the game plays out.  It's a really good game and this design really works well.

RATING: 7
There seems to be a fair amount of luck in which card colours you have available for movement. Quickly getting a pawn to the mainland seems like a key strategy to mitigate this luck as well as store points for the end game and/or have disposable income to pay for gaps.

I don't think there exists a pure doodler strategy where one player decides to hang back to maximize tile pick-up. You can choose to move a bit slower at times for this purpose but there do not seem to be extreme strategies in the game. Which probably isn't surprising considering that it plays in 20 minutes.

The game is really about tactical decision making, a bit of local optimization in planning out each turn. At the beginning especially you have to weigh your options of which pawn to move forward and what the cost/benefit for each is. Note that costs are both immediate and speculative, if you decide not to move a pawn now it might mean more gaps for them to cross in the future.

I was a bit surprised that high value tiles are not worth going out of your way for. After reading the rules I thought it might make sense to sit on a 7 hoping to move to the very next tile on a subsequent turn. This is probably very rarely worth the effort, spending two turns basically sitting still is a huge disadvantage. Late in the game if you feel that your winning you might do something like this but usually not.

It's a nice little game, the setup is too long and I fear it will be too chaotic with 4 but on the other hand it might still have some hidden depth, Colovini can be tricky at times...  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Despite the criticisms levied against Atlantis, our family still manages to have a good time. It is wildly unbalanced, with initial setup taking a bit longer than should probably be necessary. And strategy goes out the window 99% of the time... But with players willing to roll with the punches and just have a bit of silly fun, it satisfies a short, light niche.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Colovini took the idea from Cartagena and developed it into a potential brainburner. That's where the problem starts. Atlantis wants to be a family game that's interesting for gamers as well. 
But gamers will take long to ponder their moves prolonging game time beyond what is reasonable for the game. It's questionable if Atlantis justifies deep thought. In the end the winning strategy simply seems to be getting the right cards to race ahead as far as possible creating gaps that other players have to pay for crossing. 
Families could play this casually but should be better served with the more casual Cartagena. Atlantis is a nasty game. Losing most treasures again when crossing empty water spots can be a frustrating experience. While I normally like games with easy rules and some depth, this experience killed it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting "race to the finish" game where you try to escape the sinking island.  There is definitely strategy involved, however a bad run of cards can kill even the best strategy.  This game is not in my sweet spot, however its one I'd play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
A game where used spots allow bonus movement. You gain the tile behind the one on which your movement ends, which are biggest part of your victory points at the end. But the more crowded it gets the more water holes arrise and the more you have to give away your precious scoring tiles just to jump over them. Simple and elegant design. Like it much. Should have deserved an expansion.

RATING: 8
This is way high on the Filler-o-meter. 

You have three meeples that you're trying to move across (I think) around 70-80 tiles in a bunch of different colors. You just have to play a card to move to the next tile of that color, and then take whatever tile is just behind you. (These are numbered 1-7.) Since the tiles are one or at most two deep, you end up with gaps, so you have to pay to cross these gaps, using tiles, cards, or a combination. That's how simple this game is, but there's more complexity here than meets the eye, and the strategy is sometimes non-obvious. There are times when you want to slow down so as to grab as many tiles as possible, and it can be very difficult to decide when to use your bridge.

A nifty little game that I can see playing over and over if I had it, if only to find out whether the advantage of going first is adequately counterbalanced by starting with fewer cards.

I thought this was too simple the first time I played it, but after a second play I can see little complexities that must have been there all along. Being able to buy cards with your points makes for more meaningful decisions and counteracts the luck factor. And the fact that you CAN get your markers to the end more quickly doesn't necessarily mean that you SHOULD, which makes for interesting choices: do you sacrifice the short-term benefit of picking up more points for the long-term benefit of drawing more cards every turn? It's a fun little game and usable as a gateway.

Egyáltalán nem rossz játék. A kritikák általában lehúzzák, de szerintem élvezhető. Van benne véletlenszerűség, szerencse, egy kis stratégia és taktika. Viszonylag sok dologra kell figyelni, de mégis egyszerű, így olyan felnőtteknek, akik még nincsenek annyira benne a társasjátékos világban, arra jó lehet, hogy kicsit megszokjanak egy ilyen jellegű játékmenetet. Ráadásul gyorsan lemegy egy parti, jó választás lehet bemelegítésnek egy komolyabb játék előtt.

A Cartagena-hoz szokták hasonlítani a játékot - azért is szereztem be, mert az nekem bejön -, de nem igazán értem, hogy miért. A 2 játék közötti hasonlóság kimerül 2 dologban: itt is el kell vinni az összes bábút A-ból B-be, és itt is kártyákat játsszunk ki az előre haladáshoz. A legfontosabb különbség, hogy itt az a játékos nyer, aki a legtöbb pontot gyűjti össze út közben, vagyis nem csak annyi a feladatunk, hogy elsőnek juttassuk be a célba az összes bábunkat.
Mindkettő családi játék, azonban az Atlantis egy sokkal mélyebb darab. Szinte minden kártya kijátszásnak megvan a súlya, mivel szem előtt kell tartanunk azt, hogy lépésünkkel minél több hasznot hajtsunk magunknak, de egyúttal az is fontos, hogy az ellenfélnek minél több kárt próbáljunk okozni. Igen, erre is lehetőség van, ugyanis egy jól időzített lapka felvétellel okozott vízlapka lehelyezés sok pont levonását tudja eredményezni ellenfeleink számára. 
Összegezve, egy a vártnál sokkal mélyebb játékot ismerhettem meg az Atlantisban, ahol bizony minden lépést jól át kell gondolni. Persze a kártyák miatt a szerencsének is van szerepe.
Előnye, hogy 2 játékossal is jó.

Unique game of shooting yourself in the foot as inaccurately as possible. Obtuse strategy that is difficult for me to grasp, as well as "spend your points to make points", and taking advantage of lucrative movement opportunities.

RATING: 7
Light weight Euro where the players must play cards to try and escape Altantis. The movement mechanism is similar to that seen in Cartagena. 

This is a good game but not a great one and falls into those midling Euro games done by Mayfair...interesting but nothing to have you coming back again and again.

Jeu tout à fait correct. Il ne sera jamais mon premier choix, mais des joueurs occasionnels risquent d'être charmés par ce jeu lors de leur première partie.

I enjoy this game because it doesn't out stay it's welcome. There are some decisions to be made! Should you quickly get a meeple to the mainland missing some of those higher point tiles so you can draw that extra card per turn? Should you take your time so you can scoop up all the goods along the way? Should you get all three meeples to the mainland so you can end the game and make your opponents lose a lot of their points?

This is an advanced Cartagena, which in turn is advanced Candyland. So, expert Candyland. Very fun, very tactical
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It is an abstract tactic game where the main question is whether to race fast or to build points. Every round, you are presented with many options.

The main attractive of this game is the mechanism. 

It's one of those games where you really don't know what to do in order to win. Combined with the many possibilities in each turn, there's a big danger for AP.

The setup is a bit annoying, but the deadtime is my main issue with this game. You can't plan ahead, because the actions of the other players will affect the board.

I have the impression that once you have played some games, this "not knowing what to do" will disappear and you will enjoy it more.

RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): Very similar to Cartagena in terms of movement. In Atlantis you try to gain points by taking tiles that form the road from Atlantis to island. Here you have a bit more to think about as the road to safety is getting harder and harder as the game progresses since taking last tile from a pile (of 1 or 2 tiles) creates a water spot you must pay to go over. Pretty abstract but I like this type of puzzlelike gameplay.

RATING: 7
It's Verflixxt all grown up. Set out a long track of tiles in 7 colours with 1-7 VPs. Play a colour to move 1 of your guys forward Candyland style, then take the closest open tile behind you for the VPs. If that's the last tile on that spot, replace it with water, which means guys behind you will have to pay VP's to cross it. So when we mean run, we really mean RUN. There can be downtime while you assess movement possibilities for each of your guys and the cards in hand, so probably best with 3, but there's lots of good decisions about how far to go - will it be cheaper later as gaps start to coalesce, do you go for the close 7 or the further away 4, etc. I enjoyed it.

A light euro where you move your piece to the next tile matching the card played, but then you remove a tile behind you, gaining points and creating holes that other players need to pay for to cross.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The basic idea of Atlantis is similar to that of Cartagena, also by Leo Colovini, although it also has similarities to That's Life (Verflixxt). By playing cards, you move your pawns along a track to the next space with that colour.

You want to move your pawns quickly to the finish, but in the meantime, you also want to stay back to pick up the highest value tiles. Each removed tile creates a gap, which costs points to cross. You can use a bridge to cross these gaps for free, but it's better to wait until one of your opponents has built his bridge there.

All in all, a nice, light game. The amount of randomness is just a bit too high for my taste, but it's not annoying.

RATING: 8
I'm not sure if I like this more than it deserves or it's just under-rated (partly down to Tom Vasel hating it). There's not a lot of depth after a couple of plays but I've rarely introduced Atlantis to someone that didn't like it.

Leggero e divertente. Con una preparazione lunghissima, quasi quasi ci vuole più ad "apparecchiare" il tavolo che a giocarlo! Ambientato sull'isola di Atlantide che sprofonda, dove gli abitanti scappano verso la terraferma portando via i loro tesori. La componentistica è piacevole nelle partite bisogna muoverci in concomitanza con gli altri, sia perché le mosse dei giocatori influenzano le proprie e sia per evitare la troppa penalizzazione che spetta a coloro che non portano l'ultimo omino sulla terraferma; condizione questa che decreta la fine della partita con relativo calcolo dei punteggi e malus. Ideale come "filler" e con le sue regole facili, può essere spiegato rapidamente ed è quindi adatto ai neofiti.

Has a Cartagena feel to it but play is much different.  Game has a really race feel but you still need time to not only pick up treasures but optimize the net gain with these pick ups.

but  i think, that the 4th player has a disadvantage if the other players play cards to "make" quick sea-fields.

we see the ideal world of atlantis - no herald of the catastrophy.
the habitants stroll along the way, collect statues(!!!), branches....

The land of Atlantis is sinking! You gotta let your people getting out of there! And don't forget to pick up some treasures when you go running, because it's the treasure land! It's a racing game. The first play who reaches the Mainland gets a huge advantage: drawing more cards and creating gaps for the ones left behind. The card draw is important for your race. With some luck, you can win this game without much strategy. As a funny game it's worth of some plays.

RATING: 7
Played once with 3P. This is Cartagena with a high screw-your-opponent factor. It's quite an interesting design as players can cause tiles to collapse and form water obstacles for pieces which are left behind. Players then have to pay treasure when crossing water obstacles, so this can be quite a mathy affair. The set-up time is a little daunting, although I'm a bit more concerned whether the player order puts the players who start later at too big a disadvantage, as they will be facing a lot more obstacles left by the players who went earlier.

Like Cartagena on steroids: players try to use coloured cards to move their meeple across a sinking Atlantis. Meeple pick up VP tiles along the way. But when the last time is taken, a sea tile comes into play. Other players crossing the sea must pay the value (in VP tokens) equal to the lowest-numbered adjacent tile.

Reaching the other island gives you one extra card per turn. This is vital so get your fist guy across fast. When a single player gets all three meeples across, the rest have to spend their cards and VP tiles to get the rest back

Most VPs win. Each remaining hand card is worth 1 VP.

There is a clever mechanic much like Cartagena where you can take advantage of moving people based on what's in front of you, but it's novel in the way in which you pay your victory points (in forms of treasures and cards) to get past obstacles that the other players have created.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Online (BSW) play only.

Sort of like Cartagena -- have a path along which you need to move your tokens from finish, using cards (colors instead of symbols) -- but possibly with more randomness (not just the cards, but also the tile setup). On the other hand, it seems like there ought to be some strategy here since you have so many options for card play each turn? Needs more play.

--- Summary ---
Create a line of tiles, stacked 1 or 2 high. Each player has 3 pawns at the start. Deal 4 cards/player. On your turn, pick one of your pawns to move forward, and play the required cards (each card moves you forward to the next unoccupied tile of that color). If you move over water, must pay cost (= lower numbered tile of the tiles on either side of the gap) in tiles (value 1-7) and/or cards (each is worth just 1) for each gap crossed. Players also each have 1 bridge/game, which may be placed to bridge over water (any length; bridge expands to keep tiles connected; all players benefit). After pawn moved, take the unoccupied tile closest to and behind that pawn. Finally, draw cards (1 + 1/pawn at end of path).

Game ends when any player gets all 3 pawns to end. Then, other players immediately move remaining pawns to end (1 move/pawn), paying all required penalties. Player with most VP (sum of tile values + 1/card?) wins game.

Something just does not feel right about this one to me.  I blew my wife away in the first 2 game and I was the first player.  This needs more plays to figure out what the problem is that I have.

EDIT******

I just played a solo game to see what we may have been doing wrong.  I think the key to this game is that you can buy cards.  In my solo game, I bought a lot of cards for both of the 2 "players".  This really helped me to make better plays and to score more points.  The scores were higher and the "player" that went second won.  I'm seeing the potential here.

Sokra becsülöm a Cartagena-t, és ebben a játékban is megvan az a fajta versenyjáték érzés, mint a Cartagena-ban. 

Rátettek viszont egy számolós mechanizmust, ami a Cartagena elegáns egyszerűségéhez képes meglehetősen bonyolult és átláthatatlan. A vizeken történő átkelés olyan drágának tűnik, hogy hajlamos vagyok többször újraszámolni a lehetőségeimet, hátha elkerülhetem a vizen való átkelés magas költségét. Aztán persze mindig rájövök, hogy ez egy taktikai játék, tehát nem érdemes nagyon keseregni azon, hogy amikor rám kerül a sor, csak a nagyon drága és egy kicsit kevésbé drága lehetőség közül választhatok.

Első partinkat végül az a játékos nyerte, aki kölcségeket nem kímélve ment előre és elsőként vitte be a három bábúját a célba. Ugyanebben a partiban én megpróbáltam együtt tartani a csapatomat (mert a Cartagena-ban ugye az a jó), de így lecsúsztam a több kártya húzásról, ami akkor jár, ha bevitted már az első emberedet. Szóval itt érdemes előreszaladni egy bábúval.

Szóval alapvetően nem tetszik a játékmechanizmus, és hiába van csodálatos grafikával ellátva a játék, nem fogok többet játszani vele.

Played twice with four players. Very enjoyable game. Both times the first player won, but I don't think the first player has an advantage. As with nearly all card games, there is significant luck of the draw to the game. This is mostly an exercise in taking advantage of situations presented to you. Very nice components. Fiddly to set up, but  when playing with four, each person can lay tiles starting at the ends and the middle.

Atlantis borrows so heavily from the designer's Cartagena that it is nearly a re-implementation. Cartagena was delightfully simple and it's easy to see why one would try to grow a bigger game from it.  But here the additional complexity adds only frustration and fussiness.  The original game's movement mechanism is still present, but the elegance is gone.

A light, easy to learn, quick to play family board game that reminds us of Candyland. Of course in Atlantis you're out to sea and you get to cut out pieces of the trail as you go, making it harder for those that follow.

Very much in the vein of Cartegena except movement + jumps are less elegant, there's a mini and unncessary cards/points economy, and minmaxing over the different values of cards (With consequent different penalties of crossing water gaps)

Cartegena is far more elegant and lacks the crushing feeling of being left behind water gaps that will sap your points, instead it's a short, clean, efficiency race. I prefer Cartegena to this.

If you don't mind the paste-on theme, this is a very enjoyable game. It plays fast (although players may take some time finding the best move for their cards each turn), it has turn angst, and always offers an opportunity to screw the other players with inconvenient water gaps. Despite obvious similarities to games like Cartagena and Verflixxt, it feels more interactive and involved. Each turn, you have to decide whether to help yourself or when to hurt others. Whether to stay behind for a valuable tile or when to race to the finish (to receive additional hand cards in future turns). The artwork by Menzel is, once more, a feast for the eye. The biggest drawback to this game, is that it takes quite some time to set up for such a quick game. Still, I am glad to have purchased it, and so is my girlfriend (it plays great with two) :-).
UPDATE: The more I play this game, the better I like it. And it also plays great with three! Could very well be Colovini's best design so far, and I really like some of his previous work.

So game was not nearly as bad as the reviews suggests, at least not with two. I could see the game getting more frustrating with 3 or 4. Less control and planning and certainly more painful. The game falls in the "loss aversion" game category as players need to make payments using hard won tiles or cards they collected. Sometimes, you are forced to make payments with tiles you collected from the previous turn just to jump across several gaps. Sure, you can also use cards for payments but cards are tough to come by. All criticisms of this game are somewhat true. Very tactical, no long term planning and the race is more important than the points. Playing with the expansions also helps to alleviate some of the pain since they provide more avenues to traverse gaps free of charge. Overall, the game is not overtly taxing on the gray matter and the rules are quite simple. Game is decent with 2 but probably you will be gnashing teeth with more players due to board changes that prevents long term planning. If you have the game, do yourself the favor and score bonus points for set collection.

the effective board state changes drastically very quickly, meaning you can't really plan things out very well.  this means each turn is some numbers crunching before your action, which adds small but unfortunate downtime to a high tactics/low strategy game.  

it's ok, but nothing special.

First played at Essen 2009, and very much disliked it. A second play was better, though that was 2-player.  Clearly a cousin of Cartagena but as far as I can tell, a less interesting and enjoyable one.

I like Cartegena which this one is often compared to.  For some reason the "math" and broken chains of tiles did not do it for me.  This is definitely more of a gamers game, but I'd rather pick other gamer's games and play Cartegena with non-gamers.

Be the first to get your 3 meeples on the mainland. 

You jump by putting colorcards down. In return you can take the tile behind you. But that might create water wich you can cross by paying with tiles. 

In the same style as Cartagena

This is very clearly a Colovini game.  The theme is irrelevant, the game plays quickly, and for the players who enjoy this sort of thing, it can provide a light challenge of how to place your pieces each turn.  It's a blend of Cartagena, Verflixxt!, and Tutankhamen, but provides a bit more of a challenge than any of those games, while giving a unique experience with the game.  I think the game probably works best as a 2- or 3-player game, since so much can happen between turns, but either way, it's a light, thinky kind of game that will appeal to fans of the designer.

I bought the game because it was pretty fun for 3-4 players, but I have to bump it down for being disappointing for 2 players. The two player game takes too much set up for how quick the games are. The game always takes about 3 minutes to set up, and the two player version is often over in 10.

I thought this game was fun and a nice derivative of Cartagena. However, some players thought the game was broken with the leader creating more and more gaps for the trailers to have to cross costing more cards leaving in a rich get richer scenario. While I'm not entirely sure it's a game breaker, I agree that it can lead to an advantage for start player.

Thanks to Colovini we now know what sunk Atlantis: A tidal wave of luck.

At first you think you're playing a chess-like game of nuanced strategy, but then you realize that this card-running crapshoot is the equivalent of using chess pieces to play BINGO.

There's more strategy present here than in That's Life! but not by much. It's really as simple as "snatch high value tiles" and "create gaps when other player(s) have more meeples to send across them than you do." Thus, being in the lead is king, but there exists an important variable. If the tile next to the shore is crap, each player wants to slowplay and get their first guy to the shore just after their opponent. That way he picks up the crap tile and you get whatever is (randomly!) beneath it while preserving the "per turn" card inflow. If that tile is awesome, it's a mad dash for the shore and a great deal of hoping for the best. What color cards you're dealt early, the board setup, player order, and what tiles are secretly beneath others are all crucial elements left to chance. Either player (first player has priority) can easily gain an advantage if he can jump out to the section with no tiles underneath and begin creating gaps, provided that his or her random grip of cards ALLOWS for such a maneuver. (Every game there are instances where you say "It would totally rule if I had X color right now, but I don't." Then either your opponent or the player who draws the color first capitalizes on the board position.) The system of possible movement very closely resembles the nightmare that was Titan (maybe even worse!) but thankfully I played my 10 games on BSW where the system runs the calculations. It was a small consolation.

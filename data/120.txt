Mechanic, theme, fun, and strategic elements combine to make this a good game for beginners or more experienced players.  Recommended as a "gateway game".  Only works well with 4-5 players though.  A language independent game as well, despite the very German name (I have the Adel Verpflichtet version).

A surprisingly light game from the alea big box line. Its most important virtues are the pace, the simple rules and the graphic. On the other side a little bit too light for that price. Probably a good gateway game. Deserves a look from gamers also, as a filler.

RATING: 6
Not as good as I hoped that it would be - at least not with gamers.  In a way, Nobody But us Chickens (which has a similar rock, paper, scissors mechanism) is better as it's simpler and more fun.  I thought this was ok, and may come out with certain groups, but I don't feel that it's worth some of the praise it gets.  On a more postive note, though, my kids do like it!

Not a bad game, I just can't rate it as a real good one.  On the good side, it can be fun and at the same time there IS more strategy than people give it credit for.  On the down side, it seems there is always one or two people who always seem to screw up the card play.  It's ok, not bad.  I'll play it if someone wants to, but I won't pull it out.  Hence a 4.

I enjoyed my one game, but it did not grasp my interest. The rules are quite simple, but the scoring seems completely arbitrary.  Maybe I just need to play more to understand its rational.
Update: after further plays, my appreciation for the game has increased. It is fun, short, interesting and good for up to six people. No many games accomplish that.

RATING: 7
A good game of second-guessing, set building and timing.  The question you are always asking yourself is whether it is better to build up your set at the auction house or to head for a stately home to exhibit, steal from exhibitions or catch a thief.  Focus too much on set building and the game can run away from you. Exhibit too often and your set can be decimated, leaving you to limp towards the finish.   A few wrong guesses can leave you clutching little more than Johnny Weissmuller's loin cloth to cover your embarassment, but this is a light, quick game so I am not so bothered by that.  

This game is nicely themed and well produced (at least, my FX Schmid edition was).

RATING: 7
I'm cooling on this pretty quickly, but the rest of the group seems to still like it a lot.

There's nothing wrong with it.  It's a well designed, light, double-guessing game.  It provides enough information to figure out what players are likely to do  so that you aren't guessing blindly, but of course you never know for sure what someone will do.

So there's some lucky guesses in the end, but an appropriate amount for a game with this depth and length.  And it's nice that it offers several things you need to do and several different ways to do them.

I'm fine playing it, I'm just feeling that I'd rather play something else.

this seems like it was impressive for its time.  i played with 6 players my first time out, and found the experience largely underwhelming.  i don't like it as a gateway game compared to what's out there now either.  lots of basically unavoidable turn skipping for all parties.  i'd rather save some time by playing paper/rock/scissors and having the losers get kicked in the nuts.  still not a terrible game, but i don't see a reason to play it.  and i'm a fan of edel, stein, & reich.

I am almost supernaturally bad at bluffing games. I keep buying them, though, because they are fun. I've played this now once, with three players, and it was a quick, fun romp -- everyone is always interested in what's going on, the game moves along quite quickly, and it's fun and funny. There aren't many 17-year-old games in my collection, but I'm glad I bought this one.

Interesting auction game that if kept light and playful shines.  If taken with too much seriousness, the game does not perform as well.  Can be a real blast if players play in character and tell stories of how each item in their collection was acquired throughout the game.

Definitely a game of trying to out-think and out-guess your opponents.  Because of this, it's not the right sort of game for many who want more predictable outcomes.  Plays well with 6, and doesn't outlast it's welcome.

I didn't even want to try this one. I haven't liked Mr. Teuber's designs much thus far, and this, being one of his firsts, I believed to be just as "light with heavy lengths" as his other ones.

How wrong was I, and how pleased I am that I was! This is a great outguessing game; probably the best I've tried so far. I've only played online, but I can imagine how much cooler would this be IRL.

I'm even considering buying it!

Three plays so far. Already good, and I do believe it will get even better after we get more used to the mecanics. Only weird thing is that it only comes equipped for five players. I'd assume it'd get better with six or seven, a few more people at the embassy meetings and secret missions.

A light but strategic game of set collection and bidding along-side a familiar rock-paper-scissors type experience.  Plays quickly and almost never fails to please.

** update **

after a few more plays it seems like this games appeal has worn thin on my group.  

I still think it's a good light game for 6 (which is rare) but it's not quite as satisfying as it once was.

** another update **

This one has swung back into vogue recently.  I find that its important to explain to players how vital it is to pay attention to whose in the lead on the board in order to challenge that person.  Otherwise players can get to wrapped up in improving their collection in the auction house while the leader continues to show off in the castle un-opposed.

Good game for 6 and fits very nicely into my collection when I want a fairly light game for decent size group.

RATING: N/A
Missing 1 of the 45 collection cards. More importantly, missing the following location/action cards:
Green: Exhibit, two checks (I have 17K and 20K)
Black: Exhibit, $3,000 check
Blue: Castle, Exhibit, Detective, $2,000 check
Yellow: two checks (I have 1K and 12K)

Also missing the black and green pawns.

The game is technically playable with these components by combining the green and yellow decks and then playing 2-player vs the red deck (which is complete).

The game also includes 3 blank collection cards, so if one determined which item is missing from the collection deck, it could be replaced.

Pretty interesting game.  It reminds me of Citadel because the heart and soul of the game is guessing and second guessing what your opponents will do.  A pretty decent gateway game since it's pretty easy to teach and the game goes pretty fast.  Will need to play again a few more times to see if I should include it in my collection.
Initial Rating: 7

I have enough gateway games to buy this game.
Oct-12-2007
Ran into a post that informed me that we played the game wrong on Sep-28-2007.  We were recycling the cash that were used to buy the items by leaving them in the game.  In effect we were thieving cash that was spent from previous turns, which is a direct violation of the rules.  This resulted in a much more cash heavy game than if played with the real rules.  I don't know if this is better or not, but certainly makes this a "try before buy" game.

I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, considering it's little more than an elaborate game of rock / paper / scissors.  Having played with 3 players and 6 players, I definately think it plays better with more people.  That way, there is a less likely chance that one person will be alone in the auction house or castle, and therefore receive a "freebee."

Hoity Toity is based on that classic bluffing dilemma, like the poisoned wine scene in The Princess Bride: "You're likely to choose this so I'll choose this, but then you know that I know this, so you'll probably actually choose this, but then..." This is a fun kind of mechanic, and can lead to moments where you feel very clever with yourself, or where you laugh at your poor choices. But the problem with Hoity Toity is... that's all there is to it. Just turn after turn of trying to second-guess your opponents in a rock-paper-scissors battle, trying to figure out if they're exhibiting their art or trying to steal yours or whatever, which, actually, gets pretty boring. And it turns out, if you carry out that same action over and over again, eventually it all tends to even out anyway. Very repetitive, quite one-dimensional, and at 60 minutes it definitely outstays its welcome.

Easy to learn fun game where you are trying to maximize your actions by guessing what you opponents are going to do. Based on the old Rock, Paper Scissors mechanism. Not a real high flyer.

RATING: 5.5
Initial rating after half a game.  I'm worried that actually playing through the whole game might be disappointing.  Usually with fillers, due to the short play time, first impressions tend to be pretty reliable for me.  My first impression of Hoity Toity is that it might be repetitious and kinda boring after a while.  Basically, a little too plodding for a filler.

RATING: 6
There's some fun in this game, but it can really lack tension if someone gets out to a lead.  The simultaneous action selection keeps things moving, so the game is nice and short.  I like games where you try to read your opponents and predict their actions, so this one should be perfect for me.  The problem is that, unless you can completely read what someone is planning on doing, you can't target them.

As a result this game can suffer from a real runaway leader problem.  When that happens I don't find the game nearly as interesting.  Also if you fall into the trap of getting both your thieves arrested, it can take a long time for you to recover them.  All in all, I feel like I should like this game, but I just don't.

Light and brainless. Be prepared to basically play multiplayer rock-paper-scissors for thirty-five minutes. A recent review claims this game is chock full of subtlety and nuance, but that's a crock. If your opponents play like morons and let you predict everything they do, then sure, it's a game of skill. But once people realize that the key to winning is to be unpredictable -- and believe me, they will -- you've got EVERYBODY being unpredictable and trying to outguess each other, and of course there's nowhere that can go besides an RPS fest.

When you boil it down, this game is "Do what no one else does".  Which means that a game between experienced players is probably a really interesting exercise in bluffing and doublethink.  But it offers little to the casual gamer - comes off as a long exercise in randomness.

This is at its core rock,  scissors, paper.  But, it's a little more than that because different players have different incentives at different times, and so you can sort of work out what people are more likely to do in a given circumstance.  

Many blind guessing games fail in that you can sometimes play entirely randomly and still do pretty well.  I would guess that this would not work in Hoity Toity.  

A clever little game.   Wouldn't want to play it all that often, but as a once-a-year type affair it certainly has its place in a collection.

This game is truly great with five players.  I have never played it with less and I have no desire to do so as the game loses the tension.  Besides, with four we play Edel(Stein&Reich) and with five we play Adel. Got it?  This game is lively and tense, fast and fun, deep and surprising.  A great game to introduce a non gamer to the world of German games.  I tried the six player Hoity Toity which just felt chaotic and frustrating.  I much prefer five players.

Surprisingly fun game for its age. After Settlers, it's probably Teuber's best design.

For a game in which you regularly screw over your neighbors, it's surprisingly lighthearted and easy. Excellent gateway game.

High replayability factor here. Each turn results in a lot of table chat (in appropriately toffee-nosed British accents, of course!) and the tension and fun continues throughout the whole game. With the right group, this gets wonderfully raucous. A hit that comes back to the table a lot. I have both the newer version and the old "By hook or crook" version.

For a turn-based game without time limits, this game is fast paced fun as its best! Each game is always exciting! Straightforward rules. The game is well-balanced and contains a lot of player versus player interaction. Players can be mean towards each other, but this is risky too, so unlike with other games, lasting grudges amongst players never occurred at our table. It is just fun. Check out Basari if you look for a similar game.

My first love of gaming... Adel Verpflichtet is the game that started it all for me: elegant, balanced, social, and a fast pace. 

One of my favorite parts of this game is that the little victories and swings are never far away. Even when things are going poorly, you are less than a minute away from a great little victory. I LOVE THE PACING! Everyone can stay engaged and the decision making to time ratio is very dense.

Like the greatest of games, the game grows as your awareness expands within your gaming group, but this game is limited ultimately and inescapably by being so damn human. As such, the skills of this game are those of poker (thankfully without the math)---your game knowledge is servant to your knowledge of the people at the table. Other games may work strategy, tactics, and mechanisms more subtly, but none isolate so densely what gaming at its best has been for me: playfully trying to outsmart my friends with a novel narrative to tie it all together.

* * * * * 

Some say this game is showing its age. I disagree completely and use this game as the opening game in a boardgame course I teach. It always goes over well and I wish the game was more easily available as the students request it frequently. 

I refuse to call this game 'Hoity Toity,' but applaud Uberplay's effort to add a sixth player.

RATING: 7
The blind bidding mechanic is very challenging for me.  In some games it doesn't throw me -- I seem to 'get' Aladdin's Dragons, for instance -- but playing Adel Verpflichtet I never seemed to be able to anticipate other players' moves.  That's not a criticism of the game, mind you.

Despite the fact that I usually lose (not a good bluffer?), I love this game.  Shades of the paper/ scissors/ rock mechanism also seen in the Alea game Edel, Stein, and Reich.

I own the Uberplay (Hoity Toity) version which scales to 6 players. I think its playable with 4, but better with more. I like it more when there is increased amounts of conflict (where multiple people are in the same location). 

Hoity Toity is light enough that you can pretty easily introduce it to anyone. Its also silly enough that the theme will engage them. Finally, although there is certainly some strategy and mind-games...at the end of the day it really has a big dose of luck....which is a good thing for a light introductory game, which is how I view Hoity Toity.

There aren't a ton of great 6 player games (besides card games) to pull out for a short light gateway game, but Hoity Toity works well in that capacity. I don't think I would pull it out a lot of the time, but it plays so quickly that I might suggest it and certainly wouldn't turn it down very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The classic paper - rock - scissors game. In many regards I think I came to a lot of these gateway games both too late and too early. I initially didn't care for this one that much, as it really is a lot of guesswork and double-thinking; but at the time I first played it I was almost purely into board games from a strategic / thinkey perspective. Time has changed my feelings a bit, as I now play casually with a mixed group that includes both gamers and our less gamery SOs. In that regard, this is a excellent, as it's got a bit to chew on with the set collection, but it also is fast moving and has the fun moments that our SOs seem to like.

This does need to be played fast, anything over an hour is overstaying its welcome, but if you can accomplish that mild ask (most games go less than 45) then this is a solid, seminal bluffing game. Yes, a lot rides on the last exhibit. Yes, the game can have some pretty random swings. But it does introduce some basic set collection mechanics and has some fun moments to make up for the inherent chaos that simultaneous action selection tends to inject into games.

In some ways Edel, Stein und Reich is similar to this one, but ESR has a much gamier negotiation phase that adds depth, but also overhead to the game. Which you will prefer, if either, depends on what you're looking for. This game is definitely the more accessible and fast moving of the two. Also: it has been said before but it is still worth repeating: do not play this with less than 5. Some editions go up to 6 as well, but this really does require a higher player count to work. It is not anywhere near as good even with 4. This is a function of its central mechanic where players diverge into 2 groups and then try to outguess each other. You need at least 5 for these groups to be large enough for the game to work correctly.

This is not a particulary heavy game, but is a good one, in my experience, for a mixed group of gamers and non-gamers. 

The Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic bothers some of my harder-core gaming colleagues, but I like the bluffing aspect. 

Another game that cam be played onlne at spielbyweb.com, a site that is awesome.

Those seeing nothing but guessing and double guessing are missing out on a great game.  It is so much more than the sum of its parts.  Its simplicity and cleverness make this a classic that is as fresh today as it was when released.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It teaches quickly, it plays quickly, but the entire game revolves around a repetitive double guessing mechanism which gets old very fast. I'm not impartial to double guessing, in fact enjoy it a good deal, but the lack of variety in case of Adel Verplicht had me  yawning in about 10 minutes. The game doesn't work at low numbers of players too because there isn't sufficient action contention to have the various actions work out as they should. The game was probably very good way back when there was little else to do—nowadays, with Fiji, Lascaux, Morgenland and a few others out there is no need to haul out this dinosaur any longer. 

[b]Update[/b] If you like the concept of doublethinking thieves stealing stuff, I recommend Sneaks & Snitches from Vlaada Chvátil. That game in my experience goes over much better than this title, and finishes in the proper amount of time it ought to take for such a game.

Swedish version called Spionage. Quite amusing when played with five, but doesn't accomodate three or four players nearly as well. I do like the double guessing, bluffing and RPS, but it tends to become a tad repetitive towards the end as it often lasts a bit too long. Ok as a filler.

Played first game with sister and brother-in-law, and brother.  Great time!  Probably the first game I'd suggest for larger groups of men and women who are looking for an intro game.

I really would like to play this one more than I currently do.  I've played this one sometimes on the PBW system, but its not the same as in person.  This one is all about the bluffing aspect.  The problem is that this game shines with a lot of people playing.  Finding enough people that want to play this is the hard part.  

Play with all 6 players using the Uberplay edition if you can.

Adel Verpflichtet - FX Schmidt.  This is a fun game for 3, 4, or 5 players.  It has a kind of rock, paper, scissors feel to it.  Players collect art, steal art, display are, buy art, try to catch thieves stealing art, and eventually try to make it to the end as the furthest player along the victory track.  It's a fast paced, fun, euro style game with no dice.  Can you outsmart your fellow lords?  It's one upmanship at its finest!  Adel Verpflichtet plays in about an hour.  The FX Schmidt version has made my top 50 euro style games of all time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
This game seemed like it should be more fun than it was.  I have 3 complaints:
- There is a big potential for a runaway winner, and the only clear remedy is to catch a thief.  But the number of thieves are very limited.
- The supposedly balanced values of thieves and cash that each player starts with aren't as balanced as it would first appear.
- The action selection cards are ridiculously small while the exhibit cards are unnecessarily large.
Definitely a disappointment.

Components: Some years ago this would have been great production; by today's standard, the durability still holds, but the artwork is very drab.

Experience: My more recent playing has made me suspect that I do not like simultaneous action selection. I can see that with more playings, and a better sense of value, I might be able to better out-guess my opponents, but the game just didn't have a lot of energy for me.

The most fun you can have playing rock-paper-scissors. The only drawback is that if you have one of the "middle" sets of checks in your color, then you get shut out of auctions regularly if the higher checks keep circulating. It's also a bit difficult to explain the game, especially collections, to non-gamers. Otherwise, a brilliant design that has stood the test of time.

RATING: 7.93459
A great game of what David Sirlin calls 'yomi'. It's always massively advantageous to be in the auctionhouse or castle on your own and so selecting the location becomes a case of predicting which the less popular option will be and going there.

The possible actions (theif/exhibit/detective or theif/bid in the castle or auctionhouse respectively) all have differing benefits and are useful in differing situations, allowing some degree of prediction of what a player is likely to do and reacting to that. But soon it turns to 2nd-level yomi as you react to how you imagine they'd react to your expected move or a strange 'group-yomi' as you consider how each of the group will react to the probable actions...

Ultimately, it's a great game of Rock-paper-scissors, but just like Kongai, it works brilliantly.

For some reason I enjoy playing this more online than in person. It is a game of outguessing your opponents and in person you rush to make decisions because your decisions are extremely light and anyone taking too long will be blamed for over-thinking their move, which is entirely true.  Unfortunately I think the fun part *is* overthinking your move so having extra time online to think it through actually helps make the game more fun.  There are other filler games I'd much rather play.

Kinda interesting.  I can see this getting deeper with more plays.  Showing too many works can give a thief the chance to break your chain in the middle.  Stealing at the auction house is either a great way to circulate money, or totally weird and broken.  Can't tell yet.

Update 6-4: Nope.  The endgame is "I have the biggest set, and oh look, I have the biggest set again".  Starting hands are ridiculously unbalanced (try starting with AAEF).  The catch up mechanism is silly and short term.  Just gotta say I don't like it.

[Teuber] Unfortunately, Adel Verpflichtet is know as "Teuber's OTHER game". Which is a shame, because it is [in many ways] a better game than Catan. I like it for what it is: another great Teuber game for players af all ages. It also may be a good one to try out with six players, often a difficult number. Definately worthwhile every so often, but it wears out its welcome by game's end and I never wanted to play twice in the same night.

A very pure game of bluffing, guessing, and out-guessing your opponent's action selections.   Other than that, you are collecting straights (of art cards) and then second-guessing yourself about when you should try to score them without getting stolen from.   We played it at breakneck speed, and that seems to be the way to go.   Would be painful if played slowly.   More players seems better as well, as it makes the bids, theives, and detectives all more interesting choices.

Eddig csak 3 fővel próbáltuk ki. Már most látszik, hogy minél többen játszanak, annál jobb. A hangulata így is kiváló, ahhoz képest, hogy egyszerű kő-papír-olló elven működik a játék. Mindenki igyekszik kitalálni a másik lépését és ebből egy jobb lépéssel előnyt kovácsolni, persze sokszor kiderül, hogy tévedünk és ebből születnek a vicces szituációk, főleg amikor egyszerre akarja mindenki meglopni egymást :). Egyszerű, könnyen megjegyezhető szabályok, minimálisnál is kevesebb nyelvfüggőség (először egy német nyelvű játékkal játszottam, s nem okozott gondot, hogy egyáltalán nem tudok németül), vicces szituációk, gyors játékmenet (kezdőkkel 45 perc), családi játéknak tökéletes.

I had such high hopes for this game.  I mean, it's a SDY winner and created by a pretty famous designer.  But playing it was dreadfully dull.  I lost track of the number of sighs and vacant stares from my opponents throughout the half hour game. 

 What can I say about the game play?  Well you are building a collection of stuff to display.  Points are earned for the person with the best(or largest) collection.  You can either buy or steal the, uh, junk in the game.  The game is a bit annoying in that everyone starts with different amounts of cash so you can be outbid a few rounds and quickly fall behind.  You do have other options, like stealing cash or art and putting on your detective hat to catch the thieves.  Mostly, you are trying to anticipate what your opponent will do and outsmart them.  There are better games out there that have that mechanic.

RATING: 7
One of the forerunners of the "German wave", still a good game after all these years, although the theme feels slapped on. The "where am I" card mechanic is interesting but also involves a lot of luck, because your fellow gamers can never really be read fully, and there is always the odd play that benefits a particular player immensely without really being his achievement. The race around the board has some interesting twists, as some spaces advance you less than others, and people falling behind always have a good chance of catching up. Apart of the name that is inprounancable for every non-German this is really a gem that still has some shine left and is worth checking out not  only for nostalgia value.

"Spiel des Jahres 1990". Very old Klaus Teuber Game, some years before he made Settlers of Catan. We played it when we were kids, and I have it quite fresh in my mind. Found it in the attic lately and am eager to give it a try after the long time being almost forgotten. It's a very repetitive game, but can be quite fun with the right group and at least 4 players.

Wow, this game suffers from a runaway leader problem. There's some thought required to bluff your opponents, but it doesn't seem as if there's much to the game beyond that. Sometimes I feel as though I'd be better off rolling a die and picking an action, even though I'll most certainly end up in last place. But I don't think there's a lot of strategy here. If you get lucky and can build to an early lead, the game is yours.

Based on one play and a shaky understanding of the rules, we had a reasonably good time. I did notice that when Andrew pulled ahead of everyone by about 10 points, the game seemed like a lost cause, even though we played for another 15 minutes. I suspect that it could be as good as an 8 or a 9 with the right crowd, but I think the basic game doesn't hold enough strong choices to make it an oft requested classic with my gaming group.

20 years ago, now nearly 24 years..., sure one of the best family games available. The bidding scenario with the different locations and options are really nice. But in the end there is so much luck included that you could place this game only in the "family" game category, playing with players accepting to loose not for here strategie instead of her unluck choosing the wrong places, cards in the wrong situation... Could be frustrating if you like board games challenging but even could be really nice if you accept the game mechanic including this factors of luck and ...fun! 
Playing during the 90ties I would have given a ranking of 7 till 8 but for now accept my 6. Have fun playing.

[Blind Actions, Set Collection] [4P:4, 5P:5, 6P:4] The great granddaddy of the blind action selection mechanism, used subsequently in games such as Edel, Stein & Reich and Pirate's Cove. I'm not a fan of this mechanism, and despite the arguments that there is a lot of psychology in play when choosing actions based on what you think the other players will do, it's not something I'd like to pin a whole game on. Gamers who like making something out of multiplayer chaos should find something to like here though. Sorta sad that it's now known as "Klaus Teuber's other game" because I think it's much more tolerable than anything named Settlers. Ok to pull out once in a very blue moon, just for a change of pace.

No jogo nos somo ingleses, sem ter o que fazer, colecionando objetos. A mecânica é bem interessante. Nós devemos escolher ir para o castelo expor obras e, caso tenha a maior exposição, avançar ou ir para a casa de leilão adquirir novos objetos caso vença o leilão. Os dois pontos altos do jogo são na hora de escolher para onde ir, quando você pode acabar ir sozinho ou com todo mundo, e na hora das exposições e leiloes quando você pode, ao invés de expor ou comprar objeto, usar o ladrão para roubar um objeto ou o cheque usado no leilão, ou usar o detetive para prender o ladrão.

This game is incredibly good. Although the core mechanics are somewhat akin to rock-paper-scissors, it never feels cheesy or gimmicky. Although you have a limited set of options throughout the game, it never feels repetitive, and the decisions always feel 'important.' There is a built in balancing feature with the detective scoring (and to a lesser extent with the movements being dependent on the leading player's position). Simply put, this game is great fun.

Not a deep game, but short, easy, fun and a regular in my group&#039;s sessions.  A good filler at the end or when you need one.
Easy to pick up, too, so it&#039;s a good one when some of the potential players aren&#039;t really &quot;into&quot; games, or think they&#039;re to hard to be fun (one of my friends persistently borrows my copy to play with his parents when he and his wife go to visit, for example) - just don&#039;t expect to get away with playing it once and then moving on to something a little deeper, because they&#039;ll want at least three games before they&#039;re ready for something different.
I have the English version.  I assume the various sets are the same, but certainly in mine the items on the cards are well chosen for visual appeal and genereally top notch.  It&#039;s a shame the publishers didn&#039;t translate the original title, though - it quite amuses me that the correct English translation is actually French (ie &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot;)

October 2011 -- Our son and son-in-law are the winners everytime we play. The rest of us just can't seem to compete with them. I still have mixed feelings about the game, probably because I never do well at it. Maybe I'll catch on to the tactics someday and like it more.

I rarely play games that I flat-out dislike and wouldn't play again, even when I've felt completely lost in more complicated games, but Hoity Toity is one game that I didn't care for at all. It seems to boil down to merely guessing at what others are going to do and trumping them in some way. I knew from the moment the rules were explained that I a) would finish dead last in this one and b) wouldn't even enjoy the ride as I trailed farther behind. I was right on both counts. In nearly every situation, I guessed wrongly and was a) victimized by a thief, b) arrested and tossed in jail for attempting to steal, c) left out in the cold as the detective in the castle or d) overbid in the auction house. On only one turn did I manage to score any points at all, and that was when I came in second on my exhibit. Every other time I exhibited, I was plundered by thieves.  Yes, I managed to screw up in every way possible in this one. Imagine this scenario: Everyone on the game goes to the castle. One person exhibits. The other three players are thieves. In all but one case when I exhibited that was the scenario. It's not that I'm a sore loser, really; it's just that I felt utterly powerless in this game to do anything. I guessed wrongly every time. I would not play this game again if I were locked in a fallout shelter and this was the only game we had left. The other players in our group seemed to like the game just fine. Okay for them. They couldn't pay me to play it again. It just did nothing for me. I'd just as soon go outside and throw rocks at a hornet's nest.

After all these years, it's still the quintessential "outguessing" game.  Although Teuber is known chiefly for his Settlers series, I think this is his best game.  We only play it with exactly five players.  [Update: The new "Hoity Toity" edition supports six players.  I've tried it twice so far with that number, and it's almost as good as with five, and certainly much better than playing with fewer than five.]

RATING: 4
I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't, and it wasn't because I lost.  The game tries to balance itself out, but it seems to have the effect of making the scores closer at the end of the game without really giving people who have fallen behind a chance at winning.  It shares my favorite aspect of Citadels—second-guessing and anticipation—without being even close to as fun or elegant.

One of my favorite games. The bluffing, the stealing, the surprise, when you lay down your collection. Great mechanism of moving forward based on whose leader stands on what place. Very interactive game. Simple and fun and gets played over and over and over again. Love it!

RATING: 8
It's "advanced rock, paper, scissors" but somehow manages to be a great game anyway. In fact, I think it's best if all players recognize this -- agonizing over your turn trying to figure out the "correct" move will result in tears. But if you play by the seat of your pants, knowing that fortune will smile and frown on you at various points, you'll enjoy the experience a lot more.

RATING: 6
A good game, but it suffers a bit from being too long for what it is. 

In some ways, it could be seen as a souped up version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each action can be countered by a different action, which in turn is balanced by yet another action. This makes for a very interesting dynamic, and kept the scores quite close.

A very interesting and unique card game with a lot of cool decisions. The simultaneous card-play is hilarious (or nerve racking, depending on the moment) and the flexible point scoring system is very intriguing. 

The only problem is the rulebook which is very unclear on the fact that you do not lose cards after exhibiting them. (This basically ruined our first game, although we still had lots of fun with it even so).

RATING: 6
Light game of bluffing, blind bidding and outguessing. Those are features I don't like very much, but nonetheless I enjoyed my only play of "Adel Verpflichtet". It may be a nice gateway or family game and can be played by anyone. I played it with 5 players, which seems to be the best number, and I can't really imagine it working well with less. The Überplay edition adds a sixth player, but sadly downgrades the artwork - not to mention the extremely silly name. The theme of the collections could have been more interesting in both versions.

Doesn't work so well on the low end of the player range, but with at least five this is a blast!  Undoubtedly has a rock-paper-scissors feel, but playing randomly will not lead you to victory.  You've got to weigh your options each round and decide which choices will bring you the most points.  Fast-paced fun.

A great game of quintuple-think.  Lots of agonizing choices ("I need to exhibit, and I know he knows I need to, which means I shouldn't, but, of course, he knows that, too, so he'll be expecting me not to.  Or will he?") and simultaneous play make for the fastest, sweatiest Great Dada Heist you've ever experienced.  I guarantee you don't have anything like it in your collection.  ("What are we in this one, petulant old geezers cobbling together Rauschenbergian agglomerations of junk to try and out-Duchamp each other?  Really?  Wow.")  Recommended.

RATING: 7
One of the first German games to become mainstream with English-speaking audiences. Still enjoyable although it's been surpassed among the gateway Euros by Settlers, Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride, and Citadels does the blind action mechanism better. Definitely better with more players, so the 6-player option in the most recent incarnation (there's an unofficial expansion for earlier versions) is certainly welcome. Strategy doesn't amount to anything more than 'play at random'.

RATING: 6
Who ever thought rock-paper-scissors could be this much fun? I love the element of psychology and trying to get inside someone's head in a game like this. That being said, it's a little too light and repetitive to want to play very often.

RATING: 6
Fast, fun game of psyching people out.  I like this better than most simultaneous action selection games I've played, perhaps because of the way you get a better idea of how things are going over time. It's definitely possible to overthink this. It's actually possible to win while NEVER exhibiting.

Light fare, action selection. There is nothing really wrong with this, the theme is fun, the game is clever, it is reasonably quick. For me though I think the chaos of the game gets to me.

First played August 28th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (~5min) and a pretty quick play (4 of us took less than 45 minutes).  It's a gold bluffing game.  The rules seemed more complicated, however it's really quite simple once you start into it.  You can buy a work or steal money from the aution house.  Or you can sell works, steal works, or catch thievs (if there are any) at the store.  You get points or movement by catching thives or selling works.  Winner is the one who finishes first and furthest.  There seems to be a good balance of luck and strategy in the game as well.  Well perhaps dipped towards the luck since you are depending so much on what others do.  I'd recommend giving it a try for those who enjoy bidding games.  It's worth a play every now and then to mix things up.

After 2 plays it seems a little unbalanced.  In the games we played (3 player & 5 player) by the mid point in the game you could almost predict who was going to win and who was going to come in last.

I thought it was OK and am willing to play again, it was fun but I also want to see if I am right about it seeming to be unbalanced.  The player in last seemed to get really discouraged and felt like they had no chance to win by about mid game.

RATING: 6
I'm sure this game was the shiz back in the day, but nowadays I just don't see the thrill.  The scoring track attempts to be clever while not really doing anything at all of use and the groupthink boils down to lucky guesses.  Sure, occasionally you can read people, but by and by - the average Joe thinks on a pretty random curve.  This makes the gameplay FEEL random though it PROBABLY isn't.  I don't know, I just wasn't all that impressed although I wouldn't mind playing again while in the right mood.

Apr08: Pretty good lightweight family game.  It does simultaneous action selection well so the action is always moving.  It definitely feels like group "Rock-Paper-Scissors" at times, but there's more thought and "Wine in Front of Me" action than bland RPS.

The actual game play is generally interesting, and there are a few ways to go about things.

The theme isn't too bad, as long as you enforce mandatory British accents.

I'll probably keep it around, especially since the market value has to be about nil.

My favorite 5-player game.  Actually, will only play with 5-players, as with 4 it's a much lesser game.  Magic Rat kept playing with 4, and didn't understand what i saw in this game.  I kept telling him, "Play with 5, damn it!"  Once he did he understood.

A long-time favorite, because of its quick playing time (at the WBC tournament where this has been an event for years, you play four games back-to-back and add up your scores).  There's a bit of guessing and psychology in knowing your opponents, and while the game mechanim is a bit repetitive, it is easy to grasp yet engrossing for experienced game players as well as novices.  I have bought all three editions of the game, the original (Adel Verpflichtet, By Hook or Crook, and the more recent Hoity Toity which added a sixth player and some more art cards.)  Always a great amount of tension, particularly when you have all the players jammed up 2-3 spaces from the finish line, all going to the castle on the final turn or two ...

Not Hoity Toity, Fair Means or Foul, it's earlier (and much better) name. Great game but really needs 5 players to be at it's best. The winner is usually the one who copes best with the Meta game.

A lighter game built around a series of 50ish rock-paper-scissors decisions. Needs to be at least 20% shorter. Six players might be a little too much. I want to like this, but I feel like I know better, so my expectations for future play are low.

Found it at Drexoll for 50% off... huzzuh!

I really like this game, it is fast and has round-after-round of simultaneous reveal.  This creates an interesting psychological battle, with players attempting to predict what everyone else  is going to do.

The only problem is that I have yet to find others who enjoy it as much as I do.  It tends to annoy people on the first play, and they don't care to try it again.

This is another example of how versatile Klaus Teuber is as a designer.  I can see how some would not like this game, especially those that are turned off by the rock paper scissors mechanism.  But I always enjoy these types of games and this one is simple, easy to explain and fun to play.  The theme, while paper-thin, is amusing and unusual, and the game time is just about right.  I would highly discourage playing on Spielbyweb, which drags out forever and sucks the fun out of what is a whimsical, relaxing game.

First of all, I think this game wouldn't be any good at all with less than five players. Five is fine, six is better and best. Imbalances seem to appear with fewer players.

I enjoyed the game initially and thought the rock/paper/scissors mechanic was well-done, but I now have serious reservations. Two or three turns from the end of the game I can already determine whether I can win or not. If the answer is "not", there is nothing I can do to change it. Not sure if I really want to play this much more.

The Good: A good family game. Good theme. A very well implemented set of rock/paper/scissors types of mechanics where you are trying to outguess your opponents. 

The Bad: Not very good with 3 people: the more the merrier. Too much luck of the draw in your initial hand. Endgame has a bit of a runaway leader; the person who completes the track first will most likely also get the largest hand bonus. A little repetitive if you do not like the mechanic, but even then the game is short enough that it does not overstay its welcome.

An action selection and set collection rock-paper-scissors guess your opponent's actions game. This game has catch-up mechanics, and there is tons of good interplay with the thieves. Plays quick enough that I wouldn't mind playing it, but I wish there was a little more at stake in this game. Lots of times it just seems more correct to go to the castle than to the auction house, and players can just scream ahead on the track. I'd like to see an updated euro game using some of this games' awesome mechanics in a better way.

RATING: 7
I played this game once at a party with a long-time expert explaining the rules and was entranced with its repeated auction mechanism, which I had never encountered before in a board game. It's bluffy and bitchy and you inevitably start getting into character as you argue over inane objects with debatable value.

I immediately sought out my own copy, yet... you really do need one rules expert to run a session. Everyone else can be an eager first timer, as long as you have one person to remind you of the bidding rules and how to advance from art house to art house. It's not that the rules are so hard, there are just some specific aspects of the bids and scoring you really need to get right.

Without an embedded expert, it's draggy and uninspired. So, my "8" is qualified with "provided you are playing with someone very experienced in the game (not necessarily yourself)."

Also, it's best with four or more players.

The key to playing a game where your actions may work and may not, like in Hoity Toity, is to have the right attitude in playing. If you are expecting a bit more depth and are competitive then you will be disappointed. But if you are just having fun, not caring too much (though still trying your best), you can laugh at the misfortunes of everyone (including yourself). I got to do that in this game and even managed to sneak in for a win by some miracle but it is definitely in that category of "play when in the right mood."

The first german game I played and one of my favorites from the start.  Then again, I always have liked Rock, Paper, Scissors.  The simplicity of the mechanics leaves psychology as the primary determiner.  This one has suffered from a nearly incomprehensible title (Adel Verpflichtet?) that even native Germans have trouble translating and explaining the meaning.  I'm glad to see it reprinted as a six player version with a title in english (but couldn't they come up with something better than Hoity Toity?)--I want to try out Hoity Toity with a full complement of players, but am not sure if it will be better with 6 or get bogged down.  Update:  It gets bogged down with 6.  Better with 4 or 5, but nice to have the option of 6.

First time I played it the other players found it somewhat lackluster and never asked for it again.  Pity, since I like auction and bluffing games, and I like Klaus Teuber's games.  On repeated plays I still feel that it is underwhelming in spite of its commercial and critical success.

Although this brought a lot of new ideas to the table in 1990, it has, for me, not aged too well. My biggest complaint is that bad luck can eliminate you from the race within the first few turns without any chance for a comeback.

Fun theme, interesting and fun mechanics, and ultimately more luck than skill.  If you're not playing it to have something to laugh at, then don't play.  Too frustrating if you're on the losing end of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game too much.  It's a fun game if you keep a good pace and don't overthink it.

I can't my finger on the reason, but I really really like this game. 01/07/06 I played again last night. The game falters a bit with 5 players. We ran into a situation where 3 players had no thieves ( they were all in prison ), one player had no cash ( with no thief he had no chance to get more cash ) This really created a lock for the two players with thieves. Not a situation for a fun game. 

4-18-08 It appears we played incorrectly in that last session. With 5 players thieves get out of jail quicker than with 6 - the jail is smaller. We missed this rule and thus ran into a snag.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Maybe it is unfair to judge older games like this against more modern fare, but ultimately I have one game table on which I get to play one game at a time, so competition has to occur.  Regardless of any previous fun with the title, a game a like Hoity Toity just can't keep up, but even so I wonder if the fun was ever as fun as I remember or if it just occurred when there was little euro game fun to be had.  In the intervening years since the rise of popular gaming I nearly never referenced the title and that alone stands in witness against it being anything other than "ok"

I think you think I'm going to play the Thief so I'm going to play Exhibit, but maybe you think I'm thinking this, so it might be better if I play the Detective.  Add in a few other players and it's more guesswork.  Too chaotic for my tastes.

I find the game play to get stale since the last half of the game does not have the same number of options as the first half does.  Once all of the art has been acquired, the options are more limited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Gameplay is very, very, very repetitive; this is acerbated by the fact that there are very few options to choose from at any given time. The sole mechanic of the game is of the ‘I think you think I know you think that…’, which doesn’t involve much strategy or bluffing. Very difficult to collect sets of three of the same colour, or to steal from somebody else’s exhibit. You’ll spend most of your game in the auction hall. Good luck to anybody playing black, he has some of the worst money/thief cards around. Overall a very disapointing experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Basically a guessing game but with a good memory (of what thieves, checks and items the other players have collected) one could come up on top.  Easy to teach and probably not bad in a party setting although I've only played in on SBW so far.

As English nobles, players decide whether to go to the auction house or display an art collection. Either location you can be a thief to steal from other people, or be a detective to put thieves in jail. Displaying an art collection allows one to advance along the game track. If multiple players are displaying collections, larger collection wins. Show an art collection, or go to the auction? Some doublethink, some guesswork. It's okay, but don't try to treat it as a deep strategy game.

The epitome of an 8-rated game: Very good if not great game; Withstands the teeth of time in an excellent manner (hard to believe it's over 20-years old); Excels with a limited range of players (namely 5). Half of the time you lose because you try to second and third guess everyone else.

Too tiny Cards, slightly confusing rules, chunky theme and chintzy bits combined to form a cute little game.  Definately for those who love to out guess your neighbors.  You are trying to alternatively steal and purchase items, and move along a scoring track at the same time.  Add in limited resources (thieves and money) to the game and it makes it all interesting.  Has an elegant equalization mechanism  (detective catches thief in the castle, you move up the board a number equal to your place in the game.  IE 5th place moves 5, 1st place moves 1) With nicer bits, cleaner rules, and modified theme, could be a better game.  Can see why this was a great game for the time.   Definately has an appeal, but is eclipsed by later games.  Play if you get the chance.

RATING: 6
Fun simultaneous action selection game in which you have to second guess your opponents' intentions, which is actually not as difficult as it might first appear. The game is a bit of a one-trick pony, with each round playing much out the same way (though your personal circumstances will definitely shift from round to round!), can fall flat with the wrong group, and it does run a tad too long for what it is, but this has been hugely influential and probably deserves its classic status. Best with 5-6.

RATING: 6
Plays quickly and has that "you know, that I know, that you know, that I know..." kind of thing working for it. I like it, but I'm surprised it appeals to so many of the more "hard-core" gamers (for lack of a better word). It has a very party-game feel to it. The decisions to be made aren't very complex, and there's not much reason to ponder anyway as you don't have very much control over things. Almost requires that you play with 5 (or 6 of you have Hoity Toity... what a horrible name for a game... I didn't think you could do worse than Adel Verpflichtet!) to appreciate the game.

The extended game of double-triple-guessing, it ends exactly when it needs to end.  No one is ever fully out of the race.  And it's got a wonderful back-stabby moment or two every game.  How can you not like this?

Well, it's kind of simple.  If you like it complex, it ain't for you.

Hoity toity version that allows six players. I would not play this with less than five, but I have so many good five player games that I would rather play those with five. There is not so many good games with six though, and this one works quite well with that number of players. The game remains fast with even six players, since it employs a simultaneous action selection mechanism.

RATING: 8
Gentle but rather cheeky game of double-guessing in which players have got to advance along a track by exposing their art collections: their activities include bidding for works on and stealing the winning cheques at the auction house or staying at the castle to expose items, steal exposed items from other players or have a detective catching thieves in flagranti. Players first decide where they will act, and after their choices are revealed they then choose their concrete action. Especially this proceeding rises the gameplay above pure bluffing. The effects of the actions are more violent the more players are involved (for two players the author offers a couple of fixes to compensate the simplistic interaction, though).

For all the kudos and money Klaus Teuber has received for Die Siedler von Catan, Adel Verpflichtet has aged way more gracefully. Games could be set up in two minutes back then as well (sob).

RATING: 9
Excellent game and underrated by previous commenters. 

I love the simultaneous action selection mechanism and this game makes the best use of it. You need to engage in mind reading, trying to judge your opponents position and his reasoning and risk preferences. People call it dumb rock-paper-scissors, but there is much more to it as every move has very different tactial implications. In my opinion, you can't actually say there is much luck involved - at least no random. Every action evolves only out of the players decisions. If you call it luck, I really prefer that kind of luck to rolling dices or drawing cards or flipping coins. At least you have a real chance to predict your opponents moves out of analysis. To me it has much more complexity than rated. 

So, in my opinion, plenty of tactics and strategy involved. What adds much to the enjoyment is the thrill. I feel it is really exciting. 

To me the only real downside is that starting positions can be pretty unfair. If you draw a really awkward set in the very beginning, it can be quite decisive and spoil much of the fun.

I give it a 7 with 6 players (there are gaps in the cheque and thief sequences to make up the missing set) - as there's more fun and more competition. This is one of the ultimate Vizzini games. But Vizzini can only carry a game so far, so this is still just an occasional game for me. It drops a rating notch for each player less than 6.

1/24/10: Hoity Toity is a decent game.  It plays quickly, about 45 minutes for a 4 player game, so that is a definite plus.  My main problem with the game is that it didn't engage me.  I liked the bluffing/rock-paper-scissors aspect, but wish there was a little more meat to it.  I can see myself liking the game a bit more on subsequent plays, but I doubt it'll be one I ever end up requesting to play.

Excellent game with 5 (Rate it an 8), but not so good with fewer folks.  As a stone-paper-scissors mechanic, it can be frustrating to keep guessing wrong, and playing to oppose people can fluster the heck out of you.  If you play and enjoy games only when people make good, strategic decisions every time, this one won't be for you.  It has the same sort of choice frustrations as Pirate's Cove.

RATING: 6
It is unfortunate that any game require a very specific number of players.  Needing five AND capping out at five is the reason this game gets a 6 instead of a higher score.  Even if it accomodated one more player, that is still an unacceptably narrow range.  If it peaks at 6 it should be constructed to accomodate 5-7 or 5-8 players.  That said, good fun in this box, but not a serious person's game.  Not one you'll likely play 3 times in a row.

Update: Sadly I feel this 'classic' hasn't aged well in the 20 odd years:-although mechanically easy to get into, for 45-60 mins it is too repetitive with hardly any development besides holdings and movement 'increments'. I find this is such an issue that I feel the need to include a mid-game start variant. Only the unique theme, coincidental sitcom and mind games saves the design, but again marred by the stealing to disrupt chains souring the vibe.

Most fun with 4 or 5 players as this increases the coincidence of visiting the same location and increases the competition for the desired resources. I appreciate the design of this game with its inherent sit com and the psychology of bluff and double bluff which because each player's programmable choices are the same makes it easy to relate to others. But where it fails to be a keeper is that: a)the hand content often doesn't change much, so evaluation of what to play can be a little repetitive; b)the stealing factor puts some players off, especially the brutal tactic of breaking up players' collection chain. So this game has a certain attitude suitable for that kind of group mentality.

The game is pretty much based on one clever game play mechanic and that is simultaenous choice of action(s). Yet, I feel that something is missing from the game and the odd extra mechanic would have been nice. Sometimes, especially at the very early and the late stage of the game, the choics just seem too limited and the information regarding the other players' strategies and motives simply too easy to obtain. It also plays a tad too long for being so simplisitc. Then again, it might speed up and smoothen out with more plays

Adel Verpflichtet by Avalon Hill
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The more I play it, the more I enjoy it. Lots of double guessing and bluffing involved. When it comes off, fantastic, but it is one of those games where coming last is completely frustrating and you feel like never playing the game again. Excellent scoring system such as the ability to score 5 points if you're coming last by choosing the detective and capturing a thief means you don't always want to be miles ahead - it's fairly easy to catch the leader.

Some interesting attempts at guessing and out guessing your opponents, but it never really feels like you have much control.  Even the balanced distribution of money and thieves can lead to situations where you're clearly ineffectual (unlike Ra where control of the game flow can exploit the various levels of bidding power.).  A light and fun game, on occasion, but I much prefer Raj, or even High Society or For Sale for similar experiences in less time.

This game is about collecting a set of antique objects, but the main mechanism is not set-collection, but rather out-guess your opponents: "Does my opponent play a thief, because he thinks I will present my collection. So I should rather play the detective, unless my opponent thinks that I think ..." 

This game is this  mechanism in pure form without much else. Although this purity has its merits, out-gessing my opponents is not my favourite  mechanism and hence I do not rate this game higher.

A nice game of selecting actions but then hoping your action is counter-acted by someone else.  As a result, there is a bit of group think needed to do well.  Mechanically, a simple game - easy to teach, easy to learn - but need to read the other players a bit and outguess them to do well.  While the actions might be repetitive, the short playtime makes sure the game doesn't overstay its welcome.

Before there was Catan, Teuber's first hit (at least in the American market) was Adel Verpflichtet, a great little bluffing game. It's easy to think that it's a litte one-note now, but it hits that one note so perfectly and stays just the right amount of time that it's a true winner.

Playing it for the first time in 2013, it didn't seem as revolutionary as it might have felt to the first Americans to try it. As one of the first German games to make it across the Atlantic, there are things like simultaneous turns and victory points that must have felt completely unreal. A fun game, and one that should be back in print if there were any justice.

This is my favourite filler game, though it's slightly on the long side to so-qualify.  Not terribly skilled, in that you're left to guess at what the other players are doing without enough information to be really analytical about it, but chaos and hilarity tend to ensue.  A proud collector exhibiting his collection to a room full of detectives never fails to elicit a laugh.

Then.... played again and Walla!  Helps to get the rules right, and we had a blast.  Excellent mindgames to be had.  Don't take it too seriously though.

A brilliant and simple game. Rock Paper Scissors on steroids is how I would describe this. This is such an easy game to teach and to play even to non-gamers, yet it's really quite absorbing as you attempt to outguess your opponents.

I really was not all that impressed with my playing of this.  However, that might have been because we were playing with three.  That is a real shame as I had expected to find it more interesting a game.  The blind selection mechanism is hard to do well (such as in Pick Picknic).  In this game, is seems as though it is too easy to be hurt by the selection.  Perhaps it was just really poor play on my part.  [03/13/2011]

Alea version. My Alea collection is complete. Mwahahahah!

When I first played this game, I thought that it was too simple to be good (I mean, it's Rock Paper Scissors for crying out loud!!!).

The game finished and I was struck at how the simple element of guessing and double guessing married well with the bluffing elements. This game has been described as a psychological game and in a sense, it's true.

With games like poker, there are alot of meta elements happening. Adel Verp offers all this and more. It's a modern classic that has aged VERY well.

My initial impression after one play is the game is light, but fun.

So there is a lot of second guessing your opponents which I find fun. The game is not particularly deep, but it is pleasant nonetheless.

Enkele snob Lords proberen een zo groot mogelijke kunst collectie aan te leggen. wat ze niet op de kunstmarkt konden kopen proberen ze door dieven op pad te sturen toch nog in hun bezit te krijgen. Krijg je lucht van dieven stuur een detectieve op pad en krijg toch nog aanzien op het punten bord. De meeste punten zijn echter te verdienen door op tentoonstelingen met de grootse collectie te verschijnen...

Steeds weer even leuk om te spelen, en zeker een betere in de categorie voor grotere speelgroepen.

My first true Eurogame. There is a lot of luck involved, and yet almost no randomness, like rock-paper-scissors. The best strategy, in the end, is virtually no strategy at all--otherwise, people will be able to guess what you're going to do, which means they will do you wrong. Easy to teach and understand, and generally a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.

I played with three players, and it was awful, though I won handily. I'm sure it would be better with more players, and that's where my rating comes from, but downtime would increase, as would luck. The game is too transparent to offer difficult decisions apart from the bluffing involved with the rock-paper-scissors simultaneous action selection, and I don't find that hugely interesting or rewarding. As a result, I doubt I'd ever request to play with any number of players. Impressive for its time.

Highly interactive, quick-playing game that should appeal to most who aren't turned off by the "rocks-paper-scissors" element of guesswork.  I'm pretty sure my brother and I played this when it was new back around 1990 and it still holds up well.

Excellent blind bidding game, with a lot of bluff involved. It has the drawback of only really playing well with at least four players, but in that case it's a very nice middleweight game that can easily be played in less than an hour. Good, shortish games, we can never have enough of those.

RATING: 5
A series of rock-paper-scissors blind presentations eventually leads to a winner. One of those games that's fun while it's on -- the rounds of bluffing are fun, particularly when thieves are involved -- but doesn't feel like much of a [i]game[/i]. Strategy is not particularly rewarded and it goes a little too long for the level of thought involved.

RATING: 6.2
I liked it enough to buy it after one play, but it really hasn't struck a chord now that I have it home. It is nice that it plays with six, but it seems long with six. On the other hand, with less than six, the burglers take too long to get out of jail.......

RATING: 7
I really like simultaneous action selection games, so this one was fun for me.  I would never play this one with less than 4 people.  Towards the middle of the game it can seem like it's getting repetetive, but as you move towards the end game the game flavor changes.  Gameplay now gets very strategic and tense as people situate themselves to have the best overall collection for the end game.  In summary, a fun game with simple rules, a good meta-game component, and great player interaction.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I enjoyed both plays, it was a good quick game.  Easy to learn.  Amusing to guess what everyone else is doing and see if you are going to get screwed and if you can screw someone else.  Ultimately though this is just a guessing game.  Though okay to play a couple time, I really don't have any desire to play this more.  If other people wanted to play I would join in no problem though, I don't dislike it, it just would never be my suggestion.

[FX Schmid 'Adel Verpflichtet' 1990 edition] {Merchant; blind-action selection, set-collection; scalable} Hoity Toity is a funny family game with many interactions and some intrigues. It is more a double-guessing game than bluffing. It's chaotic and players cannot control much but it's usually funny each time when the decisions of players are revealed: someone must be yelling. It's quite frustrating to have both thieves in the jail.

[Uberplay edition] The new edition of Uberplay is better than the old version: more players, prettier parts. It's more expensive, though. (My wife likes Mickey Mouse. So I have to stick to the old versions, in which Mickey Mouse is one of the antiques :laugh: )

Adel Verpflichtet packs lots of laughs and groans into a short playing time, which is a good thing.  For some reason, I really enjoy trying to predict the actions of my opponents.  I think a fair warning would be that Adel is one of those group-dependent games.  Players have to be willing to take runs of bad guesses in stride, and want to laugh and get just a little bit loud.  Still, for five players who want to have some light-hearted fun, I recommend Adel highly.

I enjoy this set-collection game greatly, but never seem to be able to outguess other players. This has a rock-paper-scissors mechanic ... maybe I should stick with good old trusty rock :) Update: this is one of the first German-style games I played, and it was a staple in the early day of the Alan Moon's Gathering of Friends, so I played it quite a bit. It's started to feel a little be dated to me during my last couple of plays, however ... it just doesn't feel as polished as the best of the new breed of games. I'm leaving my rating at a solid 7 and will still play this if others request it, but I think it's going on my trade pile. There are too many great games vying for attention to play a game like this, which is solid but hardly spectacular, very often.

RATING: 7.5
When people complain about games that are multi-player solitaire then it is always nice to remind them of this gem. 

The rock, paper, scissor mechanic may be simplistic and even unoriginal but it is well executed here. The game could feel repetitive, but it does not. There a number of choices to weigh dependent on your needs, opponents needs or even board position (the movement mechanic is an underrated aspect of the design). Because there are a number of things to pay attention to you aren't feeling as though your are doing the rock, paper, scissors thing AGAIN. It flows as an organic part of the gameplay.

The game has held up very well. And while it will not be a favorite for everybody, it should be acknowledged as a minor classic from the guy who had already given us a major one.

Update:  Raised my rating from 7 to 7.5. It is a lot of fun when the entire group understands it. 



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1.5

OK, it is basically an elaborate game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, while some recent releases feel like little more than a slightly different way of putting together the same old mechanics, this one feels fresh and different even nearly two decades after its release.
What this game really needs, however, is quick play.  As a 30-45 minute game it is fun and light.  If people try to overanalyze it and take forever it becomes a dull slog to the finish.

Hoity Toity edition. Intelligent game mechanism. Nice revision to make it a 6 players game. Simpel rules, but interesting interactions. A good training on mind reading ability. Good mind reader can benefit from bother majority and minority situations. Different strategies can be devised among different game groups. 
My fastest game group can finish a game in no more 10 minutes. Non gamers with excessive common sense would often wrongly play a detective in auction hall. ROFL. An experiened gamer playing with a group of lawful players is another kind of unenjoyable challenge. lol. However, I like playing with and beating cunning players. ;)

A light game but highly dependent on luck. Runaway leader issues are real high and since this is a very luck based game with simultaneous actions, it may turn off some people. Still a decent game and can be enjoyed or understood with minimal teaching or instructions. Would consider it a medium filler (30 minutes). Enough tension to be exciting. Best with 5.

Silly game, rarely do you have control of the situation but if you good at reading people, this game is for you. WIll play it, but won't ask for it.

Picked up off the TBGT Prize Table (Adel Verpflichtet).

I played this once online, and I was pretty sure I liked the game, but there was alot of time between turns.  Now that I have played it for real, I can say for sure.  I hear alot of people complaining about "Blind Bidding" games, and I found a game that actually seemed like "Blind" bidding I might agree with them.  In this game there seems to be lots of things to base your decisions on.

Yuck.  Is there a number of players with which this game is fun?  Three players makes the game uninteresting because the player who goes solo gets a big advantage, and six players makes the game so chaos driven as to be impossible. It's too difficult to judge what other players are going to do, and it becomes a crapshoot.  I usually enjoy a bit of double-think, but a whole hour of double-think that's this simple?  That's too much.  As my friend pointed out, one game of rock, paper, scissors is fine.  63 games in a row are less exciting.

I've found a new appreciation for this game. Must be played with 6 players! It's a lot like Citadels which I love because you have to guess what your opponents are going to play. Sometimes your best move isn't what you should do becausae your opponents will play accordingly. A lot of excitement for a game about exhibiting antiques.

RATING: 7
Better then I remembered. 

You choose whether you play in the castle or outside. You can bid for art and the highest bidder wins but the thief can steal all the money. Or you try to move on the board.

The rules could have been a bit clearer concerning the collecting of the cards. (You keep them)

This one just doesn't get me, despite the second-guessing nature of the game.  Normally, I like those sorts of games, but the fact that you have to do it twice might be why this one doesn't click with me.  The mechanisms are just all weird, and it seems easy for someone to win just by drawing random cards.

Easy for newbie game players.  Fun, but not too deep, as results come from a rock-paper-scissors guessing mechanic.  I think 6 may be too many players, which results in less interesting choices.  5 is probably the sweet spot.

Fun game of bluffing and double guessing. Quite fast and hilarious. At first, rules aren't very clear: you need a couple of turns in each situation two understand the dynamics. The art is really old fashioned but it was expected, being 26 y.o.

After the second game... i must say it is very funny, already in three. I guess in 4 or 5 it will shine the most

Blind voting/bidding and bluffing is one of my least favourite mechanics (as experienced in games like Pirate's Cove).

+- a bit strategy with inspiration, but spontaneous suggestion maybe improve your strategy
+- just collecting but no building engine, your actions remain the same if you hold a thief and an exhibition, actions didn't become stronger/greater
- not challenging, short learning curve
- accidental and random blocking mechanics

A truly light game of out-guessing your opponents while trying to position yourself the best. Quick, lighthearted and easy to play. Be warned, though -- with more people, you can easily find yourself having several turns in a row where you do nothing, simply by guessing wrong or mathematically having the weakest series of cards in a set (thieves/checks). A good 1/2 point of my rating is Nostalgia, as this is one of the earliest "Euro" games I played that was successful.

This game has some wonderfully unique mechanics and is quite fun.  There seems to be a bit of a rich-get-richer problem, but I haven't played enough to see how often that problem occurs.  It's definitely pretty lame with less than five or six players.  Four is ok, but three just causes the mechanics to break down a bit, and one person ends up as a runaway leader.

A fellow player commented that it was basically a paper, rock, scissor game.  I guess I would sort of agree with that.  Personally, I really don't find flipping cards over and over again to compare what you chose with your opponent's selection a very fun thing to do.  Also, when someone gets 8  cards in his collection, it is very hard to beat him when exhibiting.  Then there's the problem of deadlocking when people kept using the same choice to force a steal to happen.  This game was too straightforward for my taste.  Really would not want to play it again.

You need at least 4 to make this worth playing...the more, the better.  I like the guess/double-guess aspects of the game, but not much else.  For its time, it was an excellent game...and now that hundreds of others have hit the market since, I can't see this being played very much at all.

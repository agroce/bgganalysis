My current favorite two player game.  I enjoy the tension in deciding if I should give my opponent a card I *know* he can use or playing a card when I *know* the next card I draw will be the six after I play the seven.  A great game.

RATING: 7.6
This is a fun 2-player game that properly balances strategy with risk.  As with any game involving risk, this means luck plays a large role too.  The game is growing on me the more I play it.  Currently, I am enjoying "Morels" slightly more than this one, but that probably depends on my mood.  Give this one a try!

Very good game for those with a weakness for Knizia Maths Torture which I am. The early decisions are always tense and one often picks up cards (especially towards the end)with a hollow feeling in the pit of one's stomach. But it is weakened somewhat by the lack of enough player interaction. Actually I'm no longer sure about that. After playing against the same player alot the history weighs ever heavier on how you play and improves the game.

RATING: 6
Set collection/hand management with push your luck tension.

Yes it could basically be played with a regular deck of cards, and the theme is non-existent, and yes the card quality/choice is absolutely terrible (poor stock quality, black edges, and oversized preventing card sleeves- almost makes me think the design is intentional to make it like a disposable razor), BUT the gameplay is great.  It's definitely a wife-friendly game, it has some luck, but there's definitely tactics and strategy and it's overall addictive fun.  Simple, easy to play/learn, and worth the $18-20 you have to pay for the great idea contained in the "normal" deck of cards.

Fun game, simple....you can pretty much approximate this with a deck of cards, but the art is pretty and it never hurts to support the designer.  
Update:  I like the game less and less every time I play it.  I guess its because I feel so constrained when I play the game.  You make decisions at the beginning at the game and at some point it just feels like you're just playing it out.  Its now a 4 and may well go lower soon.
Update2: Talked about it with my girlfriend, she pointed out mistakes I made during the play tried it again tonight, its back to a 6.  You do have a bit more control than I realized.  I thought it was missing a tactical element, but it was just that i wasn't paying attention.  Also would have been better if we were playing 3 rounds with the winner at the end - that would create a story arc.

RATING: 8
Big fan of Lost Cities.  Very simple game to understand, but there's a lot of strategy.  I also love that you can basically chose how long you want the game to be.  You can play one round if you wanted a quick game or you could play nine rounds if you wanted an epic game.  My S.O. and I normally play medium-length at 3-5 rounds. 

Scoring system is very well designed and forces players to evaluate risk / reward of every expedition and card play.  The game can frustrate a lot of people since you are frequently forced to make undesirable decisions, but it's really a matter of minimizing the harm, and maximizing potential reward. 

Only downside to the game is that there is a significant luck element in which cards you draw.  However, I find that this normally evens out when playing a 5+ round game. 

I'm giving it a "8" for strategy, fun, and short / flexible length of the game.  It's not the perfect strategy game, but it's one that I'm almost always in the mood for, and I have not grown tired of at all after a dozen plus plays.

RATING: 6
Simple to learn, harder to master.  You can learn to play this in minutes but it will take a few plays to figure out the nuances.  Fast and fun so you can play many times in a session.  No direct interaction with your opponent - you play your cards on your cards and discard to common discard piles and draw from a single draw pile until it is exhausted.  Game ends when draw pile is depleted and with both players holding a full hand of cards.  The interaction with your opponent is more about misdirection of your intentions and what cards to show him or continue to hold in your hand.

I played this a lot with my wife. Both enjoyed it. Quick and relaxing. But since it is such a shallow game, it doesn't take too many plays before one knows how to play optimally. In the end we felt we could just as well toss a coin to see who would win, and traded it.

As regras são simples e dá para jogar várias partidas seguidas (o jogo é rápido). A caixa do jogo é grande demais, mas eu achei legal ter um tabuleiro (mesmo sendo essencialmente um jogo de cartas) e espaço de sobra pra um lápis e papel para fazer o score final. O tema é praticamente nulo, apesar da arte sóbria ser um ponto positivo.

Uber easy, yet deep.  You take some risks and sometimes it pays off big time, otherwise it doesn't.  After I read all the indepth reviews I was beginning to wonder why I ordered it.  Normally I don't want a card game involving numbers.  I tend to think of it as just more darned Rummy or Rook.  Well, I was wrong.  This is a great game and another reason I'm learning to love Knizia.  This game is just such a great pick-up game for 2 people, beautifully done.  The board and cards just add to the flavor of the game.  I originally expected something a lot different based on the description so I was disappointed... until I actually played it!  Awesome game for 2 players.  Highest marks for sure!

I really enjoy this one... it's light, it has a fun theme, yet there is a suprising amount of depth to it. I hope to have more plays of this one... it's giving Battle Line some good competition. I love how you can take the top cards on the discard piles... it opens up some really interesting opportunities.After playing this quite a bit more, I have to rate it above Battle Line. The replayability and universal appeal of this game make it win for me. I'll still keep Battle Line but it probably won't see as much play... at least not until I wear this one out.

Our favourite quick filler. Hundreds of games, and the cards are holding up well. Easy to get some games in before dinner. Terrific.

We are now on our 4th copy of this game, having given away our playing copies to friends. The cards are now sleeved and it is even lovelier to play, in a tactile sense, and this copy should last forever.

One copy we gave away to friends living on their yacht in Bundaberg, truly became Lost Cities when their yacht with all their posessions was totally lost in the flood in January 2013. At least they had some fun with it before the game went on its own acquatic expedition.

This is a standard (i.e. feels very traditional) card-game, which could probably be played with a poker deck, but is enhanced by the lovely artwork. The rules are easy to pick up, and there is strategy, but there is also a heavy dose of luck required. It has that "Just-one-more-round" factor, which is a positive thing, and it's a game my girlfriend will request to play.

It is hard to say whether Lost Cities is a masterpiece or just an average game. If you are the owner, you love it because it is easy to teach and to carry with you. If you are just a player, you love it because it is easy to learn, plays quick and offers meaningful decisions to make. There are few other games that are so simple but still offer a healthy amount of things to ponder.

To answer my initial question, I have to say that I am inclined to put Lost Cities into the category of good averages. This is because in the long run the game becomes a bit repetitive. By this I am referring to the fact that most of the time you are just making wild guesses when starting an expedition. Of course, you can try to read your opponent's hand and thus make good or better guesses, but still most of the excitement in drawing the cards.

Nevertheless, Lost Cities is a good 2-player game for occasional playing.

Probably the best two player German-style game I've played.  It has the stamp of genius...simple but clever and deep.  The hardest decisions sometimes have to be made and it can be painful to discard a card that you know your opponent may want or that you are likely to want later.  It's amazing how often you play a card and then find that the one you pick up could ideally have been played before it.  Lots of thought goes into each game and yet you are never left with a headache.  How can such a simple concept be this good?  In addition, my wife adores it, and so I can almost gaurantee a game of it anytime I like.

Has the feel of [thing=760][/thing], but much more simple.  It lacks direct conflict, but is not a boring multi-player solitaire game, as many Euros are.  It has a passive-aggressive component to it, where you can do things like draw from the draw deck to speed the game up and keep the other guy from meeting his goals, or holding on to cards that he desperately needs.  Best part it plays quickly -- VERY quickly, and is a lot of fun in a small, quick package.  Also, a big plus with small children (about 3rd grade): it teaches math without being boring.

I think I could actually use this as a gateway game for several friends.

RATING: 8
Excellent 2pl game!  Quite a bit of randomness in the card draw, but good playing will be rewarded.  Fun and interesting, not overly long.  If I played 2pl games more often, this would be high up on the list.

Negatives:  Not particularly deep or strategic.  Not long enough to see any development.

But the negatives are also some of the game's greatest strengths.  Perfect for what it is.

Game of strategy.  Pts are earned by taking journeys.  To start a journey costs you to begin at negative twenty, y ou may begin playing multipliers, your goal to get rid of the negatives and into positive.  A game consists of three rounds.  Good mathematics here and practice with integer operations.  A round ends when the deck of cards runs out.  Cards in your hands do not hurt you, only the cards played.  Be careful you must balance playing cards and  yes if you are not wise you may be feeding  your opponent pts.

Not a bad filler at all.  I know it has a reputation as a gateway game; unfortunately the maths involved (as undemanding as it is) seems enough to prevent it from being a good game to play with my daughter.  With slightly less calculating involved at the end this could be a big hit for the ten year old crowd...

Update: it *is* a big hit for the ten year old crowd, who have proved much less afraid of simple maths than I had feared. Lots of fun.

RATING: 4
Boring. 

There are a few tricks with numbers, and an elegance Knizia is famous for, but it's not a deep game. The 'bluff' and guesswork elements are wildly overrated. 

I find Battleline boring too, but it's strictly superior to Lost Cities.

It is mystifying to us how this is such a standard recommendation for 2-player games.  It is no worse than many conventional card games, but if you have a deck of cards and a copy of Hoyle's you can play better games than this -- and not pay $20, or wonder "what's the hype about?"  The claims of very deep strategy (don't discard things your opponent needs -- really?) don't convince me.

Compare with Battle Line:  even the standard rules (with tactics + 10s, no play on taken stones) are a vastly superior game.

This game is bursting with adequacity. Would be a good thing to play with a non-gamer spouse as long as they don't hate math too much. Adding up after each phase is annoying without pencil and paper. Still, it's perfectly serviceable quick fun.

RATING: 7
Lost Cities consists consists of 1 simple boardgame and 60 cards.  There are just 5 spaces on the board with different colours.  Cards were also separated into these respective colours with ascending numbers and multiplier effect cards.

At the start of the game, players starts with 8 cards.  They can choose to discard their cards or place cards for play by placing coloured cards onto the board of the same colour.  By placing a number cards on the board, the column that the player played starts with -20 points.  Before number cards were played, multiplier cards can be played.  Multiplier cards can double/ triple or quadruple your score (depending on the number of multiplier cards are played), but it will also cause you to start with a more negative points (also dependent on the number of multiplier cards played).  

Whenever a card is played or discard, player can draw a new card, either from the discard pile or from the new deck of cards.  The game ends when the new deck of cards are all drawn by players.  As the result, players can prolong or shorten the game by taking cards from the discard pile or from the new deck respectively.

Good points: The game has simple rules and involves some strategies during play.  The game is good for people who like short games.

Bad points: The game invloves in some luck when drawing of the cards.  However I think it could be offset by placing cards wisely.

The concept of searching for lost cities is totally irrelevant however, since this is really an abstract suit building game of scoring high against a high initial risk. Again, it is waaaay better than it sounds, and has a great mechanic whereby if you discard a card you don't need. your opponent can nick it - meaning you have to be careful what you get rid of as well as what you put down.

It has lost a lot of it's luster over the years but it still comes out now and then. Luck of the draw issues are tempered by playing multiple rounds in a game. Nice decisions to make in a quick, light game. Not much to complain about with this one other than the end game. Still there are better light two player games IMO. I think I'd prefer Schotten-Totten (the original and better version of Battleline) and probably Balloon Cup over this one.

Usually play this with my Dad during our coffee time.  I'm still learning to understanding what is a good and bad move.  So far I just try to wait until I get high cards then start investing.  I guess I have to think more and perhaps play a good player before I feel this is challenging!

After a while, I feel like that draw controls your destiny. True, there are a lot of strategy; True, it is a very deep game. And true, it is fun and additing. But I have not found a way to defeat a bad hand. Should we go for damage control when you feel it is a bad hand? but by the time you know the cards are not coming, it is already too late and damage is done. So how to play well? My low rating is base on the fustration of not be able to beat the game ;-)

This is a great little 2-player card game with a surprising amount of strategy given how quick it is to play and how easy it is to explain to new players. 

This is a favourite of my wife and I and due to it's small size it's ideal for taking on holiday with us. The fact that you play "best of 3" as recommended by the rules means that the winner isn't necessarily so clear after the first game as it can change drastically between games.

A press-your-luck exercise from Herr Knizia. It's beautifully implemented, and surprisingly thematic for a Knizia title: if you don't invest enough, the expedition will fail, but if you overinvest, your opponents will overtake you. This is what Victorian treasure-hunting should feel like, I think.

A pretty brilliant design from Knizia. I prefer Battle Line to Lost Cities, but Lost Cities has the same tension in each card play as Battle Line. Lost Cities feels a bit more like a solitary endeavor (though you must be aware of your opponents' expeditions) but it feels very deep and appropriately agonizing for what it is.

This would be quite a nice game which does not really need the board that comes with it, but it is far too easy to kill the game by negative play shafting your opponent rather than helping your own. A couple of omissions in the rules doesn't help, house rule insertions would help. Playability is still good and involves more thought that appears at first glance. It isn't easy to make a profit from expeditions.

RATING: 9
Good two player game with some fun, fast decisions.  

An ideal filler for two to play while waiting for another game with gamer friends to finish:  you can play 1 round in five minutes, 2 rounds in ten minutes, and so on.  Giving it a 7.  May 2012.

Okay, although this is quite simple, and can feel a bit auto-pilot mindless at times, the design and experience are quite good.  Raising it to an 8.  October 2014.  

This game manages to please and intrigue just about everyone who plays it for the first time, particularly non-gamers, and its design manages to pack many "good game" design principles into a very small package.  Simply put, the game decisions are interesting and pleasing on many different levels.  With some hesitation, but respect necessitated by several key factors, going to raise this to a 9.  August 2015.

I played Lost Cities a couple times. Definitely a fun two player game with a bit of strategy to it. I do worry that after playing it many more times the fun will be played out as people figure out the strategy to win. Then winning will be determined by luck of the draw. I'll have to keep playing it to find out.

RATING: 5
I really didn't like this.(I have played quite a few rounds, but...)  If I were going to introduce games to my grandma this might be useful, overwise it is pretty pointless.  I guess I was expecting something different.  The theme is none existant except for some poor color coded location pictures.  These could have SO much better.  This is just a solitare type game with some more color.  If you really want to play this get the rules use that deck of playing cards at home paste on your own pictures and save $20.

This is an excellent ‘girlfriend game’. I really enjoyed this, the first week I had it I played it almost none stop. I think I’ve burnt it out a little now. The only annoying thing for me though is shuffling the cards, the cards are all in order when a round is over and it takes some time to shuffle them properly. Other than that, a great little game that even my girlfriend requests now and again.  Quite a lot of luck involved but the better player should win over the three rounds more often than not.

it took us a long time to give this game a try mainly because it has Knizia's name on it and we not liked any of his games so far. But when you hear Tom Vasel talk about a game enough you just have to break down and give it a try. And you know what? It is a very good hand management, set collection game with some really tight strategy. The only thing we don't like about it is that wonky scoring. Add up the numbers on the cards, multiply it by the number of this type of card  then subtract 20? It doesn't seem to complicated but we are always having to refer back to the rules and a calculator to see who won. Why does he always have to make scoring in his games so complicated?

Outstanding. My favorite game. I have 40 games in my collection and this is the one I've played most. Only after about 10 hands do you learn that there is an immense amount of strategy in the game. I own Battle Line, which is similar and is made by the same designer, but I keep coming back to this one because it is less cutthroat, simpler, and packed with so many difficult decisions.

[initial rating: 7] I rated this a 9 when it first came out, then that dropped down to a 5 after I played it a lot (I felt the luck of the draw was too strong)... but having recently played it again a few times (after ignoring it for over a year), I remembered what I liked about it in the first place.  I don't think I'll ever give it a 9 again, but it's a very solid 7.

[100+ plays later]

Upped it to an 8, thanks to Brettspielwelt, where it's become my quick game of choice... and allowed to me appreciate it a bit more... but only when playing to target score, preferably 300, or higher.

RK knows the gamers thrills, and he hits the sweet spot once again for me on this 2-player card game.  While the game isn't much to behold on paper, it becomes much more addicting in real life.  The games go by so quick, and that irrefutable human itch to balance and weigh points and risk, is scratched well, thank you.  However once worn, I am not sure I feel as if it was life-changingly innovative.  It seems to follow the rules all too well, I need this game to be more wild and funky, with some character to impress me up to a 10.

The cards are oversized but look very nice and colorful. The board is not really necessary but adds a lttle bit to the not too strong "theme" of the game.
It is a nice card game but not the most exiting one.

Der geistige Urvater von [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] (na ja wenn man bedankt, daß das Spiel schon 20 Jahre auf dem Buckel hat, auch kein Wunder).
Die Aufmachung der Karten gefällt mir ziemlich gut. Das Thema einer Expedition bleibt zwar trotz der stimmungsvollen Spielkarten und dem Spielbrett mit den Schatzkartenmotiven recht abstrakt. Aber mit etwas gutem Willen und Fantasy kann man sich so die -20 Startpunkte pro Expedition doch erklären. 
Ich hatte mich von den sehr einfachen Regeln täuschen lassen aber im Laufe des ersten Spiels dann auch schnell verstanden, daß dieses Spiel nicht einfach eine weitere Multiplayer-Solitair Version ist. Man kann schon auf die Züge des Mitspielers agieren und reagieren. Wenn man gegen Ende des Spiels merkt, daß es ein Zeitproblem gibt um seine tolle Expedition von der Hand bis zum Spielende ausgelegt zu bekommen, dann kann schon Spannung aufkommen. Es kann taktisch klug sein das Spiel zu Verlängern in dem man keine neuen Karten vom Hauptkartensstapel sondern alte evt. unbrauchbare Karten von den 5 Ablagestapeln zu nehmen. Aber evt. wäre es doch besser so schnell wie möglich das Spiel vor seinem Gegenspieler zu beenden bevor der seine Expeditionen mehr als ab bezahlt hat. 
Gutes und schnelles 2 Personenspiel zum Entspannen.
Die Abrechnerei am Ende kann evt. etwas abschreckend wirken (vor allem beim ersten Erklären der Regeln ...)

The girlfriend LOVES this game, which is a big plus for me (as she rarely likes or will play anything).  She'll even bring it up to me just randomly to play.  

Outside of her, I would think this game is still pretty good, but probably not AS good.  A lot of it seems to be timing, as well as some risk vs. reward management.  You could hold cards in your hand until you're 100% sure you'll make a profit.  Or you could risk it, put down some investments, and hope for a good payout.  

And of course, the theme is wholly pasted on, but I guess that's pretty expected.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite two player only games.  There are five different colors and each color has cards labeled 1-9 with three multiplier cards for each color as well.  Object is to stack the cards sequentially (starting with a multipliers if you want to risk it) and at the end of the draw stack you tally your scores.  Here is the kicker though.  You score negative points if you have a stack that has less than 20 points in it.  Each stack you subtract 20 from to get the final score.  That's to keep you from just placing in each color and to make it more complex.  It's mathy but fun.

I've always enjoyed games, but I mostly played cards growing up.  If I played a boardgame, it was Risk or Monopoly or some other American game which was okay, but nothing special.  This game though, perhaps more than any other, really introduced me to the idea of a different kind of game.  I was just looking for something I could play with two people, and more or less stumbled across it.  I was so enamored, I went web searching for more games like it, which led me straight to the Geek.  And the rest, as they say, is history.

A nice, tense little card game that kind of gets bog down by the arithmetic-heavy end-of-round scoring. I can't do it without pencil-and-paper, I'm afraid.

It depends heavily on the interaction between players by risking dropping things you might need later.  If you play conservative, it isn't much fun.

Sencillísimo de explicar y muy corto de jugar. Con cierta estrategia, muy rejugable y para dos jugadores. Es perfecto para iniciar a gente en el tema de los juegos y a las mujeres les encanta (mis dos cuñadas, mi mujer y dos amigas han "caido"). Es perfecto para lo que es. Imprecindible.

Nice, but somehow frustrating. The type of game where you have the illusion to control the situation, but you don't. You need to get stressed at the end of a game to succeed. Well, why playing this stuff when you can have so much stress at your jobplace? Just my personal taste. In any case it deserves a high note for the design, very challenging.

A good game that can be grasped very easily. Ideal for introducing new players to this hobby of ours, but once you play it several times, you don't want to get back.

UPDATE: It really gets boring as the cards you get can really be awful. Plus, for such a light game, the end scoring is just too tedious. Down to a 5.

A quick and easy 2-player card game with nice art work.  Your ability to suceed will depend greatly on the cards you recieve but there are plenty of challenging decisions to be made.  Despite the simple rules there is a lot of replay value here.

I'm still somewhat convinced that Knizia went with 5 expiditions (i.e. suits) just so the game can't be played with a regular deck of cards :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fast paced card game for 2 players. Very easy to learn and fun to play - You only play one card and draw another, if you draw from the draw deck it's always a blind draw so this game is very luck driven. Forget the theme, this is mostly an abstract.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Got this game because of all the positive feedback about partners liking it and beating their BGG husbands as well (my wife will play games but rarely beats me - not very competitive). And yes my wife likes it very much. However was disappointed to discover that the first three games my wife had yet to achieve a positive score. However she now usually beats me (using her witchy powers to influence the cards). Damn that female intuition!
I fully recommend this game if your partner is a reluctant player.

RATING: 6
I did not like this game at first. It was my first Knizia game and was very disapointed. It felt like a glorified 2-player solitaire card game. However, when my partner kept consistantly beating me, I put my mind to give it a serious go. I don't understand why, but I still can't find a strategy that beats her!

In the first 16 games, I have won 2 against her. I've grown to admire and enjoy this game. It has what I'd call indirect interaction and it's cleverly integrated in this surprisingly good game.

I spent the first few games looking at the cards for lost cities. I never did find those cities, but placing numbers in rows can certainly be addictive. It plays faster than a Himalayan mountaineering expedition, and makes me see red more often than trips to the Red Planet.

A doboz alapján nem egy számolgatós kártyajátékra számítottam, ennek ellenére nem voltam csalódott. Kétszemélyes játékokom kevés volt még akkor, ez pedig ebben a kategóriában jónak tűnt az előzetes próba alapján, ezért vettem meg. Tetszik, de azért nem játszanék vele bármikor. (Keltis egy kicsit összetettebb, és kicsivel jobb is.)

Most már nem vagyok benne biztos, hogy a Keltis a jobb, a Lost Cities a maga módján egy letisztult, és egész sok taktikázási lehetőséget adó kis játék.

Part of my rating may be nostalgia since I was playing this regularly before I even discovered BGG. However, there is so much more to take into account such as its simplicity, its depth, its conceit, the blend of strategy and tactics, the art, the over-sized cards, the tiny box, how unique it was at the time (and maybe how unique it is now), how the tension builds throughout the game, how the choices become immediately difficult, how players have a little control over when the game will end, et cetera. I will never turn down a game of Lost Cities. I am not afraid to give it a 10.

This is a nice card game.  I wasn't expecting much from this game but it is pretty good and I enjoy it.  It is a much more toned down of Battle Line.  I actually have a strong urge to play this game again and would suggest to play the game.  However, I don't think the feelings will stay because of it's shallow depth.  I think I would still play this even if I have Battle Line.  I am now deciding if I should get it or not, since I already have Battle Line.  
Initial Rating: 7

Update: 2/16/07
After playing it 55 times in BSW.  I think I like this only on BSW because it is very fast and all the accounting is taken care for me.  I don't have to count the cards afterwards and I don't have to shuffle the cards either.  Each game round only lasts an average of two minutes and off we go to start another round.  I think if I played this face to face, a lot of the charm of a QUICK simple game is lost and I would be bored to tears playing this game.  Having Battle Line IS sufficient and I'll only play this game on BSW.  Since all my ratings are based on face-to-face games, this is a 6.

this is just about seeing who gets the nines and tens... way too random, with no real fun story to make it interesting to see what will the random cards produce. it might be that i havn't given it enough chances to catch on to the strategy if there really is more than i see already, but likely won't try too often in the future as my wife was at least as unimpressed with this as i was.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: A very simple game with some surprisingly tough decisions. Play a card, pick a card. However, do you discard a card and hope that your opponent can't use it, or do you begin an expedition even though that might not net you the most points. This makes a good gateway game and can be played very quickly. My only beef is the endgame scoring can be fiddly.

10 Plays: I'm still enjoying this game. Once you've played regularly with an opponent, the game quickly evolves into a mindgame where you need to bluff your opponent into discarding the wrong cards. Setting the pace for the endgame is a very powerful tool in that regard. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's a lot to enjoy with Lost Cities. I like that the simple rules lead to difficult choices, and often, any card you play could help your opponent more than it does you. If not for this factor, it would rate a point lower, since endgames can become a card churning exercise once you have completed all your expeditions and are striving to exhaust the draw pile.

This is a game that frequently hits the table. My wife likes it and plays it well. Lost Cities is one of the best games to teach non gamers what great games are available today.

Based on the description, I was expecting more than the box provided.  This game is basically a deck of cards, made up of 5 different colors.  Players start "expeditions" by playing cards of the same color in numerical order.  Doesn't really have the feel of an expedition, but it's about as fun as a traditional card game.  However, why should people buy a $20 card game when they have the option of playing over 500 games with a standard deck of cards?  Lost Cities can be addicting for some people, but the same can be said for traditional card games, such as Spades, Hearts, Canasta, etc.

I just can't see what there is about Lost Cities that makes people choose such a mediocre game as a favourite. I mean surely there have to be a bunch of better games than this.  Lost Cities lacks any sense that the theme is meaningful - this could just as easily be a game about cooking pizza, washing dishes or cycle touring.  It lacks depth, and I don't feel it does much more than what a traditional card game like Patience does - all it does is present what amounts to a traditional card game in a nice flashy graphics package - but underneath the make-up it's still basically a variant of Patience.

RATING: 8
[i]Posted: 10/3/05, Rated: 8[/i]

A solid two-player game.  It has been compared to [i][thing=15878]Rummy[/thing][/i], but I find that analogy to be misleading.  [i]Lost Cities[/i] is its own beast.

The "theme" such as it is fits well enough: you are potentially embarking on up to five expeditions that are represented by card colors (or suits).  The art on the cards is very appropriate, but the cards themselves are too big.  They feel "floppy" when shuffling.  The game wouldn't have suffered any had they been standard bridge-deck size.

The scoring calculations are slightly convoluted: starting an expedition automatically incurs a -20 point penalty.  This value represents the initial cost to embark upon the adventure.  The cards that you play afterwards defray that cost, and hopefully result in a net profit.  There are "handshakes" (investor cards) that act as score multipliers, but they must be played first.  They increase the risk and also the possible reward.  All cards are played or discarded face-up, which is important since you and your opponent will probably be vying for the same cards in at least one suit.

The heart of the game is found in trying to maximize the returns from your own expeditions while inhibiting your opponent's efforts.  You can only hold eight cards in your hand, and it is never enough.  You will have to take risks by beginning an expedition before you have enough support for it, or by discarding something your opponent may be able to use.  A particularly frustrating development occurs when you start an expedition for which you have several cards, none of which are handshakes.  Sure enough, as soon as you play the first numeric card, your opponent will start to discard those handshakes.

My wife enjoys this game, and is rapidly becoming a shark at it.  After ten plays or so, I'd be more likely to rate [i]Lost Cities[/i] a "7," but it does get a bonus point for sparking her interest in games.

I like this game. I played the discard piles wrong the first time. For some reason I thought there was 1 discard pile. In fact, there is a discard pile for each of the different colored expeditions. This is a fun and quick 2-player game. The randomness of the cards means both players have a chance even if one is better with strategy. It's compact since you don't really need the board. All around a good game.

Everyone said the card game was better than the board game. We played the board game first, then the card game.

They're basically the same game. The card game is just portable and easy to manage. There is even a nice calculator app out there to track your rounds. I could see us taking this when we travel and want something easy to break out.

Our preference is on the board game though.

Quick and easy filler game. Nothing spectacular, and, frankly, I don't think the cards are that interesting - c'mon, lets have some variety in the scenes rather than different perspectives on what is relatively the same scene for each color. Yeesh. And, yikes, can we do something about the card size (like, shrink them?!).

This was one of the first games we got. We loved it! But then we got some other games and went through a LONG stretch of not playing it (and not really wanting to play it).

Then later, we brought it out again and gave it a shot. We found out that we still really liked it! Yeah, it's not as deep as some other games, but it's light, fun, and doesn't take too long. A very nice 2 player card game for when you're not in the mood for something very heavy.

It's a ton of fun that doesn't disappoint. If you have a wife, husband, boyfriend or girlfriend that plays games (or doesn't), try this on them, they will probably like it!

RATING: 8
Fun game for two that always gets tense towards the end. Tough choices to make as you fund and embark on up to four expeditions. Do you spread yourself thin and score points in multiple places, or go all in on one expedition and cash in on your efforts? Not rocket science, but very enjoyable.

This is our (travel) game of choice. neither one of us has EVER turned down a game, not even during our 2 month cycling trip when we played hundreds of games and you would expect us, towards the end, to be so sick of it, that we would try out its absorption capacity when we realised we overlooked packing some other essentials.

I suspect that if we had to get rid of our entire game collection, these 60 cards would still be the last ones to go. Pathetically simple rules, with dilemmas in each and every turn of a fast and involving game. Apart from a lifelong replacement service for worn cards, there is not much to improve on this classic 2 player game. You can take it anywhere (we have tried), play it on just about any surface (ditto, often intriguing the hell out of onlookers), it is so quick that it  invites many instant replays, and it appeals to gamers from all ages and levels of experience. No wonder, since it is challenging from the opening hand, to timing the play of those last high value cards. Brilliance in a nutshell. Luck, skill, gambling and (blocked) hand management balanced to perfection. The 20 point "hurdle", the frequency of doublers and the temptation to hang on to obtain more vs the need to play cards to keep the hand flowing, the capacity to slow the game down by picking up discards, or NOT, psyching out the hand of your opponent, and trying to survive my favourite gamble: 3 jokers with nothing to back it up. Love it, love it, love it.

4 PLAYER VARIANT:
We have recently started to play the 4 player version again, and I forgot how much I enjoyed that (too). A completely different game evolves, where the end always comes quicker than expected. Making the most of a poor or excellent hand is the loveliest dance each team can be put through. Figuring out what your partner is flagging with the cards they pass on is a nice addition, but deciding when to play and when to leave that to your partner is especially engrossing, even more so since turns are so precious. It seems to be more important than in the 2 player game to make sure that the chances you do get to score high are executed to perfection. If you have a chance to explore the less trodden 4 player path, grab it!

Borrowed from library. 3 playthroughs. My wife enjoyed this game more that I did, that could have been due to her beating me each game. Yes its all random, but i just kept on finding the cards i was drawing were either all high value cards or colors i didnt need. I would probably play this again and  hope for a big swing of luck.

Ok, well on play #7 and #8 i actually won. Best to leave his game alone, now that I am reigning champion

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2007/06/exploradores-lost-cities-1999.html]Exploradores[/url] es un juego sencillo, a veces tengo la sensación de jugar al cinquillo. Asimilar los conceptos básicos del juego, sus posibilidades y las diferentes tácticas se desvelan por si solas a las pocas partidas. Decir el juego que está bastante equilibrado y que su alto factor azaroso compensa el desequilibrio de nivel que pueda haber entre jugadores, lo que lo hace idóneo para pasar el rato con neófitos.

Exploradores es un juego de relleno, portable, para jugadores ocasionales, neófitos o simplemente matar un rato.

A two-player Reiner Knizia game with an inconsequential theme but captivating gameplay.

Fast, fun, thoroughly engaging, highly recommended.

Often times in lost cities, you're holding cards that the other player wants and that you want to hold onto but you have to get rid of one. Do you give the other player what they want or discard something you want? 

Add this to cards where you bet on your own success in a  pretty lucky game and that's where all the fun is. Things may just work out based on your educated guess or maybe not. You take the risk anyway because you need to make up points for the last round you did so poorly in. 

All around a satisfying two player card game where all you do is take a card and play a card. A game I like because I can just shuffle, deal, and play.

My second favorite in the Kosmos 2 player series. You must build expeditions by playing low and hoping you will get higher numbers later. Once you place your next card must be higher. The problem? You play then draw and not vice versa. You often find yourself discarding to avoid geting set but help your partner too. Great balance of what do I do?!

Lost Cities satisfies its intended goal extremely well.  It is not a super flashy or intricate game, but it is serves the purpose of being a semi-easy exciting 2 player game excellently.

Wife and I have really enjoyed our head to head games (as has my brother and I) and we are looking forward to more.  

Such a simple game can get very intense!

A great filler game for 2 players (and one I can actually get my wife to play).  Easy to learn and quick to play.  I don't like luck in my games, but for some reason I'm willing to look past it in this case.  Maybe it's due to the fact that my gaming group got quite competative over this game ;)  The cards do look cool, although the theme is irrelevant.

Simple to learn, with just enough strategy and depth to keep you coming back.  But really, why the whole minus-20-point thing?  There has to be a better way to score a game.  I give this game an 8 up until you have to actually figure out scores.  I'm fine at math, but come on.

// We've played this game quite a bit. It may as well be
themeless, but the mechanics of the game are reasonably 
fun. The tough choices involve when to start a new set of
cards - and whether to place a bet on actually getting 
very far with that set. Meanwhile, your opponent is 
weighing the same decisions and may be interfering with
your plans. I wasn't a huge fan of the scoring in this game
at first, but after playing it more, it works well enough.

About as most perfect a two-player card game as you can hope to find. It seems so simple that you're always amazed it ends up so agonizing and cutthroat at the end (but this never generates any hard or hurt feelings between the two players, as it is completely obvious the other player is trying to do the same thing to you!). And then it's over before it has a chance to get boring. WONDERFULLY balanced. Love it!

I'm not a fan. It's basically two person solitaire but, like solitaire, the whole strategy comes down to whether you can expect your needed card to come with the next draw or not. There are some clever multiplier cards which can add a press your luck component to it, but it just doesn't add enough. There's no theme, little laughter, and just so many other games out there that are better.

20 plays: 

A perfect balance. Nice, light feeling but quite deep variation on the Fantan type of paying cards game. Simple and well made components. 

The theme and art are well done.

I like the amount of strategy and information-tracking: enough to make a difference, but not so much that players get paralyzed. The game flows well, and you finish wanting to play again.

It shines not so much in the depth of any one decision point, but in the enjoyable exploration of slightly different strategies as you play the game more times. In that sense, it's very similar to Jaipur.

The points based system makes it feel anticlimactic.

Usually people that play for the first time this game will loose because they don't know when and how to make better tactics. Easy rules, but if you want to win always, you need to play multiple times.

Now, we are digging for artifacts!

Easy to learn.  Easy to play.  Themeatic somehow but really its about math.  This is a game that I zone out with and that passes away time quickly whilst working subtle strategies that and greatly impact my final scoring tally.

Although it is two person many times I feel like I am playing myself.

I used to think this game was kinda fun if played sparingly, but now I feel that it's only high points are quick setup and portability, but for the same thing I could play Blue Moon (which is a bit more fun).

edit: I'm kicking myself for trading it away. Everything I originally said, I now disagree with.

I played this once, didn't like it, won, played it again, didn't like it and lost ;-). It moves fast, real fast, mainly because I found almost zip to think about, draw, play, draw, play, draw, play one card after the other, th outcome decided by two factors - risk taken and sheer luck. The more risk you take up front, the greater the sink or swim pressure, but ultimately to make the 20 points onece starting ane expedition you must eithe rbe delath the cards up front, draw them form the deck or have an opponent forced to discard one you fortuitously need. To cap it off, there's a mad rush at the end to try and play all the cards you still have in hand and had been sitting on in the hope of bridging the huge gaps under them (which are sealed and point-less once you play them).

In short, didn't do it for me. EIther I haven't worked out the joy or subtley in this or others juts enjoy basic luck games without either a strong social or thematic angle to them.

This is a surprisingly good light/gateway game. Super easy to learn with a little bit of strategy and a great push-your-luck component. Pleasantly surprised. Wish it cost $15 instead of $25, but we've already gotten our money's worth in the first month.

My wife and I like this. Luck in the card draw has some inpact on the game, but there are also some gambling factor to wait exactly long enough to be able to get all your cards out.

Used to absolutely love this game, then had about three games in a row where I got slaughtered by the card draw.  Still like it, but the bad memories linger.

There are some neat mechanics here.  The timing effect (trying to drain the deck down vs. take a discard) and the opportunity cost are significant.  When to move on a color and when not are key.  A good game.  Quick but thought provoking.

I enjoyed this game a few times, but it just seems so monotonous and luck driven.  Plus you could play this with a standard deck of cards and save yourself the money.

I may be picky, but I have a REAL problem with scoring that is this byzantine. Game is fine, cool even, but then the arrhythmic... I mean, there are probably apps to smooth that out, and sure, it's not like I hate every game where the scoring is a bit brutal (Yes... precious... Arboretum...) but this one just seems to pale when compared to modern 2 player fare. Modern two player games that, incidentally, tend to have theme. 

Now I will confess it also could just be that this is a Knizia, who I have just recently purged from my collection, as... well, I've decided that his games just aren't my bag. It could also be that I'm a bit cult of the new, but I think lack of theme and scoring really sums it up for me on this one. Now, lets go play Arboretum... confused yet? So am I.

This has a nice gambling feel to it. You have to risk something, start exploring without having the cards in your hand to make it profitable. The hand management is really tight, as you almost never should discard anything your opponent could use.

This is the game that I use to introduce people into eurogames.  It's easy to understand.  The strategy is straight forward.  I find most important is that it introduces a couple of concepts new to Americans like cards that aren't the bicycle kind and the concept of 'actions' and 'victory points'.  From here I then go to Dominion, and then maybe Carcassonne, and then who knows Lord of the Rings or ...

Boooooooooooooooooooooooring and dry.  I don't get the praise.  Let's play solitaire.. together!  The real lack of player interaction and high degree of luck completely kills this one for me.

It makes people feel smart.

When this game came out, I didn't appreciate it that much; I liked the agonizing decisions, but I don't think I really understood *why* they were agonizing, and as such, that limited my appreciation for the game. Now that I understand Lost Cities as fundamentally a game of risk management, rather than a game of tactics, I like it much better. That tricky Reiner, always packing so much more into games than it seems on first inspection; such elegance and subtlety. There's a reason that he's the best there is.

It's Rack-o! OK, OK, it's an improvement on Rack-o. Actually, probably an idealized version of Rack-o. 

All right, all right, I just like saying Rack-o.

Anyway, good press-your-luck flavored rummyish game that (surprise surprise) is my wife's favorite game. What is it about non-gamers that makes this their favorite game?

Update (after 22 plays): A simple, elegant, and enduring 2-player card game with elements of set collection and press-your-luck. The connection to the theme of exploring ancient ruins is pretty tenuous, but it isn't really necessary anyway - Cribbage, Hearts, Bridge, and Rummy do just fine without any themes at all.

RATING: 8
Pros:
Excellent scoring mechanism.
Many opportunities for decisions.
A unique press-your-luck style of strategy.

Cons:
The board and tarot-sized cards are utterly superfluous, serving only to make the game twice as expensive as a pure card game would be.
The luck of the draw aspect of this game frustrates me every single time I play, to the point that I don't have fun anymore.
Too many games end by one player having a slightly lower NEGATIVE score than the opponent.

Overall, I'm always intrigued by the game and willing to play, but I just can't catch the fire of this one like I can other Knizia classics.

[b]Edit[/b] I've raised my rating from a 6 to an 8. I've been enjoying this much more recently. There are still things that irritate me a little about it but overall this is fun game.

After more plays i realize that Lost Cities is a deep game.  Initially I thought Lost Cities was a  childishly simple,  but after repeated play it is a game of serious risk management.  

The game became a 10 when I learned some new strategies.  I hold off playing cards to find the investment (multipliers) cards, stall by playing cards to break even one color to buy time to score some big points for another and other techniques.

I look forward discovering new strategies.  

Scoring is too complicated.  Should be an easier way like in Lost Cities the board game.

RATING: 6
Based on game play alone I'd only give this a 6 but, like Battle Line and Blue Moon City, Lost Cities offers a great "value" in terms of the game play given for the modest effort and time required and for that it gets an 8. You can pick it up and play it anytime without it ever getting old. I'm finding this is generally true for Knizia's better light/medium weight titles and I appreciate that he fills this niche so well.

UPDATE: Knocking back down to a 6. It got old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For replayability alone, I'd have rated this a 9. However, there's more: Knizia has created a deceptively simple game that requires players to learn distinctively different mechanism for the beginning-game, mid-game, and end-game phases. And there's a tempting "push-your-luck" element: you must be a wise investor and sometimes curb (and sometimes indulge!) the impulse to "go big" with the colors you decide to start "adventures" in. Highly recommended. Packs a lot of fun into a short time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is definitely a great tense game where you have to play or discard, and playing often means giving up potential points, and discarding means helping your opponent.

The flaw in the game, for me, is that while low cards are important for the bonus points, a player who sees more high point cards than the other has a huge advantage.

However, for me, Schotten Totten does everything this game does, but better, tighter, more elegant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far, Lost Cities been all about luck of the expedition draw. I'll need to explore it further though, because the whole timing-aspect--using the discards as a holding pen and 'timing' the game through wise discard--seems to be central to whatever skill is actually involved.It's basically risk-management and gambling. Bonus points for being easy-to-explain, portable, approachable, and newbie-friendly.

A nice light game with some tense decisions here and there (usually toward the end), and a good balance between tactical play and luck.

Even though this was rated as a great wife/girlfriend game, I was reticent to buy it; it seemed too simple and boring.  I was initially disappointed that it didn't have richly themed archaeology cards in the style of Jambo.  Well, it didn't matter.  The family is addicted.  It's nice to play a game that can be played and scored in under 20 minutes, and it's great for families to have around; my son can always find someone who wants to play it with him.

Has a lot to recommend it compared to Battle Line. Games are shorter, which allows luck to even out much faster. Just a lot of fun, and non-gamers love it.

[u]January 10:[/u] A very fast-paced 2 player game. Theme is irrelevant but that doesn't bother me much. I prefer Lost Cities to BattleLine. This is a game you want to play over and over again.

[u]March 2010:[/u] Was writing [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/505083/multiple-player-review-lost-cities]a review[/url] and realized I had to bump the rating one notch. Went from 7.5 to 8.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lost Cities is nothing like Battle Line in my opinion! Well, “nothing like” is probably too strongly worded, but I had always been under the impression that those two games are very similar. The way you need to play cards in order to get points are very different I think. In BL there is much more interaction as you compete directly against each other in order to win flag. There are also the tactic cards which have a big impact on the gameplay. Finally, you build pokerhands in BL, whereas you simply play cards from 1 to 10 in LC… In LC the interaction is very limited (except when you’re discarding cards face-up in the middle, as you need to keep a close eye on which cards the other player can use – this is a great feature). LC is a much more casual and easy-going game, so I honestly don’t think the games have too much in common, and I don’t think you’ll necessarily like one if you like the other. 

To me, LC is the better game as I feel it’s a little more relaxing and without too many hard decisions. It’s better suited for non-gamers or casual play. The time to play feels just about right. Sure, there is the luck of the draw; if you get a couple of the hand multipliers and some high cards in the same suit, you’ll have a big advantage, but that’s why you play three games and compare scores. And despite the luck of the draw there is still room for clever play: when to discard which cards, how many expeditions to start (as you lose points if you start a mission that fails to reach 20+ points, which is probably the best thing about the game).

RATING: 8
This one appeals to me in the same regard that Carcassonne does. Even though the games are very different, they are both very attractive and enjoyable as an activity. I can play the game, think a little bit, and still have a good conversation with a friend. Enjoyable.

Scoring is clever, even if a bit mathy. 

I know people on the geek say it is over-rated, but I think they are forgetting that the rating is for how frequently you would play it. This game is accessible and appeals to a wide audience. The rating is not for "How much it makes me feel like a true and noble gamer." 

I like the board even though it is unnecessary. 

I love the theme connected with the game. Pasted on? I daringly say,"NO!" The excellent execution of the progressive art and design capture my imagination fully. The game is beautiful, the design is tight. Here is my test for theme: while playing, can I make a bold or colorful move and then joke about what must have happened to reflect that move in terms of the theme.

Theme = does it capture my imagination enough that I can explain my moves in terms of the theme. Think about it: can anybody explain to me why the harvests speed up in Agricola and why my young child is able to work in the fields in strict theme terms? No. It makes sense because it is a Euro-game. I don't see anybody talking about how pasted on the theme in Agricola is.

I think Schotten-Totten and Balloon Cup are far superior.  The early-game guesswork about where to open expeditions feels too random to me, and the dilemmas in this game just aren't much fun to me.

Another great Knizia game.  I know that some have criticized RK for rehashing the same theme over and over, just pasted onto a different box.  Well, I own only 4 of his games (and will most likely add T&E as a 5th), and none of them are the same at all.  I guess if you don't buy all 250+ of his games, the "repitition" factor is diminished.

Read the rules and thought, "Eh. Not bad." Then ran through a solo dummy game and thought "pretty good I suppose." Then played the first game with my wife, and all the agonizing choices came to the forefront. Played a 2nd game immediately after the first. 

This game is a great introduction to two-player-only gaming, or "spouse gaming." In fact, this game might be the game that kicked off weeknight gaming as a mutual hobby with my wife and a way to wind down after a work day. It's also the game in my collection that shows the most wear and abuse, with 70+ plays taking a toll on the cards. Not a bad purchase, eh?

We've since moved on to other and slightly more heavy games, graduating to Jaipur, Roma, Dominion, two-player Puerto Rico, and so on and so on. But this is the game that really started it, and it's deceptive combination of simple rules and tough choices stood up for quite some time.

RATING: 8
A great 2 player card game that we finally got to the table. It plays super quick and the artwork is awesome. In  our first few games it was apparent that you can play to any number of columns and have a chance to win, which is great as you can play different strategies each game based on your starting hand. Also, by being forced to play the investments first it is a bit of press your luck as you will need to hope to get some high number cards in that color later on to ensure you get a positive score for that color. My only complaint is the scoring is a little hard to wrap your head around (it was late and we have 2 kids, what can I say), but I imagine it goes quicker with more plays. I can easily see this one coming out frequently.

So, the *same* day I make a comment in a Geeklist that I haven't played Lost Cities ("I feel like less of a woman"), I end up...playing Lost Cities for the first time.  The irony was too much to pass up when it was suggested as a game.

WHY is this game suggested so often as a "game for non-gamers to try"?  It's all right as a 2-player game, pretty dependent on card-drawing luck and a little on bluffing and timing, and easy to explain.  It's not unusual or stellar though--but maybe that's why it's used as an intro game?

A very fun game, perfect for couples.  Both of us really enjoy this, even when one person is way behind in score.  Although you have to watch what you feed to the other player, the conflict lies mainly in deciding how long you should, and can stand to, hold out for the cards you need.

Really great card game for 2 players. Your strategy builds as more cards are laid on the table, be it in your own piles or your opponents. A lot of "press your luck" in that if you wait too long for your ideal card, you'll end up with nothing (or less than nothing!). The theme is icing on the cake.

I've played four times and enjoyed it each time.  Scoring can be a bit of a bear and will stretch one's arithmetic skill (but that's not a bad thing, now is it?), and it can feel at times to be a lot of work to put a pile of cards down and get < 10 points.  Hard to see yet how deep the strategy is.

(06-22-07) - As a testament to the playability of this game.  I got my dad to play...with my sister no less... you don't know but that's amazing.

(04-01-07) - I played this a few times since owning and I've enjoyed the game.  It is light and fills time pretty well.  There is just enough there to keep your attention but not so much you can't watch a little TV too. :)

Excellent 2-player game. So simple, but the genius of the design of the game is astounding. SO TENSE, especially when you finally get the card you need, but--HOW MANY CARDS ARE LEFT IN THE DECK AND DO I HAVE TIME TO PLAY IT???

RATING: 8
Not a heavy game, but one that's interesting, fun, and easy to introduce to non-gamers. Plays relatively quickly (less than a half an hour), so it's good to fill in those time between introducing them to more complex games. Beautiful design of the cards and board make it a great item.

Lost Cities plays quickly with some tough choices to make along the way. Everyone in my family that I have introduced it to has loved it and requests it often. Sure there are other games I would rather play, but very few games are playable in such a short time that are this fun.

I lowered my rating. Battle Line has just about fired Lost Cities. The two games are still different enough to keep both.

Quick and fun. A little too much luck, but playing multiple games evens things out.

We have, however, gotten to the point where when a game is over, we glance at the two sides and it's usually clear who has won, so we don't even add up points. That takes away from the game.

Often compared unfavorably to Battle Line by serious gamers.  I think that that is because Lost Cities has such a low barrier to entry, and can be played so casually.  However, the fact that it can be played casually does not mean that it *can't* be played seriously.  Of the two, I vastly prefer Lost Cities over Battle Line when played casually, and I slightly prefer Lost Cities over Battle Line when played seriously.

Great two player game.  One of my wife's favorite games.  It is a really good game for us to play together when we want to relax.

Ye gods...is it just me, or is this game terrible? It's definitely just a solitare style game with the thinnest of adventurer texture maps, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game.

This was an early purchase in my board game collection, and for some reason I completely misinterpreted what it was about. I think it was before I started reading reviews before picking things up. Anyway, even after getting over my initial issue with how the theme is completely tacked on, this is still just a basic push your luck game with a lot of math.

A great game when you only have a few minutes or are stuck at the airport during the annual air traffic control strike.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

I really like the simplicity of this game.  A quick 15 minutes (if that) and you've played a round, tally your score then repeat, and repeat, and....stop eventually I guess.  I know some people don't really care for the simplicity here, but it works for me since this is just a quick relaxing game for "break time."  

Anyone reading this, please recommend more quick, 2 player games like this.  My library is getting too many large games that I just don't have time to play enough in order to get my fix.

RATING: 9
Very simple game, but the great thing about it is the tension it generates.  You don't want to help your opponents, but there's times you might have to discard a card you think they'll use. You don't always want to start or continue a play (expedition) right away, but you may be running out of turns or your hand is too full and you have to do something.  You have to balance taking too many expeditions with taking too few and you're also trying to figure out what your opponent is doing.  Then there's always doubling or tripling or quadrupling down on your expeditions making them even more important to at least break even.  Again it's a simple game, but the quick play and tension makes it addicting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think I like this game more than Keltis/Lost Cities. The lack of duplicate cards as well as as the fact that it's two-player make this far more cut-throat than its cousins. Handshakes can be a bit tricky to pull off, but determinijng the perfect moment to start an expedition (ideally your second or third) along with some extra investment is a game in itself.

RATING: 7
One of our favorite two player games at the moment. Definitely a lot of luck influence which can lead to frustration. It's amazing how much the point totals swing (all the way from negative points to near-triple digits). So you can play two really bad rounds and still come back to win it. That makes it fun but also pretty annoying. 

I play roughly the same each round, but there's room for some modification based on 1) what cards emerge, and 2) the opponent's choices. If my opponent is going high-risk, piling up wager cards, I tend to respond with defense and conservative play, drawing out the deck quickly. Sometimes the key to winning is to not play every awesome card you hold or even to give up big points in order to accomplish your plans. I like these choices and the inevitable times that my best hopes and plans are thwarted by unlucky draws end up being less devastating because the game is short. If the game was even a little longer or more invested, those kinds of things would drive me crazy!

Egyszerű játék. Reiner Knizia készítette ami magában hordozza a matek jellegét a játéknak.
"Igazából a játékrendszer nem követelte volna meg ezt a témát, de gondolom, így jobban el tudják adni, mint ha csak egy száraz, matematikai alapokon nyugvó számolásos kártyajáték volna." /Hosaka/
Számomra ez az egyetlen negatívuma, túlságosan látszik a matematikai kötődés és ez mindig zavar - amikor éppen nem játszom vele. Ha épp kalandozunk az 5 világban, akkor rá se hederítek. :)
Felvezető-bevezető játéknak kiváló.

Kedveljük ezt az egyszerű, szép és gyors játékot. Szerintem 60 kártyáért és 1 játéktáblárt szörnyű 4000 forintot elkérni (van ahol jóval többe kerül). Hosaka 2004-ben elkészített egy házi változatot (aminek a design-ja nekem jobban is tetszik mint az eredetié), érdemes rákeresni neten és otthon legyártani a táblát meg a 60 kártyát! :)

Excellent card game.  Set collection with a twist: investments that multiple your final score for a set and a set minimum rule that scores your sets below minimum at a negative.

Although the production decisions were somewhat odd (what's with the over-sized cards?), Lost Cities is a fun two-player card game of taking risks to get greater rewards. It's a quick game, so it makes a great filler. It's definitely one of the better games in the Kosmos two-player series.

Great game with beautiful artwork - I enjoy both LC and LCtBG.  I like the card game because of the quick set up vs. the more fiddly set up of the board game.  The card game feels much more frenetic and tense to me because of the faster pace and this is something my husband enjoys.  It seems like just as you've gotten your expeditions on track, the draw pile is already 2/3 gone and you'd better get those high cards out or you'll be stuck with them in your hand!  Also much more difficult to discard because most of the time it seems your opponent will need the cards you want to toss.  I really enjoy the slower pace of LCtBG as a family game -- LC the card game is great to play with my husband.

Lost Cities has a subject so thin you coud shave with it. The cards, while beautifully illustrated, are not pleasant to shuffle and handle due to their size. The board is not needed for play. The scoring system is artificial. Okay, that sums up a lot of modern-style boardgames, so I can't really hold it against the game. What I [i]do[/i] hold against this title is the absence of interesting strategies: luck and a bit of elemental tactics are all you need. And that's precisely the rub. If both players use the best available tactics, it becomes the luck of the draw. If one of them doesn't, the other is bored stiff from lack of interesting play. I had a nice time figuring out the game, but after a while it grew repetitive because the decisions all amounted to the same thing. I tried playing it online, and turned away in disgust after seeing how bad people were. I haven't played it since, and prefer games with a bit more meat on their bones.

[b]Update[/b] Replayed after what seems an eternity. Yep, still boring luck of the draw and fixed strategies and tactics. Glad to be done with it.

This is a terrific two-player game!!  The cards are beautiful (both their artwork and their large size).  It is true that the board isn't necessary, but so what? The rules are relatively easy to learn and the scoring is straightforward.  There is more strategy than one might initially expect.  I think it's disgusting that so many people have relegated this game to "spouse-only" status when it's worthy of so much higher regard.

No one told me there'd be math!

I marked this as "owned" but I only actually have the Xbox 360 version. It's a very fun little game, but I think if I had to do the scoring myself, it would totally kill the flow of the game (which is lightning fast in the digital realm).  I'm not sure if I should be embarrassed to admit this, but I don't think I could do the math in my head!

PLayed this once awhile back.  Not bad...it's a good, quick, scoring game.  However, while I normally don't have a problem with thin themes, this one is a bit hard to get over.  You can basically play the exact same game with a normal deck of playing cards by simply removing the jokers completely and seperating out the Ace cards and using those as the "game board."  I don't think it's overpriced (especially given the lovely art), but it is a thin theme, dangerously so in my opinion.

RATING: 7
For a game with such simple rules and mechanics, this one is great fun! My only criticism is a minor one. The game can feel a bit like two people simultaneously playing solitaire. Not a huge amount of interaction, but with the right opponent this can be tempered some. Known as a good game for playing with one's non-gaming partner, I was hoping this one would be a big hit in that department. It kind of disappointed on that front. Apparently, my partner Barb's idea of fun doesn't include even the simplest of forays into math, so Lost Cities' calculation of points leaves her a little cold. I am thankfully only too happy to step in there, so we strike something of a balance. After many plays, the game has now lost some of it's freshness. It's no longer getting played.  Had to downgrade it's rating a tad.

My wife said she likes this one. She does not say that about games. I lowered my rating on this one. I like it, but now that I have discovered Schotten Totten, I'd rather play that. I still think this a a great game and my wife will almost always play with me.

What can I say. Reiner Knizia is a great designer and this game is no exception. The game while easy to learn can absolutely make you think. I wouldn't go so far as to call it an absolute brain burner though. With this game you can easily play 4 or 5 rounds in an hour and feel satisfied after doing so. Plus, unless you're keeping exact score throughout the game it is always fun to do the end game scoring and figure out just who won!

Really great game, beautiful cards. Perfect game for my husband and I. Very simple play. Plays quick, but lots of strategy. Very very good two-player card game. I wish the cards were a different size. These are difficult for me to shuffle (small girly hands). And, I think the board is completely unnecessary. The scoring at the end kind of gives me a headache (so much math!), but it's ingenious.

This game is really simple and makes a great 2 player game.  It's a good "travel" and "time killer" type of game.

You can screw you fellow player out of getting any points which makes me feel dirty and steals the joy of winning.  However... it works every time!

As far as two player games go, this is one of the best! Quick set collection card game.  The concept of going on "expeditions" to each colored "region" makes it so you don't just throw down every card you have.  If you don't collect enough of one of the colors it'll cost ya!  Quick and fun - great with the wife.

This is another great couples game.  I am plagued by the same problem every single time I play, yet simply cannot force myself to make the necessary correction to my play.  I always start a new color, rather than tossing a card into the middle where my opponent could pick it up.  I should probably learn from this and apply it to other parts of my life, but then that could potentially lead to personal growth.  Hmmm...

RATING: 6.4
This is a good game to pass the time for 2 people, but I generally find it to be a bit too predictable.

The old mechanic of Rack-O is back with more attractive components.  The investment cards are what keep it a bit more interesting. The challenge is if a player gets a bad hand to start (i.e. all high cards), it can be difficult to choose a path to go with, and then he gets way behind.

"Lost Potential" would be a better name for this game.

UPDATE: After playing this quite a bit more online, I recognize that it's a decent game - the problem now is I've played Keltis, which I think is vastly superior.  LC is not bad (I'm upgrading my rating) but just not as enjoyable.  But it's small size and quick playtime are definite pluses.

Surprise! I actually like it! When I finally pushed my Knizia suspicion aside, I discoverd that LC is actually a nice little card game that I can imagine to play again and again ...

On our first try, we played it seven or eight times, and my wife still wanted more. Now, we have maybe 40+ games under the belt, and it's still growing on us. 

Negative point: somehow, my wife beats me *all the time!*

EDIT: When someone asks me about a light 2-player game, I recommend LC all the time. It is truly great.

Components: Beautiful oversized cards and game board for discarding.

Experience: It is short enough to be played multiple times in one sitting, the luck of the draw keeps it interesting for me, and I really enjoy the differing emotions it inspires: when I am either reluctant to give up a single card, because I'd rather wait it out and observe my opponent, or when I am eager to play out the good cards from my hand, but am unable to play them all before the draw is exhausted. I find the decisions simple, yet interesting, and the interaction benign, making Lost Cities a pleasant way to spend time with someone.

My best friend and I have ground this game down to its barest profit margin, with each of us willing to take a loss on a color rather than risk giving a potentially useful card to the opponent. Makes for very low scores.

I play with one round per game, rather than with three per game as the rules suggest.

This is a card game and a math game. It's a pretty good game for what it is. It plays quickly once you understand the game.

Played this one for years -- superb family choice, whether playing with spouse or with kids. For younger children I play a simple handicap technique, where I'll only look at X cards in my 8-card hand, thus narrowing my choices and discard options. I then "level" my kids up, starting low (X=2, for instance) and then take it higher and higher as they beat me, till eventually the handicap washes away... and your kids are killing you....

This was a finalist for my choice of a "coloured cards with numbers" game (along with Schotten Totten).  But no, it was not to be.

I think, like Schotten Totten, that there are not enough decisions to make here.  Sure, you make some decisions on when to start an expedition, but once the cards are down you're just locked in and waiting to see whether or not you get the cards you need.  Then its just luck of the draw: will you get the cards you need, or will your opponent?  Will you get them at the right time?

I will say that I like that the game forces you to do something every turn; you can't just camp out until you get a perfect hand (like in Ticket to Ride or something).  And I also think the game is actually quite thematic.

For now, Arboretum will be my "coloured cards with numbers" game.  It has so many more tough decisions at all stages of the game.

The wife and I play often, one of the few she will play anytime.  The token "couples" game does work for us, but we actually would probably like to play something a little heavier most of the time.  It can be played quickly though, and is intuitive, so it gets out often.

This game didn't do anything for me and my wife, the art wasn't that inspiring (to me) either.  We didn't care for the mechanism of having to play a card, then select another card to your hand, which made the game more random and not as much about strategy in playing the right card that turn.

Not sure what the theme has to do with the game, but the cards are pretty and the gameplay is fun.  For some reason, I find it hard to explain the game to new players but after a round everyone gets it.  Then it can get a little cut-throat.  I would have given it a 7, but my better half likes it so that's worth an extra point.

Having played numerous games, most of which online, I think it's fair to say that this is one of my favourite two player games. 

The rules are very simple and the luck factor is definitely there (as you draw cards and have to play one each turn), but it is certainly a game where some skill is involved. 

You try to focus on a few colours, as you pay 20 points for every colour you start. However, you don't want to show early on which colours you'll be playing, trying to entice your opponent to throw out the card you need.

I'm a fan of Knizia's work and this game is certainly one of my favourites, although Euphrate & Tigris and -to a lesser extent- Genius are also very enjoyable.

RATING: 8.97546
I think the game is 60% luck, 40% skill though Ian disagrees.

The game is all about managing your luck - considering the probability chances that you'll finish a route in the black, how likely it is that the opponent holds a certain card or will take the cards you need and the chance of you even having enough turns to play your cards.

There are also many seemingly viable strategies - do you try for 3 expeditions? Or try and make one monster expedition? Do you throw away the cards you no longer need or bluff and hope your opponent now feels free to throw away those cards you want.

When do you start your expeditions?

Despite the simple toys (with only 2 relevant properties each and an easily understood distribution) and simple rules (essentially being 'put down a card, pick up a card) i can see loads of scope for discovery.

2009-07-15 (9 plays)

I think it's probably actually more skill than I first thought (70-30?), given that I usually beat Joel ( in our adaptation) and Gregor beat me both times soundly.

I feel like I'm missing something and that gets me excited to play it again. At the same time, I just felt hopeless against Gregor. Maybe the lack of a handicap system is a possible drawback.

If he were willing though, I would have gladly carried on playing, trying to win what now appears to be a game of judging probabilities, arithmetic and psychology.

A lot deeper than I first thought and I think it could be played at different 'levels'.

I enjoy the game, but my math hatin' partner struggled with it in the beginning.  So much for the famous "get your girlfriend to play" game...  But she stuck with it, and has grasped the strategy of the game.  

The theme is non-existent, but the gameplay is solid.

I really wish the cards were standard size, because it would make the game much more portable.

It's a quick, fun game.
I also played this with a regular deck of cards, using each suit as the colors, and the court cards as the multipliers. It seemed to work pretty well. Because of the missing color, we also dropped the number of cards dealt to seven instead of eight.
Note: The scoring of this game can be confusing for beginners.

I just played a game and the opium-like effect of the game is still hanging like a London fog in the cobwebs of my unused mind. This is a game that will appeal to the non-thinking crowd. Perhaps if I play this game anymore I shall run the risk of falling face down if a puddle of my own drool. Not my type of game. Very nice cards though.

Fun little 2-player card game of risk vs. reward.  Your goals must not be spread out over too many excavations, as there is only a limited amount of cards shared by both players.  Quick game, but drawback is it's only 2-player (well, unless you buy another copy of the game).  One mechanic I like is that you must either play OR discard a card on your turn. Your opponent can then choose to take the card you discarded.  

I also like how the game is light, small and easy to set up and plays quickly.

This game is brilliant in it's blending of simple gameplay and difficult decision making.  Each turn is simply play/discard a card, and draw a card.  That's it.  BUT the difficulty comes in when you decide to actually play a card to start an expedition, because you can only play cards on that same pile of higher numerical value each later turn, and you lose points if you can't score a high enough combination in a particular color.  Then there is the added complication of seeing what your opponent is collecting or playing, and trying to make sure you don't give them easy points, while trying to make room in your hand for cards that you want as well.  I love this game, and if you want to find a good 2 player game, this is a hard one to beat for it's ease of play, and short playing time.

Lost Cities is a very fun, quick game that works well over coffee or morning breakfast. The rules are easy to teach and as long as you can multiply numbers, you can figure out this game. There is a bit of math involved with tracking points scored throughout the game. As with any game with cards, a bit of luck is involved, but strategic planning \ mathematical probability is certainly a part of this game. As with many of Reiner's games, Lost Cities has that extra layer of interest which keeps it hitting the table often. A typical game can be played in less than an hour.

I fail to see the appeal of this game.  There is tension, yes, but that seems to be all that there is.  I highly recommend trying before buying or, to see how sparse this game really is, make your own version from any five-suited deck and decide if you like playing it that way.  Trust me:  there isn't anything special about the components.

Like most other Knizia creations, this one falls flat for me.

[28 Mar 2017] - 6 (4 plays)
Game play consists of drawing cards from a common draw pile and then trying to create stacks of cards of increasing value to earn points. The value of a stack is 30 - (sum of the cards), so just by starting a stack you're in the hole. The strategy is pretty simple - don't start a stack unless you know you're holding a bunch of cards and try not to let your opponent know what color you're trying to stack so they discard you something that will help you. A quick filler but didn't seem to offer enough challenges for my normal liking. After 4 plays, I felt like I had experienced the game and further plays aren't necessary.

It's fast and easy to teach and learn. There's enough depth to the game to keep you interested, but not so much that a new player is doomed against an experienced player.

We got a lot of good plays out of this but it's now been demoted by Battle Line.

[April 2016 - 8.2]
Fun and fast intro game that anyone can learn and similar to Battleline. It's short time frame (5-10 minutes) really creates the sense of a race and running out of time in the end. The other raw emotions come from wanting a card, waiting for a card and then giving up, only to get it the next draw. Luck plays a bigger role than in Battleline, but there's still strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very simple, addictive game. It plays fast and you will almost always end up playing it over and over. Most of the strategy is not making the best play but in not making the worst play that will help you opponent. It is agonizing what to play at the beginning and this holds true to the very end. Set up is nil and it plays so fast that it is perfect for when you just want to knock a few games out at lunch or when waiting for something (like the other gamers to show up).

Fun and easy to learn.  I play this with several folks regularly. I picked this one up along with a bunch of other Reiner Knizia games and everyone who has played it has become addicted. It is simple to play, quick to learn and you always feel that you are sure you could do just..a...bit...better the next game. Try it!

RATING: 7
Fun, quick, relatively simple two player card game. Luck can play a huge role and combined with the scoring system, sometimes getting or missing out on a single card can dramatically swing your final score. There is some pretty fun tension when discarding since it may significantly help your opponent.

One of my most played 2-player games. In the first few rounds of every game, I think I'm going to get crushed by my opponent. But then it becomes a great back-and-forth card game. Really slick game, we never play just a single game in one sitting.

[2008-09-24 Rating: n.a. -> 8]
Rating of 8 is based on a couple of online-games versus a not so strong AI at http://www.yourturnmyturn.com/. This seems to be a nice game which reminds me of Schotten Totten. The decisions are somehow similar. Sometimes you don't wanna play a card but you have to. There's a fair amount of luck involved but since the game plays fast (just like Schotten Totten) it doesn't bother me.

+ This game is just fun and plays fast
+ Some tough decisions
+ I guess my non-gamer friends will like it
+ There are definitely some "strategies"

o Price is okay for a card game (~10€)
o Just two players

- Fair amount of luck. So you can't really plan too far ahead.

[2008-09-30]
Bought the game at amazon.de for 10.98€. Managed to play it face to face three times on the day it arrived. Until now, my rating remains unchanged at 8.

The theme of this game kinda matchs the overall goal of the game. In the end though it is really just a numbers game. It isn't a bad thing however thats just how I feel about it. I have a lot of fun playing even though I feel like I get put in spots where I might only have two somewhat equal options and when I pick one and three turns later the other was the better choice and its to late to fix the mistake, obviously. The more I play I feel like I can overcome this randomness in draws, but I realize even now it will probably impact my point totals at the end since I didn't risk it. 

I recently got Jambo and would almost always play that game over this one. Pretty much this is one I will get tired of playing back to back while Jambo I generally won't get tired of it.

This is probably my favorite 2 player game.  It is so simple and has such great depth.  My biggest complaint has to do with the lack of a theme but I also like the game better when you are forced to discard more.  For instance, get rid of the loose rule about an extra 20 points for 8 cards or more and instead, have the cost for starting each new expidition be -30 points!  Try it sometime...

RATING: 6.95
Each expedition is a road to the unknown and the mechanics used in this game is perfect to depict that. What you feel playing this game right away is the risk taking factor on each decision you make. It can either be one full of elation when you do make the right choices and the deck remains in your favor or full of regret when the deck turns against you. Either ways it makes you come back for more. This very simple game is easy in a lot of ways - easy to learn, easy to carry, and easy to win and easy to lose. There's also a strategic element in it that you may do to turn the tide of the game by combining your decision making skills with the cards that you're dealt with. You can even influence the other player so that he may give you favorable cards. I'd rate this game higher if they could somehow add more players into this game without ruining the mechanics.

Well this is a classic! My rating is not based on the complexity of the game, which is quite low, but to the fun and replayability the game has! You finish a game and you instantly want more! The urge to keep a high red card for example and probably discard another until you re lucky enough to draw a lower red is always entertaining. Luck has definitely a role to play in this game, however, after hundrends of plays i can say that generally when luck is balanced, which is usually the case, the one with better tactical skills wins. A game that all women and non-gamers will enjoy as well!

The theme is oh so thin.  Basically, just a deck of cards and you try to string a bunch of number together. Some subtle strategy.  You'll get your money's worth on this one.  Everyone talks about their wives/girlfriends liking this game.  My wife is no exception.

RATING: 9
Players are dealt 8 cards each from a deck of exploration cards. The cards consist of five suits, each representing a different destination. The cards are numbered from 2 to 10 in each suit, plus three "agreement" cards. A turn consists of play/discard a card, draw a card, but cards played must be in ascending order. Scoring is the sum of the cards in each suit minus 20, multiplied by the agreement cards. Incredibly simple, but very tense. The "one more game" factor is huge. As Mike Siggins once wrote, this is a "hobby affirming game".

[Knizia] The best game filler ever. Wonderfully addictive. As others have already said, this is also a great "wife game". Or bring it to the coffee shop. Or when you and another just got eliminated from Risk. In other words, keep it handy! ** also: the box top of this game has become te default "dice-rolling box" for my house. We lay the folded-up game board in the lid to dull the noise factor. Perfect size for this role.

played a couple of games, and I liked it.  The people I played with said it's basically luck based, which I admit (due to the card drawing) but it also holds some strategy to it as well, as to when to start a trip, and when to avoid it.
Played a couple of more times, with partners. Lost 5 of 6 games, cause me and the partner weren't communicating well... partner play does bring a lot out of this game.

Idea & Mechanism:
Explore old ruins, play cards from 5 different colors valued 1-10 and 3 times multiplier. Your final score from each color is cards played-20*multipliers. You can only play bigger card to the pile. Discard cards to common pile where opponent can grab em and play to his piles.

Finally picked this one up, and yes, my wife does love it.  Not for the reasons I usually see given though (non-confrontational, multiplayer solitaire).  I find this game to be downright cutthroat.  Our game is focused on denying each other needed cards (only to discard the 8 the turn after they play the 9) and on bluffing them into giving up the investemnt card you want.  She loves it, and she repeatedly thumps me at it.  While I like it, overall I find Battle Line to be similar but slightly better.

One of the best 2-player board game I've played.  Each player starts an expedition to 5 potential archaelogical sites.

Két játékosnak megfelelő mélységű taktikai csata, ahol a szerencse szerepe nem elhanyagolható. Aki ezzel együtt tud élni, annak kiváló taktikai kártyajáték. A téma viszont annyira nem jön át. Egyenlőre ez az első kétszemélyes játék, amit kipróbáltunk. Első játéknak kiváló. (2013.12.25.)

A feleségemmel ismét játszottunk egyet. A szerencse szerepe nem változott, mégis simán győzök a feleségem ellen, pedig nem rossz játékos. Tehát a jó taktikázásnak, melyik színre megyek rá, melyiket engedem el (egyáltalán nem rakok le hozzá lapot a negatív pontok elkerülése végett), melyiket blokkolom (nem rakok ki egy lapot direkt, amire az ellenfelem is vár) igenis nagy szerepe van. Nagy előnye a játéknak a rendkívül egyszerű szabály, a gyors játékmenet és a rövid előkészítési idő. Aki csak egy könnyed játékra vágyik a párjával, vagy még csak most csöppent bele a társasjátékok világába, annak egy jó játék lehet. (2015.01.23)

A buddy and I after we both graduated from college and moved up to Chicago played this game A LOT. To the point that I was burnt out on it and contemplating getting rid of it. But I never did because that was a fond time. And after dozens and dozens of games it really clicked what the game was about, I felt like I was investing in an expedition hoping for that big payout at the end, but not knowing if it was there. It wasn't a game played with a five suited deck, it was much more. Then I taught it to my wife and I realized that this is a game that needs to be widely available and everyone should be playing. It is just good.

Another strong pick for a short game with the wife. While I prefer Knizia's other game of a similar nature (BattleLine) for it's deeper tactics, Lost Cities brings it back to a lightness that makes the game easier to get out for a quick game.

Even with it's very math-y scoring system (which I'm a huge fan of, especially the =20 risk for starting any expedition), it's still easy to appeal to players with the art alone. The game's theme may be minimal in play, but it looks like a gradual investigation into ancient ruins.

After playing this game a few times, I realized that it's nothing more than a repackaged card game with an adventure theme. An almost identical game can be played with a deck of cards using the Aces as the cities, with each suit representing the different cities. The face cards of each suit represent the multi-scores and all your left with are 2-10 cards. It's still an OK game, but seems like a waste of money when you can play the same game with a deck of cards.

"In Lost Cities, another card game in the Kosmos two-player series, the object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities."

Funny, it seemed more like tedious math exercise to me. The "gameplay" has no relevance to the theme, and there is no player interaction. I only give this three points in respect for the people who like this sort of thing. I am, admittedly, not a math guy. I would rather play with a calculator. Alone. In the dark.

My wife and I both enjoy this 2-player game, it has enough tactical decisions to keep us both interested, and the scoring mechanism can be brutal if you're not careful. I've also taught this to a co-worker, who quite enjoyed it.

RATING: 7.5
A terrific, fast 2-player game... one of the very best out there for what it does. Fun and addictive, the only downside to this one is that entire games can pass by in silence. It's not a very interactive game. Great look and theme. Calculating the score at the end can be a bit of a pain, and works best with a pad, pencil and calculator. 

**Addendum- I've lowered my score half a point because I find that now, a year after purchasing it, I am less inclined to want to play this one. Maybe it's because it's not very interactive, or maybe it's because I just burned out on it. Still a good game when you only have a 15 minute window, though.

Good, quick, deep, tense 2 player card game.  

Variable strategies. 

Dropping cards in the middle in restraining to show your hand in the early game is just as tense as changing suits in the middle and racing to finish in the end game.  

You can take risk by faking you are not going for a suite to lure cards out of your opponent or use a middle card to lure your opponent to get a card while holding hime back.

You have to watch the other player is doing on the other side.  Have not try the brutal variant of placing on the other side yet - doesn't seem like a good idea.

Lives up to its "Great Spouse/Girlfriend Game" status.  I would rather play games with a bit more strategy to them, but I can't deny the fun and ease of this game.

Outsanding game mechanics, but not at all what I expected.  Kosmos should be sued for false advertising with this one.  This game has absolutely nothing to do with lost cities or archaeology or anything of the sort.  It's basically a playing card game with only 2s through 10s of different colors.  The reason I rank it as highly as I do, is it is outstandingly good at the simple yet complex playing card game that it is.

I like the fact that it's a quick light filler card game.  "Let's include a board you don't need, and make the cards bigger to justify a higher price tag!!" is probably what was decided after the publisher put together this game.  Anywho, I like the decisions you have to make, such as, whether to hold cards that are beneficial to opponents or making room in your hand to help out your own situation.  I also like that players have partial control over how quickly the game ends.  Overall, I can see why it's so highly rated as a couples game but there are other two player card games that I just prefer.

I LOVE THIS GAME!  It's hard to find good games I can convince my wife to play, and yet be complex enough in strategy that I can still enjoy it... this is that game.  Simple rules that allow for a staggering amount of incredibly difficult choices in tactics.  Loads of fun.

BTW, I've played a 4-suit version of this with a standard set of poker cards.  Lay down the aces as the "board" of color markers, use suits as the colors, all face cards count as handshakes.  Works well, even with only color "suits" to play with.

Played 1 full game and liked it.  Were not WOWED, but did see merit to the game.  I can see why it is popular, but don't see why it is also widely hated.  Carc is definitely longer and more boring.  Will rate after more plays.

See my Session Report.

Acquired in trade!! Excellent condition.

Played in April 2010 with a newb and only 1 hand.  I had forgotten that you also have to try and control the game end in order to maximize your points.  Interesting gateway game.

Love the "play or discard" mechanic, and the tension and agony it subjects on to the players.

Solid game. Cool artwork and cards. A good mix of hard decisions and fast gameplay. Up to 8 after bringing it back out yet again. After a break, I've come to realize this is a near perfect balance of speed and choices. Up to 9 after my consistent return to it. It's the game I compare all other two player games to. Are there better two player games? Sure, but LC provides that perfect choices/speed/ease of play mix. 

To put as elegantly as my friend has in the past "Playing Lost Cities is just a relaxing experience." That's it. It's not overly complicated, it's not hard to play. I've never walked away utterly amazed by the game, but I've always enjoyed the experience.

For some people, there will be too much luck in this game. But still there is a lot of strategy in this game as well.

I've introduced the game to other people and they all liked it!

Simple, elegant game with some tough decisions to make.  Not a great deal of depth, however.  Theme is superficial, but the art on the cards is gorgeous.  I've recently down-graded my rating because we are tired of the game.  The plays recorded don't tell the whole story because each 'play' of the game is actually three games long, so really I've played this about 24 times or so.  It is fun, but wears thin after a while, so much so that I eventually traded it away.

Es rápido y además las cartas son de tanta calidad como belleza.
Debemos intentar empezar las menos expediciones posibles y cada una de ellas alargarlas lo más posible.Si no tenemos más de 3 cartas de una expedició o 2 muy altas no deberíamos empezarla, porque nos restará puntos al final de la partida.Debemos quedarnos en la mano las cartas que puedan beneficiar a nuestro rival.

My play count for Lost Cities is way off. I must forget to record this game. It is a staple for my wife and I.

What makes Lost Cities shine? Decisions! Every turn you are challenged to play the right card. You feel you have plenty of time in the beginning, but you can't predict which cards will end up in your hand. Investing in one path may prove costly, while skipping investment in another may be a missed opportunity. Investing in all five is, of course, madness.

I would set the level of agony in each decision to a level just below Twilight Struggle or a balanced war game. The levels of depth and involvement are wildly different but the pain is the same.

Classic and popular light fare two player game, nice cards, but over-priced (can play it with a regular five-suit deck).  Does have a solitaire feel, and depends on luck of the draw but still involves constant decision making.  This along with its quick game play makes it appealing and addictive, although calculating the score at the end of a hand is a minus.  Try it free online @ www.flexgames.com

When I bought this game I was pissed off because I felt that I'd been tricked into buying the board game equivalent of math flash cards. But it's proven to be a pretty solid, fun game.  Rarely my first choice, but I won't turn it down.

Not a fan. Yes, there's smart play required but once you get to that point (don't put out cards your opponent can use; use handshakes judiciously, etc.) it comes down to  pushing your luck on which cards will come out. You can educate your guesses, but in the end they're still guesses.

A nice, inoffensive, addictive game you can play multiple times when your brain is fatigued from world building.  Requires strategy, but sometimes rewards risk taking and reliance on luck.

RATING: 6
Not one of my favorites, but my partner loves it, and she's willing to go through the rigmarole of scoring. It usually seems much better to gamble on wasting a few points by starting an expedition with mid-point value card (provided you have a higher card in your hand) than to waste plays by discarding needlessly into the neutral area. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very elegant and tense card "building" game.  At it's best, it requires anticipation, flexibility and risk taking.  At it's worst, it can seem a frustrating luck-fest when the cards just don't come as hoped, though this randomness is generally mitigated when several "rounds" are played out.

Overall, an outstanding game for which I don't understand all of the criticism here, and one that has become our 2-player travel game of choice.

My wife and I enjoy playing this quite often. It's easy to learn, fast to play, travels easily (if you're going on a trip you don't need the board - don't pack it) and we find it has an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it. The theme, while mostly window dressing, is good too with interesting art on the cards and the board. Scoring is a bit of a pain for a game that plays so fast.

Perfect game for spouses or lovers, including pairs where only one really loves board games, and the other enjoys an easier game from time to time.  Can be played anywhere at any time.  It's short.  It's super portable because you don't really need the board or the box to play, just the deck itself.  Easy to learn, but really interesting to play even for seasoned gamers.

Sort of like a more interesting version of Rack-O, this game forces you to hold your own high cards as well as your opponent's low cards, so that only your "expeditions" are successful.  The rules are very simple, the theme is adequately integrated.  This is one of those "play 3x and accumulate scores" games.  A little bit dry, but very solid: typical Knizia!

One of the two games that I will promptly take from the shelf if non-gamer friends visiting me discover my collection and ask to play something. In case of a single friend visiting, I will put Lost Cities on the table. You learn it in one minute, play it in fifteen and will ask for more, for the rest of your life. "Gateway" is the word here. At heart, it is a risk management game, and a great one at that.

2000: Decent filler, good game to play with the gf.

July 2014: A numbered card game with light tactical play and nice art. Typical Knizia, there is very little theme here, but it's a tough little game that has a fair bit of tension in its short playtime. 

Belongs to the "addictive light abstract" category with Splendor and  Cribbage.

RATING: 7
It's a fun game that keeps you on your toes.  It's definitely good filler, particularly when played fast.  I don't really get all of the complaints about the scoring system.  It's simple addition and very light multiplication.  There are extremely clear examples in the rulebook for reference.

Admittedly, the theme is meaningless and pasted on.  The game could easily be reproduced with two decks of cards and a marker, although that's not a negative in and of itself.  It's just a super tight two player card game, like a good Rummy variant.  There are further similarities to Rummy but it's certainly its own game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Just for 2.  A beautiful game that is easy on the eyes.Always the game that goes on trips. 

I have played over 7,000 games (a game consists of 3 hands)since 5/04.  I do not have that many plays recorded here on BGG because we started playing prior to my recording plays here, but we had kept records on paper.  

Once two players are equal in strategy, it becomes more a luck-of-the-draw game, but still addicting.  This is one of the few games my non-gamer family suggests--and since I am game hungry, I never turn it down, even though I am SICK-TO-DEATH of it, but interestingly enough, not really. 

3/25/08 We just opened our 5th box, 10/1/08 opened 6th box, 6/9/09 opened 7th box, 9/5/2010 opened 8th box, 11/1/11 opened our 9th box--The cards hold up well, but the ink eventually wears off the front & back. On only 1 deck did we ever bend the cards. Looks as though we get about 700 games to a box (3 hands per game).  9/1/2017 Opened 14th box.

Highest score after 3 hands, 337 on 1/18/09; Highest score on a single color in one hand, 136 on 12/06; Most games won in a row, 11 on 5/07; The difference of most points in the lead after 3 hands, 227 on 11/05.  I lost the records for the single highest hand.  We lost interest in keeping up on these scores, especially since our playing has evolved so that we rarely get the really high scores any more.

Dispite all these games played, I have only played once with four people (combine part of a 2nd deck per rules).

Ranks alongside Blokus, Bohnanza, Rumis and Ticket To Ride as one of those games I would be confident showing to absolutely anyone.  This game is all about knowing when to play your cards.  And being able to choose how many rounds you play means it can last as long or end as quickly as you want.

Still, I will almost always choose to play Dominion, San Juan, Citadels, or even Bohnanza over this when looking for a quick, two-player card game.

This is a great two player game and one of my favorites.  It's a game for me that plays with a quick rhythm and has a 'one more hand' momentum.

One of Knizia's classics. The rules are so simple anyone can play it, yet there is a good bit of depth to the game. Every draw of the deck is exciting and every move your opponent makes is interesting.

A light and fast filler by the good Doctor Knizia. The pasted-on theme notwithstanding, Lost Cities is an enjoyable set-collecting diversion that is one of the best two-player games around. Recommended for any gamer's library. *** UPDATE: This game is starting to hurt due to the better 2P games available now. Its decisions just aren't much fun anymore. Can do a lot better as 2P fillers go. Note though that it's still recommended for non-gaming folk, due to its simplicity and non-threateningness (is that a word?). Just don't expect it to hold you attention for long. It might, just don't expect it to. You might be disappointed.

I love LC. It's a great short game to pass the time, and the more times you play the more you find strategies to make the game aggressive and petty in the best possible way. Definitely a game that can be played with friends or rivals with equal success.

Edit for a new opinion. My love was only short lived infatuation. It's a decent game, but nothing to write home about.

Great game - especially when playing with my wife!  And true to the form of many husbands, I haven't won yet.  I was reticent to get this game at first because I thought it would be too similar to Rack-O, but it really is a different game altogether.

Well above average. The theme is not too geeky so my wife will play. Strategies can vary quite a bit so it seems likely to stay fresh. While its true that the game is not a bottomless pit of tactical variations it is much deeper than one might initially think. My one complaint - the artwork is really ho-hum when compared to Blue Moon, Hera & Zeus, or MECCG.

Lost Cities is a very light, purely tactical hand management game. I actually hesitated to use that term because there really isn't a lot of managing to be done.

Best 2v2 card game ever?  I like the 2 player, but the 4 player is what earns this such a high score for me.  Trading cards with a teammate and trying to work together to efficiently play your cards is a great challenge.

Warning: fun to play with spouse teams, but likely to cause strong emotions (+ or -) 

"GAH I was gonna play there!!! You didn't give me a chance!"

"That's cause we were out of time! I can't read your mind!"

What can I say about Lost Cities that hasn't already been said? I clearly have a thing for Knizia's card games with Thor and Schotten Totten already appearing on this list. There will be more from the good Doctor believe me.

[2014.06.15 - 7.75]
This is the first, and best example of, a game that has a quality that I'd like to call "beautiful tension."

[2014.11.26]
The more that I play the more I realize that it's not entirely driven by luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lost cities is the epitomy of design elegance. The principle of trying to collect sets by drawing from a deck without any possibility of manipulating those cards should be boring as hell.

By simply coming up with an ingenious way to do the scoring Knizia has made it into an interesting game with elements of luck pushing and many tactical decisions.

Not sure if I still want it, since  a friend has it. Good gamebut I'm not crzy about it.  I don't like the coloring on the center piece since the colors are different enough.  I have some visual design problems with it:

The actual card art could be color coded too, not just the numbers. It must be hard for color blind people to play this. and the numbers of the cards should be on the tops and bottoms. 

I'm nto sure that I want this, but I'll leave it on the want list for now.

RATING: 10
I have played this game well over 100 times, so many I've lost count.  I play it about 4 times a week during breaks at my work.  The rules are very simple, but the strategy is not.  You are gambling on getting the cards you want later on in the game, but you may also get stuck at the beginning of the game with cards you don't want to play until later.  What's worse, you can't discard them because then your opponent can pick them up!  This is one of the few games where going first may not be a good thing (or a bad thing.)  I also love that you can draw cards from the discard later in the game to slow the game down and buy yourself time to make all the moves you want to make.  After 100's of plays, I keep coming back for more.  Another Knizia masterpiece!

Received in trade 07/03/06


Didn't grab me like I'd hoped--very okayish.  Quite "mathy" and sort of dry, very much like a standard ol' card game.  There is some cleverness here (c'mon, it's Knizia) so I'm going to give this time to grow on me before I toss it on the trade pile.


--Update:  Heh...hadn't updated this one in a while.  The comments above are hilarious when you look at the number of plays we've logged for this (and I've forgotten a few.)  This game is stupid, but fun and addictive.

It's more like a straight up card game with some funky scoring more than anything else.  But the hoi palloi thinks its okay to like this game because it's "designer".  If Parker Brothers had put this out, it'd be ranked #2719 and no one would have ever given it another look.

Recommended, all the same.

RATING: 8.948
The pick of the crop for two player card games, with a pleasant mechanic that gives a slight angst feeling.  Going first is always a difficulty, as your never sure what to play.  Can be played a number of times and is still a most enjoyable card game when you just have a partner and not a lot of time (14/12/08). UPDATE: I have reached a point where there is nothing new or unexplored with this game.  It's now the same feeling i get when playing Euchre, in that It's obvious  what the next move should be.  I guess there are now  just other card games - will tend to save this as light filler or for newbies, so rating drop from 8 to 7 (29/11/11). UPDATE: The iPad app gave me an opportunity to reassess how good a game it is. As It's also a game the wife will actually play and enjoy, It's pretty hard to beat (and the actual big cards are lovely to hold), elevated to an appropriate 9 (9/3/13). UPDATE: Don't really get this to the table, but iOS is ok, still an excellent game (rating 8.948, Sept 16).

This is a great Knizia card game that has a nifty math mechanic.  You have to take a lot of chances in this game, and I can't think of any other game that uses a mathy, push-your-luck mechanic to build tension in the same way.  I like how you have to balance your expeditions and take risks on the cards you are going to get.  Obviously there is luck involved in what cards you pull, but it is all part of the risk.  The theme could have been anything, but I like the one Knizia chose.  Great card game!

Przyjemna pasjansowata karcianka dla 2 osób. Cała przyjemność kombinowania tkwi w wyborze odpowiedniego momentu na wyłożenie kart, często trzeba podjąć ryzyko, które może się nie opłacić, bądź wręcz przeciwnie. Szybka, do wytłumaczenia w 3 minuty, również dla nowych graczy. Nie premiuje doświadczonych graczy, losowość sprawia, że każdy ma szansę wygrać, co działa na plus. Spokojnie można rozegrać więcej niż jedną partię pod rząd. Mimo tego, że to nie nowa gra, wciąż bawi, podobnie jak wersja online.

This was a neat card game to play and it's one my friend would actually play with me because, well... because she could beat me at it. The game is played with cards that have Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and White numbers on them. The idea is to lay down the cards (numbered 1 to 10) with the lowest numbers and work up to the highest. At the end of the game you subtract 20 from the total to come up with the score. You can also lay down up to 3 contract cards which become multipliers at the end. Don't do contracts though if you can't get more than 20 points out of a string of numbers. You can also get more points if you have 8 or more cards in your string of numbers. Cards you discard go on the board, so be careful dropping those down as your opponent can draw them if they're useful. Two of these games will expand into a 4 player game where you can play partners.

Beautiful cards, and a nice quick game for 2 players with some interesting decisions. It does not however have the depth and angst with which it is often credited - there seems to be a maximum efficiency at which you can play, and most players approach that.

RATING: 7.5
Incredibly easy to learn.  Great for non-gamers.  Tense, but not very confrontational.  Forces you to make a lot of tough decisions.  Luck - in the form of the order of the cards - is a factor, but the unpredictability of the card order is what forces these decisions and makes the game fun.  Also, luck is evened out somewhat since you effectively play the game three times to determine the winner.  I've never cursed at a game as much as this one, but that's not a bad thing - it's just funny what it brings out in people.

A classic two player card game. Really tough decisions, but a fast fun two player.  One complaint: can be hard to tell which color is which on the game board since there are multiple colors on the card spaces.

This is a pretty good 2 player game, something hard to find in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lost Cities is every bit as addictive as others have stated.  Quick, tense, frustrating even.  The tendancy to drop a card right before picking up the card of the same suite you had been waiting for happens more often in this game than I believe probability allows for.  A great 2-player by the good doctor.

UPDATE: Still getting played frequently.  The thrill this game offers in such a short time is astounding. Truly a classic with longevity in replayability.  Yes the game is dictated by the card draw, but not everything worth playing is ripe with multiple avenues to victory.

Initially I gave this a 7.5, but i've dropped it 1 point because if I have to play this game again i might just poke my eye ball out with a Bic pen. 

I'd give it less if it wasn't actually a good game, I just can't bare playing it again. Great for couples new to gaming, but replayability is low.

I really enjoy this game.  It's super fast and super easy to teach new gamers.  I managed to teach a 7 year-old student and play a game, all in a 15 minute recess.  Not only that - he independently figured out how to improve his game and where he made mistakes.  

I enjoy the luck of drawing the cards, as well as the opportunity for strategy.  I would say it's 70/30 skill/luck.

Wonderful little game. Good for a quick game, or play best of 3 or 5. Pretty high amount of luck involved so you can play with anyone regardless of skill and still have fun, yet over time the better player with still prevail, so it won't feel pointless if you don't like games that are all/mostly luck based.

I think I get what I dislike about Knizia's games as a whole: the theme often feels applied after the fact -- like he came up with a fairly abstract concept and then wall-papered it with some loose theme so as to produce an EXCITING! box write-up and make it more salable.  If you have some way of making/acquiring a 5-suit deck of cards then there's nothing in the experience here that would be lost by ditching the exploration theme.  (Well, that and the scoring.  For such a light, simple game the scoring is unneedfully complex.)

As for the game itself?  I need more plays before I decide, but right now I'm leaning towards dislike.  (The SO, on the other hand, likes it so I doubt that I'll be allowed to get rid of it.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm bumping up my rating slightly with more plays.  I've found the luck factor can be negated somewhat both early in the game and towards the end of the draw deck by managing your hand through careful manipulation of the Expedition discard stacks.  Very enjoyable

I enjoy this one on occasion.  It doesn't seem to offer much that you can't get with a standard deck of cards.  In fact, it's pretty easy to play lost cities if you use two decks of cards and use face cards as handshakes.
But it's a fun game, just not a top two-player, and for me not worth owning.

For such a simple game the decisions are tense and fun.  Feels like a race of patience as you wait to score more but have to get your cards out in time.  The board is unnecessary but I particularly like that they added it in.

This is an excellent couples game, as advertised.  Good, quick game with some tough decisions but it doesn't linger too long to outstay its welcome.

Overall, though, we just don't get this out too much.  It's so light that I would rather either sit down and play something more serious or play something *really* frivolous.  For me, I don't kill to get the game out.  Now moving it down to a 5.

Quite a fun little set collection game for two players. The card art is really nice, and there's a certain appeal to holding larger cards (Dixit, etc). 
The game is super easy to teach and play.
I would directly compare this game to Arboretum, which feels very similar, and the core of the game involves making an educated guess as to which cards your opponent is holding/going to invest in. (Arboretum does this also, but there is sort of a spatial element to it in that game.)
I love games with the simple set up this has; ALL cards shuffled, then a hand dealt to each player. (ie: Zero to minimal setup time! You're up and playing.)

Great two player game for everyone. Even girlfriends like to play it. Rules are easy to learn, but underneath those 'simple' rules lies a rather deep game. You are playing your opponent even though it doesn't seem so at the beginning. It's short (10-15 mins for a game, usually three games are played in a match), doesn't occupy lots of table space and is fast paced. The minor negative point for me is that luck can and will play a role in determining the winner.

Lost Cities was popular with us, being one of the first 3 games we bought (apart from games using a regular 52-card deck) for our evening rotation.  But after about 6 - 9 months of steady play, we became bored with it and seldom play.  Good game, but not a lot of replay value.

The game moves very quickly along, and there is a nice tension where you try to keep strategic cards from your opponent while simultaneously trying to get what you want.

Like most of our favorite games it is simple, fast, and light. When I say light that does not mean that there is no strategy or decision making, just not a lot of them to make each round.

RATING: 7
Played on iOS. Great game, very smooth, addictive and tactical. There is only one drawback in this game - cards are dealt and gained completely randomly (there's no order), therefore there is quite high luck factor in the game. I like that there is quite much of simple math in game as well.

Addictive risk management with a cool theme and art work attached. I would suggest Lost Cities to other wargamers who are not turned away by the lack of theme. The reason I love many non-wargames like Lost Cities and Lord of the Rings is because each is unpredictable and requires me to manage my plans while considering the factors that are both in and out of my control. That is the charm of Lost Cities.

There is more skill involved than the game's critics claim. However, the difference between a very good player and a masterful player is probably quite small. Thus luck will tend to dominate in matches between two good players. A fine game nevertheless: easy to play, easy to teach, goes over well with those who aren't game nuts, and still very enjoyable after dozens and dozens of games.

So far, my wife's favorite game in my collection. What is it about non-gamers that makes this their favorite game? She enjoys it so much she beats me at times. The game is fun, easy to learn and plays fast. A good two player game.Neat card playing game which requires some thinking (i.e. calculating), but not overwhelming for any player, with just enough of a random flavor with drawing cards, making a nice equalizer, though a bit luck driven. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the mathematical elements of Lost Cities, trying to calculate the odds of a particular expedition paying off.  There's enough randomness thrown in that even the best laid plans can go awry.  It can feel a bit frustrating at times if the cards simply won't cooperate, but I'll usually play if someone is interested.

It’s a good game for 2 players. It is definitely more fun than playing Durak. I would compare this game to the Mice (Coloretto) -- I rate Lost Cities 5 points as well. It is a quite game and it was very good when we were staying together with your Mom. We played it again and again. It is not too complex – unlike Imperial, you do not have to move your cannons and ships. You can play Lost Cities at evening before sleep. When the game is finished you do not get disappointed, you do not get overly excited. This game is good for old age.  I’d also say that the game has nice cards.

Described as mean by my partner because of the way the game ends...leaving you with no chance to play remaining cards. We agreed it was very tight and well designed. We played in near silence each concentrating on the decisions in front of us. This doesn't mean there was no interaction- it was just silent interaction. Quiet intensity with the game.

Very solid game. Nice arc...continues to create a nice sense of drama with the tension between - do i try to go for this or do i play it safe? Push your luck element is strong and adds a nice edge to the game.

Lost Cities is the leader in the rummy-inspired card game genre. It is quick, and decisions, while few, always feel important. I enjoy choosing when to commit to an expedition and whether or not to forgo the eight card bonus. Easy to teach and engaging, Lost Cities is a great 2 player filler game.

RATING: 7
Rating of 7 is based on this game compared to all games in general. If rated among the filler games for 2 players, it is an 8. With more time there are better games, but this one is a very competitive quick playing game. And very little in rules to remind someone who hasn't played in a while. When playing, the decisions affect your outcome right from the start, and often players will need to choose the least bad among options since there is not a good option in the cards that turn. And at the end, how much time is left in the game is determined by the number of cards and each player's intent to either speed up or slow down the arrival of the game end.

The more I play this game the more I like it. There is just something about it, that keeps pulling me back. I think it is the fact that, it's almost like golf. You can play a terrible round of golf, but if you hit just one nice shot, you relive that shot in your mind and want more of it. In Lost Cities if you don't get good cards, you make due and hope to break even, but the next round  one color could be great and you could get an 8 card expedition and dominate. Just talking about the elusive 8 card expedition makes me want to play right now! Lets go!

There's some difficult choices here for such a simple game.  Some have called this the ultimate "spouse" game, but I'm not sure I'd go that far.  Over time the veneer begins to rub off.

It is however one of the better short 2-player affairs and I recommend everyone at least try it.

One of the most hugely overrated games on the geek.  Considering it isn't rated that high, thats really saying something.  What feels like strategy is actually a lot of guessing based on your hopes that you will draw the cards you need.  The game has a luck factor that I normally am not bothered by, but with a game with this little meat on its bones, that much luck is just annoying.  Once you learn basic play concepts such as don't give your opponents cards they can use and don't play too many handshakes until you are sure you can finish off the run, then the rest of the game doesn't have a whole lot of strategy to it.  Plus, any game that requires folks to double check each other's math is usually not my thing.  Do you remember order of operations from 3rd grade math class?  OOO is involved with the scoring of this game.  This game is too complex for what it offers, and considering its pretty simple, that tells you a lot.

Update: The lost cities board game is slightly better than this from gameplay perspective, plus has better bits.  Both suck, but the original here sucks worse!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Like many BBG'ers this is a favorite of my wife.  We mis-interpreted the rules and were playing "wrong" for a long time (till the X-Box Live version made it clear).  Our version was cut-throat in that you couldn't play a card lower than the last played to EITHER side of the board.  This meant you could start an excavation having a long set of the cards, and the other person could cut you off by playing a high card.  They'd take a loss, but not as much as you did.  This resulted in a few rare (for me) occasions of real anger playing a game.  Even playing the "real" way is a fun challenge.  X-Box Live version is also very nice.

Nice pictures, fun theme, if a bit pasted-on. Really a push-your-luck sort of game because you are weighing the risk that you will draw a card you need when it is too late if you play. Oddly enough, I feel this game would be improved if played without a hand limit, because you would never be forced to play a card you didn't want to and the risk would all be based on how far ahead the other player was getting. Lots of luck of the draw, only for 2 players. I hear the ladies like this one, though I'm sure you could find other games they would like better.

A surprisingly clever 2-player. At first the dependence on the luck of the cards feels staggering since even making optimal plays will sometimes leave you in the hole. But after losing early games by horrible margins I realized that risks have to be taken early in the hand. Aggressive play is usually the best. Players must astutely manage card-drafting, discarding, and the draw-deck to maximize scoring. With continued play these competing demands shine.

Has clearly earned its place as an easy recommendation for games for two that aren't too taxing. I find that there are other games which offer something more within the same time-frame and relative weight. Battle-line for tension, Jambo for creative play and variability, and Jaipur for that race-like atmosphere. This isn't to say that Lost Cities isn't well designed and still holds up, it just doesn't quite do it for me the way it did when I first started this hobby.

This is a great 2 player game.  I have enjoyed playing with my wife on a regular basis though sometimes the game can be really swingy.  It is best enjoyed over 3 rounds to help even out the luck factor that creeps in.  However, sometimes there will be that game where one player wins by 100+ points and a couple more rounds won't change that gap.  

It would also be a good game for children of many age brackets to work on numbers and math in a fun and creative manner.  The end scoring requires multiplication and addition.  When your child is motivated by competition to find out their score its a sneaky way to get them to do math.  For younger children the art and counting the numbers along with learning what number is greater than other numbers is a good teaching tool.

I would highly recommend this as a 2 player game for couples as well as recommend it for family game night where children can be helped by their parents to enjoy the experience (even if they really aren't playing the core strategy of the game).

RATING: 10
A perfect two-player game.  The mechanics are deceptively simple.  Timing your plays can be quite the delicious agony.  Do I hold out for another doubler before I open in red?  Do I have time to get down 20 points of green before the deck runs out?  The artwork is also lovely.  Indeed, the art is what puts this game slightly above Schotten Totten for me.

[Initial Impression: 4]
Lost Cities clearly possesses a simple elegance, but for some reason it tends to alternately frustrate and annoy me.  The game rewards patience and can harshly punish risk-taking, and yet the obvious early plays involve some measure of risk.  It feels too much like you're just waiting to see what cards you draw and how they fit with what you already have - in that sense you are often playing more against yourself than against your opponent.  In some ways, I think a solitaire version of the game would play just as well, as much of the game involves reevaluation of your hand each turn as you discover which new cards are out of play for you.  I play more than I'd prefer because my primary gaming partner really likes it.

Average/Nice little two-player game. Nothing that a good old "standard" poker card deck can't accomplish... but nice anyway. Sadly, the theme is present only in the title and the illustrations. Which means that it is only pasted-upon.

Anyway the game is not that bad.

Now that I have a physical copy, my old comment is no longer relevant.  This game is easy to teach, plays fast, and is fun for two.  Not a whole lot else to add - the theme is entirely tacked on, and the scoring feels simultaneously effective but sloppy.

Limited to two, this might not make it to many game nights.  Around the house though, or before hosting friends, it could be a good warmup or filler game.

A good, short and simple, two-player filler. Probably not something that would stand up to regular play too well but certainly a nifty game to bring out of the cupboard every now and again for a quick play between bigger games.

I haven't played this in a while as the missus really dislikes it.  Works fantastically well when both players are of a similar skill and I love how well balanced it feels - you are always presented with difficult decisions about which is the best card to play.

A definite keeper, but one that will only make infrequent appearances.

This is a fantastic game for two.  So easy to play because once you have committed to a strategy you can pretty much just act on it for most of the round.  I haven't won a set of three games yet, but i'm sure I will soon.  Amy seems to like it alot too which is great.

I don't understand how people prefer battle line to this... Battle line is slower and much more fidgety; the extra card deck is not a nice element in battle line.

I really enjoy this simple game of card play.  Some people say it's solitaire, but it isn't.  You really do need to consider your opponent when you discard...really!  I have one friend who thinks this game is high strategy and takes 45 minutes per hand...yuck.  One of my all time favorites.

I found this game to be simple, fast, and fun. There are interesting strategies that remind me of Bridge, and the 4 player variant adds an another level of excitement. That said, I am disappointed that this is essentially a 5-suit card deck, with a simple theme pasted on top; I feel ripped off. There is no feel of expeditions or of exploration--if I want that, I'll play Tikal. If I want to play this, I think I can construct my own game using two 52-card standard decks; I am essentially paying for the rules, and in this regard, this reminds me of another Kniza game: Escalation--another simple card game with a pasted-on theme.

I am disappointed. Way to luck based and way to similar to basic cards games to justify the need for unique deck.  I would rather play cribbage, any rummy variant, or pitch and I can play all of them with the same deck.   I could see the game coming with a bob the builder theme and being marketed to 6 years old.  Way to simple for me.

One of those games you can just keep playing round after round.  I like the push your luck mechanism.  We used to play this game so much when we first got it.  Doesn't really hit the table anymore.  Great game for what it is (Light 2 player push your luck card game).

Incredibly simple, yet still engaging. Too bad the cards are so big and of so poor quality that we managed to wreck White 9 within 1 week. :( Currently battling Jaipur for being my best couples game.

Update: My solution was to scan all the cards and print a myself a Poker-sized set for daily use. I even 'converted' the board to five cards, so everything now truly fits in a pocket.

It's not as bad as Race For The Galaxy but I always feel like I can go on auto-pilot and ignore my opponent's play for long stretches of this game.

There are many 2-player games I'd rather play before this. I can't but help feel there's some kind of front-runner effect here. Lost Cities is popular because it is popular, sort of like how Monopoly has monopolized the non-BGG boardgame headspace. If Lost Cities were released in today's crowded marketplace I doubt it would be as popular as it is given the number of other games that are equally fun.

Also, there's something generally distasteful about card games that can essentially be played with a standard deck of cards. I realize that in some sense I'm paying for designer's "thought output" but there are hundreds, if not thousands, of public domain card games I could play instead.

There's not even a pasted on theme here, just an oversized deck of cards with fancier art on the front. Instead of buying Lost Cities for $20 you could buy a themed deck of cards (say cats or Renaissance artists) for $5 and have the same gameplay with just as much theme.

Fast paced, easy to learn, very interactive.  I like the luck factor in this game as it potentially forces you to make changes in strategy from card to card.  But, with time ticking (last card in draw pile immediately ends the game) these changes add a lot of tension.  Very fun.

I'm not as crazy about this game as many others are, but it is a very solid and fun game.  I think it is interesting that you can draw cards from the discarded expedition piles or the draw pile.  The game evolves as a result, with unwanted expedition cards becoming more attractive due to the number and quality of the discard piles.  It is also interesting that the game can be sped up or slowed down through the use of the draw pile or discard piles.

Among the very best card games for 2, although let it be said that's a pretty modest club. It's perfectly playable with only four suits, so a standard pack of cards can be used. Risk taking is the essential element in the game, you must start up to four 'expeditions' without knowing whether high value cards will come off the draw pile. As with all card games sometimes you get the cards and sometimes not, there's only so much that you can do to put yourself in a winning position. This is among my favourite of Knizia's games and much better than many standard card games for 2.

They should rename this, "The Spouse Game." I heard various reviewers say this was the perfect game for a spouse that's just not as interested in gaming as you are. Upon hearing such a statement, I decided to put it to the test. And....SUCCESS! My wife absolutely loves this. It is a two-player card game that comes with 60 oversized cards where each player is competing to get your expeditions the most funding.

Now, the cover on the box is where the theme ends. The whole idea of investing in different expeditions...is really non-existent in the game. If you look at the cover you'll see that this is a Reiner Knizia game. So basically it's a bit of a thinky math game. But don't let that scare you away. The "math" part doesn't come in until the final scoring. 

The reason this game is so high on my list is because of the quick back-and-forth nature of the game. It does come down to luck of the draw, but there are important decisions that you have to make as well. Whether to invest in one expedition, only to have your opponent be completely stacked with all the right cards for that one. Or to take the risk and start supporting one more expedition when you know the game will be over soon

First played this on Dec 21, 2006.  I wasn't sure what to expect playing this for the first time and was eager to see how it worked.  Althought it's like rummy to some degree it really isn't.  This should be a fun game to play with the wife and I've now planned to get it.  There is enough luck and strategy to make this a must play.  I played with a very experienced player and made the rookie mistakes and at the same time he didn't take advantage of me when I really did a bone headed move.  The first of three sections it was clear I didn't know what I was doing.  The 2nd section I actually scored more as I played cautiously and actually had a really bad starters hand.  The 3rd section I played too fast as I thought I had the hang of it and made a few poor decisions.  Can't wait to play this at home.  It's also a good filler game taking 30 minutes or less to play.

I have played the board game of this and was happy when I saw the card game was back in print.  I had a coupon that got me 30% off, so I had to pick it up.  I've only played with my older son, but it seems like an enjoyable two player game.  There is some strategy in getting points as you have to remember that you have to pay for each "expedition" you go on.  My son was lucky to get several of the multiplier cards at the beginning of the game, which helped him win.  Looking forward to trying with my husband.

Someone showed me this game and we played a fast round. This game is kind of dull actually. It kind of slapped me across my face with how jarringly uninteresting Lost City is because I had just learned Battle line shortly before. I loved Battle line. I couldn't believe that a similar looking card game by the same hall of fame designer, Reiner Knizia could be this dull. I just wanted to put it back in the box posthaste and extricate myself from paying any further opportunity cost of not playing dramatically more enjoyable games. I will try it one or two times further, but I will not be likely asking to play Lost Cities.

Damnit if this game isn't appealing for some reason.  I have no reason to like this nor shouldn't due to it being pretty much being a game of luck and math...but I just can't pass up a game every now and then.  Stupid Knizia and your awesome games I don't want to like.

Update:  Loses its appeal VERY quickly.  The game lacks a lot of depth and card draw can be overly frustrating for a light, casual game.  I haven't played this with my girlfriend in ages...

So I bought it and played it.  It is enjoyable, but I personally prefer battle line.  Lost Cities feels like a very good Rummy, but still a Rummy.  In fact, Wyatt Earp does Rummy better even.  There's also a reasonable disconnect between what you're playing and what it feels like you are scoring.

Schotten Totten on the other hand feels like a completely unique card game.

Jan08: Still enjoyable and sees occasional play, but just not as good as other 2-player card games.

A 2 player masterpiece. Very simple game play with few choices with a great combination of luck and skill for such a short game. Everyone should own this!

Comparing to other games, there is hidden subtlety here. Risk management is key and figuring out how to get the most of a bad hand is what this game is all about. Luck does not play such a central role as one might think after a game or two.

Really good two person game. I love the decisions early-on whether to invest in a color or not when you don't really have the right critical mass of cards for it -or- waiting, waiting, for the handshake doubler when you DO have the critical mass but they never show because they are in your opponents hand. I even love the anguish of investing in a color w/o critical mass and having your opponent do the same *groan*. It goes on and on...plus a nice variety on how you want to play the end game. If I knew of anyone else who enjoyed this as much as I do and if it didn't have such an unbelievable lame theme I think I would rate it higher.

RATING: 8
Classic game for two players.  Both players have a hand of 8 cards which contain numbers in 5 different colours.  Players then must place the cards in ascending order onto the table, at the end of the round if you have more than 20 total points in a colour then you score positive points, less than 20 hurts your total score.

Sounds simple enough but it's made interesting with the "Investment" cards which may be placed before any numbers of that colour, which multiply your points (positive or negative).  This adds a great risk/reward mechanic that's really fun and makes you want to play just one more round.  Highly recommend this as a nice simple game to play with your significant other, for example.

People keep saying this game is like two-player solitaire.  However, I think the player interaction is there, it is merely subtle.  It is very important to watch what the other player is doing and adapt your play accordingly. Reciprocally, what cards I play or choose not to play can influence the actions taken by the other player.  This allows some subtle inter-player strategies.

I bought the game for me and my wife to play together. At the beginning it was fun, but after 3-4 plays it got quite monotonous. After playing this and Ticket to Ride, we realized that set collection mechanics don't feel much fun to us. If you like strategy, bluffing and set collection, this is a well designed game for 2. I will take it out from time to time, but not the favorite title of mine.

A very light, very casual card game for two players. It’s easy to learn and a pretty fair gateway to modern European boardgames.

There’s not much to it, though.

(Apropos of nothing, the artwork on the board includes some archeological utensil that looks like a pair of tweezers. My creepily smart cat poked at them as if they were real — which makes me wonder about their true powers of imagination and abstraction. How many millennia till we’ve bred house pets that play board games with us?)

My non-gaming wife really likes playing this game and she would rate it as a 9. I like it too but there are other games I would rather play. The theme is non-existant (I like well-themed games). If you like card games with an ordinary deck of cards you will really go for Lost Cities. It is fast and there is quite a lot of luck (you get this in cards). It is a game of tough decisions, often between bad and worse options. Can be very tense towards the end as you try to play all the great cards from your hand, while your opponent is trying to bring the game to an early close.

A very interseting game. I didn't like it too much at first but the more I play it the more addicting it seems to get. My mom and sister especially seem to enjoy the game.

Highly recommended!

RATING: 8
Great game for non-hardcore-gamers, in that the rules are simple, there's a lot of replay value, and it's pretty quick.  This is a good one to pull out when you want to play a game but don't have a lot of time for explaining rules or setting up pieces.  There's some strategy, but there's also quite a bit of random chance in the luck of the draw, so it can be a bit frustrating at times, but overall I'd rank this as one of my all-time favorite games.

Essentially a traditional-style card game with 5 suits rather than 4. The board isn't really needed and the cards are too large. However, it is a very well-designed game and maintains interest despite the simple rules. It can be very tense at the beginning as you decide whether to start expeditions, and requires some planning towards the end to ensure the most effective use of your remaining opportunities to add cards. There is only a modest amount of interaction between the two players.

Surprisingly cutthroat game for 2.  My girlfriend doesn't like to play card games with me, because she feels I have too much of an advantage from being an mtg player, but this game is mathy enough that she feels like she is on equal footing with me.

Scoring takes a few games to get used to, but once you get the hang of the game, it does play very quickly.  I'm glad I bought this, its one of the better 2 player games I own.

This is a decent time-killer and good for playing with casual gamers, but it is not my first choice even in that situation.  Whereas my wife really likes it, to me there aren't enough important decisions during the average round.  Occcasionally one pops up, but most of the time the "best" play is obvious and the game simply feels mechanical. By the time we reach the third round of play I'm ready to just move onto something more interesting.

Gorgeous artwork. Once players know what they're doing, it's fast to play. Tough deciding whether to bet you can play enough on a color. Which cards that the other player wants do you keep, thus limiting what you can hold for your own use? Major drawback is calculating the points at end.

This is a little better than I expected because I wasn't expecting much, a little tension, push your luck and some decision making to be had and well it did come from the doctor after all. Makes a good late night filler with the spouse as it is very light and a good dose of luck thrown in. I hear the art is great but so is making your own deck with the file from here adding your vacation pictures to the cards, makes a great touch and it must be said that the 'theme' is 100% pasted anyway. I much prefer battleline to this for the extra strategy elements but this is good for what it is.

A classic two player game that deserves its reputation. I really like the decision making between which card based set-collection expeditions to pursue over others, as well as rapidly re-planning if the draw pile or your competitor isn’t doing you any favours! A little ‘mathiness’ may creep in, especially when planning end strategies. However, it is quick playing, supports light strategy, doesn’t kill table-talk and a great game for sticking in a rucksack when out and about.

Simple mechanics, tough choices, and no theme in true Knizia fashion. This and other Kosmos 2P games like Jambo are what helped my wife and I discover how much we loved gaming together. I don't love it as much anymore and would have traded it away by now except for the little known 4 player variant. If you combine 2 games you can play 2 vs 2! It is even better than the normal version because there is a new team element. Hidden information means you have to guess what your teammate has and what he wants you to do. Great game for non-gamer couples. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a great card game! It requires some good strategy, has a good theme, and requires a little luck (as in most card games). It's relatively quick and very easy to teach. The start of the game can be downright torturous as you decide to start expeditions and then immediately draw the card you'd have preferred to start with! There a nice balance betwen getitng the cards you need and holding back the cards your opponent needs.

Lost Cities is a fantastic two-player game. It's very portable and accessible with interesting card art. The theme is a bit weak and luck can play a non-trivial factor in determining the winner, but the agony in deciding whether to chase cards while possibly opening up better moves to one's opponent is exciting. It's a definite keeper in my collection.

Great game for you and the spouse.  I would rate it lower for serious gamers, but the real appeal to this game is that it has lots of replay for two people.  It is also a very quick game, so you can play it when you are waiting for the real game to start.

This game is packed with very tough decisions. It also has a low explanation and play time which makes it a good game to introduce to non-gamers. The luck of the draw is quite heavy here though which can lead to frustration. Like many Knizia's the scoring is a little mathsy which may put some off. This one doesn't see as much play as it once did...

RATING: 5
Like playing 3 hands of poker with no money.  Gives the illusion of depth on top of a level of randomness that can't be overcome by card counting over 3 games.  A good player will win more in the long run, but each individual game is largely a rote exercise, with the only difficult decisions occurring when every option you can possibly take is bad.  The rest of the game plays itself.

My bet is that in 1000 plays, a good player beats an average player 550-600 times at most.

Initial Rating: 6.5

At last I got to play the fabled Lost Cities game. I had my doubts because Knizia is very hit or miss (mostly miss) with me, but at the end I liked the game. It is a light quick game (as expected) but it has some depth in it. The game can be explained under 5 minutes and played under 30 minutes. I vastly prefer this than Keltis due to the number of players. The game components are adequate, the cards are bigger than normal but I found sleeves for them so no troubles there, the art is ok too. The game has a healthy dose of luck but as it plays so quickly I don’t mind.

For me, it is very reminiscent of Battle Line (Schotten-Totten) 

In conclusion, Lost Cities is a good familiar game, I will be playing it in the future but not very often.

------------------------------
Within the first coupla weeks after I'd bought this, the missus had actively *asked* to play! Several times!! I join the ranks of the male analytic mostly-serious gamers whose gaming-light wives enjoy this game and repeatedly hwip our ass at it! The theme is *completely* irrelevant, the deck could be ordinary playing cards but for the fifth suit. But the cards are large and pleasantly coloured. (AU$50 still seems a little steep for this production, but I'm certain we'll get our play-value out of it.)

7 - Good game, usually willing to play ('Geek Definition of a 7).

I've spread this one around faster than a sailor on leave; it burns and it itches and soon everyone's got it.

It makes a great rainy day/cabin game to break out. This is a good game for playing as a filler now and again (I don't believe in playing a game to death, I like variety).  I totally stink at it and netted a -27 points in my first time out. I like it and it's enjoyable to me. Perhaps I'm too relaxed playing it though, as I've yet to make a good appearannce in it! :o) This is a very good game to introduce and has been popular with many of the women/friends that I've broken it out with. The scoring kind of scared me off at first since I'm a math-phobic person, but it was an unfounded fear; the scoring sure makes the game what it is and is important to getting a strategy for playing. I found good interaction with the opponent and you can influence their game by what you do. This game can be played with four players (2 per team, no talking!) if you have two sets together. I would reccommend this one.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game that I enjoy with the wife. I view this as a filler game, and while there isn't much thought that has to be put into this game compared to some others, we still have a good time of it.

How will this game stand up to the test of time? Not sure, but as of today (1/18/11) I rate it a 8. My wife and I both are typically willing to sit down and play some LC, however not always.

One of our favorites. A light card game with some real tough choices to be made. Some very hard decisions have to be made throughout the game: start an expedition? Wait for more funding?

Highly recommended.

I really enjoy this game.  There is certainly an element of press your luck to this one, but there is more.  The players can effect the tempo of the game round by the manner in which they play and this can be used to shift a loss to a win.  Playing several rounds seems a good way to overcome the impact of a particularly favorable card shuffle.

I once gave this an &quot;8&quot;, until playing it repeatedly with a friend.  The scores were never close, and were obviously the result of the &quot;luck of the draw.&quot;  First, I would get a crushing score, then he would.  

And before you tell me that we just &quot;don&#039;t get it.&quot;  Bull.  Both of us know how to play rummy (and are quite good at it), which is just what this is with a couple of tweaks.
Gin, Rummy, Cribbage, etc.  are all similar (in terms of being luck determinate given relatively equal skill levels), and cost a whopping $2 in quality playing cards.

Throw strategy out the window with this pure luck-of-the-draw card game.  Far TOO many times I've started plays with low cards in my hand only to never have gotten 20 points by round end.  If you can't handle the fact that educated guesses often don't succeed then pass on this one.

I've found the choices to be pretty obvious while playing the game.  The theme is very pasted on.  The art is nice but the size and quality of the cards isn't great (no wear yet though, admittedly). Played a bunch of games, but always against the same opponent, so maybe that's why I have such a mediocre view of this game.  It's not a bad game, and I can see why some might like it, but personally it doesn't do much for me.

A simple game (though not nearly as simple as it seems) that goes down easy and doesn't overstay its welcome. Nice choices to make each turn. Easy to explain. Nice visually.

Main defect is you have to pull out pencil-and-paper to score, it's a bit complicated for such a simple game.

Lost Cities might appear to be a light filler at first,but this game is a cutthroat grudge match packed with tension. The decisions in this one are simply agonizing.

[>5 plays] A well-designed light game. There is a fair amount of randomness, but good play usually helps to overcome the effect of bad draws. Be careful of how many cards are left, as you often have to draw "bad" cards to extend the game long enough for you to play what you need. It deserves it reputation as a couples' game, as it's a good game to finish off a night while enjoying being together.

RATING: 4
Totalmente sobrevalorado.

Este juego es simple y sin sentido. Realmente no entiendo cómo puede estar colocado en el top 200. Sólo robas cartas y tratas de ponerlas en la mesa, pero no haces nada más, no hay más opciones. Cuando acaba una ronda tienes que calcular tus puntos, y es bastante aburrido.

No es un buen juego, si quieres un juego de cartas para dos, rápido y realmente bueno, mejor Battleline.

Totally overrated.

This game is simple and pointless. I really don't understand how it can be placed at top 200. You only draw cards and try to put them on the table, but you can't do anything more, there are no other options. When a round ends, you have to calculate your points and it is quite boring.

Not a good game, if you want a fast and really good cardgame for two people, go for Battleline.[/color]

Rating after three games (three sets each) + a couple on BSW to get me hooked in the first place.

A pretty good mechanic on a pretty crappy (or pretty much non-existent) theme.  Some basic arithmetic req'd for success.

If light strategy suits your palette, you can't really go wrong here, especially for the price... However, if you, like me, are looking for an experience as much as you're seeking great gameplay design, then this Knizia game just isn't worth exploring. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wonderful Knizia creation which packs a whole lot of game and fun in very few rules.  Simple in the extreme but captivating in gameplay.  Although this really is an abstract game, the theme is still present - you feel like you are embarking on a risky expedition when you play your first cards.  Knizia is the short game king.  This and Lord Of The Rings: The Confrontation are genius.

RATING: 4
Not a bad two player filler, but kind of an empty game that could just as easily be played with a 99c deck of cards. Board is bigger and heavier and more solid than it needs to be so the game isn't even particularly portable - would be better to have a cloth board or even just five other cards to use as the expedition bases. Manual doesn't need to be as big as it is either, it should be the same size as the cards. Would be more highly rated if the design wasn't so inane.

Really, this game is all they say. Everyone I've played with has liked it: an ex-magic the gathering shop owner, my mom, and a cute gal I'm hanging out with.

If that's not a cross-section for you...

Okay, after 35 or so plays (a ton for a single game for me) I'm a little cool on it, but it's still a good quick game ala cribbage or the like. Mom still loves it...and I still enjoy it as an occasional thing.

Perhaps this is a harsh rating for a game that so many love so much, but it does accurately reflect my feelings. I don't enjoy playing Lost Cities. The give and take of the central display and hand management aspects are great. What I don't like is the set collection/scoring rules. On top of that something just fails to impress in this game it leaves me bored and wishing I wasn't playing.

Lost Cities is a solid game in the very simple & fast card game category. But that's all it is. It's neither exciting nor deep, and it is strictly inferior to Battle Line. I don't understand why Lost Cities is such a universal recommendation on BGG. If you're expecting a novel Euro game, you'll be very disappointed - this is a traditional card game in a very overproduced costume.

Some short 2-player card games which are superior to Lost Cities:
Battle Line (aka Schotten Totten)
Cribbage
Dominion
Jambo

This one has slipped a lot for me. Erin still really likes it (though she ALWAYS loses by starting a new set too late) but I just don't ever feel the urge to grab it over something like Jaipur or Schotten Totten. Still, it's small enough that it doesn't take up too much room and I'm still prefectly happy to play it when Erin feels like it so it stays. Though we mostly just play a 4 suit version with a regular deck of playing cards now. Thinking of maybe using Schotten Totten's deck, but the lack of face cards makes investments tricky.

The first thing I mention to anyone about this game is that the cards are my favorite cards ever. They shuffle like a dream, and are just fantastic! In any event, this game is quick, I'm good at it, and my wife likes it. The only downside that one could potentially consider is that the scoring is very mathy. I like math, so no problems here, but if you want to teach a kid how to do math have them score this game.

I'm typically not big on card games (and I do consider this to be a card game) but I am pleasantly surprised by this game!  Although it can sometimes seem like two players playing solitaire together, there is still lots of room for interaction and "tweaks" in strategy.  Also, the end can sneak up on you - be aware of how many cards are left and stop waiting for the "perfect" card or you'll be sorry...

Nice, light two-player fare. There are some decisions to be made here, chiefly (a) how long to wait (or how long is too long to have waited) to start a new "suit" and (b) how to manage the pace of the game through picking up discards vs. drawing from the draw deck. It's fast enough to play three rounds (the recommended) in under an hour, and no one feels too challenged (except maybe by the arithmetic if it gets too late). The cards are lovely but oversized and black edged; mine already show numerous nicks after only a few plays (not enough to "tip" but still irritating). There are much worse ways to spend 30-45 minutes, but there are better ways, too.

Didn't think much of this game, rated it a 4 and sold it. Subsequently realised I'd been missing a key rule which would probably make the game more interesting (ability to pick up a discarded card). For this reason I've taken off my rating since it was based on a misunderstanding of the rules.

For a fast 2-player game this is a really nice choice. Typical of Knizia, the system is brilliant. Most of the time there's this feeling that you simply don't have a card in hand you'd actually want to play. Mathematically there is probably always an obvious solution, but that doesn't matter to me.

Once you figure out a few simple strategy essentials, the game becomes an exercise in carrying out those strategies. Nonetheless, it is a good, relatively quick two player game. The artwork is also nice.

Great game, with brutal decisions.  Players must strike a delicate balance between assuming the right amount of risk, leaving themselves adequate time to complete their plans, avoiding helping their opponent more than themselves, and knowing when to take a suboptimal score in one exploration to be able to maximize another.  Very nice.

Probably my favourite filler game, I first played it on the xbox360 against the computer and loved it, introduced it to my dad with a normal pack of cards and we loved it so much, we went and bought 2 copies of the game.  Play about 3-6 games, once a week for the past 3-4 years now.

Seems very random when played against a bot, even though the bot always loses.

Now played against a human and always won against that one too! Not sure why. Gameplay is not unpleasant, but feels more luck-influenced than Schotten-Totten.

Raised from 6 to 7. I like the whole game length control thing. Also the bots at Happy Meeple, as opposed to those at YourTurnMyTurn, don't always lose.

Typical Knizia - Math is involved, theme is irrelevant to the game. His games tend to be hit or miss with me and this is probably the biggest hit thus far. Simple mechanics, easy to learn but takes some thinking when playing against someone else who knows what they are doing.

- 2 player
- Weight: Very Light
- Genre: Card Drafting/Strategy
- Length: Short

A quick 2-player card game with surprising amounts of depth. This game creates a constant inner struggle that makes for a fun experience. You'll constantly be asking yourself, "Is it too late to lay down these cards? I could lose a lot of points but I could also win a lot." or "How much does my opponent want this card? If I give it up I can get that card which would help me." There's a lot of give and take so only a discerning player, with a bit of luck, will come out the winner.

二人用のゲームではコロレットよりも面白いと思う。ただし、最後の点数計算が面倒だけど。シリーズのケルトよりもこちらがテーマがしっくりくるので好み。
遺跡探検といったテーマが好みなので甘目の点数かもしれない。が、ソロゲーム用ルールがBGGのヴァリアントで紹介されており、結構面白いので点数はこれ位。
「出したくないけど出さないといけない」が、捨て山の使い方や方針転換のタイミングを学習すれば、それほど厳しいゲームではない(?)かも知れない。

RATING: 3
This is a glorified Texas Hold 'Em card game, but nerdified so nerds would be interested and buy specialized decks. That doesn't mean it's a bad game ... just that single playthroughs will give much more noise than signal as far as who actually played the better game. (This is a common theme in many of Knizia's games and Knizia's response is to ... have them play poker-style, with multiple games that make one big game.) If one wants to play poker that's fine - but I fear very few people will buy Lost Cities thinking it will be more like Dominion than Texas Hold 'Em.

Lost Cities has a transparent theme (it's very possible to not get any flavor of it at all during the game) and is utterly overmanufactured. At its heart this game is a half-deck of cards that could be _easily_ homemade for $2. But to make it sell for $20 it has to be put into a much larger box than is needed and given a completely unnecessary board. Lost Cities may not be the only overmanufactured game out there but it is the most flagrant offender of efficiency out there. Curiously enough Knizia's "Poison" is the other game that comes to mind. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lost Cities works well as a short, friendly game, especially if you're playing with someone you love who doesn't love games.  It lacks strategic depth for me, in that the only two substantive strategic decisions comes from either assessing the likelihood of the points one can return on the base investment of any expedition, or controlling the game clock by choosing to draw from the deck of the discarded expedition cards.  That being said, it's an enjoyable game, with some quality art assets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An entertaining card game with fast playing hands which always involve the challenging decision of what suits to pursue or discard vs. when to play them to your advantage and your opponents disadvantage.  I'll gladly play this but don't see any reason to own it unless I have a regular opponent who speciifically and regularly requested this game (i.e. read wife/girlfriend).

Two initial disappointments, both of which a couple of playings more than mitigated:

The "long" cards. Initially I was sort of disappointed with their shape, but I've grown to enjoy the ease of shuffling with them. And nice illustrations, too.

Is that all there is to it? Is there really a game in there? It turned out there were, lots of agonising decisions, all in a very nice little package. Kudos to Knizia, again!

A nice card based around melds and drawing from discards, somewhat similar to Canasta, with a spin around the five separate discard piles and the “investment” cards used to bet on making your melds. Like any card drawing game there is luck in the fall of the cards.

The rules are easy to learn, it plays quickly and you can vary the game length by the number of rounds played.

The artwork is nice, though the theme is essentially pasted on the basic mathematical game.

Four player works well too.

Ellie and I used to play this game after dinner almost every evening for a while. We played this at the early stage of our marriage and there so many beautiful memories stays with this game. The game itself is bit too dry and mathematical but I would keep this game rest of my life of course.

I admit it, I am just not a big Knizia fan. I've played Ingenious, Samurai and Lost Cities and while I can see that they are well designed I just don't end up with that longing to get them to the table. The gameplay in Lost Cities is fine, especially with the interactive discard piles shared by the players, but it all just feels like a math puzzle. I enjoy a good math puzzle, but in my games I want something more. For my money, Parade and Jaipur are both much better games.

As with so many couples, it seems, this is a game my wife routinely wins when she plays me. I can beat others, they can beat her, but when we sit down and face each other across this board, it's a miracle if I win a single round. If there is something about this game that she knows and I don't, she keeps it hidden pretty well. I fight the urge to play cards in all 5 colors- every hand, one color gets dismissed from my plans early in the game, only for a bright shiny combination of 2 and 3 or 6 and 8 to be dangled in front of me, and I bite. It almost never works. Too often, I also string out the game by picking up discards in order to buy time to play all the cards from my hand that I want, and in doing so, give my wife the chance to also clear hand of her cards. And it always works to her advantage. One of us married a mule-headed idiot, and it wasn't me- I have more sense than that...

Bought it, since it has a good opinion on bgg as a wife-friendly game. After reading the rules I thought it was too simplistic. Played it just once by now, but my wife agrees - there's just not too much game in it. There is a bit of strategy and a lot of luck + need for some math at the end. 

So not bad, but really I was hoping for something more meaty. Additionally my wife isn't too fond of card games, so this one is going to be sold soon.

Lost cities is one of those games that could almost be played with a traditional deck of cards. Which implies the theme is completely irrelevant. The cards are pretty, though.

What we have here is a quick and friendly card game with a wide appealing potential thanks to its extremely simple rules. The game mechanisms are clever, so it isn't only about playing your cards randomly, but luck has quite an impact.

This isn't something I'm going to play time and time again, but I will look for it when trying to introduce new people to the hobby.

Initially, I regarded this as perhaps a subsitute for Hearts or Gin Rummy, but not a game to play it on a real games day.  After playing it a bit more on BSW, I appreciate the tension in the decisions to place or withhold cards, the "go for broke" aspect, and the strategy in timing the exhausting of the discard pile.  Still, it's still pretty light for my taste.

[size=12][b]Why I like Lost Cities:[/b][/size]
+ The game is easy to teach.
+ The game is short.
+ The theme does not bother me (it is in the background)
+ The game requires decisions to win
+ There is high player involvement
+ The replayability seems alright

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Lost Cities:[/b][/size]
- I am not the biggest fan of pure set collection games or pure card drafting games and this barely passes the line by combining the two mechanics. 
- The game plays too much like a traditional card game

RATING: 7
Quick colorful game that's easy to learn but difficult to master. And of course, there's the element of luck - get a hand full of 8s, 9s and 10s all of different colors at the start and that's that. If you discard them, your opponent grabs them, if you play them, you're likely to get minus points. Looks like this is another game I'm not going to win often, but fun nevertheless.

One of many great two-player games from Kosmos. Fun to play as a couple, and lighter than Hera and Zeus or Caesar & Cleopatra. Can be a little random, but randomness balances out over three sessions or more. Very strategic and not a brain-burner either.

RATING: 9
This is a stunning 2 player game as well as being a stunningly simple 2 player game.

Play colour matched cards in an incrimental order. Simple, hey? But with the hand limit and the inability to pass this game is all about blocking and ducking. Planning probabilities several turns ahead to keep a fresh supply of cards cycling in your hand so you can afford to wait on a high numbered card that you need.

This is a classic of simple rules that lead to arduous decisions.

07-29-2014 - I think there's just too much luck in this one.  I'm not sure that I wouldn't get spanked by someone who has a number of plays, implying that it's not all luck, but it's luck enough to pretty much turn me off.  I'll play it, especially since my wife likes it a lot, but I rarely find myself really enjoying it.

Fun card game. Scoring can be very confusing at first, and it's hard to explain how it works sometimes for new players. The card have nice artwork (like all Rio Grande/HIG produced games!). Before Lost Cities, I bought Ceasar and Cleopatra which is a relative of this game. However, I still don't get how to play Caesar and Cleopatra! Lost Cities is an easier version, and I heard Hera and Zeus is more difficult than C-and-C. Overall, this game plays quick, is a great time killer and very portable.

I had a comment dating back to an (estimated) 2005, so clearly it needed updating.  I said that I didn't play two-player games enough to value this.  That's now a load of crap, as I mostly play games with my wife now, and I still don't see this as something I'd be into.  It's too dry and mathy without the charm of something a little more involved (cf. Through the Desert, Samurai, Ricochet Robots, all of which I love), and not thematically rich enough to warrant buying in game form (cf. Odin's Ravens, which you could also make a deck of, but it would be ugly and not as fun).

It's just not my thing.  For two-player card games, I'd pick several Decktet games over this.

Still looking for good 2 player games for serious gamers with little battle/agression. This game, just never could get that excited over as it's pretty random.

So bad at it, but I love playing it anyway. I know my downfall is that I'm afraid to commit to any one color too much; I won't play multiple handshakes because of the risk that I won't get to 20 for that color and my negative points will end up multiplied. So I regularly lose by like, 50 points. Per hand.

Playing this with Dan (a hardened gamer), we were laughing because we knew we were each holding on to the cards the other needed, and it was funny to see how much we would hurt ourselves to hurt the other guy.  Syndi (not so much of a gamer) doesn't seem to appreciate that approach, though, ha ha.

Update: dropping this to a 4; I would always prefer to play [gameid=760] instead.

Really great, simple game that always sees multiple plays in each session.  Replayability will start to suffer after awhile but it is a simple game that is easy to pull out on occasion and play again without your performance suffering.

Some prefer Battle Line as it is similar but more involved. If you want a quicker more casual game though this is still better and its a game I will happily play anytime.

Nice little card game. This is a good game for the beginners, because it's easy to learn, but still quite a challenging. Unfortunately there are a lot of luck involved and the game is interesting only at the beginning of each round. Not bad at all, but there are many card games which are definitely better than this one. Updated 2008: Lost Cities the Boardgame makes this one even better, so you don't really need to get this original cardgame version at all.

RATING: 7
In Lost Cities, a card game from the Kosmos two-player series, the object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities. Card play is straightforward, with a few agonizing moments sprinkled through what is mostly a fast-moving game. If you start a given expedition, you'd better make some progress in it, or it'll score you negative points. If you can make a lot of progress, you'll score quite well. After three rounds, the highest total score takes the day.Rules are included for a four-player team game that requires two copies to play.

I know people rant about this being like Racko, but I actually like Racko. There's something about putting things in order that will either satisfy your OCD or send you over the edge. I like this because it's got that Racko-ness but what you discard is way more important here. The stress of not wanting to help your opponent is a great mechanic to me. The game looks fantastic and it's one of those where you feel a sense of completion when you are done. Yes, there is a lot of luck, but it's a quick game so getting that negative score once in awhile doesn't make you want to kick puppies.

i gave both lost cities and voltage a 6. strictly as a game, lost cities is superior, but voltage has cool bits that look like candy and that feel really nice when you're flipping them over, as well as a look and theme that i like much better than lost cities. given the choice of playing either one, i think i'd choose voltage most of the time.

A bit like Knizia's Vampire, this isn't a board game and is more akin to Bridge or other classic social card game.  This time it's a 2-players game and it works very well.  Again, playable by literally everyone.  Theme is of no relevance what so ever.  Straight up replaced by Battle Line.

For a simple light weight game, it's OK. But I don't think I going to play that game many times in a row. It's a good filler. Unfortunately, the game box is too big for that kind of game. I printed my own 4 player set, using cards as the central board and it makes the game much more compact and easier to transport.

By thinking about it, again this game feels very mathematic with no feeling and experience. 

On my point of view there is no interest to discard non-dead card even if other people said there is sometime a strategy in doing it.

So either I don't grasp the strategy of the game or I don't want to start calculating how much point I am going to get.

Csak a netes változatával játszottam, de nem tudom elképzelni, hogy mitől lenne ez egy 7 pont feletti játék az átlag szerint. Oké, egyszerű, pillanatok alatt megtanulható, ez nyilván előny. De utána? Annyira mechanikus az egész! Szökőévente egyszer kerülök döntési helyzetbe, egyébként mindig egyértelműen adott, hogy mit érdemes cselekedni, és ezzel az a baj, hogy nem én irányítom a játékot, hanem az irányítja magát, felhasználva engem, mint sima laplerakó robotot. A játékosok sincsenek hatással egymásra, több játékonként jött csak elő egyszer, hogy érdemes volt felhúznom a másik által kidobott valamelyik lapot, vagy neki az enyémet. Ez így szinte nulla interakció, de nem ez a legfőbb baj a játékkal, hanem amit írtam: mindig könnyedén eldönthető, hogy melyik lapot érdemes lerakni, és így a játékos egyszerű statisztává degradálódik...

Update:
Adtam neki egy nagy esélyt: megvásároltam most, hogy leakciózták rendesen. És bejött! Furcsa, de most érzek igazi döntési helyzetet szinte minden játék alatt, sőt, elég sokszor, már-már folyamatosan, de amikor meg úgy jön ki, hogy egyértelmű mit kell raknom (mert mondjuk van valamelyik színből 7-8-9-10-esem, és sorban rakhatom le őket), az meg szimplán jó érzés, hogy összejött a dolog. Szóval nekem most nagyon bejön ez a játék, határozottan szívesen játszom vele, alig várom, hogy mikor vesszük elő ismét!

This is a relatively light card game that requires a bit of decision making and a bit of luck in order to win.  I have introduced it successfully to nongaming friends at work over lunch and everyone seems to enjoy it(although some of them prefer Battle Line). UPDATE:  The cards are wearing out from overuse -- a sign of an excellent game.  I also now see the game as deeper than I had first supposed.

First, I should say I have a bias against these types of games:  I just don't believe in fobbing off a re-themed poker deck as a proprietary game.  You could easily play this with a standard 52-card pack, since I don't believe a fifth suit adds much to this.

But what of "aesthetics"?  Well, I don't much care to look at the same 5 drawings shifted slightly to the right 9 different times.  And actually, the large size of the cards makes them hard to shuffle and annoying.

As for the game itself, well, let's just say it doesn't make my face go flush with excitement.  It plays a bit like gin.  Hardly any player interaction, the charge of "two-handed solitaire" is not far off.

A quick, fun and luck-of-the-draw based card game about exploration. The game comes with discard pile board and a pile of cards in five colors. Your job is to make expeditions that are more "profitable" than your opponents. Usually you play three rounds and who has more points at the end wins. The game is very easy to learn, and has depth to it even though it relies on luck to an extent.

Another very tense Knizia game for two players. The role of luck is significant in Lost cities and you'll need to fight very hard to manage your hand and not give any points to your opponent. Most of all, you absolutely need to avoid taking any negative points by not putting any color down before you are confident you can break the 20 points barrier. Although the theme feels a little bit contrived, the cards are beautiful and more than justify it.

A great intro game - heck, it's nothing that couldn't be created at home; but it's the first game to teach people to introduce them to the hobby. Initially, they just think you're throwing down cards, etc., but then, the strategy sinks in, and they see how they can manipulate the discard piles...

I really like this game of hard choices.  The "play and then draw" feature really annoys me because I often seem to draw something that would have solved my agonized decision on the last play.

After playing Lost Cities for the first time, I was unimpressed. Where was the game? Thinking I had missed something I headed online and came across BGG where I found two things. First, I found we had missed a rule where the players could pick up each other's discards. This was HUGE! It meant that the players could delay or speed up the endgame.

The second thing was BGG itself. I've probably spent too much time here over the last few years, but it has been worth it!

RATING: 8
This is one of the premier couples games.  We've had sort of a love-hate relationship with this game.  At first, it was a hit and we played it over and over again.  However, the addiction slowly went away and we became very burned out on it as it became almost "solved"---we were starting to play it just on autopilot, with no meaningful decisions anymore.  It stayed on the shelf for a long time.  We recently tried it out again and remembered why we liked it in the first place.  I think the time away made us shake up our gameplay and make it fresh again. It's now become our "aiport" game---a good, small and portable game that we can take out at a stressful place like the airport.

[GAMEID=50] has simple, but not necessarily obvious decisions, and coupled with its short length makes it easy to get addicted to.  It's a tight game and you have to constantly be mindful of what your opponent is doing---ultimately, you have to either keep a card for yourself or give it to your opponent.  It also taps into the risk management/gambling portion of the brain---can I afford to discard or play this card now?  Or can I afford to wait?  You can also control the game tempo by drawing from the discard or draw piles, which is a unique aspect compared to most card games.  It probably has one of the highest enjoyment to complexity ratio of almost any game we've played.  The fact that you could play it with a standard deck of cards gives it an almost classic feel, although the oversized cards and nice artwork of the real game make it worth it for us.

RATING: 6
For me this game is a classic 'Emperors New Clothes' game.  The positives are that the designer Knizia once again gives the game enough material so it doesn't completely embarrass itself in public. However, for me what there is is still unappealing to the eye.  Where there is strategy it is all too apparent after the first few games leading to many subsequent games feeling the same.  Furthermore, it appears to me as a game where the 2 player Kosmos brand came first (which is the only reason I can explain the presence of the board - to justify the box size -and the price of the game).

Knizia is a prolific game designer I admire so much however I cant like all his games.  As a mathmatician this game would be a useful tool to teach kids the basics of math.  Frustrating thing is my brother and his girlfriend love this game ... argghh, cant anyone see there is nothing there.

Try Shotten Totten as an alternative to Lost Cities and never go back.

I like the simplicity of the structure of this game. My main beef with it is that it's so easy to get lost in one's own strategy that any interaction with your partner is often almost nil. It feels a little like playing two games of solitaire opposite one another, though there is an element of hand management involving keeping certain cards in your hand that you know would benefit your opponent if discarded. A pretty solid, quick two-player game that we play every now and then (and I almost always win!)

RATING: 6
Gives a similar feel to Battleline in that both are clever, elegant, basically themeless 2 player games and you have to watch what your opponent plays carefully in your hand management schemes, holding on to cards your opponent needs just long enough so they mess up their tableau, whilst sometimes wanting to skip your own turn to prevent playing a card that opens up non detrimental card plays for your opponent. While I might have some bias towards this over Battleline because I seem to understand how to play it better, some aspects I like over Battleline are the card counting is much more transparent since each color will be in a single column/pile, there's a bit of a risk aspect with the multiplier cards, and I prefer the interaction of hate drafting my moment/stealing their discarded cards over the I play a better set than you that is in Battleline. It doesn't have the special cards that Battleline has, butthose cards always felt a little too tacked on for my taste.

EDIT: I haven't gotten a chance to play this again, but for thought I'd comment why I like it more than Arboretum. I much prefer hate drafting in a 2 player game than with more, and Arboretum seems geared best for 4 players. Lost Cities also while having a strong memory aspect doesn't seem as dependent as Aroboretum, where you can go all or nothing if you play too many cards of a color instead of holding them into your hand. Finally, the hand management and needing to hold on to certain cards in Lost Cities has more of an ebb and flow in it, as in once your opponent plays e.g. a 6 blue you no longer have to hold onto 5 blue or below, whereas Arboretum it feels more like you are in a straitjacket the whole game holding onto cards to score/deny opponents from scoring.

RATING: 9.5
Well, this one turned out fantastic!  My friends and I really like it.  Easy to teach, considerable strategy element.  Risk-taking mechanisms.  Play can be frustrating because you'll be put in situations where it's hard to not make a "bad" move, so you're always seeking the greater good -- but, that's a good kind of frustrating.  It's been a blast.  Definitely plays up the difference between a "two player game" and a "game that can be played with two people."

The cards are of a similar finish to Magic cards or Citadels cards, so they start to get the white nicks all around the edge, because you shuffle them a lot.  And, since they're oddly sized (large), protectors would be tough to come by.

Game play can be as short or long as you want, which is nice.

One night my husband mentioned how he wanted to play a card game....but not necessarily rummy or euchre which was more typical for us.  Since having kids we really  stopped playing games completely so this immediately sounded like a great idea!  We looked around and found a deck of cards which turned out not to be complete so we didn't get to play anything that night.  Later on I got online and looked for a quick card game on Amazon that wasn't played with a deck of cards and this is what I came up with.  The reviews were fantastic so I bought it and since then have never looked back to typical style card or board games.  My husband and I love this game and still play it almost a year later.  This is a fantastic quick playing card game that has great card art and is quite addictive.

I have to rate this a 9 because it is the only game my non-gamer wife will ask to play. 
While some do not see a theme here, I think it works. Of course I don't actually feel like I'm going on expeditions but if I were, I wouldn't go backwards. The theme works with the mechanics. 
A simple game with a nice combination of push your luck with a little bit of skill.

I don't understand the detractors.  This is a simple design with handsome production values... what's not to like?  It's 10 minutes long, and yet every game has 2-3 moments when I genuinely agonize over what to do... again, what's not to like?

RATING: 8
Just a really good two player card game.  The ratio of known and unknown information is pretty perfect and every move you make will affect the other person's game plan.  They say perfection is reached not when there is nothing else to add, but when there is nothing you can take away.  Lost Cities fits this catergory pretty well.  May have been rated higher if I didn't prefer Battleline so  much more.

Lost Cities: The Board Game is a far superior game. Strategy in this game involves, where possible, withholding cards the opponent needs, limiting expeditions to those one is confident of turning profitable, and only playing the handshake cards when you have a certainty of turning profitable. Unfortunately, there's a lot of guesswork and luck, and the game is short enough that there's little opportunity to mitigate the luck.

I would almost always choose to play Jaipur over this, which is another 2-player card game with similar feel and play time, but overall better execution.

For the first time I found a game that my girlfriend plays with pleasure!!! This already deserves a 10 to the game! The systen is very easy and at the same time tricky. It's fast, very fun and simple. This game has nothing to do with money or with power or with the war. There are only the cards and a small board (nothing else!). This is a good recipe for games that I can involve my girlfriend with!!!   I found here on BGG many players that said "it's a game for your spouse" and this is why I bought! It's exactly and amazingly so!!! Thanks and enjoy.

Another great game from Knizia. Similar in some ways to Battle Line - managing multiple "battles" simultaneously. Not quite as addictive as that game, but very enjoyable just the same. I love trying to figure out when best to start an expedition - do you wait for bonus cards or just plunge in. The "cost" of starting an expedition really flavors your decisions. It's also fun to suddenly dig into a discard pile and start a new expedition that your opponent thought would never happen. My only complaint is that it is pretty tedious to score.

RATING: 6
While I do enjoy this game, I think it just isn't the sort of game that is made for me.  For one thing, the "theme" is nonexistent.  At no point do you ever really feel like you're on an "expedition" as much as you're counting up numbers.  In other words, this is a quite literally a card game, and could be played with only slight modification to a standard deck of cards.  So, on the downside, I've always hated card games.  On the plus side, this is the best card game I've ever played and if there isn't anything better around you could talk me into a game and we'd have fun.

Decent 2 player game - where you have 5 colors with cards numbered 1-10 and you decide to place or pass.  If you place a color, you stack the cards in order from 1-10 betting that you'll be able to get cards that total more than 20 (over that and you gain points, less than that and you lose points).  The fun is in balancing what cards you keep in hand, deciding if you can hold off and wait to play a high card later, or keeping it in your hand to avoid your opponents from getting it.

Another Knizia game that is excrutiatingly overrated. A simple math game that is determined by and large by randomness and the game is easily broken down in 1 game, such that subsequent games are dictated purely by randomness. The board in the middle is pointless, this game could essentially be played with a normal deck of cards.

My wife and I bought this on the recommendation of a game store owner.  He told us that everyone who buys it, likes it.  That's certainly true for my wife and me, and I don't usually like card games.  She beats me about 75% of the time.  I suspect that the other times, she's just being nice.

RATING: 8
A great couple's game. Simple rules. Non-aggressive. Can be played lightly, but affords opportunity for serious tactics. 

Like other Knizia games, Lost Cities reveals its charms slowly. At first, it seems too simple, too mathy. It's just putting cards in order, right? Then you get to the end of the deck and you haven't played the cards you wanted, needed to play. You curse yourself and the game and deal the cards again. Before long, you're learning when to risk and getting hooked on the payoff.

Even after you get tired of Lost Cities, you'll come back to it. It's just so simple, just so easy to jump into again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a fun little thinker, watching your opponents played cards and considering the likelihood of other cards coming up before you start expeditions.  If you're looking to add a fun little 2-player game to your collection, this is a good one.  Once you learn it, you can see how you can play with face cards if you cut down the expeditions (suits) from 5 to 4.

This game was not an instant classic for me. However, after a few games and varying opponents, this one is now in my "go to" list. The game does have a 'luck' factor (it's a card game afterall) and a competive solitaire feel, but there are so many positives with the risk/reward scoring mechanism. I have also found this game great with teaching number sense for the younger players out there. Reiner hit the mark with this one.

One of the first games I got from reading the geek.  Good choice for us.  We played the heck out of it until we started adding so many other new games to our library.  We go back to it often when we need a short, light game.  There are lots of criticisms about this one but it fills a niche for us.  

Seems like a lot of people don't get the scoring on this but I'm not sure why.  Seems simple to us but maybe they just need to play with someone who 'gets' it.  That's how I feel about Court of the Medici.  I would love to play that with someone who 'gets' it since we sure don't!

I bought this game because I liked the theme. Be forewarned that the theme is only skin-deep. It's an abstract game at heart that could take on almost any theme. And I'm not very impressed by the vague artwork.
But a pretty good abstract strategy game it is, if you like things simple and fast. I used to play this a lot with my former girlfriend, who really enjoyed it.

Great filler game to play when waiting for other people to show up.  My only complaint is that it seems a bit overproduced as it could have done without the board and more traditional sized cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think strategic element of this game is overvalued. There is agonies here, but no real decision. This agonies make some illusion of strategy, but in fact whether your plan succeed or fail is almost entirely depending on your luck of draw. E.g., throwing away blue 2 and 6 would be good or bad? Bad if you get blue 8 and 9 later and good if you don't. And it is just a matter of luck.

Above said, I don't mind playing this 'cause it is very short and light.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Super simple game that just has this unnecessarily complex scoring system. When I played this with my SO we ended up counting the number of expeditions we win and who won the most, won the game. It's way better to count that way instead of the pen and paper, because I'm not a number autist who remembers them. A gateway game; sure. Pass the time while drinking coffee in the morning; maybe. Playing against other hobbyists; even Zombie Dice is better.

Classic 2-person Reiner Knizia, 5-suited card game.
After a few plays, you can play quickly (part of the fun is snapping down the large cards)...for a few turns, but then you get hung up in an agonizing decision and must risk giving points to your opponent.  This tension is part of the greatness of the game.  I recommend a scoring aid, in fact the game should have come with a pad and pencil.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable, quick 2-Player game.  Very tactical gameplay, you are forced to adjust after every hand and must keep an eye on your opponent at all times. Scores can vary widely from round to round, so playing 3 rounds and totalling the scores is often a good idea. Another plus is its portability.

Lost Cities lives up to the hype. Classic Knizia minimalism and brutal, yet beautiful, math married to a fun theme and gorgeous components. I can see why some might call this game over-produced: It doesn't NEED a board, nor oversized cards, nor different artwork on every card.

...But man does it benefit from all of the above! The strategy, tactics, and subtleties here would make it a great game as just a pack of cards, but the extra mile makes it something special.

Fun, quick, and makes me want to come back for more.

Really solid game. My wife and I really enjoy it. The only problem I have is that the game feels too tense in the beginning. It's a weird problem to have, but I get the feeling every time I play. I feel like I have too much to do at the beginning, and not enough information to know how to do it. Like my success in the game is determined too much by the cards I randomly draw. It's a weird feeling, how it's really tense in the beginning, but lessens as the game goes on, and you know more information about the game state.

Fun game, although my wife absolutely hates it (I always win). It's probably my favorite game on the iPhone (not iPad) because it is so quick and easy, while still offering some push your luck strategy. I do own a cardboard version as well. Keltis is superior to Lost Cities IMO, but I am certainly in the minority in this belief. Perhaps Keltis has not received comparable exposure? Nevertheless, Lost Cities is a wonderful little filler, fully deserving of its reputation.

Marian and I were looking for a good 2-player game, and I think we found it.  The first few matches involved us learning the game, but they went quickly so it was easy to get a gauge.  With 8 cards in your hand, you wouldn't think that choosing to discard one would be as nerve-racking as it is!

Great game, but not one you can repeatedly play; I break it out every few weeks to play a match against someone (not usually the same person in a row).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Shallow, but ultimately entertaining and addictive push-your-luck card game. As is usual with Knizia there's a wider range of elements in this game than may first appear, but it's still very lightweight and luck of the draw is a very significant factor. As is usual with Knizia the scoring system is a bit fiddly - enough so that I'd imagine its not *quite* the perfect spouse game it's made out to be (I would rate Battle Line as being a better candidate)!

I really enjoy the strategy for this game, and it's a lot of fun. Still, it helps to think of it as a deluxe version of a game you would play with a normal deck instead of a stand alone card game.

Edit 8/7/11: Traded for Memoir 44 expansion. My wife didn't like the scoring. I will try Battle Line instead.

It's all about the 8s, 9s and 10s. I can see this game getting a lot of praise when it first came out (1999), but today there are plenty of better options if you're looking for an exclusively 2 player game. Still enjoyable, though. Scoring system is what makes it interesting enough.

RATING: 7
Fun, but the math at the end of each round can get a little tedious...  

Does play well and quick, though.  Demoted after playing Jaipur.  Still a good game, but the aggravation of counting up points at the end can be a nuisance sometimes.

Some highlights of other commentors:
Easy to play
Quick game
Skill required, but doesn’t have to be a brain cruncher
High replayability
Tension over when to hold ‘em, when to discard ‘em
A bit of luck involved (sometimes too much)
Theme is thin

My thoughts:
Agree with all above, and in addition: 
I find really no theme
I found the cards to be physically too large (though great artwork)
Too much luck on opening hand

For new players I would suggest playing 3 hands immediately, without thinking. You really need to get a feel for when the game ends. That’s really the key – how many cards you will really ever play, the average numbers, the average total in a suit, and average suits to even try. From that you see how the card counting comes into play, when/how to discard, and finally the usefulness of the multiplier cards. 

Though I believe opening hands can dominate, I think the 3 rounds per game helps balance that out. 

All in all a fun game, and probably the best 2 player game because the variation each hand is great, it’s not a backstabber, and with a high luck factor sheer brilliance will not dominate. But I guess the same could be said for Yahtzee actually. Definitely high on the spouse game listings.

This family game for 2 is a good abstract to play with newbies in the hobby. I see too much luck to like this game a lot, but I need to play it more to be sure of my feelings about it. The scoring system is tough but different and kind of thematic.

I've played Lost cities today and I felt more control than last time playing it, and can be played really quickly so I'm rating this game as a 6, an OK game overall I'm open to sell or trade. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Leisurely 2p game.  Difficult decisions mostly come early in the game when deciding which cities to pursue, but once that's over the game is almost (almost!) on auto-pilot.  Nice as a warm-up or wind-down game, but definitely not meat and potatoes stuff.

Initially, both my wife and I found this game rather dull. It seemed like multiplayer solitaire. However, after playing with a friend I realised how this game is meant to be played. It's a fast-paced game of hand management. At every turn you have to make a decision about which card you play or discard and which ones you hold onto. Once the other player thinks along the same lines, the game becomes very interesting.

Easy to teach, classic two player card/adventure game. I did horribly my first play throughs, because I confused my strategy and ended up doing too much. Even though I lost pathetically still fun.

But, it is easy to teach anyone that is has played set-collecting card games, has beautiful cards, and is nicely low-conflict.

Played on IOS first and I thought we would like it more as a quick filler. It was just okay. One of those games which profit from the app taking care of the accounting / end game scoring. Board doesn't lay flat on the table and cards are seriously oversized.

Edit 01-15: A game I would not buy again, tbh. We rarely get the itch for fillers, and if, we'd rather bring out Splendor or Carc: The castle. Lowered from 7 to 6.5.

It's Solitaire...for two.  No, really.  the game is literally Solitaire.  That's it.

Honestly...I was disappointed. It didn't seem like a game from Reiner Knizia. It seemed more like a 'print and play' free game from Cheapass Games for use with a couple of regular card decks.  I actually felt ripped off for purchasing it.

It might be a good 'go camping' game to go along with Rummikub, or something, but as far as a game night, I think it's staying on the shelf.  The game just isn't that exciting.  I truly have a hard time understanding why players rate it so high.

Bought 11/08/99. 
A very good entry level game to the world of German type games. Especially good for those that don't like direct confrontation (in other words - most women). However for that same reason its a bit bland to those that prefer some nastiness and/or are very experienced Euro gamers. That's me. So its gotten few plays in the last eight years. But I played the hell out if it from 2000 through 2006.

Mathy game for the wife and me....too mathy for one....not heavy enough for the other.  Good game but not loved enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a very simple card game. It's a better game toward the end where you can be faced with some tough choices, but the beginning can be hampered by the first deal. It feels limited, then opens up as cards come into play... and the deck always seems to run out just before you've played that vital 10. 

The theme is quite fun, but it could be anything, really. In fact, if you had a 6-suit card deck, you could drop one deck, lose the aces and use the face cards as handshake/deal cards and have the same game. Like all the Knizia's I've played, the theme seems an afterthought.
 
A good game, but not great.

Initially this game's biggest attraction was that magical combination of reasonably good fun with price, accessibility, and speed of play. As my wife and I play this one more, however, I am enjoying the way the simplicity of the game allows us to bluff and subsequently trap one another by discarding non-intuitive cards. Adding this bluffing has created a tension between being aggressive vs overly cautious as the other player can lure, confuse, and ultimately trap the other at the end of the deck. She keeps telling me that none of that exists... but could that be metagame?  A great game, and I don't see either of us feeling like matches have become mindless or vanilla for some time.

Easy deck-building two-player card game that easily can be house-ruled adjusted to accommodate three players. Basically a normal card game with custom deck and could actually be played with normal card decks. Elegant rule twists in that (1) playing a colour commits to it in that all starts out at negative score witch must be overcome, and (2) players can play multiplier cards that incrementally increase the risk and reward potential before playing value cards. Good balance between luck and skill, but tending slightly toward luck. Good and quick card game for playing with less strategically inclined people, gamers or casual alike, or in relaxed and less invested situations.

Light, compact, and quick. A great card game with a nice exploration theme. At first this seems to be a vary solitary game; however, it is important to watch the cards that the other player has discarded or played so one can predict which expeditions will be worth investing in.

very easy to learn and played within minutes; perfect for takeaway and having some quick rounds no matter where you go;
much luck involved by card drawing, but still leaves enough space for tactical decisions, including subtle influence on opponents gameplan
(although most of the time you screw yourself over by being too greedy ;)
perfect amount of strategy to be interesting without stretching your brain and time - always good fun no matter how often played!

RATING: 7
The classic go-to two-player euro.  Very tense decision-making as you try to anticipate when you'll see the cards you desperately need and what cards to sacrifice to keep your opponent from scoring huge points.  Can be a bit confrontational when your opponent finally gives up on waiting for a certain card, then you discard it on the next turn, thrilled to not have to keep it from them anymore.

For such a light easy game, this ends up being a nerve wracker. A simple game of playing cards in sequential order with the option of discard feels like playing 5 games of Racko at a time, that induces the good kind of nervous, nail biting anxiety, that only a few games can do.

Pretty fun. Just confrontational enough to make it exciting (especially at the end when strategies are realized and the cards start slappin') but not too dastardly.

Keeper: Very cool 1st game i bougth, played with the misses, and my mates has and a ddictive quality that makes you want to play 6 round in a row, good filler game for 30 mins, little expenzive for a pack of cards! edit upped score as keep coming back to this!

RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Choose to invest, starting out in the negative, in some of five different areas and then try to earn more points then your opponent by doing a better job of making up those points by playing numbered cards in your investments.

Played as: 2 player.

Pros: A much welcomed change of pace from the more traditional rummy style card games that dominate the casual market. Interactive in a non cut-throat way. Easy to learn and plays fast enough that you can lose count of how many times played. Takes almost no effort to find a partner to play a couple quick hands.

Cons: There's no beating bad luck, though it's a minor complaint given games short length (It's wearing more as time goes on). In addition to being easy to find an opponent, it's also easy to burn out on this game when it gets requested a lot.

Other: This is a good game, but a word of advice: play in moderation.  Most likely you'll be playing this game a lot so try and stretch out time between plays in order to keep it fresh. It's one of the last games I'd like to play at the moment due to burn-out.

Best Use: Two-player gateway-game or time killer with the casual types.

RATING: 8
A simple yet fun game. I feel there is a lot of tension in trying to decide what cards your opponent has and what risk there is in attempting a specific expedition. I could see this game getting a limited number of plays though just because it's still just a filler and there really isn't a lot of variability, though the manipulation of your opponent and attempting to predict them I feel makes up for this.

RATING: 5
After ~20 plays.  Not much love here.  I respect it for the fact that there is a real psychological game that emerges: you can manipulate your oponent by playing discards that lead him to incorrect inferences about what you are trying to do with your cards, and about what he can do with his.  To be really good you can't just compute probabilities.  Still, respect isn't the same thing as affection, which is maybe odd because I love psychological games.  Perhaps it's because this suffers because this is a similar kind of psychological game that lord of the rings: the confrontation is.  The latter is one of my favorite games and infinitely richer than lost cities, so I have little reason to bother with lostcities.

RATING: 5
A fun, light diversion, that I've burnt out on due to games with more depth over the same playing time being available. My biggest nuisance is actually not its lightness, but the fact that for a single match, you need to fully shuffle the cards THREE times - and you need to do this thoroughly, since otherwise the card draws get messed up. The shuffling takes almost as much time as playing the session-part, and it annoys the hell out of me.

As a two player game it just doesn't grab me. I suppose the fact that you don't really interact with the other player - other than to see if you get a higher score. It's a short little time waster, in that view it's not terrible, but I wouldn't get it out as a main game.

A mi novia le ha encantado. Ya había leído en más de una ocasión que es un juego perfecto para jugar con tu pareja y que, incluso, ellas muestran más interés por este juego que por muchos otros. Pero ya lo puedo confirmar. Un juego sencillo, rápido y con un poco de estrategia, aunque no mucha la verdad. El factor suerte puede influir un poc. Se puede "putear" muy poco al contrario, aunque con muchas limitaciones. Lo que menos me gusta del juego es tener que calcular las puntuaciones de cada expedición. Requiere papel y boli o, en su defecto, calculadora. :-)

Not a bad game and definitely takes a few games to get the strategy down, but there's just not enough to it and not enough player interaction (it mostly comes from sharing the deck and being able to draw from the discards).
I think Odin's Ravens is much better light two player game.

RATING: 8
I'm in the camp that believes there is some strategy and depth to this game. I don't mind the luck that is inherent in drawing cards. That's what creates the tension: Am I going to draw those expedition cards that will get me out of the hole? It just isn't for some people.

I love the elegant simplicity of this game. Very simple rules and some tough, tough choices. I prefer playing sets of 3 games (as suggested by Knizia), winner being the one with the most points. 
I am addicted to this game. Even when I forget about it for a few weeks, I begin to crave it very soon. I get my dose at happymeeple.com, but yourturnmyturn.com is also fine. :) 

P.S. I HATE it when some people compare this game to Keltis or Lost Cities: The Board Game. These 2 don't have nearly as much tension as Lost Cities and the luck factor is much higher.

Loved it and played it many times until it became some kind of automatic response so stopped.Since replaced in my affections by Lost Cities The Board Game which can also be played with 2 and is much better than the card game as it has more variety in the setup and better replayability. Slightly more meaty. Haven't tried the ascending/descending variant yet.

                                                   subtle and powerful. Plus, the card art is beautiful.

Tension is Lost Cities' strong suit, and it delivers in spades. But, more often than not, rather than deriving from having to decide between two or three things you really want to do, the tension comes from having to decide between things you really [i]don't[/i] want to do. Which is decidedly less fun. So while I'll still play, I do grow weary of Lost Cities from time to time. Not to mention the premise that it's appeal is somehow tied to which chromosomes you have.

[gameid=372]/Battle Line is better in the same arena. But heck, why not just play [gameid=28143]?

I played this while at a game store waiting for some games to finish up.  The owner of the store taught my sister and I how to play.  We both quickly picked up the game and we were flying through by our third play.  The only real strategy in this game is to make sure not to discard a card your opponent needs, and that is usually pretty easy to do.  After that it is all luck of the draw.

The point to this game is that there are several lost cities you are trying to find.  You don't have to go in search of all of them, but you want to make sure you can get down the path quite a ways before the end because there are costs to starting the expedition.  Playing your cards in the different colors is how you move closer to the lost city.  Each card you play must be equal to, or higher, than the previous card in that color.  The scoring is hard to remember, especially so many years after playing, but the first few cards leave you with negative points, but after going far enough you start making positive points.

This game just has too much luck, and really little to no thought involved.  I have heard this game touted as a game even your girlfriend will play, in my book that is just another way to say this game is so simple that it isn't worth your time.

Another favorite for myself and my SO to play together. It's only a 2 player game, and it's very simple (in fact, all you need is a 5-suited deck and you'd have all the necessary components for the game). However, the art is great on the cards, and for my SO it makes up a good deal of the game for her.

Very fast playing game of risk management. I didn't see the interaction that was promised. Players establish what they are looking for early on and with a large hand size, it's usually easy to avoid discarding what they want, so the game devolves into fishing through the deck to find what you want before the game ends. Not unenjoyable, but not terribly engaging either.

Es increíble como un juego que parece tan sencillo puede dar tantas horas de diversión. Es uno de los juegos con los que nos iniciamos mi pareja y yo y aún a día de hoy cae alguna partida. Es imposible echar una sola partida, el factor pique es muy alto y aunque parezca fácil siempre te faltan turnos para completar tus jugadas, hay que andar espabilado y tener en cuenta bastantes cosas para ganar.

Yes, it's like playing solitaire.  Yes, you could (almost) play it with a normal pack of cards.  But it's good.  When it's just the two of us, we (nearly) always start with this one, and from then on it's 'loser's choice'
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably one of my favorite quick 2-player games of all time. There is light-strategy to the game, as well as a lot of risk and luck.

It's fairly straight-forward in terms of rules. Both players start with 8 cards. In the middle of each player is a board with 5 different expeditions they can go on. You can only play a 'Handshake' card at the start of an expedition, hence the risk. The reward and luck to the 'Handshake' cards comes in the fact that they multiply the points received each time (eg. 1 'Handshake' = 2x total score, 2 'Handshake' cards = 3x total score, etc.).

The players play 'against' each other, but on separate sides of the board. You then can only play a higher number than the card played before, so if you play a "5", you cannot place a "4" or less on top of it.

Each expedition costs 20 to go on, so you are automatically -20 in the hole. Therefore, you want to try to at least score 20 on each expedition to break even, with the hopes of scoring more.

I recommend to the boyfriends/girlfriends and spouses out there. An easy game to pick up, and a lot of fun to play.

Part of the far-reaching "Great Knizia Purge of 2014," this felt less like a purge and more of an exorcism for my collection.  I had long kept it in the hopes that it would grow on me but even as a solo game (where I had no one to blame for my rotten card-drawing luck) I still could not contain my disdain for this title.  Good riddance.

My favorite lightweight game, gets played more than anything else at our house.  Maybe too easy to settle into a basic strategy, but I'll still violate my cardinal rule (never start five expeditions!) every once in awhile ... & live to regret it.  Connection to theme nonexistent - it's a card game, that's all

RATING: 8
Good combination of strategy (which colors to play, where to draw cards from), luck (which cards are dealt to you), and player interaction (which cards to discard, as your opponent can pick up cards you discard).  This has the possibility for lots of thought to go into each move, with much strategy, yet the options are not overwhelming.  Almost all the information you need is visible in front of you at all times, and thus even though this is a card-based game there is virtually no card counting required (yay!).   This seems like this should have great replayability, especially given how relatively quick it is.

There is a tension in this game which I really like. Do I start laying down cards now or do I wait some more in the hope I get the cards I need? It is very hard to play an optimal game because of the random card draw. This make the game fun and fresh every time. It is quick, had a nice flow and I keep coming back to it. One of the best 2 player games in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I had my doubts about this game at first but it was all erased after we played it. Beautiful looking cards and simple yet strategic game play. Players head up expeditions to one of the five areas on the board. Numbered cards represent progress into a certain area. Typical with Reiner Knizia, there’s a little calculation and complication involved in the end scoring. A great 2 player game that can be expanded to 4 with 2 sets.

There are a number of other card games for 2 players that I would recommend much more than this one. Extremely simple with luck of the draw being the biggest factor in the game.

The theme of lost cities and exploration is nothing but window dressing for what is really just a numbers based card game. I recommend playing cribbage instead. Much better if you like abstract card games.

Rating changed on 12/27/17, from 7.2 to 9.0

This is a game which I've given out multiple times as a wedding gift to gaming couples (or aspiring gaming couples) - but one which I thoroughly enjoy myself. Competing archaeologists, a la Indiana Jones, racing to collect the most points for each of 4 colors/dig sites. Forcing each player to decide what to hold and what to play, because cards must be played in ascending order.

But the game activates the gambler gene in all of us, because the card's numbers are its point value... AND it costs 20 points to start a dig... AND one can drop between 0-3 multiplier cards (for x2 points each) prior to any points... so a game can be anywhere from -40 points up to 90-some points. A gamble too far is still in good faith, right....?

After many plays, I think this one's lost its luster. It's just uninspiring. Sure it's a strategic card game, but now our games of it lack any essential tension of struggle - it's as if we know the game too well, and so our actions come tacitly, without real thought, and luck rather than skill becomes the determinant factor. Thus, when the wife suggests a game of it, I won't say no, but inwardly the gaming experience just feels "meh."

RATING: 7.5
A very enjoyable game, but my early impressions were that this game just has too much luck in it for my tastes. This feeling seems to be confirmed after viewing the results of thousands of games, courtesy of www.flexgames.com which includes an awesome online free version of the game. At flexgames, a chess-like ratings system is used, and the lack of a proper spread in the ratings, as can be found in the chess ratings, emphasizes how big a role luck plays in the game. Although, note that luck seems to be the key determinant only after you've developed the ability to avoid major errors in play.

Old collection

My favorite short 2-player game from one of our favorite game designers: Reiner Knizia. Easy rules, short playing time and although it has a big luck factor, as most card games do, it requires a lot of tactical decisions to be made because starting an expedition costs 20 minus points. Are you going to wait one more round or are you going to put your card in the middle, maybe helping your opponent, or are you going to start to explore anyway, knowing that you're next card drawn will be the card you needed but cannot play anymore now... so easy but so frustrating! A cool card game that we always take on holidays with us!

We also own Keltis, based on the same principle, but that is less forcing you to play your cards as Lost Cities does.

This is a delightful card game with pretty art. It's very addicting because it is not as sophisticated as other card games. Besides the art, the game doesn't have much to do with "lost cities."

For a simplistic quick two player this game has a very deep strategy that you can invest in and it will pay you back. Sure you can gloss over and say it's a game where you are just waiting for cards but if you do, you'll never win against someone who is putting thought into their strategy. Lastly, you are on a clock to execute your strategy because there's only so many cards in the deck. Plan all you want but you better be able to lay down all those juicy 9s and 10s that you're holding onto!

Lost Cities was one of my first purchases after getting back into the hobby in 2004.  My initial impression of it was very favorable and I used to rate it a 9.  Now, after playing many more games, I've downgraded it a bit.  It's still a very good game that will see play for years to come, but it's rarely my first choice anymore.  I can't see my score ever dropping further, though.

UPDATE:  Dropped the score again; I still like it, but there are so many other games I'd rather play.

RATING: 6
Ezer froncsira leakciózva újonnan, nyilván meg kell venni! Nagyjából Keltis kártyajáték szebb kivitelben, csak két játékosra. Ez még kockáztatósabb, nem csak a fogadáskártyák miatt (ami tetszik nagyon), hanem a lapok száma miatt is. A Keltis anno elsőre nagyobbat ütött (a közös dobópakli bejövős volt). A méretei miatt meg pont nem az a magammal vivős.

Lost Cities is a fun light two-player game.  Because it is a short game and not too complicated it is one game I can usually get my wife to play.  I think this is fairly universal and makes Lost Cities a favorite among significant others.  My only complaints are the games cost and the oversized cards.  There is no reason that this game couldn%u2019t have used a standard size cards and been sold for $10.  However, since it does get played quite often it is probably worth the price.

Fun game for 2.  The scoring can be a little math-intensive and slightly off-putting for non-gamers, but the basic strategy is easy enough for anyone to grasp.  However, there is enough strategy that it can remain engaging even for more seasoned gamers.

Perfect game for a lunchbreak or anytime you have a few minutes over. It´s very simple to learn and play, and very addictive.

When you have played a couple of 100-times the rating goes down to maybe a 5.

Can pretty easily be played with a regular deck, with some slight change of the rules: 4 colors instead of 5. Jack, Queen and King are the multipliers, ace is 1, the rest is what they are. ... There you go!

A highly rated game by many on the Geek and a favourite for many female gamers (based on threads here on the geek and my own experience).

Whilst the contest is good I don't feel there is enough player interaction. Players will often need to take chances on a colour based on the cards they hold. 

I liked it when I first found it but after 20+ plays I started to wonder and have now found much better card games that are more engaging like Battleline and other games in the Kosmos series.

Nice artwork.

I like LC. It is simple and interesting and is very easy to teach and learn which I'm sure is why it has garnered the reputation of being one of the best Euro gateway games. It's not a particularly deep game yet there is still enough to think about that it doesn't all come down to luck and the better player will usually win...the sign of a game that isn't totally luck dominated. Replayability is good as the length of the game isn't severe and encourages rematches. I'd class this game as a great game to own for those wanting light filler style games and games which take very little set up and break down time. A good travel game as well.

Lost Cities is a Knizian 2 player card game quite similar to Battle Line. Play cards of different colors with values between 2 and 10 to different tracks, always of higher values and with the option to double the bet that the total value will exceed 20. An extra dimension is the discard pile, where cards discarded by you may be taken by your opponent. I still prefer Battle Line's tense fight for flags but I understand Lost Cities' appeal to many 2 player gamers.

RATING: 8
I like the fast pace of play.  I enjoy the 'Damn!' moments where you play your red 6 on your red 3, only to draw the red 5.  Sure, it's luck, but there's a degree of strategy.  I see definite trends over dozens of plays based on aggressive (me) versus conservative (my girlfriend) styles.  I'm more likely to end with a negative score one or more colors, but because I tend to pursue as many as 4 colors, I often end up winning anyway.  I see giving up cards and giving points to your opponent as often worse than using them yourself and potentially losing points on a color.

I tend to play this in 3 hand sets, with the points total of the 3 hands determining the winner.  This evens out some luck fluctuations, and adds new strategic elements.  For example, if you're 30 points down leading into the 3rd hand, you have a strong incentive to play aggressively to try to make up the difference, while your opponent may tend to play more conservatively to get just enough points to stay on top.

The funny thing about Lost Cities is that I played it incorrectly for so long.  We never knew that you could pick up the cards that have been discarded, which is obviously a big oversight.  Since we've been playing correctly, I definitely like the game more.  It has some tough decisions, and the games always seem close.

I have grown tired of Lost Cities, though.  The game is very simple, and even though it doesn't take long to play, I find myself getting bored by the end of the 3rd round.  This is likely from having played a lot, but it nonetheless means I don't play as often, and that I don't rate the game as highly.  A good, light game, but there are other light two player experiences that I prefer.

This does not mean that it is a light game on strategy however. There is plenty of interaction between what you play out and what the other player has. I see this one being a staple of my game nights for a long time to come.

Reminds me of Rummy.  The basic strategy it seems is to hold onto your good "expeditions" as long as possible, hoping to pick up stuff that your opponent discards.  Focus on two or three expeditions, while trying to hoard cards that your opponent needs to develop their expeditions.

RATING: 8
Play cards in numerical order to start expeditions. The longer the expedition, the more points. Great 2 player game from Knizia. Tense decisions on whether to start playing cards to an area, attempt to double the value of an area, or discard a card that your opponent could potentially use. Simple rules, but many decisions.

I like games that make you think about the positives and negatives of each play. This one does this.  It's a simple game, a couple rules to remember, and you are off. Downsides: scoring system is a bit too much and took away from the flow of the game; no interaction between players.

A durable classic that has more than earned its place at the top of the two-player pile. It's one of Knizia's most devious designs, forcing players to often make the least painful choice among many bad ones. Not nearly as luck dependent as it might seem.

I prefer a BobSponge deck.

El juego es OK, como un cinquillo, como un chinchón, como un tute. Sólo tiene una opción más que es dejar cartas en la mesa para luego cojerlas tú o tu competidor.

There are moments in Lost Cities where you are holding out to get that ONE card you need. After what seems like days you determine that your opponent must have that 6 you need. You play your 7 down only to find the next card you draw is a 6. Raaaargh! 

This is usually when I headbutt the person across from me and set fire to the game.

That being said this is a great filler that I can play with my wife. I can never seem to beat her which is why I think I like it as much as I do.

A fun, 2-player game.  It includes a little bit of luck, along with some tough (but ultimately fun) decisions about which cards to draw and discard.  It's not for everyone - I've played with people who enjoyed it and wanted to play again, and others who didn't get into it.

For the kind of game it is, this is really just about perfect.  I guess it might be a little chancy for some tastes, but to me, that's just part of the gambles you are always weighing in this game.  When you first read the rules, it sounds like two players playing solitaire, but once you play a hand or two, you see the really rich interaction between the players.  *Great* game for seducing non-gamers or light gamers into a serious game.  My wife loves playing this one.

A very nice 2 player game.  Not too taxing or decision-heavy, and generally well-received by non-gamers, spouses, and the like.  A good introduction to German games (or Euro games, as some call them).  A little too luck-heavy to get a higher rating, but a nice way to spend some time with a buddy, especially while deciding what other game to play.  Also a very nice non-confrontational game for playing with the spouse.

12-10-07: Lost Cities has stood the test of time and is still a great game to play after all these years. I'm less rabid about some of my other (newer) games and still love to play Lost Cities (maybe more than ever). Therefore, it moves from an 8 to a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The theme doesn't matter one bit in this game (although the sequential artwork is beautiful). What makes this game fun is the card allocation and scoring. You really have to monitor what your opponent is doing and make selective choices about which card sequences to go for and which cards to discard. The possibility of scoring negative points in this game is a brilliant way to force players to think strategically about their card choices. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
This is a very nice, quick, two player game that works well as a filler.  You could almost play this with a standard deck of cards, but you would need a fifth suit and some additional aces.  I like that there is suspense that builds to the end of the game.  The competition between the players is subtle, but well done.  I really enjoy this one.

Lost Cities is a great little 2-player game, up until the math at the end. Nevertheless, a game can be rattled off in 10-12 minutes. Tension really ramps up as the deck dwindles while players race to get their expeditions into the black.

The game itself is a kind of 2-player rummy/solitaire variant with a pasted on archaeology theme. My girlfriend likes it enough to request games and I could see my parents liking it too.

I'm not a fan of Lost Cities' artwork. The pencil crayon style looks unfinished.

As with all fillers don't play too many consecutive games in a row, 3 is probably the sweet spot.

Quick fun 2 player game anyone can easily pick up and learn.  Some hard decisions to make because at times their is either a play it safe, or gamble move to decide on.

Much quicker than, but not as good as, Lost Cities the Board Game. Having the sum of the numbers played matter is an unfortunate twist -- a player can tie up a color just by having a monopoly on 8-9-10s. Whereas in the board game, it matters less what the exact distribution in a color is.

This game is simple, fast, and fun. Very good downtime game, especially when you don't want a game that is gonna make you think too much. The game is best if you don't agonize over your moves, because the cards will present you with many choices that you find unpalatable. There is a huge luck factor present, but there are also not a lot of deep strategies to get into so it's not often a frustrating game. It's very much what a light game should be. 

Edit: I feel exactly the same about this game as I did earlier. Nice to play to pass the time.

[b]Lost Cities[/b] was sold via auction 1/1/15 and again on 7/7/17.
Received in a math trade (8/8/14). 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I can appreciate the importance of Lost Cities when looking at all the card games that have been influenced by it's design. However I would much rather play Knizia's Battle Line, which I think is brilliant in its execution. 

If I am looking for a game that is in the same lineage as Lost Cities I'd choose Musée. Musee offers everything Lost Cities minus the wonky scoring and introduces a spacial aspect to the card play which adds more depth to the game but not complexity.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A great cafe game, small footprint (you don't need the board if you don't have room).
- Very easy to play/teach, but Mr. Knizia found a way to make it engaging.
- I like being able to change the tempo of the game based on whether you deplete the deck of cards or take a card from one of the piles of face up cards.
- The push your luck element: do you try to wait for one more handshake or do you start that third or even fourth expedition?
- While the scoring system seems wonky at first it makes the game. 

I prefer Knizia's Battle Line over this, but both will stay in my collection.[/i]

Among the greatest two-player game.  Although you are in direct competition, it is not an 'aggressive' playing game.  With a shared set of resources you are each attempting to gain the best final result.
Since it is played in several rounds (three is standard but I like to play five.  It seems better balanced) you accumulate a final score in successive plays.

I have only played this game a couple of times, but am eager to play it again.  The artwork is outstanding and charmingly evokes the turn-of-the-last-century archeology scene.  It's an easy game to learn how to play, and one that I was able to enjoy from the very start, without the usual "beginner's anxiety."

Update: I think now that I have played the game a few times and understand it better, it actually causes me more anxiety!  I still enjoy it, though, and look forward to the day when I will figure out a strategy for success. (5+5)

RATING: 8
I can see why this is popular with couples: it's a card game, the rules are easy to learn, play is quick and relatively short, there are choices to be made but not too many, and there are enough choices to make the game interesting. The game doesn't lend itself to being terribly competitive either, and because it's easy to learn, non-gamers might give this a look. As others note, it's very addictive. Once people get the hang of it, the game plays fast. Playing 3 games for a complete set is a good idea. I've played it with my sister and wife, who both like it. Maybe the coolest thing about this game is the artwork, namely, that if you lay out the cards in each color you'll notice that each successive card extends the story of an expedition...amazing. People who aren't very competitive may be somewhat put off by this, however. Purchased my copy in Boulder, Colo., while on vacation.

I broke down and bought this today for full price at a FLGS that I was unaware of before last week--Blackfyre Games, nice place.  My wife and I have both been in a gaming mood lately, but without much time to get together with my brother and sister-in-law whom we usually game with.  We don't have a lot of good two player games, so we've been playing a lot of Blokus.  We love it, but we needed some variety.  I received Knizia's Spy for Christmas which was a major disappointment.  Started exploring this site and BSW around the same time and tried Lost Cities.  THIS is what we needed for the two of us.  So we splurged and got it tonight and played our first game of three.  We both had a lot of fun with an easy, but deep game.  Games that my wife and I enjoy playing frequently get high scores with me.

Like everybody else has pointed out, this is a good partner game but just a tad too light for me. By now I am mostly on autopilot while playing this because after repeated plays it becomes increasingly obvious what the optimal play is every turn.

There is a good amount of luck in this game so oftentimes, no matter how well you play, your opponent just gets the numbers when he needs them and you can't do anything but lose. That's probably the reason it's such a good partner game because even if your SO isn't really into games, they can still win against you without you having to hold back.

Shuffling the cards between and before the game is annoying though because sufficient shuffling takes up 25% of the time you commit to this game. And you have to shuffle sufficiently because If you don't, the colors will be clumped together from the previous game.

Perhaps the finest filler game ever conceived. Even playable with a standard deck of cards, if you're willing to drop the fifth journey.

I don't know that I'll ever tire of this one. It comes out a few times every quarter, mostly due to 0 setup time and 15 minute play time. The very very longest game of this I've ever played was maybe 30 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
100+ plays. It's one of the great 2 player spouse games. It's light enough to play fast but there inevitably comes a few agonising decisions over how long to hold out for better cards (vs giving useful cards to your opponent via the discard pile vs playing too early to a colour and limiting your score in it). The other hard decision each hand is whether to play safe or risky (by playing multiplier cards on a suit that you may score negative in if you don't get the high cards). There's no direct pussage and limited interaction, but your plays generate enough interest and tension (from time pressure to maximise your score before the deck runs out) to warrant a lot of replay.

Simple to learn.  Addicting.  Fast Play.  Scoring system is a slight hurdle, but makes sense, and gets easier to do the more you play and understand it.  Colorful.  Even non-gamers like this.  Fun and challenging, but simple design.  A perfect 2 player card game. Yes, the theme is pasted on, but I feel the graphic design makes it more pleasant and adds to the games' timelessness.

Some lesser mortals find this a little too mathy for their liking.

Extremely easy to explain.

I like the artwork and the gameplay. Nothing mindblowing, but simple and enjoyable games are not easy to design. 

Players have to think before they make a move, but they get the feeling of Nice and Easy. 

Scoring is a pain in the ***. I made an Excel for it, but maybe I should delete it so I can get better at math.

(Wife's Point of View: I was pleasantly surprised. She asks for it all the time. The same girl that doesn't play Carcassonne because she doesn't like to think that much. She liked Jaipur, now she prefers this one. Everybody refered to it as wife friendly but I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong. It feels really easy going and fast despite it's mathy mechanics)

Luck is more of a factor than I'd like--there's nothing worse than jumping up to 6 from 2 and drawing the 5 immediately--but this game is way, way more strategic than it appears at first blush, and if you tell me it's multiplayer solitaire that just lets me know you haven't played it nearly often enough.

There are a lot of other good 2-player card games out there (San Juan? San Marco? Rook? Canasta?). The "Indy-Jones" theme is a clever way to sell a relatively simple 5-suited game. I do like it, and it will be a good one to hook people into playing who might not be up for a traditional Euro, but don't (think) they feel like cards.

12/11/05 - after 20  games on BSW, the random element has started to annoy me a bit. Still a good title, probably too pricey for what it is. A good gift at $10. Not sorry I bought it, but dropped rating to 6.

2013: played over 100 games on iOS. Games last less than 7-8 minutes against AI, 10-12 minutes against a human. Perfect time, and addictive at this play speed. Raising to 7. Deleted game to save space in iPod. Huge time sink also!

My wife and I enjoy this game very much.  To me, few games have such agonizing decisions to make throughout the entire game.  Which expeditions should I try for?  Do I discard this card hoping my wife doesn't need it and draw from the deck?  Do I abandon an expedition at a loss and try another? Each game is very different. Great game!

Much better than I remember it being. The game is very light, but you have plenty of opportunity to mess with your opponent. It's like a less thinky version of Battle Line, yet at the same time, I believe there is plenty of hidden tactics and clever play that's waiting to be first discovered.

RATING: 7
An OK light card game. More luck than strategy and minimal opportunity to effect your opponent. Theme is completely pasted on, and you could play without the board and even with normal playing cards if you had a fifth suit. People who really like traditional card games will probably like this. It's quite portable and quick-playing and good for non-gamers.

Whether one considers this better or worse than Battle Line, depends on what one is up for at any moment in time, lighter or slightly heavier fare. I prefer the extra heft in Battleline.

A good, quick, light two player card game.  It is deeper than it appears, though, as sometimes there are hard choices when to start an expedition or when to throw off.  The four player game (using partners) is okay, however felt tacked-on.

The game can be "mathy" and its theme is pasted on.  People looking for a little more of a challenge or theme should look elsewhere.

Finally found a (semi-) local game store; brought my wife along and chose a lineup of 4 games... she chose Lost Cities.  After our first few games she loves it, and I'm having fun too.

RATING: 7
This is a small game that fits in my mind alongside Jaipur in terms of a great 2 player game that is quick and easy, but really forces you to make interesting decisions.  The game absolutely is NOT balanced every time.  We've ended a round where my wife scored nearly 100 points, and I had negative.  Sometimes, the cards you're dealt continually just are terrible, but the "best score after 3 rounds" makes up for it.  I actually won that game. So if you want perfectly balanced, look elsewhere, but if you want a fun game that is interactive, comically stressful, and rewarding, this is a good one.  Quick head-to-head play is perfect for spouses.

It's a card game with 5 suits instead of 4.  It's 2-player only (unless you buy a 2nd deck and play partners) game where you compete head-to-head for many of the same cards so it can get rather confrontational.  Also, it has nothing to do with any "Lost Cities" -- that is just artwork on the cards you never look at and has no relevance to the game.  Fun and addictive, absolutely no theme, but a good fast fun cardgame, and head-to-head competitive and tense, maybe too tense for non-confrontational players.

I love this game.  It's fast paced, doesn't take very long to play the three rounds of a single game.  There's a fair bit of strategy involved, but also a lot of luck.  And despite being a simple card game, it definitely gives a great feeling of theme.  It's very easy to learn.  The oversized cards are beautiful to look at, and if you line them all up, they convey a little scene or story.

Very famous and well liked game. But it seems to me that this game is basically about withholding cards that your competitor needs until they commit to building in that set and then you dump the cards they need which screws them so their scoring potential is limited. I don't see the fun in that.

Battle Lines has a similar feel, but is much more fun because players have more decisions, more complex decisions, and more agency to adapt and change strategy in mid-stream to minimize the damage of bad card draws or the impact of a "take that" delivered by an opponent.

Brilliance.  Easy, simple, elegant, and quick.  But features never-ending second guessing -- not just against your opponent, but also the deck.

Cards need to be redesigned -- too big,too difficult to tell apart, and too related to a theme that is pointless (let abstracts be abstract!).

RATING: 8
It is a game with simple rules that has a surprising amount of depth for a filler game.  You are constantly put at a crossroads in the game as to what to throw away that my opponent might take, what to keep, and what to play.  The handshakes or exploration funding is what makes this game really interesting since it multiplies the point scored, gains or losses.  And a lot of tension is produced by this.  This really solid filler that is you can get non-gamers into pretty easy.  I haven't played the board game that takes 4 players, but this version has got me interested in seeing what it is like.  Each round plays surprisingly tight.  When I first read the rules, I didn't at all expect this.  I give this an 8.   My wife will play it and it is surprisingly good filler.  If I were rating it as filler, I would give it a 9 or 10.   You can find the game for $10 and quick and very good play.  When I am playing it, I am never thinking "I wish I brought this other filler instead."  

The only thing I don't like about the game is the scoring.   Knizia has said himself that he develops a game around a scoring systems.  The scoring he believes is what drives the dynamics of the game.  In this game, the scoring drives the tension on starting expeditions.  If you fail and expedition, you could lose points, a lot of points if you fail it badly.  If you fund an expedition, your point loses or gains are multiplied.  This drives the game.  It works.  The downside is that it is a headache to adding up your score without a sheet of paper.  I am an engineer so I am better than most but if I am playing this at the bar without pen and  paper to track my scoring, I will finish adding up the score from one color x my funding level and completely forget what I scored in the previous color I added up.  I don't know how you fix this other than have a pen and paper handy.    The adding to negative numbers and multiplying negative numbers hurts my head if I don't have scratch paper and have had a beer.  The scoring works though and drives the game.  It just isn't the easiest to add up.

I love the simplicity of the game combined with the natural way it blends with the theme. Go in a very clear progression on an expedition, balancing investment and risk. Takes very little time to teach someone to play, and not too long to get serious winning strategies going. Really good two player game. I am tempted to get a second copy and see how the 4 player version feels, as I can see how the mechanics would be enriched not only by attempting to read your opponents intent, but also your partner. (I used to play bridge on ocassion, so I like partnership games in general).

I bought this game based only on reviews and regretted it. I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. The expedition theme feels completely artificial and slapped on there. It's just a counting game. Yes, there is strategy and tactics involved, but the decision making is very straightforward. In fact, the best choice to make is often so obvious it doesn't even feel like I am making a decision. Moreover, luck still plays a big role, and it's simply frustrating to try and block your opponents line, only to have him draw a 10 or 9 in the colour he needs. My wife and I played this game twice and put it back on the shelf. It hasn't moved since.

Zzzzz...this game bores my fiance and I.  Yes, I do appreciate the abstract strategy element in it but the theme is extremely week.  Plus, you could easily make this game using two decks of normal playing cards.  But it looks like I'm in the minority with my thoughts.  Get "Caesar & Cleopatra" instead.

An inexpensive, fast-playing, and enjoyable game for 2 people.  It does suffer from being 'over produced', as a resourceful person can quite easily 'make' this game with 2 decks of cards.  That aside, the game is fun with the calculations at the end being the worst part about it.

When do I play this?:
Well, to be honest, not often.  This is a game that I got after hearing so many reviews, but it doesn't really work for me and doesn't really 'grab' me.  It's okay for travels though, and is accessible to new gamers, so it's got it's plusses.

It's ok.  Bit dull as lack of decent theme.  Has benefit of being quick and having a bit of thought to it.  Good to play with people who don't want to spend the time or effort to play a better game...

Also pity the board and cards are so huge - almost as if I'd got a special pack for partially sighted... makes it impossible to play on the train which is a shame as would be just right for a medium-length train journey.

RATING: 6
*Have played this alot and been impressed that sometimes I come across a subtle tactical decision I haven't experienced before. I like the progressive images in each of the expedition cards, and game play has that advancing storyline, though doesn't have the exploration narrative of Africa. Has the Knizia trademark "Play a card, draw a card" which enforces speculative angst (though this is to a lesser degree then some of his other card games as you can draw from one of upto 5 discards). What increases the pressure is trying to get over the positive scoring threshold. The drawpile acts as a countdown to game end, the pace of which can be manipulated which I like. Quick pace is another good feature as sometimes plays are obvious. Can't intefere with opponent's play (so safe to play with your partner), all you can do is deny your opponent a valuable card to advance,though holding on to too many of those doesn't benefit you; so dilemmas creep in. On the whole Lost Cities quietly provides moments of consideration, quick to play but lacks the sharing of sitcom. Where it fails to do anything more for me is when I'm feeling competitive and need the thrill of comparing race situation:this requires maths gymnastics to discern current player status in order to make the best decision(though I guess the uncertainty maintains hope). Adding to this is the scoring which personally is an overlong, dull chore leading to an anticlimatic game session.

A fun and rather fast 2-player card game. It is easy and quick to learn with simple mechanics, yet allows for tactical and some strategical plays. Furthermore, there are elements of tension and risk taking, plus the variability of every hand, which give the game a tremendous amount of replayability value.  However, if both players are experienced in the game and have a good grasp of the various play tactics, winning boils down to literally 100% luck of the draw.

As far as the game's production, simply by using oversized cards, the publisher succeeds in enhancing the look and feel of the game and adding uniqueness to it, distancing it from being just another card game. Although, some purists may argue against trivially overdone components when a standard format could do just as well and might even be more functional.

For a similar game but somewhat more involved and more tense check out Battle Line. Another decent game in this vein is Odin't Ravens.

Probably my biggest disappointment to date.  I picked this up after seeing people rave about it here, and I really disliked it. The strategy is way too simple, and the gameplay just isn't compelling. I can see how this might be nice to play with a partner who has very little interest in heavier gaming.  But otherwise I'd leave it.  When I finished up the first game of this with my brother he said "We should have played Carcassonne".  All I could do was agree.

Update If you are looking for that 2 player card to play with an SO, skip this and grab Jaipur.  It is what I had hoped Lost Cites would have been..

Yes, in accordance with the cliché, my wife loves it.
And so do I. We can play 10 games in a row. I once used to play online almost everyday. It's so addictive.
Some say the theme is weak and pasted on, but I like the artwork and think it adds a lot to the game (I can't imagine playing it without the board and with standard cards, it wouldn't be the same).
The gameplay is pretty simple but also very clever. The strategy behind it is huge. A mediocre player can win a round to a good player due to their luck, but on the long run the best one always wins.
Simply the best choice for a quick but meaty two-player game.

As with many of these kinds of games, explaining scoring is a little tricky at first (you basically have a 20-point debt to repay for each expedition before you start tallying positive points) but it quickly becomes second-nature and the game can survive if you leave it on the shelf for a long time and pick it back up later.

Quite tedious game of hope-to-draw-high-numbered-cards-in-good-combinations. Totally useless board, and horribly hard-to-identify colours (is that card green or blue? Oh well, I don't care, this game is stupid anyway). A bit better played on a computor-machine because it'll do all the tedious scoring and colour-recognising for you, but even then it's still mostly a game of hope-to-draw-high-numbers.

For what it is, Lost Cities is a fine game. It's just not something I pull out very often, due to it being pretty light and also only for 2 players. Drawing the right cards in the right order is important, which can be excessively frustrating. I wouldn't want to play more than occasionally.

What a fantastic and elegant little game. My play partner told me it plays pretty much like Bridge, but I would not know, so this is probably why I am so impressed by this game. A reductionist approach to interaction but it is enough to make the decision you are taking turn by turn very important. It takes a few hands to get the hang of the right balance and I am not sure how this will hold up after dozens of plays, but for now, I am thoroughly impressed by this gem.

A simple to grasp, fast playing game for two. 
Each person tries to build expeditions from the same pool of cards. The players have to add increasingly higher numbered card to their rows in order to make that row/expedition profitable by scoring as much points as possible. 
There is no direct confrontation in this game, just passive agressively hogging or (re-)taking cards your opponent could use and speeding up getting to the end by taking cards from the drawing deck. Easy to learn and fun to play. It might as well be themeless, but it has a sound system. An easy recommendation for anyone who plays games with their partner.

Played in Sept of 07.  It is a VERY solid game.  Nice balance.  A good variation on all card games.  Very quick to play.  I mean there is little one can complain about this.  Right?  Well, it is not my cup of tea.  There is little confrontation.  I believe Hera and Zeus is the best out of the Kosmos 2-player series.  This game just is not as exciting.  Again, though, very solid

RATING: 7
This is an enjoyable two player card game.  You play three rounds scoring at the end of each round.  The round ends when the last card is taken from the draw pile (Not the five discard piles).  A turn consists of two actions; Your first action is to either lay a card or discard a card.  Your second action is to take a card from either the discard pile or the draw pile.  The moment you play a card you start with a negative 20 points.  Your optimum play would be to play two cards with hands first and then the matching color number cards in sequential order 2 through 10.  The hand cards are multiplier cards.  This can be good and bad.  If all you have down is a hand card when the draw pile runs out you will be a -40 points (-20 for starting the row times 2 for the hand card = -40 points).  If you have the following cards layed down you would have 18 points: (1)hand, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 (add up the value of the numbered cards, minus 20, times 2 = 18).

RATING: 5
Quick thoughts: So far this game has proven to be a dud. Maybe there is something that I am not doing right. A sense of adventure is simply missing, and this is just a game where you place cards in ascending order. There is no sense of huge risk in this game, and as with most games and kids, the maths are a bit boring and complex. Instead of having a simple scoring mechanism, it is a bit stupid. Each expedition costs 20 points to start, and so you are trying to get 20+ points in the game. This is done simply by ignoring the lower value cards and focusing on the higher ones. Then there are the wagers or agreements which I am still uncertain about. Something about points doubling or something? I don't know. Example I realise that it is a multiplier. One agreement is 2x, two is 3x, and three is 4x. Does this mean that you need 40 points,60 points, and 80 points respectively, just to break even? I think that this game does have potential with a better explanation of the rules.

This game is NOT "the perfect couples game" as some say - it's just a numbers-in-sets collecting game with a wagering multiplier - kinda like a cross between Gin Rummy and Spades. Theme nonexistent except for art on cards. It's nice, as a small cardgame, but there are many other games that are more unique and entertaining experiences.
That said, it is a good 2 player game for couples (in a relationship, or just a gaming partner) and could go up to as much as an 8 when played between 2 serious gaming partners.

At first it felt like a random-fest. Was very expensive for what it is, and I think the cards could be better designed. (I thought it would be great if they had shown the expedition progress with a superimposed map Indiana Jones style.)
However, after a few plays I found it more fun and developed a strategy. A fun filler game that the kids can understand, but is more fun to play with an equal.

RATING: 8
When I first read the rules to Lost Cities I thought that it was a simple game.  After the first hand I played, I changed my mind.  The discard piles makes discarding tormenting, but you don't want to wait too long to start playing your sets or you won't have enough time to complete them.  This adds a complexity to the decision making that is hard to see from merely reading the rules.  I can understand how this game would be addictive because it makes me want to play again--hoping I will get cards in the right order, hoping I can extend the suspense.

There is a great deal of luck involved, but someone who has played the game more will invariably do better than someone who has played the game less.  One reason for this may be that veteran players have a better understanding of when they should and should not risk starting new colors or playing higher numbered cards.

I'm starting to think I'm not a huge fan of Knizia ;).  Lost Cities is an ok game, but I don't quite get what all the fuss is about it.  I had seen people talking this one up and to me it seems just... alright.

Update 11/9/09 :  I keep hearing there is great strategy in this game and I just don't see it.  Often there just seems to be one optimal play - and sometimes you just are presented with the choice of "a bad move" and "an even worse move".  If you are fortunate enough to draw the right cards then you just lay them down in sequence... no great decision making there.  I figure I'm missing something here or just suck at the game.  I don't hate it, and will play it if someone asks to, but it seems really average and vanilla to me.

2 player easy to learn filler. Simple yet very entertaining.  You can play five games in 30 minutes. Simple rules, requiring players to draw then play cards of 4 different sets ("expeditions") in ascending order. Expeditions that are left significantly incomplete result in negative points, while those with many cards played (particularly high numbers) give a player points. This could be played with a standard deck of cards.

Lost Cities is in effect a card game - nothing more, nothing less. I happen to enjoy card games because my formative years where spent playing the usual family crap e.g. Game of Life, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, et al. I also played card games. 

In Lost Cities, you and your opponent play cards numbered 2-10 in 5 coloured sets to either the appropriately coloured set, or to the discard pile, with the objective of scoring the highest points. The key feature of the game is that when you lay a card to one of the appropriate coloured sets, you start from a position of minus 20 (-20) points after playing the first card to a coloured set. The numbers on the card represent the number of points when played on a set. 

You can also play cards that will double, triple or quadruple the value of any cards played to a set. These cards will, of course, also multiply any negative score.

From your own hand, and the cards that your opponent plays (and discards, as well as picks up from the discard pile), you have to deduce whether you can play to a set and overcome the negative modifier, and gauge how strong or weak your opponent is in a particular colour.

The cards are of good quality, and the back of each coloured set of cards make a nice tableau.

My fiancee and I played a lot of games when I first bought Lost Cities a couple of years ago over Christmas, and then never went back to it.

Mathy but delicious, Lost Cities is a game that anybody who has a background in regular card games will love. Simple and easy to learn as rummy, but with enough subtle strategy to keep it running, LC is a game of tense decisions and the temptation of taking risks. Do you play an investment card when you are unsure that you'll be able to complete a viable expedition in that particular color? The questions are endless, the hands seem to end too quickly. Great game, one that you can pull out with literally anyone and have a good time.

Nice card game. It's kinda like playing a game of Solitaire but, with two players. I don't play it much but, my wife likes it a lot. She usually plays with one of her friend. The game isn't too long to play either so, I guess it makes for a great filler game.

It's a simple card game that could, in all honesty, be played with regular playing cards. The cards that the game comes with are so colorful and beautiful that it's worth picking the cards up. The board itself, while it looks cool, is totally superfluous. 

Update (8/3/07): Turns out the board has some uses and that I read the rules wrong the first time. The game is a lot interesting and fun now! It must be because I love card games or something. I don't know what it is. I seem to largely prefer Ameritrash-y titles, but this game just scratches a particular itch for me. I love it.

Abstract 2 player game that plays fast and is fun, but haven't played in a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple yet very entertaining 2-player filler. You can play five games in 30 minutes. Simple rules, requiring players to draw then play cards of 4 different sets ("expeditions") in ascending order. Expeditions that are left significantly incomplete result in negative points, while those with many cards played (particularly high numbers) give a player points. This could be played with a standard deck of cards.

RATING: 8
An excellent two-player card game; addictive.  Great game to hook non-gamer friends and family members on.  Luck of the draw is an important factor, however, and if you're drawing poorly, it can be hard to overcome.  But it's still fast and fun.

Card game in which players mount "expeditions" by collecting same-colored cards which are numbered 2-10. The first twist is that you cannot play a lower numbered card than the highest number you currently have for an expedition (i.e. cards must be played from low to high). Your score for that expedition is the sum of the numbers minus 20. So the second twist is that if the sum of your numbers in an expedition is less than 20, you will get a negative score. You can also play investment cards prior to embarking which multiply the profit (or loss) of any expedition. Sarah's favorite 2-player game.

A good 2-player filler to start or close a session. There is some tactics involved in this game but the card draw luck is huge. I don't mind the luck factor if I just play a couple of times. Probably the biggest mistake you can do is to start too many expeditions. In the end it's all about taking calculated risks and then see if you'll get lucky.

edit. After more plays I can say that there is surprisingly big amount of risk management and tough choices in the game.

A simple set building game from Knizia. The central mechanic is easy to pick up (lay down cards from lowest to highest, rather like a game of patience) but the catch is that you and your opponent are working from the same set of cards and there is a penalty for making a half-hearted attempt at any particular set.
The game is fun but it gets a lower rating for being two player. The reason is fairly simple, if I was going to play two player I wouldn't pick something with this much luck, I'd want either something heavier or a perfect information game.

At first, I was disappointed at the lack of theme in the gameplay...it&#039;s basically just a five-suited deck of cards.  But my wife and I were totally hooked!  Tough decisions--almost excruciating--on what to play and/or discard.  Quick play time is nice, and the cards travel well outside of the box for plane/train gaming.

RATING: 6
Among the best games to come off Knizia's long production line of lightish card games, Lost Cities has both simple rules and a fair number of strategic points to learn - and is incredibly addictive when you first learn it (at least, it was for my wife and I back in 2011). Unfortunately, it doesn't sustain this initial surge of interest, as you gradually realise that there isn't much you can do if the cards you need for your high-scoring "expeditions" don't come your way. While perhaps it is our fault for overplaying it early on, I never have any interest in breaking Lost Cities out again these days - but I still have plenty of respect for the game. Although it's worth pointing out that Battle Line, another 2p Knizia card game, feels pretty similar in most respects - despite being mechanically quite different - while retaining interest far better over repeated plays.

Another great two player filler. The struggle of deciding how many expeditions to go for, whether to play investment cards, when to play a significantly higher card than your previous one, and what to discard make for some good decision making. Can have a very high frustration level - drawing a card just less than the one you just played, for example - and that initially made me question whether or not I liked this game. But after s few more tries, that frustration turned into one of the more appealing aspects of the game.

Ratings upgraded after playing regularly for a year and not getting bored.

How the hell does Knizia make a game out of counting up? 
---
Ratings upgraded again after more years of contemplation. I've been underrating this game, I think, still. It's not aiming for my favorite target - it's virtues are its learnability, its ease of play, it's relatively narrow decisions pace. It's not a monster-soul of a killer of a game - but the design is so clean and play is so surprisingly engaging. Also, I've played it like 200 times, and that's gotta count for something.

It's still the first game I recommend for a new-to-gaming couple that wants something gentle, but a real game.

pure genius - takes a fairly enjoyable card games, gives it 2 key twists (multiple shared discard piles and a player controlled end of game) and somehow contrives so you never actually WANT to play ANY of your cards :) i love it

NB this is NOT the same as games like balloon cup which are JUST fairly enjoyable card games

oh and btw if anyone gives this less than 10 they are wrong

PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF - Balloon Cup, Schotten Totten.

Lot's of interesting decisions with this one.  You'll want to horde cards you know your opponent needs, but that means you probably have to sacrifice something with your own sets.  The deck is pretty short, so there's tension in knowing your time is limited to create the ultimate sets.  Do you wait to start an expedition hoping you draw better cards and discard something that might be what your opponents needs, or start an expedition in a worse position than you would hope for?  Agonizing at times, but still pretty fun.  Great game.

In this game you'll score many points in a certain color. Each color (5 colors) features cards from 1 to 10. Each card occurs just once and if you play a number, you cannot play lower numbers. Complication also, is that there are multiplier cards which cause you to win (or lose in case..) multiplied amount of points. You try to estimate the likelihood of occuring the amount of high cards in the deck. Problem, you don't know what your opponent has and what's left in the deck. You need at least 20 points in 1 color to come out positively.

This is an easy and simple two player game.  It doesn't require a ton of thought and plays quickly.  It is easy to teach to almost anyone.  We didn't keep it mostly because there are so many other two player games we'd rather play.(JW)

There isn't much to this game... you have a few decisions to make, but none of them seem to carry much weight since the game goes by so quickly.  It doesn't matter too much if you mess up because a new round is only 5 minutes away.  This leads to 90% of the game being played on autopilot.

I'll play if I'm bored... wait, why did I say this?  I'll probably never play this game again.  (And I won't care one bit).

I own kilgore's retheme version (thanks TGov!)

Good 2 player game. Light, and plays super quick. This game is one that I fluxuate on. At times I think its brilliant, at times I think its lame and predicatble. I guess I just need to space my plays and I appreciate it more. It's not even close to the game that Battle Line is, but its a fun quick game for nongamers.

I like this game.  It is a solid two player game and a great additional to the Kosmos small box, two player series.  However, I can not help but think all these Knizia two player games are the same.  This same mechanic is used in Lost Cities, Scarab/Minotaur Lords and Blue Moon.  I am getting tied of the same system in two player games and want something new from Knizia.

Light-weight, excellently themed fun game for 2. There is more to it, than you would expect at first, like in many of Reiner's "lighter" games. A good example how to make an ingenious card game that is all about numbers!

Luck of the draw can make or break a round, even for a skilled player. Some room for strategy, but most games play-out the same -- wait as long as possible before playing anything, then either run the deck out (when cards favor you) or stall (when cards favor opponent). Card play is almost automatic. The game plays well as a brainless filler.

    Good for a quick bit of fun when only two people show up on game night.  Also a good game on a date, as your girlfriend will enjoy it enough to sit still and drink champagne for an extended period of time.  That's a good thing.

A good game for the less-vicious among us as no one is killed or wounded while playing.    

Very simple setup, easy rules.  A bit light for my taste, but quick and fun.  Limited to two players.

I feel like I owe Lost Cities an apology. I spent a lot of years actively hating it, assuming that most people we're crazy for thinking it was anything besides a goofy crapshoot of a game. I thought it was impossible to gauge risk and that victory hinged entirely on what cards you draw, not on how you actually plan.

But I sensed I was out of step with the general consensus, so I spent some time reading about strategies and how to play well. I'm ashamed to say that a lot of what I read never occurred to me, obvious though they might be in hindsight. After giving those some thought and playing a couple games with my wife, I found that though Lost Cities is a very simple game, it's definitely not stupid and random. It's a game filled with tense decisions and just a hint of thematic flavor that makes more sense the longer I think about it.

So now I've done a complete 180 on Knizia's classic. Right now it's one of my favorite two-player games, and definitely one of my favorite games to play with my wife.

A very fun, no-frills risk-management game. Knowing when to call off an expedition, or how late in the game to risk beginning one, makes each game tense and engaging. Sometimes having nothing viable to do but give your opponent cards is annoying, but I guess that's part of the tension.

One of my favorite two player games.  Adapting to your draw as it progresses is key.  This game is quick to set up and put away, quick to play, and has plenty of critical decisions to make throughout the game.  Playing three rounds balances the score so one bad round doesn't mean a loss.  This game is also reasonably compact and easy to take anywhere.  Great coffeehouse game or great for a filler during longer game nights.

A very simple game idea that leads to plenty of choices. It's really a game about pacing and compromise, and making the best use of what you have. The bits are of excellent quality (tarot sized cards etc).

The downsides are some unexpectedly agonising AP and the luck of the draw, though given that it's a lighter game neither are particularly troubling.

There's been something of a backlash against this game on BGG lately, but playing it again recently made me appreciate it anew. A good light game, and a great gateway game.

Update: losing interest in this lately, as the scoring is a bit fiddly for such a light game.

RATING: 6
This is a mathematics/numbers game.  There are 5 expeditions, each with 3 investment cards and 1 copy of each number between (and including) 2 and 10.  Each turn you play a card either into one of your expeditions or onto the discard pile for that expedition.  Then you draw a card, either from the draw pile or from one of the discard piles.  When you play a card on your expedition the card you play must be of greater value than the one previously played.  At the end of the game, as soon as the draw pile is empty, each player totals their expeditions, subtracting 20 points from each expedition they contributed to.

The tension in the game comes from deciding when to start an expedition and which ones to abandon, as trying to play all of them will result in negative points for at least one.  Players are making decisions based on the totals they can make, as well as deciding to give up a card their opponent might take in order to stall and hope for a better draw.

It plays fast, but is rather light on strategy.  It makes for a great filler or casual game.

Having heard many things for this "classic" game, I thought of finding more about it and was able to test it online. I found out why were there so many controversial comments here. So after 20-30 games that's what I saw;
Why many people love it?

-It is so simple to learn.
-It is very fast and lasts no more than 5-10 min.
-It is different each time you play it.
-It has some(many) difficult decisions.
-It is one of those rare board game that is so easy to get your wife to play with, and love it!
-Its theme fits very well and it's something different. They even avoided having goblins (or zombies...) making the excavations!

Why people hate it?
-It is soooooo simple even for a filler...
-It is soooooo much luck based. It would be ok to have luck involved but from what I saw, a player may have lost the game as soon as the shuffling ends.
-Pointless decisions. Yes you just made a difficult decision, but what you realise after a while is that when the outcome of the decision is so much based on luck you could as well just pick a card and skip the thinking. It's something you easily realise when someone asks you to pick a number for a dice roll, and you just call a whatever number. The difference here is that there are minor differences on the choises and you are tricked to think that it matters. If you think is worth to squeeze your brain to find which option has 54% of success and which 46% then go ahead, be a master on this game.
-It is easy to get your wife to play with it, exactly because it seems to have some depth, but she will win half the game anyway because it's just a luck game. And she will be the cool wife that plays board games with her husband!!!
-If the theme was investing on summoning zombies, goblins, vampires and dragons to make the most fearful army it would probably be more "cool". Yes really it could have any theme. Why bother buying a game that you could easily play with one and a quarter decks of playing cards. On the other hand, there are people that go and buy Rummi...

As for me the only chance I see playing this one again is by making a PnP copy myself with a different theme to play with my wife and kids when they grow a little. Or have them play and I play Diablo. Or if everyone is willing to play we better play hearts.

This was surely a very good and innovative game back there at 1999 when people were obsessed with Windows Minesweeper. But as Roland of Gilead can asure you, the world has moved on. And better so should you.

RATING: 8
Much more sedated (and much more passive) than Battle Line but still enjoyable, and much simpler to explain. I enjoy the push your luck aspect to this game, how every expedition you go on sinks you from the start and you have to crawl out, and the player influenced round end. The biggest problem with this game is the WORK you have to do to get your score, it's like every round ends with a 3rd grade math test.

RATING: 7
Another tense card game for two players, this time from Dr. Reiner Knizia.  There are 5 cities in a different color, each with 10 cards and 3 multipliers.  You are trying to get the most points you can by building expeditions based on playing cards from lowest to highest.  If you don't score high enough, you lose points!  Tough decisions must be made throughout, and tensions can get pretty high!

So, there's that one moment where you dont want to drop any card because you need them all.  Finally, you pick the card to drop (and "give up" on that one expedition), and without fail, you draw that one card you needed to have been able to play the card you just discarded.  HARSH!  Sometimes I feel like I've outgrown this game, but I always enjoy it when I play it.

Fast two-player risk and investment card game. There's some math you have to do in order to decide whether or not you want to start an expedition, or which expedition is more worthy of your attention. A nice, clean game giving you good subtle decisions. Good for the spouse. Often compared to Schotten Totten, but see my ST comment for a disputatious essay.

This used to be my Top Tip for Two-Player Games.  It's got a perfect blend of luck, risk and despair/joy (delete as applicable.)  The only thing wrong with it is that it gets old a little too quickly, which is why Blue Moon has supplanted it.  It's still a fantastic game though.

A great light game with tons of frustrating choices.  It's incredibly easy to explain, the cards and board is beautiful (you could essentially play this with a deck of cards, but it just wouldn't be the same), and there's enough decision and strategy involved to make it a different game every time you play.  Simple, but elegant.

I was wary of purchasing this game despite the great reviews fearing it would be too simple and lacking depth. I found it cheap so picked it up. So far it it my favorite of the Kosmos 2P games that I have. It has just the right amount of strategy for a quick 2P game. Highly recommended.

A very engrossing and engaging two player game.  Luck obviously plays a decent part but that doesn't take away from the constant tactical decisions that need to be made.

Rate it a 7.5/10 overall, but as far as 2p games go, I'll give it an 9

Really great, well-balanced, two-player card game. A true classic. The only quibble I have is that, like with most Knizia games, it's the manipulation of cold probabilities -- the theme is interesting and evocative. And completely unnecessary. It's really just bunch of math, ho hum.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a big fan anymore, and here's why: after playing a few times, you figure out all the strategy, play to the best of your capability, and the rest is luck. Each turn, you either have a very, very obvious action to take, or you don't. If you do, you take it, and it's scripted. If you don't, you take a risk on doing something, and the thing you end up doing is always a crapshoot which you hope will turn out good for you. Each turn, you either follow the right thing, or you close your eyes and pick something almost completely random to do. Not a good decision. Will still play as a filler, or to trash people who think this is a deep game. Need a scoring track for this.

A really great 2 player game. I bring this out when my GF and me just want to play something quick and also when I only have one friend over to play. Also a good game to play when you are waiting for the third player.

The game is pretty luck-based, but it also has some light strategy in it that makes it interesting and fun to play time after time after time.

Quick, fun and really great game!

RATING: 8
This is one of my favorite 2-player card games--if only I could get my wife to play more often.  I've seen a lot about this being a Rummy knock-off.  However, there is no melding, which seems as though it should be a prerequisite for a game to be termed rummy-like.  Despite being superfluous, I really like the artwork as well.  As far as gameplay, there is some luck, as with most card games.  However, like any good card game, it rewards skillful play.  I've also noticed when I've playe with different people that styles of play have occurred that I was not familiar with or did not expect to work.  Hopefully, it will continue to entertain.

Very simple game that is very overproduced as it is essentially a deck of cards. But, hey, it's a great design that makes one decision so difficult. A bit dry and very pasted on theme but who cares as it is a challenge suitable for many ages. Highly recommended.

Picked up the recent reprint because I was looking for more fast 2 player games to play with my wife or daughter. I can say the explanation is simple, game play is simple the only hard part is the math scoring which I have to do not only for myself but for my wife/daughter. That takes a few minutes each round and slows the fun of the game down but isn't a deal breaker.

Only few initial games with opponents who never played before. Finding a regular player will show how much has this to offer with repeated play.
Finally I have played some games with someone who was equal (or maybe even bit better) in skill. The games are full of tension (in the positive meeting), but I have seen many games decided just by a luck of draw. I think I will play this game time to time, especially during travelling for 2 people I will be willing to play this. Not a game I will play with my wife as she claims this is too much "math" for her.
In 2009 we managed to play several times with my wife and she's actually got into the game. It's a fun filler with a big portion of luck.

I have never understood the appeal of this game.  It's a relatively simple game with a not-so-simple scoring system. Also, while the game claims to have a treasure hunting/archaeological theme, it seems rather arbitrary and under-utilized.  The game is okay at best.

I like playing this game turbo, and finishing within 10 minutes or less. New players will probably fumble around the first game, with its slightly strange scoring system. The key to this game is not to overthink your difficult decisions - just think fast and take your actions now! 

OK, so this game has a pasted-on theme, and is a little mathy. But if you can complete it in 15 minutes, you'll probably agree to another round of it.

A simple to grasp, 2-player card game with mechanics that cause anguish in the decision making. A lot of hidden interaction that allows you to be semi-devious without your opponent ever feeling like you've screwed him over.

[57 plays] Surprising amounts of thought and tension for such a simple little game. It plays like a feisty, competitive game of solitaire for 2. (That may make sense after you've tried it.) It is quick and is highly addictive.

My parents, who are in their mid-late 70's are now complete addicts of this game after I gave them a copy for Christmas 2004. They taught themselves the rules. Their running total is now 53,000 points to 49,000 points with Mom in the lead after almost 18 months of continuous play. (their stats updated 6-7-06 )

Most recent plays 11-6-06 with Dad at deercamp.

A high rating because of its accessibility to newbies!

For a 'gamer' the game can get a little too static and dull. There are shades of rummy (play a card and draw a card from draw or discard pile) and the typical Kniza agony (do you build your hand slowly or take risks with expeditions).

The theme is pathetically thin (explorers my arse) but the artwork and oversized cards and even the board is a plus.

This is one of the first games that my wife actually liked and still requests to play from time to time.  That's a great thing and I actually like the game as well.  She used to beat me all the time, but I've since improved.  Anyway, there is quite a bit of strategy packed into this simple card game.  I would describe it as elegant.  Yes, the scoring math can be a bit annoying, but it gets easier and easier with each play.  I personally think that the theme works with the game and offers a good way to explain the play while teaching it to others.  This has become a classic card game and will always be in my collection.

As with most games where you have a public draw pile and a mysterious closed draw pile (eg, TtR and Gin Rummy), it is generally considered best to only draw from the closed deck. However! if you do that, then there is hardly any player interaction. It also doesn't help that Michelle flat out hates it (she says the central mechanic is too boring, like Battle Line, except more so). And yes, we have many more plays than are listed here.

A seemingly simple concept of set collection with a dose of press your luck. Deciding which cards to start a set, which ones to discard, or which to hold in your hand (to deny your opponent) make for a rather strategic card game. A really good 2 player card game with just a small amount of "good-natured screwage" to it, highly recommend for non-gamers and/or couples.

One of the better 2 player games on the market.  Still, it's pretty difficult to find a FUN two player game that keeps me captivated over time.  Most of them lose their luster after a couple months.  This was one of those.

This was my first Knizia game.  His math shines great in this one.  My wife has played this with me many times.  One of the 1st "weird" games (aka not American) she tried, and decided they are pretty good. :)  It's fun planning your strategy to finish the game by drawing from discards to extend the game to play those last few cards you really want to play.

Quick and fun game, OK once in a while or to finish off an evening but repeated play against the same player gets a little repetitive.  The agonising decisions of what to discard, what to play and when are what make this game good.  What I haven't quite worked out is how informed these decisions really are - can you really know whether you should hold onto your cards a few more turns or just play them?  Still it creates tension and I still have not tired of it.

This game's components look stunning, but it is simply a loose theme pasted on a card game.  The play is OK, but with an individual game lasting only around 10 minutes, it really highlights the luck of the card draw.  There are quite a few strategic elements to mitigate this, though, so it can be a lot of fun when in the right mood.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Card. Bumped my rating up now that I have this game and play with my wife, rather than with a friend over BSW. The interaction seems more, uh, interactive when face to face, and the pressure to play cards you don't want to is more intense. Great light two player game.

Traded after the wife lost interest fairly quickly. Although, to be fair, her interest in gaming dipped quite a bit for a few years. It's getting better now, but the game is gone.

It can be an easy but frustrating game. I was thinking that a person could play a four-land version of Lost Cities with a simple deck of playing cards. The four aces could be used as board markers while the three face cards could be used as investment cards. (I guess someone could invent a version where the king's investment would be more valuable than the queen's which would be worth more than the jack's. Perhaps someone could try an option where the king is worth two investment cards, the queen is worth one investment card, and the jack is used as an eleven or some type of negative card to place on the opposing player.)

Sorry, I just don't see it.  I have tried to find the strategy and the depth, but just can't locate it.  Seems like a card trading fest to me.  At the end of the hand when there are 4-6 cards left, but all of the possible expeditions are filled, it is just a card swap to the end.  Odin's Ravens is much better, in my opinion.

A Keltis kártyajáték után ismertem meg a nagy elődöt, így úgy tudnám röviden jellemezni, hogy a Keltis 2 játékosra optimalizált változata az Elveszett városok. A szabály 1 perc alatt ismertethető, maga a játék 10-15 perc maximum. A játékosok 5 színben 2-10-ig számozott kártyákból képeznek növekvő sorrendet egy-egy kártya lerakásával a körükben. Minden új szín megkezdése -20 pontról indul és a benne levő kártyák összege adja a végén a nyert pontot. Ez még meg van fejelve minden színből 3 szorzó lappal, amit ha az elején bevállal a játékos, akkor kapott eredményét az adott oszlopban megszorozza a lerakott szorzólapok számával. Szerencsejáték tulajdonképpen, de mivel pörgős, gyors így egymás utáni 3 parti azért csökkenti a mértékét. Szép a kivitel, de fölöslegesen nagyok lettek a kártyák és a tábla is nélkülözhető lenne. Simán játszható akár a Keltis kártya lapjaival is. Nem egy nagy játékról van szó, ami szinte teljesen mechanikus, nagyon ritkán kell dönteni benne, de abszolút játszható és a rövid játékideje miatt elővehető.

RATING: 8
well- classic thats really it...OK no its not :)

Cons: Probably the adding up at the end but otherwise theres no other con that isnt a pro due to its interated mechanics - such as the cards run out before you can finish your plans but thats why the game is so 'moreish'

Pros: good fun, fast and one of the best 2 player games around. My partner is pretty fussy with games but he always comes back for more of Lost Cities. This game, because its fast and easy to learn is one of those low investment games for people who whinge when you try to get them to play - just grab Lost Cities -tell them its easy as and quick and the game will make sure they play multiple rounds as its so addictive.

Decent, wasn't expecting much but this was fun. However, I'm a bit turned off by the fact that in the late game in theory you should be constantly counting your opponent's points, to know whether you want the game to end or not. Reason that's a problem is because counting is non-trivial.

Lost Cities is an enjoyable 2-player card game that offers quite a bit of tension and decision making for such a simple game. I've had a lot of success introducing it to new players, despite the complicated scoring system. The structure definitely helps with teaching as by the time you get into the third round, new players are more comfortable with the mechanisms. This usually leads them to remark "let's play again" right after final scoring. It has waned a bit for me over the years, but I still enjoy playing it from time to time.

Sounded like a good idea and I usually love Knizia games, but when half the game time is spent on totalling the score, that's just too much boring math for my taste. Ultimately the game lost its appeal when I realized I could play it with any five suit deck. Taken this way, it is just a regular card game modified to use a fifth suite, and since there are five or six suit card decks available, a separate game of "Lost Cities" is simply redundant.

LOST CITIES! This is a great game. It scratches the same itch as Battle Line but it is a game my wife will actually play. 

I love the risk of laying a new color. You are often forced to give your opponent points just so you don't have to lay on a color you know you can't get. The timing mechanic is also great. You need to wait until you get the right cards but if you wait too long, you will not get all of your cards laid.

You can have a round screwed over by unlucky draws. But over three rounds usually the person who plays better will win.

It took me quite a few plays to realize how important timing is to playing this well. It seems like a game of luck, but has interesting push-your-luck elements that can be controlled by watching the size of the deck and the scores. I really think you need to keep a running score to use the timing aspects correctly, unless your math skills are better than mine. For that reason, I'd like to try Lost Cities: The Board Game sometime, to see how that works.

Admittedly, this is a game that seems average only because I'm used to playing good games.  It's better than most mass-market American games.  That said, I find the decision-making uninteresting -- it vacillates between obvious and take a wild guess.

A very pleasant game, that is enjoyable for boardgamers who are not crazy about cards, and for card game buffs who are not crazy about boardgames.  Very quick and fun, with a bit of strategy possible (even if it proves pointless), and the game can actually be quite tense and exciting as the end is looming.  And yes, the theme is optional, but I still like the flavour it gives the game (at least at the outset).  But my wife always wins ...

Outclassed by Battle Line. Good game, and I'll play Lost Cities if asked, but it's not Battle Line. I understand the appeal, but because there are better alternatives, I'd rather play them instead. Perhaps because scoring is such a chore, I'm at least as happy playing the board game implementation, which irons it out.

I have a soft spot in my heart for Lost Cities, because it was our gateway into designer games after my husband and I got married. I wanted to get us a two player game and was tired of playing Monopoly and Boggle, so I saw this had good reviews and bought it for us. We played it like crazy and then bought more games and eventually we're going to a Gaming Center and trying out games frequently and I'm part of a gaming group. 

I feel like I've sort of grown out of Lost Cities, but play it every once in a while for those moments when I feel like playing a quick and easy game that doesn't require too much thought. There is some strategy to it, but not enough variation and complexity to enjoy it on a regular basis.

Excellent two player game, though I confess I prefer Battle Line (also by Knizia, of course).  Nevertheless, I enjoy playing Lost Cities and do so quite a bit.  I feel like it works a different part of my brain -- one that isn't as well developed as the Battle Line lobe.  Ah well.

My only complaint is that the cards of the Rio Grande version are needlessly oversized.  I'm mostly ok because I have large hands, but my partner simply refuses to shuffle them.  An odd decision to go with such large cards.  Why bother?

Copycat purchase. mlayed several times prior to joining bgg.  ok game.  luck is either with you or against you as the numbers you need are always drawn by your opponent. not always that bad but its our "fish" story that explains how we lost the game.  haven't broken this out in forever as we have other games more interesting to play.  we'll keep it around to see if the kids have interest in it and if not, donate to some nongamers/beginners who are looking to branch out (try to get the next generation addicted to gaming.)

RATING: 7
A fine way to pass the time with two players, Lost Cities' rules are simple enough that children who understand numerical ordering and multiplication can play.  The game is also nuanced enough to be enjoyable for adult gamers.

Risks and rewards depend solely upon which cards players keep, play, and discard.  This adds a moderate amount of tension to the game.  The beginning and middle part of the game rely heavily on inferring the opposing player's strategy.  Discarding cards is the closest thing to interaction between the two players in this game, as the discarded cards form a common draw pool.  As with most card games, the luck of the draw will come into play as well.

The game is a small card game and good for packing away for a trip.

[thing=50][/thing]

Picked it up after hearing good things about it, combined with the limited selection of games designed for two players.  At its best, its a coin toss who wins.  At its worst, you end up so far behind you'll never catch up. Even when the games were close, I didn't feel there was potential to affect the game outcome.  Combine that with a weak theme, and it seems like filler.  For the price you should buy a deck of cards and some gin, the fun will last longer that way.

Pros: Quick Setup

Cons: Weak theme, feels like playing tic tac toe

Very fun, excellent quick-and-meaty 2 player game - a rare niche - which is its greatest strength and also its greatest weakness. Strong because no other 2-player game can achieve the amount of game it packs in the short amount of time, but also weak because the price point feels expensive for something that is only two players and lasts less than 10 minutes. Battle Line offers a more satisfying version but takes longer as well - about half an hour. Lost Cities (playing with someone knowing the rules) can take less than 10 minutes (or even 5 with very decisive opponents).

Played three rounds today.  This is a pretty fun game!  But it IS for only two players, so it's a pretty chill game, not a huge party game obviously.  I think it's more like a number crunching sort of math game with a theme to disguise it, but it's still fun to play.  Turns out having all high cards isn't really that beneficial.  I had pretty much all the 10s for all the cities in 2/3 rounds and still lost.  Although if the person I was playing with didn't get the +20 8 card bonus, I would have won maybe, or it might have been a tie.

Anyhoo, it's a game I'd play every now and then but not like something I'd play over and over and over...

I think all the praise for this game is mostly deserved.  It is fun to play, has some degree of strategy, isn't difficult to explain, and doesn't take more than about 15 minutes to play a round.  The only negative aspect is that luck can sometimes be too much of a factor.  This is the case when your beginning hand is either incredibly good or bad.  In these situations it's hard for your opponent or you respectively to recover much.

doesn't actually have anything to do with lost cities.  if you were drawn to this by your love of archaeology, you'll be completely disappointed.  this is purely a numbers game underneath some lukewarm art, which makes this a classic example of a game with its theme pasted on.  for a real lost cities game, try tikal.

that said, if you approach it as a math game it's fun enough--simple, quick, and replayable.

[many plays] This game is decent.  The strong point is that there is a lot of tough choices, what do you discard, when do you start a color vs wait.  But ultimately IMO there is not great replay value here.  The game is overloaded with trying to calculate the odds of getting something better vs playing what you have right now.  There is a fair amount of match in this game.  It is an okay game, I have played against my sister, my wife, people in my gaming group, people online, etc.  I don't "dislike" playing this game at all.  However, I just don't have any feeling of wanting to play or suggesting to play this game either.

[RGG Scandinavian 1999 edition] {Adventure, couple; set collection, drafting, risk-taking} Lost Cities is a nice 2p game. It is very suitable for a couple who dislike confrontation games.  Players are competing in getting cards for scores. LC is a risk-taking game with clever scoring mechanism.  It is fast-paced, thematic and meaty.  Highly recommended as a couple game with 30 minutes.

It is quite interactive.  It does not offer direct interaction but the indirect competition is fairly strong, where players are competing for suitable cards and working to end a game for their best. In LC, you cannot ignore how your opponent plays in investing an exploration. If he is investing the same exploration, you know that your chance of getting high score is smaller. If your opponent is investing an exploration, you may hold cards to reduce his income. Therefore, I don't agree with my friends that it's a 2-p solitary game.

Card counting skill is important but not critical because it is usually too late if you discover what cards are remaining or your opponents are holding.  Intuition is important in LC.  If you have a good feeling what your opponent is working on, you can develop a good game plan to get good score.

[Sessions] I have experienced several games that my opponent got the 8, 9 and 10 in all 5 suits. Maybe, it's just my bad luck in card draws :(.

Once a long time ago, people played solitaire as a happy distraction.  This two-player solitaire variant is probably more fun than you could have with regular deck of poker cards.

Fantastic 2 player card game that is almost guaranteed to have you agonizing over decisions at least once or twice a game. 

Both I and my regular gaming partner are now somewhere on the learning curve for this game where luck dictates who wins, so it tends not to be so much fun. Still, we had a good 2 years play out of this and I would heartily recommend to those who haven't played before. I've uaccrued literally 100s of plays both online and offline. I'd recommend this game without hesitation to people looking for a 2 player game. I do occasionally play online still.

Fun game to pass the time with two, easily portable... yes, you could make your own copy easily but that doesn't take away from the enjoyability of the game.

Downgraded one point after many plays on BSW because it then makes the math of calculating your total seem like much more of a pain... much better when the computer does it for you.  Also, not as good as Battle Line.

RATING: 7
Interesting light game of "chicken" combined with some math. I think it is fairly fun trying to out think your opponent, while at the same time having the "press your luck" element.

More fun when you don't allow counting of cards left in the deck and you limit the time of a turn, that way it makes it less math based and more intuition.

I'm still surprised that so many females love this game, despite the fact it is very mathy and somewhat spiteful.

Fast to play with easy rules, but ohhh the stress :) Play now or wait for lower cards to fit in?  Risk several trips or focus on a few?  Only real problem is the total lack of theme...this is just a card game, doesn't at all feel like a game of exploration.  However, for whatever reason it is the ONE game that I can consistently beat Lisa at.  (Everything else she tends to clobber me!)

There is a whole family of card games known "competitive patience" games; and Knizia's game mostly closely resembles one called "Spite and Malice" which you can look up on the pagat website. This game adds scoring including the use of the "bonus cards" or whatever they are called. So it's a nice game, clean rules, some interesting choices. Based on how I feel about playing it again, I'd rate it "7", but I have to knock of one ranking pt. for the lack of originality. 

The problem with two player card games is that it can boil down to card counting if the game plays with all the cards. This part is the most annoying, you inevitably get to a pt. in the game maybe halfway through and one or both players start to stall, until one of them realizes he may as well draw down the deck. It's not very satisfying strategically when this happens and it's starting to happen a lot now...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An undoubtedly great game that, strangely, often leaves me a little underwhelmed when I play it.  It's quite flawless in its simple but effective mechanic - and it certainly forces you into making some difficult choices.  However, the repetitive nature of it just leaves me a little cold sometimes.  A great implementation of an near perfectly designed game that just doesn't quite do it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.54
Despite the similarities to Keltis: Das Kartenspiel - I think there is room for both in a collection.  For one, this is only 2p, when KdK is 2-4.  I also like with this one you need to make the call at the start  which are going to be the bigger sets (with the handshake cards).

This game came highly-recommended by the game store owner. It was one of my first Euro game purchases, after Arkham Horror, and I also bought Race for the Galaxy and Call of Cthulhu in the same trip. Lost Cities is only moderately appealing to me. Like The Hollywood Card Game, it's a game where the theme feels tacked on. Considering the great-looking artwork and the emphasis on "expeditions", I was expecting a little more roleplaying in this game. Alas...there is almost none. I plan to play it again, though.

The orginal rules is not much fun. But try this:
play the game on 4 player in 2 teams. You are not allowed to communicate with your team mate about what to do. This is way more fun! You need to cooperate and play your high cards in the right time. Another thing that improves the game is to introduce a random card. Whenever you want to you can instead of playing a card draw one from the pile that you then must play. This can be good if you only got high cards for instance and want your teammate to play an important card first. But it is risky since it can ruin a lot if you draw the wrong card. These two improvements makes the game so much more fun! Try it, we have for almost 1000 games now. Yes really. ;-)

Yep, this was a game I bought specifically to play with my wife, who is pretty much a "games are fine for you, but I think they are a non-productive waste of time" kind of girl.  She liked it (not LOVED it), as it is almost a double-solitaire type of non-confrontational game.  A vague cousin of rummy, with a scoring system that unfortunately takes away from the easy-to-learn-and-play game.  A player-aid scoring sheet would help matters quite a bit.

Fast-paced (once you and your partner are familiar with the rules) strategy card laying game. This game can actually be quite high on the anxiety production scale. You can only hold 8 cards, and you HAVE to get rid of one of them each turn (and then take another to replace it). With only a few places to possibly put the cards, you will have to make sacrifices.

The 2 player classic!

It quickly faded in our home. 5 expeditions available to start, each gives you points, but they also have a start-up cost. You can increase the investment in any given expedition, thereby ensuring a bigger profit - or loss.

You play cards onto your own expeditions, each card can only be followed by a card of a higher value. The break-even point is 20 points, so a minimum of 3 cards is needed.

On your turn you MUST play a card either by starting/ continuing an expedition or by discarding it. Each type of expedition has its own discard pile and cards are played into it, covering any previous cards. It is sweet to discard a high card for an expedition you have forfeited, but your opponent is working at, once they have played the next higher card, thus making it impossible for them to play it.

You end your turn by drawing a new card, either from the draw deck or from the face-up discards. The game ends once all cards have been drawn from the deck.

Initially this was a big hit for us and saw repeated plays, however, it quickly wore out. The main reason for this was the lack of theme. No, we did not feel like we were working on exploring the Incas or any of the Pyramids (or whatever the expeditions were meant for). The game lacked strategic depth. Neither of us are comfortable with mathematics to the extent we can calculate the odds of such and such happening. Neither of us enjoyed the bluffing game, figuring out where to lead and where to follow and where to hold off.

Simply put, the lack of game in this title quickly showed.

I continually hear high praise for the game and have on occasion been back to read other peoples thoughts. There are claims for strategic depth, but I think of a kind that does not suit us (as attempted addressed above) nor does the quick play time entice us, we have better alternatives for that.

We took one shot with the game as a gateway game, it bombed. There has been nothing said that makes me regret selling it on.

That said, I can see where people come from but still I would not recommend the game. Why not dive straight into meatier stuff than this...

Great two player game.  My husband isn't big on games, but he'll usually play this one without hesitation.  A lot more strategy than it seems.  Yes, the cards you draw are luck based, but do you discard and risk the other player picking it up?  Or do you hold on to it and clutter your hand?  Many decisions to make, but easy to learn and simple to set up!

I have taught this to a wide variety of people.  And then, immediately after explaining the rules to them, I lose to them.  Badly.  Every time.  I don't know why.  But they seem to revel in beating the "gamer" at a game, so they want to play again.  "Ah-ha", I think.  "Now's my chance to get revenge, and destroy them."  But no.  I lose again.  Usually worse.  Damn you, Knizia.

Good: Probably the game I have played the most as it is quick and my wife enjoys it greatly. There are lots of subtle strategies and tactics, and even more tension. I will play this any time, any day.

Bad: Sometimes you just don't get them 10s. Scoring can be slightly cumbersome.

JAN 2009 - Played it with my wife a long time ago and didn't click for us. However, I recently started playing with a co-worker and we've had some good fun with it, so I have improved my rating as a result. There's some push-your-luck in this game with how many expeditions to try. Your starting draw helps a lot. I find each round to vary and each requires perhaps a slightly different strategy. Another good game with tension that builds as the game progresses as you realize you need to start playing cards or eat some points when you come up short.

After playing a lot of game via iOS, I can safely say I'm not a huge fan. Maybe its just that I'm not good at the game, but I don't want to play a game where I'm just trying to manage the randomness that will determine the winner of the game.

I much much MUCH prefer Lost Cities the boardgame, which is far superior (both games are much improved by being able to go up and down in series ala Keltis).

I guess I don't quite get this game at this point.

I love the almost 'push your luck' aspect, the interaction (what cards have my opponents played/what is still in play?), the single set of cards, the 'double or nothing' feature, the tension, the pacing, everything. 

It's a bit light, a bit luck based, a bit abstract. But it plays so well. Should I withhold cards that will help my opponent but are clogging up my hand? How many moves are left for me to achieve what I want to? Should I slow the game or rush to do what I need? Risk it and play a 5 on a 1? But what if I am about to draw a 2? All of these choices/questions and more, each turn, each game. I love it.

I like playing this against other players online. However, I have yet to find a friend who likes the game like I do. One friend said it is just numbers and can be played with a standard deck of playing cards with 4 suits. Not incorrect, but I think the strategy and mind-games with pushing-your-luck aspects go beyond the surface. I would recommend playing it a few times to pass a judgment.

As far as 2-player games go, this is one of the best, though I have to admit that after a few games the essentially number-crunching nature of the game comes through and makes it a bit tedious. A very fast-moving game, makes a great filler. I'd really like to try the 4-player version with two sets.

Very fast, extremely simple card game with a nice but superfluous board. It's very good quality, though, and the art is lovely. The theme is definitely tacked on, so it's difficult to get in the spirit of the quest as you might with "Battle Line," another quick card game with some similar features. The mathematics involved in scoring can be a bit of a turn off, although it's simple enough and the game provides a very good example of the system in the rules. Overall, really easy to learn and a decent filler between heavier/longer games or when you have a few minutes to spare. I rarely ever suggest it but it seems to be a big hit with hesitant gamers, which is always a plus.

Great 2-player game. One of my favorites and one of the first Euro card games my husband and I got into. We joined a local gaming group and met Agricola (German version, not available in U.S. yet) and Space Alert (same story) at the first gathering we attended. Exploring the host's 2-player shelf we discovered Lost Cities and realized we already owned a copy. Tim had picked it up at a thrift store in San Diego years before. Needless to say Lost Citites got a lot of play after this. Our cards look pretty worn now. 

Love the Keltis spin-off, particularly the board game expansion: Keltis: New Paths, New Ways.

RATING: 10
I was in two minds about buying this game. Given you could make your own version using standard playing cards it didn't seem value for money. In the end I decided to pick it up as a filler to qualify for free postage on another order. I'm really glad I did - this game is just about perfect, it's simple, elegant, quick, and deep. It's also living proof that nice components and a pasted on theme add significant value to a game. I can't imaging enjoying this as much using a home made deck.

10 plays: Still enjoying the game although I'm beginning to suspect that the luck element is quite high (stays at 9).
20 plays: Luck element is definitely significant but still great fun (stays at 9). Can see my rating dropping a point or two over time however.
30 plays: Still going strong.
40 plays: I've had this game for just over a week and the cards are starting to wear out!
50 plays: My wife and daughter just can't stop playing this.
60 plays: Still having great fun playing.
70 plays: I have become reconciled to the luck element in the game. I am winning approximately two-thirds of games and now understand that the game is all about managing risk and making appropriate choices in the face of uncertainty. Sure, you may still get hosed by luck but over a large number of games the better player should still prevail. If I get to 100 games and am still enjoying it this much, I'll definitely give it my first 10 rating.
80 plays: My opinion hasn't changed.
90 plays: Still on track for a 10 rating as I'm still enjoying playing.
100 plays: My first 10! Any game that I can play 100 times in under two months and still look forward to playing deserves a 10 by the BGG definition.
150 plays: I still enjoy playing this game so it must remain a 10.

I never knew how much I enjoyed "Pushing my Luck" until this game.  Such gorgeous over-sized cards and such a simple game packing so much depth.  Love how portable it is (with or without the board), my only qualm is the shuffling between games.

I think I would like this better if Battleline or Balloon Cup had never existed.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

This is a pretty fun two player game.  It can be reproduced with simple playing cards, but the production values here are quite nice.  For as simple as it is, it can be quite stressful.  (Which I consider to be a good thing in this instance.)

RATING: 9
Simple design / simple rules,  that somehow yields loads of fun with everyone I have tried it with.  Despite starting with a hand of 8 cards,  that claustrophobic feeling can sink in right from the start.

While not a deep game by any means,  this one is chock full of tough choices throughout.  Should you risk starting another expedition,  how long can you wait hoping to draw lower cards on a previously invested one,  how much can my hand withstand the clogging of my opponents cards,  will discarding this card cost me too much or should I just play it.........

Yet, despite all of the above,  I find this one of the most relaxing gaming experiences I have ever encountered.

Before we bought this, I was all excited for this game and the "expedition" theme that was so highly advertised.  As an archaeology Major, I honestly don't know what I was expecting - each box to come with a specially packaged artifact?!  The game is fun and can get pretty tense if you over-explore and get into some trouble, but I just didn't like the tacked on civilizations theme.

Miss Rhodes says: This is a card game based around quite a simple idea, but is really good fun to play and involves basic tactics and luck of the draw with the cards. This game is fairly easy to play and you get an idea for the basic tactics involved after a couple of games.  It's good fun and not too involved. 

Hoops Says: I really enjoyed this game. I like strategy games that are fast paced and where you have to work out your opponents thoughts. This is a good game for a quick play and can be played over and over.

Its good....not great, but good. Wife and I have played this several times now and it's enjoyable but it doesnt grab you and emerse you in a great theme and gameplay.

My wife and I love playing lost cities.  It's easy to learn and there is a ton of replay value.  There is luck involved with the draw of the cards, but also has enough strategy involved to make it really fun.  Everybody that I introduce to the game loves it.  If you don't want to deal with adding up the end round/game scoring, there are now apps that do that for you.

RATING: 4.5
Straightforward two-player card game.  It has seen the table a bit, but I don't find it that engaging.  I would rather play it than watch paint dry, but I probably would rather play cribbage, which isn't saying much.

Sure, it's a fine gateway, but that's only because it feels like a card game you could play with a standard deck.  I don't think this is giving any newbie much insight into eurogames.  

Traded after 7 plays.

I think I've raised my rating on this one three times! The best quick 2-player game there is, IMO. It took me many hands of play to really come to appreciate this game. There are alway a couple of turns each hand that present the player with a difficult (and usually pivital) decision. Best played over three rounds to help even out the luck of the draw.

Great game.  Always some good decisions to make, and the speed with which we go through the deck in a game adds a sense of tension as we wait for just the right moment to proceed.
UPDATE: My wife's unofficial favorite game.  I was shocked when she sent me looking for it around Omaha because she wanted to give it as a wedding present...to one of her girlfriends.  Brought a tear to my eye, really.  Only solidifies my initial rating.

I've been hesitant about this game for some reason for a long time.  Maybe cause it seems over talked about. Maybe cause it seems like just a simple numbers game for 2 players.  I can't tell you the reason but I've just kind of blown it off.  Now that I've played it I see the appeal for this game.  It's a great fun game. Wish I had played it sooner. I have my own print and play Firefly rethemed version called Firefly: On The Job which is available here in the files section.

Classic 2 player push your luck design that entirely hinges around the decision to commit to a color, or wait till you get better cards before committing.  Exquisitely designed, this makes that one simple choice an agonizing decision each and every turn (and you will ALWAYS draw that 7 right after you play your 8)!  I prefer Battle Line, but this is pretty damn good too.

I know a lot of people like this, and that's fine for them.  But it just seems too random for a simple two player card game.  I'd rather just play gin.

A really fun game for two players.

There are some strategy and tatics on it, tough luck plays it's part in a considerable way (as, if you go to find the Red City, and most of the reds cards end up in your adversary hand).

But, as with the best games that envolve luck, it is a fast game. The box says it last around 45 minutes, but usually takes around 30 minutes or less (if you take out the final scoring).

The game is fast, fits in a is small and is affordable. Really recommended!

After several plays on BSW, it's okay as a quick two-player game. The decisions don't seem interesting enough to me, though.

This game scores points in my book as a wife game. While I'm not totally wild about it, my wife likes it and beats me regularly - which makes it enjoyable for both of us. There is very little to the game, just a deck of large cards with mediocre art. The mechanic is the key in this game. There is lots of decision-making within the confines of the very simple gameplay. The scoring takes a while because you have to do lots of adding and subtracting and multiplying. In my opinion, not as enjoyable as Jambo or Balloon Cup, but this is a good enough Knizia game, and is a good wife game.

the perfect 2 player filler game. look no further.

my own gaming tastes are changing enough that I find myself wanting to play the game less and less, though I still recognize it as a superior game, filled with the special addictive qualities that really make a game shine.

The biggest problem for me is that the decisions are either fairly easy when you have "the right cards" or impossibly difficult when you don't. In other words, there are times you have to make a tough decision but have no reason to choose 1 way over the other(s). This then becomes less about interesting tough decisions and more about getting lucky.

but that doesn't come up so often and the game is light and short enough to make it pretty easy to overlook.

One of my very favorite games, knowing how to play a bad starting hand is key.  I think I got my ability to do well in this game from my experience with Mah Jongg, where your starting hand often tells you little about where you might end up.

RATING: 6
It's a good game, with nicely agonizing decisions. But you could play this with two decks of standard cards (5 suits needed). It's not a cost thing, I just maybe want a little more to a game design than something that could be written up in a couple of pages in a book of card games. Still, it fills a certain role pretty nicely--a ten or fifteen-minute game that's light but challenging from the first turn to the last, with some "let's-play-again" appeal.

Lost Cities is a card game from the Kosmos two-player series. The object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities. Card play is quite straightforward, with a few agonizing moments sprinkled through what is mostly a fast-moving game. If you start a given expedition, you'd better make some progress in it, or it'll score you negative points. If you can make a lot of progress, you'll score quite well. After three rounds, the highest total score takes the day.

A good game with a reasonable mix of strategy and luck, where each hand is usually played in less than 10 minutes.  Best of all, both serious and more casual players enjoy playing.  Counting cards to determine how many turns are left is sometimes a bit of a drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The most played game that I own.  Whenever my sons visit, they will start up a game since it is possible to play and remain sociable.  The game requires good intuition rather than card counting, and even the luck involved is enjoyable.  How often does one draw the needed card on the last turn when it can no longer be played?

But at this point, I prefer to play Babel, Roma, or Battle Line.

RATING: 7
Decent (if typically math-y and at-first-blush-counterintuitive) Knizia hand-management game, with elements of luck-pressing, deduction, and timing. Doesn't overstay its welcome, passes the time admirably, but it doesn't necessarily set me on fire, either.  Though, come to think of it, I'm not sure if I would play a game that set me on fire.

I start by finding it just ok.  Then, 10 hands later, I'm "ok, just one more"!  Essentially tho, its just too darn light for me...

Great game, if you don't mind a bit of math at the end. 

The theme is fairly dry and doesn't come through during play. It is an abstract game about numbers, at heart.

But it is very good at what it does. You are forced to make challenging and interesting decisions and the play time is so quick that, if you are like me, rushing to the end and counting up your score is just plain fun.

Is a winner for a 2-player collection.

During my first few plays, the game's simplicity made it feel like a no-brainer filler game. As players got more experienced, however, it got a lot more tactical. Now, it provides a good challenge that requires sound tactical decisions, bluffing and taking (calculated) risks. Recommended after all, and better that its spin-off boardgame counterparts (which have too many rules considering their simple premise). Perfect as a gateway (filler) game for your nongaming girlfriend.

I bought this game at DragonCon 04.  It breaks most of my rules for a good game.  It is practically a regular card game (just short one suit).  It is really an abstract game; I don't feel any connection to the theme at all.  Why do I like it?  For one, rules are for boardgames, not boardgame selection.  Mostly, though, it is fast, and while it feels light, the choices are significant.  Luck is significant, but not overwhelming.

P.S.  My interest has dropped a little over time.
P.P.S.  After a long break, my most recent game felt fresh again.  :)

For such a simple game, this yields a lot of fun.  It's kind of like competitive solitaire in that you are both drawing from the same deck and you are trying to do your best to own a column or several where you drop sequential numbered cards. Worst thing about this game is the scoring - it's a little complex and weird that every column starts at negative points, but otherwise, this game is super fun.

The first game that my wife and I played together (thanks to the boardgamegeek community). What can I possibly say that has hasn't already been said? This game is an elegant, transportable, simple-yet-deep game that has a great strategy-to-luck ratio. Not as confrontational as Battle Line, which is the game that killed Lost Cities for us, and ultimately not as stimulating due to the lack of strategic options available. There really is no bluffing aspect to this game, as you will be penalized greatly for not being 100% committed to a column. The investment cards make for some difficult choices. We have fun in the moments when we realize that the other person has the card that we need. My wife and I would rather suffer play the deeper Battle Line (and risk getting pissed off at each other when we realize that we have no hope in winning a column!).

After bringing this game out again after a long hiatus and playing it a lot, I see a new depth of play that I missed before. Classic Knizia!

I bought LC in Miami in December '06.  It was a great surprise. First, I didn't like the card games, second, I was a little confussed, coz a tought it was Inca Gold. 
But I started to play with my wife, and since then we've played almost every other day.  I think It could be its mix on math and odds the reason why we love it, but I know for sure that the short preparation time (almost 2'') allows this game to be played every night and playing every night is what I love most

This is a great game to play with someone who has a bit of time, but not the drive to learn a bunch of rules.  My wife and I enjoy it, and we actually have a wonky way of scoring.  (This avoids unnecessary housework due to bad tempers after the game.)  Instead of adding all points and then multipliers, we multiply everything positive first, then take off points.  i.e. If we only had 10 points on an expedition, the rules would have us at minus 10 (-20 for the trip) and then  any multipliers are done.  So if we had two &quot;helper&quot; cards, (sorry, I forget the name), we would be at minus 30!  In our system, the same 10 points are multiplied first by 3, then subtract the 20 for the trip, giving us 10 points to the good.  (For a kinder, gentler world.) For all you single guys out there scoffing at my rule change, just wait till you&#039;re married!

A nice little spit of a game. Having this explorer theme connected to a very basic number system made me pause....... oh, the beauty in simplicity.  A lost city theme isn't even constructed with the physicality of this game, rather it just suggests some imagery to be created in your mind...it just lets you fool yourself into feeling a little atmospheric pleasure.  

I mean you could tear up a slab of toilet paper, put some numbers on each piece and play this game.  but i don't recommend it.  

update:  Meh.  this game is so frustrating because you have to wait......that is the strategy- who manages their bad luck the best as they wait for their cards to come in.

One of my favorite 2 player games with my wife. Yes, it is a simple card game that relies a lot on luck, but I think that's my favorite part about it. It's not cut throat like a pure strategy game and more lighthearted. I also really enjoy the 4 player variant, although you do need a second set. Short play time, virtually no setup, simple to learn, with risk taking and some strategy. Overall makes it one of my favorite games.

RATING: 7
Very easy to understand but complex enough to make it fun to play!  Has been approved by the whole family, including seniors.  You rely a little on luck and a little on strategy and it can get surprisingly competitive if you try to hoard the cards you know your opponent needs.  Not my favorite game (the only reason it's an 8 and not a 9-10), but it's a nice quick one to change up the pace between longer and more complex games.

It can play very well with 4 players at once if you buy a second game box - which was well worth it for our family.  You can play 2 games at once and then swap partners until you've played all 3 (over the course of 3 games).  Alternately, you can use one board and 2 decks of cards and let all 4 players use the same discard pile while building their own stacks.

Simple rules and a fast filler. I love the way you hand just fills up with cards you don't want to play yet and card your opponents want - and then the end game reveal, with shared groans as you each realise what the other has been holding out from you. Similar feel to Battle Line, which I slightly prefer.

I really enjoy this game.  It's extremely simple to learn and I often turn to this game to play with new gamers.  I also feel like it pretty accurately simulates risk-taking with respect to undertaking a new venture.  One might really plan well before they undertake a new expedition.  I enjoy the late portion of Lost Cities when players think things are under control and suddenly realize the game is about to end because the deck is running out and rush to finish their expeditions.

I have seen players using some techniques to slow the end of the game by pulling worthless cards from the discard piles rather than pulling new cards.  It becomes fun towards the end of the game to leverage this technique to try and speed up the end of the game to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple, uberlight, contentless game, lots of luck involved and rarely fun. Extremely pasted-on theme. It's basically cards you try to put into number-order and it really is nothing more than that. I think Knizia is running an experiment of how little design you can put into a game and still call it a boardgame, charge 20€ for it and get away with it. Only reason to play it is because it requires minimal effort and is very easy to whip out with the wife at any stage of exhaustion and that is why it will keep seeing a lot of plays and stay in my collection.

I think this is a great two player game to teach to casual gamers. However I do feel like it may be just a little too complicated for grabbing casual card players. It definitely seems to grow on people the more times they play, so maybe I just need to get them over the initial learning stage.

The mechanics of this game are straightforward, but the psychological component is delectable. ("Hmmm...my wife hasn't gone on any expeditions yet. Is she waiting for wager cards? Is she just waiting for me to go on another expedition so that she can get rid of several cards that she knows I want? Am I possibly overthinking this, or am I not thinking about it enough?") Each game goes by rather quickly, and I always enjoy the risk-reward balancing for each expedition. Of course, it's never ideal when an expedition results in a negative score, but that's just part of the fun!

RATING: 6
Gyors, két személyes játék, ahol öt színben 2 és 10 közötti értékű kártyákat játszunk ki. Minden lapból csak egy van a pakliban, és csak emelkedő számsorrendben lehet kijátszani őket, így meg kell fontolni a döntéseket. Ha nem akarunk lerakni lapot, el is dobhatunk egyet annak színe szerint, de ezek később felhúzhatóak a játékosok által, szóval amit nem akarunk az ellenfélnél lerakva látni, azt inkább ne dobáljuk. Mindezek mellett a számok előtt "fogadás" kártyákat is kijátszhatunk, amik 2x, 3x, vagy akár 4x pontértéket adnak egy-egy színünknek. 
Amikor a húzópakli kimerül, összeszámoljuk a pontjainkat, de minden szín, amiben lapot raktunk le -20-ról indul! Megdöbbentő módon a legtöbb pont nyer!

Klasz játék, olcsó, sokszor újrajátszható, több féle nyerő stratégia is elképzelhető - csak ajánlani tudom azoknak, akik ketten (is) szoktak játszani.

Rated after 12 confirmed games, but there are probably at least dozen other unconfirmed games. Quite simple two player game, where the random factor is nicely balanced by playing three rounds. Very easy to learn and play, but it takes some games to understand the couple of tricks. Enjoyable and fast game.

Updated after 8 more plays, still an ok game.

Couple of more plays, all wins...

Two more plays after a long break, both losses. A nice game, but a bit too abstract.

Six more plays, some wins, but mostly losses. Ok with good opponent, but bit boring.

I played many rounds and realized there is no "strategy" part in this game. It's pure luck. When you are forced to play tacticaly due to lack of good cards from the start, you are ussually punished even more by randomly drawing other wrong cards. Also I observed that player who draws more high valued cards, wins it. No matter how smoothly your lower value cards are played. This is the second most stupid game I have ever played, first place goes to something about mob money value bluffing which can be decided by a 50/50 draw. P.S. the obvious playability with classic deck of cards was first thing that I thought of after open it, so much for originality...

This is a wonderful balance between strategy and luck, with the tensions coming from holding onto a card, playing it, or discarding it.  A lot of times, you don't want to discard something too soon, and a lot of times, you won't want to discard ANYthing from your hand.  It has a lot of agony for such a small box.  The game may get old after many repeat playings, but it still provides a challenge greater than other games your family is willing to play.

Lost Cities is a card game from the Kosmos two-player series. The object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities. Card play is quite straightforward, with a few agonizing moments sprinkled through what is mostly a fast-moving game. If you start a given expedition, you'd better make some progress in it, or it'll score you negative points. If you can make a lot of progress, you'll score quite well. After three rounds, the highest total score takes the day.

Nothing crazy here, just 60 cards with numbers and colors. Yet, it's great.  Quick and easy to teach.  Some people I've played with get frustrated when they don't do well, but after a few plays they tend to get it.  I like that it's simple, but has lots of tension and you need to really think about what to do on your turn.  Luck certainly plays a part, but I believe skill wins this game.

I can't believe they pass off this glorified Uno deck as a boardgame. The game itself is mildly entertaining, but if I paid thirty bucks for this "adventure game" I'd be more than a little upset. Then again, this is a Knizia game...so I suppose calling it "Yet Another Set Collection Game You've Already Played A Thousand Times" wouldn't generate too many sales. Yuck.

All of my plays are via X-box live, if you're wondering why I played a game I dislike 30 times. Well, sometimes you just need a quick fix. (Or a couple of achievements to farm!)

Home-made version.

A relatively simple 2-player card game. You gather sets of card types that go in a certain order. It seems a bit more complex than Coloretto. (A 4-player variation is available, but you need more cards and can't talk to your partner.)

Either I&#039;m slow or the game offers lots of variety -- I&#039;ll assume it&#039;s the latter that&#039;s true.

Simple, elegant and light - set building with a push your luck - game. A game that can be played easily with a non gamer. You could call it a Reiner Knizia classic, but I find his games very samy and sometimes a little too clever for their own good. Still, I enjoy this one with the right company, but being so light weight, playing it would be more about the company than the game.

For a spouse-friendly game, my spouse was completely nonplussed. Indeed, of all the euros we've played over the years, this is on her short list of ones she actively dislikes.

RATING: 9
Amazingly high strategic depth to rules complexity ratio.  Seriously, reading the rules, and maybe even through the first game, it seems there's nothing there.  But it's there.

The tension is all wrapped up in timing.  Essentially, the longer you wait, the better chance of getting a huge payout.  But you have to do *something* each turn, which leads to excruciating decisions.  You also have to make sure you don't wait too long or the deck will run out with good cards still in your hand.

Our first time playing this we intended to just play one learning game and it turned into a four hour session.  That's the sign of a good game.  We don't play as much as we used to because I always win and Allison gets sick of that. :p
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun relaxing two player game that can cause tension, but not super stressful.  At first, can be a little mathy when adding up the scores, but once you get the hang of it can be really fun.  Definitely a lighter game that you need to play multiple times in order to build a strategy for the game.  love playing this game with my girlfriend who tends to kill me everytime.

The game I introduced to my girlfriend to get her into boardgaming. I know, very cliche, but it worked! Fun little game that allows just enough decision making to seem like a skilled player will win most of the time.

UPDATE: Apparently, I've been playing the game wrong with whole time! 50+ plays! My girlfriend and I have been calculating the handshake multipliers BEFORE we deduct the 20 points for starting an expedition...
After telling my girlfriend, we decided that we'll keep playing it how we've been playing it. Especially, seeing as she has won twice as many games as I have...

Well, that's what happens when I teach EVERY game we play. I'm going to miss one here or there...

Very good.  Very simple to get going.  Easy to play correctly right off, but not to play well.  A good indicator of a good game is one where you keep thinking afterwards, "ah, yes, I see where I messed up, but I know for certain I'll do better next time!  Just one more game; I really know what to do now.  Yeah, one more game."  Lost Cities certainly fits that description.

I had to keep playing this and Schotten Totten (Both Reiner Knizia games) to see which one I liked best and I give the edge to Schotten Totten because S.T. is far more chaotic and tense. While Lost Cities has those moments I feel like the ending of the game is usually predictable (you usually get an idea of who is winning half-way towards the end). Still love this one though and play it at least once a week.

I had played it online and didn't care for it. Thought it might change if I played in person...nope still hated it.  Fiancee' didn't like it either so I don't expect this to make it to the table again.

I actually didn't like how big the cards were either...they just seemed bulky.  Can't like them all I guess.

We have taken our 1999 edition with us camping over the years and this game has opened the eyes of many kids to the world of table top games.  The kids really get into the world expedition theme and it helps them understand the -20 investment cost. It is such a joy to watch the kids just learning arithmetic adding the cards in their heads and on their fingers as well as agonizing over breaking their run or fearing that they have given away a valuable card. This is my standard of a great gateway game.  It can be explained in five minutes yet has enough depth in decision making to have an appeal for all of us.

Card game, the object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities. If you start a given expedition, you'd better make some progress in it, or it'll score you negative points. If you can make a lot of progress, you'll score quite well. After three rounds, the highest total score takes the day.

Just bought this two weeks ago and have already played it close to 100 times... sweet! Very easy to learn and, so, very easy to teach to others. Also love how fast-paced the games are. Downside: I think we've played ourselves out of this one, to be honest. It's starting to get repetitive and I've noticed that a good starting hand (investments at the beginning in a suit that you have a few good cards in) pretty much guarantees victory, so our games swing back and forth a lot.

Edit: Okay, this is still so much fun to play. We've been playing it zany: go big or go home with the investments, and it's taken on a whole new level of awesome. Upgrade that rating!

This game has a grip on me unlike any other game.  It also has one of the worst pasted-on themes any gamer will ever run across.  

"... embark upon adventurous expeditions..."

I'm someone who will stretch to marry theme with mechanics in games because I enjoy picturing myself accomplishing quests or duties as a character in whatever game I'm playing.  I normally am able to find real connections, so my brain becomes more tickled with realism and enjoyment.

Lost Cities is too big a challenge for me to imagine anything but laying down cards and scoring points.  The only thing other then the numbers on each card I look at are its color.  

I LOVE THIS GAME THOUGH!

As each player continues to draw, discard or lay down cards, tension increases dramatically.  Games are ALWAYS tight.  When there are only 10 or so cards left, I'm constantly counting my cards, viewing my card stacks and calculating what my opponent needs to garner positive points.

Games end in a flourish.  Each player, after holding back from committing too much to their own card stacks during the entire match, are now laying down cards as if they're on fire.

Games are short, tense, and nerve afflicting affairs. Lost Cities is very re-playable.  Though not the deepest game tactically or strategically, it is tactically and strategically amazingly deep for its simplicity.

One of Knizia's very best.  Buy it.  :)

I like this game a lot. It is amazingly simple and deep at the same time which surprises me every time I play it.

What is annoying sometimes (especially with gamers) that after one play they say - way too simple I don't want to play it any more. This of course is their problem but something inside me tries to show how brilliant the game is in its simplicity and they refuse to see it.

Update: I played it so many times already and I am still willing to play it.

I mark a play every time I play three hands or finish the set number of games we agreed upon.  I have an ongoing game going on with a co-worker.  Not a fan.  It's just too frustrating for me which in turn makes it un-enjoyable.  I understand the math and strategy behind it but I guess I don't have the feminine intuitiveness.  Fun to play every once in a while though.

EDIT: 12/23/08 Changed from 6 to 7. I enjoy that I suck at this game. It's a fun challenge every time I play it. And I definitely enjoy the smile my wife gets on her face every time she trounces me in this game.

I got this game after already owning Battle Line and I can say that Battle Line is 100% a better game. Lost Cities is a good game and fun, but the counting of the scoring is cumbersome and the game board is pretty unnecessary. I also find that you are relaying on the draw in Lost Cities more so than in Battle Line.

This game has the reputation of being the quintessential game for couples.  For that reason I discounted it.  I shouldn't have.  This is one of the best light games for two in my opinion.  It is only indirectly confrontational which is why it plays well with significant others.  It is vaguely like Drive in it's mechanic but is utterly different and much better.  There is a surprising amount of tension between this choice or that.  Herr Knizia has done it again for sure.

I like this game better online than in person, if only because it takes a significantly longer time to play in real life. Simple to learn, occasionally painful to play, and utterly random most of the time. This is a mixture of both strategy and luck, and often results in random winner, which is why the rating isn't higher than it is. If it involved more strategy and less luck, the rating would be at least 1 point higher if not more.

RATING: 7
Not a very heavy game but a little more than meets the eye. My wife loves this game. She beats me at it regularly. It has rules that are short and simple so it is easy to start a pick up game with somebody. 

I enjoy this game because it is straight forward, plays fast and is short, but with tension and some hard decisions. It can be argued that this game can be broken down to a very simple cost optimization strategy. It seems that there is an optimal and calculable move each turn similar to Blackjack. This does not really take into account that your opponent is balancing whether to discard a card which may help you or play a sub-optimal card for themselves. This is a game with only one mechanism but one that is well chosen and balanced for this type of game.

My god I love this game!! I haven't kept track of every play before 2016, but it's no exaggeration to say that I've played it about 100 times. We always play best of three and often would do that 2-3 per week nearly every week for a couple of years.

It's quick, but frustrating in having to play a card before drawing a new card, forcing you to play when you don't necessarily want to. It's a wonderful game that can burn you or reward you for waiting too long or just long enough before playing. 

Yes the theme is just plastered on, but it's a card game and I'm rarely playing cards for the theme.

Highly recommended!

RATING: 2
Sorry, but it's just two player solitaire.  And could be played just as well with a straight deck of cards using suites instead of these cards.  The art is nice enough, and the quality of the components stands up...but the gameplay is non-existent.  I may well be biased as I've found few 'German games' that I like - too much abstraction, and the themes almost always feel 'tacked on'.

This is simply a great 2-player card game. The theme is thin (but then it is a Knizia game), but the gameplay is so strong that it doesn't seem to matter. It's a simple set collection game, except both players may well be competing for the same sets. On top of that players can cause their opponent major difficulties by holding cards that they know their opponent needs. The rules are simple: literally play a card and then pick up a card until there are none left, and then count up the points that each player has. Any set with eight or more cards in it gains a player an extra 20 points. Play and enjoy.

One of the more overrated games out there.  This one was a blast initially, but after 2 or 3 games the general strategy is fairly well known and so it comes down to who gets the best draw.  The decisions 'feel' tough, but I'm not sure it's really an agonizing decision or just being in a spot where all your options look bad.  Balloon Cup is a much better 2-player Kosmos game.

Very easy to learn,  fast to play and really portable. One of my mother's favorite, since she doesn't like direct conflict. However, it has ittle and reduced strategy depth making it a little repetitive if you play many in a row. I have in mind two or three strategies available, but mostly you have to choose the one your opponent is not choosing. It bring great tension moments and really difficult decision for the strategic depth.

I wish this game could be properly expanded to 5 players. I just don't have need for two player games.  It is however an excellent two player game.

Hra po první hraní mi přišla hrozně hloupá, ale po opakovaném hraní po netu, už mi začíná být sympatická. A je hlavně hodně rychlá!

Like Battle Line, it's a nice filler but in a game between players that are anywhere near each other in skill and experience, the person who gets better cards will win the game.

My rating has plummeted over time.  I have no idea why this is rated as highly as it is.  I really don't see the magic here.  

Wish I liked it more for my wife's sake.

23 plays may suggest that Lost Cities is nothing but a ton of fun that I can't get enough of but the more I play the more I feel those three little internet words creeping up on me: 'meh'. It's fast, it's easy to learn, and there's some level of strategy, but there are also a dozen or more other games I'd rather be playing.

RATING: 8
The complex scoring requires very risky guesswork during the game, as you try to predict out of which expeditions you can squeeze enough "progress" in order to score significantly positive points.  The overlapping, gorgeous expedition art certainly adds pleasure to playing.

8.5 after our first session.  I love the fact that it is so quick and easy to pick up.  For now, I belong to the group of guys whose wives pound them at this game.  I really enjoy the almost constant tense decisions.

Edit:  After our second play, I drop it to an 8 since I managed a 97 on the first hand.  A little more luck and less skill than I had originally thought.

Edit:  We have played this a lot, but I don't love it like I was hoping.  Maybe that has to do with the fact that my wife doesn't really love it (ie it isn't one of her favorites).  Anyway, it is an okay filler, but I can see myself liking BattleLine more (I've only played that once).

I don't really see what all the hype is about.  I could easily make this game with two decks of cards (marking one suit of the second deck so I have all 5 "adventures" available for play).  I sort of felt ripped off.

A game of probability, whose sparse rules allow flexibility in play, and whose light feel and quick play-time make it well suited to non-competitive gaming.  The risk/reward of each hand makes it fun.

After 20+ Plays: I'm sorry to promote the cliche, but this game's simplicity and lack of direct interaction do make it a very good game for non-gamer spouses.  I'd usually pick Battle Line over this though, which also features those same virtues.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed my games of Lost Cities, but I have a feeling that it would get very old rather quickly. The mechanics are interesting, but it’s pretty easy to come up with a good strategy that works consistently. I’ll play this when someone offers, but it’s not a game I want to own.

A great, light 2 player card game. playing three games in a row and adding the scores together is the best way to play as a bit of luck in one round can give a player a collosssal score.

definitely a plus with women as they can really be devious and plain old mean!! Simple to learn, rummy like. My wife's not refused me a game yet.

My son quite enjoyed it though I don't think he got to grips with the ways to be sneaky.

Played a game with my dad who cottoned on pretty quickly and seemed to enjoy it. I got the feeling he wasn't sure why you wouldn't just pay a game of cards but I might be wrong.

Extremely moreish. What I wouldn't give to complete the game with a set of 12 cards (a full exploration)!!!

The over-sized cards are a treat to hold.

Still a favourite of ours after more than 10 years.

Played Mar 2017 in V and ate pizza! Quick, enjoyable 2-player game, easy to learn.

There's a similar game called "Expedition" which can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Very simple game to pick up and learn. The idea behind winning seems easy but it does take some thought and strategy to beat your opponent. Great game if you don't have a lot of time and enjoy some mental math.

RATING: 6
I really like the hand management game play involved, but the mathy scoring bit turns a lot of people off, and also a lot of people don't seem to see the strategy and interaction involved. This game definitely has interaction, but it requires a good bit of observation and memory and is subtle enough that many people seem to miss it entirely and think it's a pretty solitary experience.

It seems to me that there should be absolutely no reason for this game to be fun, yet it defies all logic and is increadibly good.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this game, unless they are followed around by an anti-magic aura, in which case this game's mystical qualities will be nullified.

Played only on X-Box Live.  A decent, but not great 2 player filler game.  I liked it quite a bit when I first played, but quickly lost interest.  Like many RK games this reminds me vaguely of a souped up rummy.  Right now I'll play it every once in a while if I'm bored, but likely won't seek it out.

130929 As I realized I didn't like worker placement games I've ended up avoiding this game all together.  I think there was one rule that was being played incorrectly in our playing group or something...so in any case, I should try it again -- which I may do if given the opportunity and a dearth of other options.  Otherwise I think it will remain in the doghouse.

120102 Interesting worker placement game.  I don't like the mechanism that much and I don't think its particularly innovative, but I didn't mind playing it either.  There needs to be better player tokens.  Those clunky wood ninja stars are ridiculous.

Similar to Stone-age but the Ninja theme appeals to me less, although the board and cards look wonderful. There are a few different paths to victory, which means there is some replay value here, but I don't think this is the deepest game in this genre. Random card draws are the order of the day here so if you don't like this stay away. But if you enjoy "push-your-luck" style games this is a good one.

I love me some Ninja Theme.  I like this game, the mechanic of trying to vie for control of the house and earning influence which then scores you points is really neat.  I think the Stone-Age Esque cards that you build sets actually work against the game a little.  The rest of the game has cool strategy and neat theme overall.

RATING: 4
Take A to get B to get C to get D. Let you have multiple options so that more people can do the same thing. The only catch here is who gets A first or B or C or D. Randomize the score tokens and let the game begin. 

Interesting to a sense but boredom sets in when run away leaders occurs. No strategy. When it's your turn, just take a look what's left on the board. 

Good graphics. Nice theme. But did not enjoy such games.

The gameplay of Ninjato received a resounding 'meh' from me. The push your luck mechanics married to set collection / category majority was just okay. I felt like it generated wild swings of victory points, but the action was underwhelming. I don't think it's a bad game, I just can't really bring myself to care about it.

I am a sucker for anything with a medieval Japanese theme, wonderful artwork and excellent production values.  Ninjato scores on all three points.  This makes me more forgiving of a game that is lite euro fare of set collection, majorities and bonuses.  Burgling houses by overcoming guards of random values is a bit of fun and introduces a push your luck element.  Though a friend's advice before my first game that I should avoid pushing my luck seems sound.

One of the better games I played lately, Ninjato combines great mechanics with an interesting theme.

Going for envoys is win/lose business. Good mix of planning and luck. I just wish it was a bit more thematic.

EDIT: After second play the game feels better. Very balanced gameplay and good amount of player interaction. We also played some rules wrong in the first game.  Rating: 7->8.

EDIT: I have to up the rating to 9. The game has good amount of hard decicions. And as I said there's that tiny luck part which I like in games in general.

Only for 4 players.

RATING: 7.5
This game has been compared to Stone Age, but that comparison is not very accurate.  This is a better game.  Game play involves working to secure honor through several methods.  Acquiring treasures, buying influence or controlling rumors all play a potential.  The key to success is shifting at the right times to gain advantages.  This isn't about loyalty, or betrayals.  The game can be played without watching your opponents with some success, but you will need to keep an eye open to their approach.  A well timed shift can yield you the honor gain instead of your opponents.  This shifting effect gives the game a feel that is not quite role selection, not area control, or even set collection (even though all of these will be present), but instead a strange feeling of Area Collection, Role Control, and Set Selection.  It's a strange kind of mix up that yields a unique and interesting game.

Combines a lot of fairly simple tactical decisions with very tricky strategic ones. It's as tricky as balancing a (wooden) ninja star on its point!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Looks like worker placement, but isn't - your shuriken don't do anything but establish next round's player order when placed at one station. So, it's an action selection game - and it's not bad at all. The central mechanic of robbing houses is pretty neat, and a great example of innovation in the push-your-luck mechanic. I think there are some balance issues in the skills, and you can get quite screwed in terms of what cards are available. It's a bit of a devil to teach given the interconnectedness of it all, but that connectivity is part of what makes it all mesh so well.

Keressünk egy újszerű témát, és találjunk ki rá egy társasjátékot, lehetőleg minél több féle kártyatípussal (úgyis ez a divat mostanában: Drum roll, Last will). Szerintem kb. ennyi ötlet lehetett a szerzők agyában, amikor nekiálltak ennek a játéknak. A kártyapaklik egy része teljesen erőltetettre sikerült, persze vannak a végén szokásos kombózások, szorzók, de sehol egy újszerű megoldás. A téma se jött át annyira, hiába a nagy bumszli fa jelölők:) Ráadásul mivel halmozzuk a kártyákat, egész korán látszik, hogy ki nyer, nem igazán érzem, hogy lehetne fordítani. A hivatalosnál sokkal hosszabb a játékidő, pedig mindenkinek csak 21 akciója van a teljes játékban. Milyen hibát hagytam még ki? Ja, szerencsefaktor ... túl nagy! (+királycsinálás)

A nice action point allowance game. Reminds me of stone age in the way the resources are used. Has a bit of a trick taking element (player vs the game) in the way the are gathered. Did not like the fact that you can constantly mess with factions' vp after a succesful purge. That adds some really unnecessary brain burning to the game. I did like the scoring condition cards very much.

Overall I liked it.

Ninjato has been on my radar for a while, since I first read something written by its designer a few months ago.
The first thing one notices about this game is the awesome quality of its components. This game is even above the average (high) quality standards of the Z-man productions: the box and board are made of thick and sturdy cardboard, the cards are high quality, and the artwork is amazing and quite thematic.
When I finally read the rules I was a little underwhelmed: nothing particularly new here (the strenght/sneaky way to enter the houses is unusual, but nothing groundbreaking).
I must admit, however, that the gameplay is much much better than the rules suggest: the number of available actions is LOW (only 21 in all the game), there's always some meaningful decision to take, and what's most important... the game is FUN!!

I was really intrigued by this and was ready to buy/trade for it based on reviews and such (which is how I've acquired most of my purchases and has been a pretty successful method for me).  A play at a local mini-convention was enough to change my mind.  It's pretty, it's got a great theme, and I'd be willing to play it again if someone broke it out...but it's lacking that "oomph" that would drive me to add it to my collection.

Great game - like how there are different strategies you can take, its very accessible and a nice bit of press your luck.  Also instead of a standard Worker Placement game you can always take the actions but if others go ahead of you they might take the better benefits.  Good bit of area control too.  Good art and a fun game. Cant see this as a game to play every day but few are.

RATING: 7
Seems to be a rather polarizing game from the comments, which sparked my interest.  After 1 play with 4 players: Fun mixture of press your luck and tactics/strategy!  I've read people complain about there being too much luck, but I agree with others that you can mitigate this by investing in turn order and maintaining a flexible strategy.  Definitely more tactical than strategic, but there is an odd mixture there that I haven't experienced in other games.  Yes sometimes a card you want doesn't come out (not much in my game), but there are many other options available.  In my opinion, this is not much different then someone taking a card or action you wanted to take in other games.  Just plan around it! The disguise skill rule can also really help with this problem. Also, sometime you can lose when raiding a house, even when you feel prepared, but is it not a part of the strategy to protect yourself by deciding whether or not to continue to fight?  The skill tiles available for the first 4 round are extremely valuable to mitigate luck at the clan houses.  Game was close between the 3 leaders, with one player left behind (didn't have the patience for it I think). Looking forward to more plays to see how different approaches pan out, but it seems that a balanced approach is best, and of course watching your opponents carefully.  Should be mentioned that it definitely feels more thematic than most euro style games, and is a plus, but I'm used to playing plenty of games with a so called "dry" theme it wasn't going to be a make or break issue for me. My wife enjoyed it, which is immensely important, but I could see the potential need for a card cycling variant for 2 players.  This will hold a unique spot in my collection.

First Play: Rules explained by game owner who had played twice before, it all seemed quite straightforward and well structured. It was clear you needed to raid houses to gain treasures, spend treasures to gain green personalities and points and then win/ come second in the personality race to gain more points / purple cards.

So we need to successfully raid houses. And here is the first kick in the teeth. My opponants trot up and skip through the process. Three attacks later they have 3 treasures, have swapped the colour points for the house to their preference and are set to buy a personality. To cut a long story short I managed to do this successfully once in the entire game. Each time I progressed in a raid I drew a red alert card and on my final attack turned the worst possible combination for my cards;

I just need higher than a '1'......1
I just need lower than a '6' .......6
Anything but a double attack.....you get the picture

In the 5 attempts to take a chance I failed each one by ludicrous odds.

The card draws were perverse, utterly favourable for my opponants, impossible for me. I had been unable to buy personalities in the first section of the game and was on tha back foot trying to catch up from then on.  I was advised to concentrate on skills and by game end had 7. Even then the repeated draw of red alert guards and vicious elite guard cards prevented me from completing a raid on the final house. All in this was an extremely miserable experience.

I was told that I had been extremely unlucky but but game end the winner had scored double my end total. I appreciate that some people enjoy a random element in a game, but there are 4 cards decks to offer randomness and it seemed clear that these can offer cards that fall in a players lap or are of no use to player 'B' at all.

All in I found the random lottey of the various card draws excessive to say the least and my experience, however unlucky, demonstrates an unacceptable weakness and absolute chaos in the game.

The mechanic of the game is clever, and for that reason I rate this a 4, but the overwhelming lottery of the cards really determines whether you can apply any strategy. I have no intention of playing again.

Discovered this one late, but really dig it. Sort of takes the stock manipulation of Princes of the Renaissance, and combines it with the exciting theme like Ghost Stories. 

Full of great risk/reward calculations, that I love. Just tight, fairly quick, crunchy, and fun. Certainly some luck, but it is luck done well, within the risk calculation, and adding a lot of excitement.

9 rating after first play.  It was a hit with the entire family...fantastic game with quality components.  I love the various things you can do on your turn and the multiple routes for victory.  I won mainly from collecting rumor cards, only gaining scoring round VP from Envoys on the very last round.  Love the game.  Temporarily supplants Age of Empires as my current favorite.

Medium level Japanese themed Euro game. While it is still pretty abstract the theme does come through in a lot of parts of the game. I especially like the fighting/sneaking mechanism. It is a worker placement game and therefore optimizing your few actions is paramount. Other than the nice theme and components this game is pretty standard Euro fare. Well maybe a bit above avarage.

There were too many better games to play than this one. Traded away.

THIS IS NOT WORKER PLACEMENT!!

An awesome 90 minute medium weight action selection game. Lots of tension and competition. With only 21 actions in the game, it's very tight...not enough actions and time to do all that you want. A small amount of luck that can be largely mitigated if the game is played well.

The bow of humility is a real contentious issue with our group!

Gorgeous components. Gorgeous art and graphics. Well done.

I lifted this from one of the threads here at BGG:

Ninjas never cry. 

Those who are about to die at the hands of ninjas never cry either ... they simply do not see death about to strike, or if they do, look upon him with honour and acceptance. Then only whispers of ninjas remain.

You hear no footfalls
from the enclosing darkness,
just your heart's last beat.

While playing I got the impression this 'game' is more about the situation of ninjas burgling rich people's homes rather than a game where crafty ninjas are attempting to sway the political game in their favour. The burgling is nice but shallow: get a few modifiers, literally push your luck, and you're done. There doesn't seem to be much of an intelligent strategy lurking beneath the pretty exterior: well, there might be in the sense of how you decide to rob the various families and make some more reputable than others, but this isn't exactly [i]interesting[/i]. There are no challenging patterns involved; it's all about simple tactical manoeuvring and the feeling of being a ninja on the prowl.

Played this at Essen 2011. Really liked the game mechanics, but missed some form of direct player interaction. This was basically a solo game where the other players served as random event mechanisms, but where you could have very little to no direct impact on their actions or activities. 

This lack of player interaction marred an otherwise great game, so I'm holding out for an expansion which may add more interaction.

A fun worker placement game dealing with ninjas!  I really enjoy the over/under mechanic of strength vs. stealth - you can beat any enemy by going over or under their strength and this gets progressively easier with different skills you can pick up.  It also reminded me a little bit of Princes of Florence with the rumor cards juicing up your points at the end.  I'd have no problem playing this one again.

I enjoy this game it drips with theme (IMO) even though the theme is tacked onto a rule set. Many tell me it is a lot like Stone Age, but I don't know because I have never played that game. If played correctly it is a "short" game at an hour and there are many paths to victory. the final scoring means that it is unlikely that anyone is really out of a game.

Did I mention already I'm a sucker for kung-fun and the shuriken action tokens are fun.  This is one of the most beautiful games I own, both in art and game play.  The player interaction is limited to selecting actions and rewards that other players may want, but it's enough to cause very colourful outbursts.  Clearing a house and changing the family alignment can cause a large swing in points and seeing the look on your opponents face after you've executed a well prepared attack on a house is awesome.  Some people do not like the randomness of drawing guards blind in a house, but I think it fits with the theme and adds fun drama to the game.  Very underrated game in my opinion.  Love it.

Who doesn't have room for a ninja game in his collection? 

Unique design where a player can send his ninja in to houses by using brute force or stealth in order to earn treasure. There's a push your luck element when combatting the guards--but not so much luck that it can't be predicted to a fair degree. The Dojo cards you spend to do battle are also what you will need for training, so there's an opportunity cost of spending them.

Players can spend the treasure for Envoys (which award VPs in a majority scoring), as well as for spreading rumors (which score VPs at end, depending on other stuff you have and how much), scoring VPs in the process. Skills can be obtained by training, and benefit the player for the entire game, but only once per round. 

Nice design, and a medium-weight game I enjoy playing.

Players are ninjas in medieval Japan, raiding houses for treasure, and selling that treasure for victory points.  Simple worker placement game where players enter a house by either stealth or strength, and try to defeat the guards in the house to claim the treasures.  To defeat the guards you must play cards from your hand, either lower than the guard (by stealth) or higher than the guard (by strength).  If you clean out a house, you get to adjust the victory points on offer in the game.  Treasures from the houses are used to buy cards, which give you in-game majorities for victory points, or end game multiplers for more victory points.  Any treasures used to buy these cards are also converted into victory points.  Fun game, but very, very, very reminiscent of Stone Age.  Basically, this is Stone Age with the dice (and luck) removed, and cards inserted in place.  If you are going to clone a game, you better improve it.  Fortunately, they have - the dreadfully long and boring Stone Age has been replaced by a much tighter, faster and more interesting game.

Got to play it yesterday and after a few teething issues we managed to have a great game.  Once we worked out the rumor scoring but by that time I suspect everyone hadn't really invested as much in them as they should of.  Overall a really good worker placement game and I loved the playing cards to defeat the guards part.  I didn't play my copy but I'm really glad I picked this one up and look forward to another game.

10 might be slightly premature.  I equate this to Stone Age though, which is awesome.

It has light mechanics, which make it not overwhelming for new players. It also has a lot of different options, which means you get to do whatever you want to to earn points.  If you want to gain special powers, you can, or fight ninjas or recruit people, or accumulate cards.  You can beat people or sneak past them is a nice touch that makes the game really interesting.  The elite guards are cool to.

Even though it doesn't have dice, it feels like a dice game, due to the linier and random nature in how you fight the guards. You can largly negate the chance of losing to the guards with a couple of special powers though, which makes it acceptable.

The only bad things about the game are the rule book has several glaring holes in it, making a few cornor cases hard to figure out. The is also no natural circulation of the people and rumor cards meaning you can get stuck never seeing the cards you are working to compete with.

A push your luck design where you attempt to loot houses by either playing cards for fighting or stealth points. Trick is, once you commit to a path (fighting or stealth)  you have to follow it on all the guards you encounter but you don't know which way will be easier until the guard card is flipped. You could collect cards and bonus tiles to tilt your advantages one way or another. I liked all that.

While the house-looting was fun, I disliked the scoring mechanisms. They seemed so gamey and goofy in that you were often helpless if you didn't have turn order due to the luck of which VP cards come out for purchase and that they are NOT immediately replenished once purchased. This made no sense to me as the rest of the game is push your luck so why stop that here and screw people? Once someone gets the only color card available you have no chance to react on that turn. At least flip a card and give me a chance, especially since flipping cards is the basis of the other part of the game.

I'm usually all for games where you can't do everything you want but this felt too constricted for me. You could only do 3 things per turn so you spent turns making incremental improvements and possibly needing to spend one precious action for turn order. Also, not sure about the kingmaking aspect. I took an action on the last turn which gave me meaningless points as I was so far out of it but tilted the game from one guy to another.

Honestly, I resisted giving this game a 10. I played it once and gave it a 9. I told myself, "Although the game was elegant and fun to play, I've only played it once. I'm sure that time will reveal it to be less than perfect. Hence, 9." That's what I said. Then I played it again, and dammit if this doesn't deserve a 9. It's just a great game.

The rules are slick and logical, and every minute of play is straight up fun.

In the end, Ninjato earns a perfect 10.

Rumour cards seem a little over powered especially the one for the number of rumour cards you have.

Beautiful board with a theme well supported (I loved the stealth option). It is easy to learn. Good strategic planning is important, as is the right mixture of luck. There are many avenues to gaining victory points so it is often uncertain who is winning, which makes hard choices, harder. 

More games should use the clever and simple scoring track--saves a lot of space on the game board. Familiar mechanics from other games are blended smoothly, giving this game newness. Player interaction is restricted to beating out others for the most beneficial rewards. 

I am favorably impressed with the game and looking forward to more plays, as are the others.

Just as its subject might, this game slips stealthily through the shadows and shows strength where you would least expect it.

On the face of it, Ninjato is deceptively chance-heavy; but it somehow manages to be a very tight game won through strategic timing and competition. This is probably due to the fact that scoring is primarily achieved through controlled action.

I have as yet only played as one of three players; I suspect things will be a little tighter with four, and have no concerns that the random element will hold more weight with one more player.

The core of Ninjato revolves around either stealthing or fighting your way into royal houses to steal treasure and earn favor. That part is thematic and exciting.

While it has the illusion of strategy, the game has an abudance of luck which can dominate the proceedings. There is luck in so many facets of the game that one's careful planning can easily be scuttled.  I also have problems with some of the design decisions.  For example, why aren't cards in the envoy and rumor rows replenished DURING a turn?  That would help mitigate some of the luck and the frustration of having desired cards scooped before you even have a turn.  

Nice idea, but far too much luck and questionable mechanisms for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I do not hold push-your-luck games in very high regard, but pushing your luck is just half the game and actually fun here. Besides, there are ways to prepare yourself and improve your chances when attacking the various houses to steal treasures. The other available actions serve to acquire stuff, either for free or by spending treasures, which also generate victory points.

It is hard to follow any strategic plan, and for the most part you are just evaluating what is most important for you at the moment and hoping that an opponent does not grab other stuff before your turn comes again. Also, defeating all guards in a house changes the clan that controls it, and this may have a huge effect on one of the multiple types of scoring. The game is somewhat chaotic and you don't really have much control over most of it, but my plays so far have been quite enjoyable experiences. The ninja theme obviously helps.

It should be noted that, despite what BGG says, there is no actual worker placement mechanic, as the action spaces are never blocked. The ridiculously big shurikens - clearly too big for their purpose - are almost superflous, placed on the board just to remind players of what action has been just taken and how many actions they have left, except for the single spot where they determine turn order for the next round.

RATING: 7
Ninjato is a surprisingly thematic euro-style game that includes elements of push-your-luck. Set in feudal Japan, you play a ninja attempting to infiltrate the various houses and steal their treasures, all the while bribing the corrupt politicians in ways that favor you and hurt others. 

The board and cards are beautiful to look at and the chunky, wooden shurikens are a nice touch. The style of the graphic design is unique and evocative. And I personally find the theme very appealing as well. 

Although seemingly a worker-placement game, this is something of a misnomer as your "workers" will never stop someone else from taking the same action as you. Combined with the fact that you can never get more workers, this seems to function more as an action-point-allowance than a true worker-placement game. The main things you can do with your actions are steal from the rich clans, get envoys on your side, and train yourself at the dojo, gaining special powers. When raiding one of the clan houses, you will attempt to beat the house guard and take the least valuable item. But you can stay, fighting more guards in the hopes of getting more items. Of course the longer you stay, the more you risk losing of what you have already stolen. 

This is really a game for people who like their Euros with a bit more chance and risk involved. Although more thematic than some, I can't really see this appealing to the Ameritrash crowd as the game struggles in places to connect mechanics with theme.(For example, what do the victory points represent?) For me, this is a nice fit. I like euros that require more intuition than calculation, and this definitely fits the bill.

I can now see why this was so highly recommended by many last year- Ninjato is a tight worker placement, of just the right length, with a great theme and development of theme in the game (down to the shuriken used to take actions!).

The artwork and the materials are top notch- even better than the high level I've come to expect from a Z-Man game- and the game play is quick, intuitive and involving.

The scoring rounds come quickly, and there are always too many good options for your actions, making for interesting/difficult choices.  Still it's not so calculating that it causes AP- this is not a Uwe Rosenberg game.

The comparisons to Stone Age seem fair, but because no dice are involved in collecting resources/taking actions things are a bit more predictable- except when you're attacking a clan house.

The press-your-luck in Ninjato lies in exploitation of Clan Houses vs. Guard cards, as opposed to Resource acquisition via Dice pips. That may appeal more to some gamers- I think it does to me anyway.

Starting this at a 7.5 after a solo 3-player play, with the firm expectation of increasing this with further plays. Though it came highly recommended, I'd have to say that Ninjato exceeded my expectations.

Played a 2nd game same day- 4-player, and even better than 3.

(10/27/2012) Comment after one play.

After playing both Stone Age and Ninjato, I can see the various similarities, but such similarities can be found in most "worker placement" games. Ninjas/cavemen go to various houses/locations to collect treasures/resources. These treasures/resources are converted into VP in terms of lord+rumor cards/huts+civ cards. There is a significant luck element in both games, but they are dealt with differently between the two games. There are skills/tools that can be used to mitigate the randomness, but in Ninjato, there is an range of skills that go beyond quantitative modifiers, but also qualitative ones as well.

In Stone Age, the objective is to convert as many dice pips into resources, which are literally "bought" for on a one-to-one basis depending on the pips rolled. Food can be bought for 2 pips each, wood for 3, while gold can be bought for 6 pips, and so forth. However, the player must allocate a number of cavemen (with each bringing a D6) to a given resource area, meaning they must make an estimate of the probability of rolling X pips to get Y resources. Tools give additive modifiers, to smooth out statistically poor rolls, to ensure that a player will get the resources they need. These resources are then converted into VP depending on either buying huts or civilization cards. On top of this resource collection is the metagame of allocating cavemen to get more farmland, tools, or cavemen. Since these spots are on a first-come-first-served basis, and the resource areas are constrained to a max seven cavemen, the players must prioritize cavemen placement. Hence, this a good description of a typical worker-placement game.

In Ninjato, the objective is to convert the limited number of actions (3x actions and 7x turns) into as many treasures as possible, as well as converting the treasures into some form of VP. Players must go to the Dojo, in order to collect dojo cards (i.e., "fight cards" similar to Shadows Over Camelot), which have ranks from 1 to 5. The order in which they attend the dojo also determines turn order for the next turn. They can go to the Sensei, to gain a skill that will help in fighting or other aspects.

The main focus is "raiding" five different locations/castles on the board. Each castle belongs to one of three clans in the game, with each clan having a relative standing measured in "honor" or VP. Each castle is defended by a sentry, which is a randomly drawn card with a rank. The player must decide whether to attack the castle through strength or stealth. If they choose strength, they must play a higher rank fight card to defeat the sentry. If stealth, they must play a card to duck. If the sentry is defeated, the player can collect a treasure, which is worth anywhere from 2 to 5 VP when converted. At this point, it becomes a push-your-luck, where more guard cards are drawn, and the player can continue to fight and collect more treasure, or they may quietly slip away; if they fight and lose against a new guard, they would lose all but one treasure gained. If they defeat three guards, and no alarms are triggered, the castle falls to another clan, and the relative standing of the victim clan falls. The interesting contrast between Ninjato and Stone Age is that a single action (a ninja) can collect anywhere from 1 to 5+ treasures, depending on the length and strength of a player's dojo cards. In Stone Age, a player must allocate several cavemen AND roll well to collect a good number of resources.

With another action, these treasures can be used to "bribe" a lord card (each one representing a given clan) and also convert them into VP. There is a final action where treasures can buy rumor cards, which become VP at the end of the game--this is similar to some of the civilization cards in Stone Age.

The lord cards represent how much influence a player has in each one of three different clans in the game. During three scoring phases, players with the most and second most bribed influence in a given clan will gain a benefit. If there is a tie, the oldest lord (the age is printed on each card) will break ties. The majority player can choose VP, based on a mechanism similar to area control of the board, or they can draw a rumor card. The second player will receive the other benefit not chosen. This aspect increases the player interaction, as players struggle to not only get resources, but also manipulate the relative standings of each clan by defeating specific castles.

The rumor cards give each player multipliers or extra VP at the end of game, depending on how many cards are collected. A single card gives 1x, two cards give 2x, while three cards give 4x to the number of specific items the player has. The multipliers are specifically applied toward skills, elite guards defeated, rumor cards, and lord cards. This is similar to the tools/farms/cavemen/huts multiplier civilization cards in Stone Age.

Since there are only 21 actions (3 actions x 7 turns), it feels very constrained as there are no provisions to get any more. It feels more like Automobile, which only has 12 actions, and a few miscellaneous/optional actions, or Princes of Florence with 7 auctions and 14 actions.

The production values are top-notch. The immersion in the samurai/ninja theme feels authentic--it feels very Japanese. (Compare this to the pasted-on, butchered theme present in Knizia's Samurai.) For example, there seems to have been a lot of research in getting the Japanese terminology correct, and the artwork is most impressive--the lord characters on the cards are simply stunning.

There are some minor quibbles, however. The rulebook is dense with prose. Thus, the first-time rules read through can be a bit much, with many details being missed. For example, the rules regarding the sentries/guards/alarms was not explained very well, so it took our group three-four times to get the attacking correct. Still, it is a fast and fluid game, with very little downtime. There is plenty of interaction, as there are several layers of cause-and-effect in play that each player must monitor. There is also a lot of randomness, as to how treasures, lords, dojo cards, skills, and rumor cards come out, much which cannot be mitigated, similar to the randomness present in Eclipse. However, in this case, it does pay to be first in turn order, as well as be ready with a stockpile of treasures to react to the lord and rumor card draws. Although there is some chaos in this regard, forward planning is rewarded. This is a very well made game that is fun to play, making it a strong and respectable "8" rating.

Update (02/02/2013) 11 plays: Liked it so much, I got my own copy! Production values are very high with the latest Z-Man offerings. Cards are flexible, easy to shuffle, smudge-proof with shiny, linen finish. Cardboard tokens are high quality and easy to punch out with very little flare (but still not clean-cut like Uberplay's Oasis). Map is also high quality, matt finish, but prone to scratches after a few plays. 

Update (01/12/2014) 19 plays: This is a very good game, bordering on great. It scales nicely from 2 to 4 players, plays in 60-90 minutes, with both interesting short-term tactics and long-term strategy. The interplay between the competition for the lords, rumor cards, castle/clan honor ratings, along with treasure holdings of each player is absolutely fantastic, with strong interactions--you cannot play Ninjato in a vacuum. You could go all out with gaining dominance in the lords, or gaining multipliers with the rumor cards, or a combination of both, but you are not locked into one path. Although there is a lot of randomness with the dojo cards, skills, sentry draws, alarms, lords, and rumors, it is a matter of being prepared to mitigate large swings in luck. I'm upping this to a "9".

This game shares many similarities to Stone Age, which I enjoy.  However, I think Ninjato falls short because the number of actions you have is so limited.  You have 9 actions before the first scoring round, and they will probably be the same each game.  Even the sequencing of those actions is likely to be similar.  It won't get much more varied in the remaining 12 actions either, although the script switches to scoring over development.  Players are also more at the mercy of which scoring cards are actually revealed.

My favourite medium-light Euro game.  Really neat mechanics.  The martial arts abilities and the way you attack houses for treasures (and are forced to leave and/or lose when you can't defeat a guard) is cool.  However, the way points are scored seems unnecessarily complicated.  Trading treasure for envoys to earn points, or obtaining rumours to score more points at the end... plus the "disguises" (masks) to boost the power of your envoys... it took 4 readings of the scoring rules to figure it out.  But it works... and it's not always obvious which colours you want to switch a defeated house, as you might end up giving another player more points.

Well produced and atmospheric Euro, albeit with a feeling of having seen the constituent parts before in different games.

After my first play I would have put this at a seven or eight.  The last play didn't hold up quite as well.  The randomness of the game completely took one of my opponents out.  I never like to see that in a game.  Having said that I think something like that occuring is rare.  

It is most akin to Stone Age but that's still a moderately weak comparison. There is room for both in a collection.  I need to play it a few more times before I would decide to buy it.  If it goes on sale I may pick it up.

This is probably the best euro game I have played for giving you the feeling that you are playing the part of the subject matter it is trying to portray.  By learning skills, breaking into houses, starting rumours and influencing powerful house figures with stolen treasures.  Even if it is treasure stolen from the very people you are then going to use to influence.

There is certainly enough going on in this for people new to euros to be scared off but understand what is happening after a first play.

The board is the neatest I have seen. The gameplay is really good. Nine turns (with 3 actions in every turn) making it quite quick. A lot a decisions to make, but not much AP. Scoring while playing, but also end game scoring. Fun to go on mission, and that you can choose to attack or sneak. The cards from 1-5 all can be used in a good way then, cause 3 can also be used as +1 och -1. Also fun that it can be alarm, so a expert guard comes, and that you can push your luck.

What stands out most is the unique theme: as ninja, you must get past the guards and steal the treasures from great houses in order to win honour points through bribery of elders and the taking in of rumours. What makes the game more interesting is that the options are so many and the moves so few per turn. Not as interactive between players, but it's a quality game that impresses.

BIG PLUS: theme

Quite a unique game. Clan control, room invasion, rumours mechanics are unique and interesting. Players constantly need to choose whether to strengthen their clan, or to attempt to gain more influence on some other clan. Also room invasion system ensures that there are no "bad" cards. Some of them (low value) are suitable for sneaking, others (high value) for attacking, and 3 can improve both cards. Many different options and paths to victory.

Pakankamai unikalus žaidimas. Tiek klanų kontrolės, tiek įsibrovimo į kambarius, tiek gandų (rumors) mechanikos yra unikalios ir įdomios. Nuolat reikia rinktis, ar bandyti stiprinti kurį nors savo klaną, ar bandyti įgyti daugiau įtakos kuriame nors kitame. Taip pat įsibrovimo į kambarius sistema užtikrina, kad nėra nereikalingų ("prastų") kortelių. Vienos (mažos vertės) tinkamos sėlinti, kitos (didelės vertės) atakuoti, o 3 gali pagerinti tiek tą, tiek tą kortelę. Daug įvairių galimybių ir kelių į pergalę.

I must say that I was happily surprised by this game! Purchased it on a whim not knowing if I would be taken in by the ninja theme (don't enjoy war/fighting games) and having no idea of the depth of play, I really enjoyed it. It's not a war/fighting game at all and the depth comes out slowly as you get into playing it - there is a lot more to it than you think with regards to strategy. I think the theme works very well too as I found myself speaking "ninja" as I was playing! Still learning and I'm sure additional strategies will continue to emerge. Fun!

RATING: 6
Ninjato is a strange mix of very clever mechanisms and strange design decisions. Cleverest mechanism is how your "ninjas" get to attack houses with a novel over / under card mechanism which also includes a modest push-your-luck -element.

On the weirder side luck of the draw is a bit excessive for a game of this length, since there is nothing you can do about it (dealing with the effects of randomness is fun - not having any way to deal with it is not). Somebody buys the only red card and no other red cards come out for a few rounds? Then that player is going to have a red majority and there is nothing anybody else can do about it. This is made all the greater by the fact that certain important cards aren't replenished during rounds, only after them, which makes the cards cycle slower and makes the luck effect stronger.

(Side note: Ninjato is listed as a worker placement game, which is wrong. Each round in the game you take three actions, and the actions you take have no effect on which actions are available to other players.)

The game looks good, altough the board is too dark. Component quality is good.

It should be no surprise a ninja game did just that!  Got a pre-copy at Gencon a couple weeks ago and finally got around to playing it.  It's one of those rare games that I want to keep playing over and over again long after we stopped.  Very addictive and easy to teach others.  It's pretty much a ninja 'pillage the entire map of its treasure' kinda game, which is always a hoot.  Gain influential leaders and other bonus 'victory point' cards for an added edge as well.  Game board is beautifully printed, cards are nice and slick, artwork is great, components are well done.  You don't directly play (or kill) against other players, you indirectly screw the hell out of other players!  Passive aggressive fun-times - ninja style!

RATING: 5
Another euro game where the theme is pasted on the game. It's basically a resource + action management game. Nothing very unique or fancy. I am a great fan of Ninjas, but the goal of this game is far from giving you the feeling of being a Ninja. I already knew that before playing, it's just that there is so little Ninja games out there and none seems to achieve that.

As for the strategy of the game, you influence the board through various methods and you score points through various methods ... Like in any other euro game. Still, I don't think you could really select a strategic path. You cannot say, I'll focus on killing bosses and not take any characters. If yo do that you will fail. So you must try to use all source of victory point income if you want to stay in the lead, else you'll have no chance to win.

The combat mechanics is interesting and simple (which is required for that type of game), but everything else is not impressive. They give you huge ninja stars which would fit better in a dexterity game than an euro game. The starts are so big that they take a lot of space on the board. I would have made them smaller.

So if you are a ninja fan, avoid at all cost. If you like euro games, give it a try, you might like it. If you are looking for something unique and innovative, look elsewhere.

RATING: 7
Players are sending their ninjas to overthrow Houses and influence to political landscape of the Clan Houses.  An very good action and resource management game with  majorities and set collection mechanisms, in an East Asian & Ninja theme.  

Some who dislike Ninjato claim too much luck.  I think this has high replay value and given the randomness of the cards (there are 4+ card decks) it seems balanced IF you plan to be flexible (multiple paths to victory).  If you lock yourself into just only one path or strategy, then card luck will either smile upon you or ruin you.  

Also, only Rumor cards and Dojo cards are hidden information, everything else is public display.  

To me, Ninjato is elegant, has high player interactivity and rules are mostly straight-forward.  There's martial arts combat (against sentry & elite guards) for the wargamer and non-aggressive mechanisms for the Euro-gamer -- a little something for everyone.  

The game is finite (21 actions) with three scoring rounds.  Remember that TIMING is a very important issue in Ninjato!  I would suggest looking at the game in three parts, each third of the game involves an escalation to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd/final scorings.  

Players also should not ignore the end-game Rumor cards which accumulates/stack to potentially provide substantial combination Honor Points.

RATING: 6
The shruiken throwing stars as "workers" are a nice touch!  Almost worth a point in rating alone!  There are basically 5 different actions you must choose between with your three workers for each of the 7 rounds.  There are several scoring rounds based on who has majorities in the three clans and then an end game scoring based on the honor cards which can grant a ton of points.  There is also a fair chunk of points in game which are spent acquiring people or honor cards.  Special action tiles can also be purchased.  Gaining goods can be done either through brute force (playing high value cards) or stealth (playing low value cards).  Fun, quick playing game that scores like Stone Age.  Perfect 6 for me - one that I am happy to play, but not one I feel a need to own!

After watching people play, and getting a quick introduction: 

+ Nice-looking components
+ Fluid game play (3 actions, but 1 action/turn)
$ Push your luck element
+ Possibility of improving your skills throughout the game

However, the game looks a little "linear" (not much of a story) and not too exciting.

Very good game! Would love to play it again! There definitely wasn't enough actions to do everything you want to do, so you have to make sure everything counts. That being said, things can go against you especially if the card comes out wrongly. The components are really good and pretty to look at, especially that really old woman. :D I didn't really like the shurikens though, it looked too big, prolly a little smaller would've been better. Either way looking forward to next game!

Edit: the element of luck in the guard's card draw can really screw your game over and it's something I don't really fancy as it is integral to everything because you need the stolen stuffs to pay for other stuffs.

I must admit I read this one as being another lighter worker placement and had considered it with Stone Age for that reason. I did like the theme and the art and the reviews seemed positive. Having played it, I wonder why anyone called it worker placement, unless one wishes to so dilute that mechanic to uselessness? (I will note that the BGG page does not list worker placement as a game mechanic). That said, its influence from Stone Age is plain, but in the end game scoring rather than the worker placement - the bulk of the game is Prince of Florence like in the fixed number of actions it allows you. And there is the new twist that is central to the game, the run on the house to get treasures and affect the relative Honor of the 3 clans in the game that you are trying to influence. 

I love how the game smoothly moves from preparation in the Dojo to the Houses to gain the treasures and then to use those treasures to influence envoys of the clans and spread rumors. The house raiding is neat, though we commented that it is a poorly prepared ninja that only knows the abilities of the sentry and none of the occupants! But it makes the game more engaging, so we will forgive this. The one wrinkle we were not quite sure about is how the Envoys and Rumors cycle: an envoy of a particular clan may only appear once in the opening rounds, giving the player that acquired that card an edge that needed little protection. A similar problem with rumors, where the 3rd card of a set may not emerge from the deck (the 3rd is worth significantly more than the 2nd) and so the end game bonus may be oddly skewed by that. These are concerns that might be brushed aside with more play, though enough to stop Ninjato winning my favorite game for this month - perhaps a year on?

Update after 4 plays in three years: there's indeed more going on than first meets the eye. My initial doubts about the fun factor of this have been unfounded.

RATING: 7.5
Decent family eurogame with a very well implemented theme. Very appealing to kids (both boys and girls) because of the ninjas - shurikens are also a nice touch. The designers have "borrowed" mechanics from other famous games (most notably "Stone Age"), but this is certainly a good game on its own merits. In other words you don't get the feeling that you play a clone of these other games.

I like the mechanism of invading the clan houses either by strength or by stealth and the possibility of encounter an elite guard during the attack. I also like the majority-control system with the envoys cards and the clan tokens. I didn't like the ineffectiveness of rumor cards, though. The pursuit of rumor cards doesn't change at all the final outcome, which is a shame, because, at least thematically, rumors should be a strong element of the game. I also think that there is a not at all negligible run-away-leader problem, especially in 2p games.  

So, to mitigate the aforementioned problems, we use 2 simple house-rules:
[b]#1:[/b] We always have 4 skills revealed in the first 4 rounds, independently of the number of players playing. The only constraint is that the Sensei can be visited so many times as the number of players in each round, e.g. in a 2p game, only 2 times in each round.
[b]#2:[/b] The rumors cards score more points. For 1 rumor card you score 1x VP, for 2 rumor cards of the same kind you score 3x VPs, and for 3 of the same kind you score 9x VPs.

The above rules make it for a much more balanced game and a very close endgame - I would rate the game [b]8.5[/b], if these were official rules.

RATING: 7.1
This game is a good example of personal preference when it comes to games. If it were up to me, I'd trade this one away, but my husband likes it, so it stays. 

I have a couple of reasons I'm not as keen on it. The first is that I don't think it's a good two-player game. At its heart, this is more an area control game than a worker placement game. You're vying for control of the three colors and then trying to make the color you control worth more points during the scoring rounds. Like most area control games, that's much less interesting with two than with more players.

I also didn't like the fiddly nature of the alarms, and flipping the treasures, and the elite guards. We've had two-player games where that happened so rarely that all the end game scoring cards that gave extra points for elite guards were worthless and ended up clogging the card display.

I love Ninja \ Japanese themed games, and Ninjato has plenty of that.  The components are of great quality, and I love the art work; very thematic.  

The rules are pretty simple, and quick to pick up, yet allow for a lot of strategy, and choices.  I am fairly new to eurogames, as I am generally not into worker placement, and theme is very important to me in a game.  

I find that most eurogames lack a strong theme, or have a theme I am not really interested in.  This is a 1st worker placement-ish \ eurogame I was genuinely interested in (must be the ninjas).

Each round gives you interesting choices, and raiding houses (either via stealth, or combat), with a nice set of ninja skills at your disposal (which you have to learn), really makes you feel like a true ninja.  There are some nice mechanics at work there.

Near the end of the game, after I picked up some nice skills, and set of dojo cards, I felt like a real bad ass who was able to decimate entire houses, or sneak in, and out, as I please, with no witnesses.

There is also a lot of long term strategy \ goals you have to consider in the long run, such as setting up yourself with specific clans \ house-control,  envoys, etc.  There is a lot of thinking ahead that adds another layer of strategy.

Great game!

One of my all-time favorite game. It has a lot of things I love in euros. Awesome artwork, top-notch components, interconnected mechanisms, theme that comes through, high replayability, tight gameplay (only 3 actions/round), virtually no downtime because other players actions effects you. It scales okay, 4-player is a bit chaotic sometimes, 3-player is the sweetspot I think, 2-player is a little slow but there are variants that helps. The 4-player game (what I played most) took about 2 hours for experienced players in my group. (Maybe we a bit slow.)
After about 20 plays I still like it very much and looking forward to play it more. Everyone in my group liked it. Highly recommended to those who likes tight, medium euros!

RATING: 5
01/03/12 Played a four-player game. 
The 12 giant wooden throwing stars as player markers are ludicrous, and often got in the way of cards and tokens. I wonder how much their inclusion added to the price of the game for no real gaming value. I found it strange that even though there was plenty of room on the board, they didn't print some sort of iconography to show how many cards one could draw. As it was based on how many cards one already had. 
- Generally speaking I'm not much of a fan of push your luck type games. And that's what one did every time one attacked a house, which one did about 60% of the time. You think there is strategy and some control, but really there is almost none. No matter what you plan its often undone by the flip of a card. Why? Because there is a *great* deal of luck (which guard cards were flipped over, which envoy and rumor cards were revealed, which dojo tiles were turned up, which numbered cards are face up). This much luck wouldn't be bad in a 30-45 minute game. But stretched over 2.3 hours it tiresome. 
- There is no direct player interaction. One has a limited number of actions (21) in the game, and I felt using them to do certain things (picking up dojo tiles, and to a lesser extent purchasing rumor cards) were a waste of effort, as they might never pay off. So I ignored the dojo and if I got a rumor card as a "2nd place" sop, fine, but I usually took the house's VP's instead if I had a choice. 
- I suppose if one is especially enamored by the Ninja theme or if you are the type of person who drools over artwork one can overlook a great many of this game's flaws. I however neither like nor dislike the theme. And the artwork was a wash for me as well. So the flaws were quite apparent to me.

Not sold on this one... it's a worker placement game in aesthetics only; placing your worker doesn't really seem to serve any real purpose, other than reminding everybody what action's you've taken this turn(?). The meat and veg is a push-your-luck higher or lower game. It's OK, but nothing special.

This is a fun and solid game.  Does it have similarities to Stone Age?  Yes.  But it is it's own game, with a great theme that fits really well with the game play.  I own Stone Age, and like it quite a bit as well.  Now I have 2 games with FUN themes, FUN gameplay, that offer interesting mechanics and decisions.  Looking forward to some more plays of this one.

Sometimes you can really get burned by those Elite guards, so maybe just a tad too much luck at times.  Just maybe?  Still keeping my rating a 9, because of the great theme & theme integration with mechanics.  Great game!

On the fence about purchasing. Looks fun and good, nice medium weight. Love the ninja theme seems to be well balanced but will I play it enough if I have Ninja Legend of scorpian clan which I definitely will get and know I will love or will I consider this the overly Euro version of same theme (even though I know they play different and do sometimes like Euro games in the mix too though less often)

Still thinking about it, for the moment not buying.
---------------------------------------------
I know they're different styles mechanically but I'm so happy with Legend of the Scorpian Clan I might not need another game. This one sounds too euro to me while Ninja Legend of Scorpian Clan is amazingly fun without feeling uber abstract.

Update: Purchased the game and like it as a medium weight Euro game. Need a few more plays to make a good judgement.

Update: looking forward to playing again

UPDATE for a euro game of about this weight, I usually find myself playing lords of waterdeep. Ninjato hasn't gotten that many plays and I'm usually not clamoring to even though I recognize it's a good game. Don't know how long it will last in my collection even though the mechanics and bits are cool, I'm never super excited to play it.

Worker placement with Japanese ninja theme. Component quality is good (the throwing stars are a nice touch). The board looks nice and the card art is excellent. Some of said the theme is pasted on but I think that's unfair. Adopt different approaches when you enter a house, and being able to train in three serparate martial art styles is thematic. I'm personally a big fan of the theme and enjoy the push your luck aspect of attempting to make off with the most treasure while risking coming up against an elite guard you can't handle.

---- Preliminary thoughts ----

It's a push your luck game disguised as an euro. Luck will probably decide the winner, but you still have to endure a light euro structure.

Besides the push your luck element (house breaking), there's even more randomness in the sense that other players actions can modify your outcome even more than your action. 

You add everything and you notice you have very little control for a game that long. It's no necessary to go to that lenghts to play a random game.

People says it has theme, but frankly, I do not see it.

Simple rules and open strategy with only 21 actions available during the whole gameplay, which makes the game tight. In a Stone Age-fashion, the randomness in the raids can be somehow mitigated with the help of the ninja techniques you can learn at the Sensei (=Stone Age´s tools).
Absolutely beautiful to look at and thematically strong.    Banzai!!!!

Received in a trade (4/30/14). 


[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I enjoyed the plays we got in as a family, my favorite element of the game was the area control aspect that was brought into the WP genre. However; I never really enjoyed the combat aspect of the game, it never felt very satisfying. Also it was not a game that my kids enjoyed; V and I liked it but the 2p game feels very lackluster.

With so many WP games in our collection at the time Ninjato was another game that fell victim to the Jones Theory. Ninjato is still a game I would play, but I don't miss not having it in the collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production from the artwork to all the wooden shuriken.
- This is a great family game.
- This game is the perfect length, it plays in about an hour. Also the tension ratchets up after each scoring round (of which there are 3).
- The theme ties in very well with the different actions you can take.
- Ninjas, enough said.[/i]

I love the Ninja theme and Treasure tokens. Medium Strategy game that is extremely thematic. Overall great game, it is a light-Euro-ish game with excellent components and artwork that is built on solid mechanics which incorporate some strategy, luck, and risk/reward with moderate player interaction. This Game is extremely fun and is a Great addition to anyone's collection especially if you like/love ninjas! This game does not have direct ninja combat with other players the conflict and player interaction are more euro based in the sense that you are trying accumulate points via choices you make and limited resources.

RATING: 7
Spend 3 actions each round (it's a 7 round game) to collect attack cards, use those to defeat guards to collect treasures, trade treasures in for points and to collect envoy cards (aiming to have the most in each colour to score in each of the 3 scoring rounds) and rumour cards (aiming to collect sets to score end-game points). I really liked how you could choose to collect high attack cards or low attack cards, depending on what's available in the draft, in order to choose to go higher or lower when taking on the the guards. Otherwise, it's all pretty standard stuff. To clear out a house of treasure (and set the house's colour to one in which you're leading in envoy cards so you'll score more in that colour), even with the best hand, you can still get mucked around if a number of "alarm" guards get drawn (the first guard is seen, anything after that are blind draws), which not only add more guards but are drawn from the elite pile which are harder to beat. So there's some significant luck. But I don't yet have a sense of how overwhelming it is, meaning it's going to be explored further. Getting decent card-manipulation skills helps with the risk mitigation. It's a game that at the least you can ham up a bit with the theme and have some fun with.

Good worker-placement-ish medium-light weight boardgame where many simple mechanics come together. What sets this game apart from other well-known worker-placement games is the majority scorings for the clans. Pasted-on-theme.

It is okay 2 players, but better with more.

Wooden pieces. Quality cards. Rulebook needs help.

RATING: 4
What I liked:
- The high/low mechanic works really well.
- Multiple paths to victory.
- No direct pvp ninja fighting.
- Components are mostly good, although the shurikens are not that functional.

What I didn't like:
- Envoys work like an Area Majority mechanic, which I don't like.
- As a result, there is a lot of pvp interaction, including leader-bashing and kingmaking.
- Some unclear rules (mostly about the strong guards).
- Prone to mini-AP.
- Too long. Our 4p learning game took 3 hours (including 45 minutes of rules/setup). An hour would be a nice length.

Due to the battles over control of the houses, it feels more like AOE III than like Stone Age. To me, it does NOT feel a worker placement game, partly because there is no exclusivity of most actions. 

I think the current 2.8 weight is about right. Slightly low, if anything. There are quite a few moving parts, and a quite a few little rules to remember. A few of the rules (notably alarms) are not as clear as they should be.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
After having owned it for a long time, I enjoy it less and less. I love the theme and the mechanics are interesting, however, 3 shurikens is so limiting that it feels that you are forced to use them always in the same way to make sure you keep up with scoring. More and more does it feel to me that the game is only starting when finished. I find it mostly underdeveloped and clearly below its full potential.

11/13/11 - I really like the artwork of this game and the options on the board makes me feel like a ninja. I have a problem with the 2 player version of the game, since my opponent ran away with the game and I had little chance to catch him. The 4 player was tighter and I felt I was in the game all the way to the end. A solid game that I can't wait to play again. It gets a 7 only because of the 2 player game.

Ninjato is a worker placement game (actually a giant wooden shuriken placement game) in which you're trying to raid various noble houses for treasure, and spend that treasure to influence nobles for scoring rounds, gain special abilities to better perform raids, or get end-game scoring cards.  I thought the number manipulation aspects of the special abilities in raids was pretty cool, it really almost feels like you're using a variety of techniques to dodge the guards.  The noble scoring was a little swingy, as successful raiders got to determine how much each family was worth, so cards can go from really valuable to not at all valuable in a single turn.  Overall, this was a fun mid-weight game.

RATING: 8
This is a highly thematic worker placement.  I love the many paths to victory, the press-your-luck uncertainty, and more direct competing versus others.  I also like how it has little blocking like other worker placement games.  It's definitely a unique worker placement game.

My main minor issue is that there is a lot happening on the board and could take longer than what it should take.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Okay game. I guess a few house rules could fix it, but I had some problems with the design:

1) The rumors and envoys don't replenish during the round. I don't really care so much about the envoys, but the fact that the rumors aren't refilled is extremely annoying, as first/second prize in having the most influence in a house is getting a rumor card. Except if all the rumor cards have been bought that round you get... nothing? Not cool.

2) The way that drawing cards work, it's extremely inefficient to ever have more than 4 cards in your hand, so it is not smart to prepare to fully infiltrate a house, so when an alarm or two pops up that ruins your full infiltration it just feels like a kick to the nuts for no reason.

3) Since you get to pick what score piece gets replaced, the middle point values for the different houses seem arbitrary and rarely used. You either think you will win the house and use the highest one, or you think you won't and use the lowest one.

This game is a blast to play every time !!

It feels very thematic which is great for a euro game and the flow of the game was very smooth. Also, the artwork is fabulous !!

The clan raiding mechanic is very fun and very unique !! It is what makes Ninjato very unique. 

Many people feels that this game resembles Stone Age, which I disagree completely !! There is nothing in common with Stone Age except the worker placement mechanic, but that is true for most euro games so you cannot say that this game plays like Stone Age in particular.

I would qualify this game as a medium-weight euro game, which is above Stone Age, Ra & Ticket to Ride IMO. 

If you are looking for a medium-weight euro with nice theme and plays under 1 hour and half, then this game is an absolute beast !!

LOVED the first play! Similar to Alien Frontiers in that you use your actions to interact with different "stations," but since there is no dice-rolling, there is more time to plan ahead.

Plays quickly, just enough randomness, and perfect little thematic "push your luck" with night raids!

...of course, I nearly *always* enjoy the first play (novelty etc) so we'll see how this ages after a few more plays.

RATING: 8
Ninjato is probably the game in my collection that best marries mechanics and theme. However, unless players have some knowledge of martial arts / medieval Japan, that aspect is likely to get lost. However, that doesn't take away from the gameplay.

You are a master ninja and you have to learn skills in a dojo, fight sentry and elite guards, steal treasure from noble houses, recruit envoys to your cause, and spread rumours favourable to you. All the components support the theme very well starting from the workers being shurikens (throwing stars) to the skill card benefits that have a very ninja-like feel to them.

The game is based on worker placement, but the presence of one worker on a spot does not prohibit others from keeping their workers on the same spot and deriving the action benefits. This makes the game more interesting than the usual worker placement games.

Another perfectly workmanlike, utterly unexceptional Eurogame.  It doesn't do anything wrong (except for having over-sized action markers), but nor does it do anything particularly well; ad it certainly does nothing for my jaded palette.

RATING: 8
There's definitely a high luck factor in the guard cards, which can play a big part in the scoring especially if the lucky player keeps clearing houses and placing the right influence tokens. However, if players aren't afraid to get a little cutthroat there are ways to stop a runaway leader- most notably, claiming important envoys. 
There are ways to mitigate your dependence on luck, especially through skill cards. Rumor cards have a small effect too, but seem to be more of a consolation prize than a real strategy.
Really, Ninjato is a push-your-luck game at heart, and easily one of my new favorites in that genre. It helps that the board, cards and components are all high quality and nice to look at too.

Yes, it feels like Stone Age and there is luck involved (via cards here, not dice). However, there are also many paths to victory, and this is a very fun game with a great theme, that should be good for at least 10-15 plays.

RATING: 7
After a fiddly set-up, Ninjato ticks along nicely. The envoys drive the game, but there's a multi-polar tension between acquiring treasures, defeating or aligning houses, and setting yourself up for the bonus scoring. The skills add some welcome texture. Handsome game, though the theme isn't as developed as I'd hoped.

Favourable depth to complexity ratio. Plays well with three. A keeper.

RATING: 8
After about 10 plays I can safely say this will be a keeper in my collection. I have taught maybe 20 people in my games group to play this and it has got a consistently positive response. 

The first play can be a bit overwhelming for less experienced gamers but there is a lot of fun to be had once you get the basic flow of the game and understand the importance of keeping the house influence points in balance.

A possible negative can be that you have really bad luck with the raids but it is manageable and when things go badly the whole table groans so you don't feel so down about it. The push-your-luck factor will make or break the game for your group probably - I love it.

Also I have found that play time is usually close to 2 hours - possibly because I am always teaching at least one player. If your whole group knows the game and can help with upkeep (not too tricky but it does slow things a bit) then the game could probably move quicker.

If you like simple worker placement mechanics but find Stone Age a bit dry (which I do), give this one a go. 

PS: The art work is a big plus and does help attract players at my games group. Gorgeous and clearly has had a lot of work put into it.

My favorite medium-heavy euro. I would say it's somewhat  more strategic that Stone Age & Egizia while at the same time the push-your-luck mechanism stirs more emotions. For a relatively simple game it offers several possible strategies and even the necessity to balance between investing (learning skills) and cashing in (raiding houses). Less random and therefore better with four, as more skills and rumours will enter the game, but scales down quite well even down to two. I can't recommend it enough - for me it's perfect in its genre.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked some stuff. Lots of maneuvering, and the tension of desperately needing more actions that the precious few you're given. The more I thought about it, though, the more little problems I had.

For one...the luck. There are 5 decks of cards you're playing with, so you're flipping a ton of cards. Luck. Plus there are Super Power tiles that come out randomly. I could be first player, but have total crap come out; you could be first player and have the exact amazing card you need come out. Luck.

The thing that makes it worse (for me) is that none of the cards you draw from reset until the very end of the turn (other than the one that lets you draw number cards, but even that doesn't rest until the end of your action). It seems that if you refilled as people drew them, it would mitigate some of the luck. "Crap. I was planning to take that lone red guy, someone else did, and now I have to wait until next turn to possibly get one." In a game with only 7 turns, it seems crazy not to refill immediately.

Yes, you can stock up on treasures, so you're more maneuverable regardless of what comes out. But raiding houses is fraught with luck, too. I had a crap-ton of elite guards come out with my draws. I failed twice when the odds were highly in my favor. I know that's how odds work--sometimes it's against you. But the randomness just kept piling up.

I'm making it sound like I disliked this way more than I actually did. I would play again, I'm just not very excited to do it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent press your luck game. Seems to be a good amount of strategy. I like the skills, and the way the control of the clans is implemented. People will stop someone trying to get every house to be one clan that they control, and there are interesting decisions about whether you want to put a large number or a small number when you wipe out a house. It also gives you additional reasons to attack particular houses besides just collecting a certain treasure.

I was on the fence about picking this one up.  Boy, am I glad I did.  There is just the right number of actions (21), so you feel crunched to try and get everything done.  There is also just the right amount of randomness.  The theme is great and the game is easily picked up after one play, which means games play very quickly.  Downtime is usually minimal as there seems to always be a great choice for your action.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up - if you can find it.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after 1 play with 3 players.  Enjoyed it a great deal, even though I got trounced.  The rules are pretty easy to pick up, although I'm still figuring out how best to play.  In my opinion, the theme is nicely integrated with the mechanics.  Picking up new skills from the Sensei is clever, and pushing your luck vs. guards is exciting.  The game has been criticized for uncontrollable randomness (which envoys come up, who monopolizes the powerful rumors, the guards, alarms, etc.) but I have to disagree.  You can mitigate the randomness by entering into your turn prepared.  If you want to mitigate the randomness of guards, pick up some skills.  If you see another player taking certain rumor cards, make sure to get 1st pick on a subsequent turn and take what they are collecting.  etc.  I'm looking forward to a second play, and my rating may well increase.

RATING: 8.5
So far I've played almost 20 games of this, with about half of them being 2P games. Ninjato combines two things I seek in boardgames - a quick playing time and beautiful art.

This game is a spiritual successor of sorts to the highly popular Stone Age - in both games, players obtain resources through a luck-driven mechanic, and trade those resources in for either cards which allow them to score in-game, or end-game multipliers. The major difference in Ninjato is the set amount of actions and rounds, which timing is crucial and every action has to count. There is some luck involved in the draw of Dojo, Envoy and Rumor cards, so players have to prepare themselves for upsets. Also noteworthy is that Ninjato doesn't play so well with 2 as the gameplay is less dynamic this way.

With a clever mash of mechanics and intriguing theme, this should appeal to fans of Stone Age who want a Stone Age-like game, but with more complexity.

Még egy játék, amit majdnem látatlanul beszereztem, óriási hiba lett volna. Kezdem a pozitívumokkal. A játék nagyon szépre sikeredett a komor tábla ellenére is. A shurikenek, mint akcióválasztók nagyon feldobják a témát, gyönyörűek a kártyák, jó minőségű az egész játék. Japán klánok házait fosztogatjuk a játék alatt, ahol a megszerzett kincsekből nemeseket állítunk magunk mellé, akik pontokat hoznak a játék egyes részeiben. Szerezhetők a kincsekből másfajta pontot hozó kártyák is. A játék az elsőre bonyolultnak hangzó szabály ellenére, könnyed és nem nyúlik el túl hosszúra a fix számú kör miatt. Mi a hiba akkor? Csak annyi, hogy óriási a szerencsefaktor. Sajnos a játék minden pontján jelentkezik. A klánok őreinek legyőzéséhez szerezhető kártyáknál, a feljövő nemesek színénél, a feljövő őrök erősségénél, a pontot hozó kártyák feljövésének sorrendjében. Szóval a játék minden pontján. Óriási pontkülönbségek lehetnek a játék végén, ami nem igazán kellemes élmény. Kár a Ninjatóért, nagyon jó játék is lehetett volna belőle, de ez a mérhetetlen nagy szerencsefaktor sajnos megöli az élményt.

Happy to have acquired it and happy to play.

RATING: 6
It's a nice worker placement, engine building game with a good theme.  Sadly, if you take the theme out you get a by the numbers design, with a ton of luck to keep you surprised. 

There certainly are multiple paths to victory, but the problem is that you don't know whether the path you choose will be viable or not until you see how the cards play out and the caprice of the other players (with no way of cycling certain cards to get those that might help you).  

There really isn't much real strategy to speak of, rather it is more like everyone tries to course correct the ship and hopefully you can get the boat in the right direction, or get lucky enough to get the destination where everyone else is already going.  That part is ok, if you just accept that it is a tactical game. 

My real issue with it, is that if you get behind in scoring it can be very difficult to pull your ass out of the fire.  With a little bad luck you could be left high and dry.  

Still, it was really cute when things worked, but that might have been from the art and the cool shuriken.

The volume and elasticity of choices can instigate some solid multi-layered thinking, but it is largely balanced by just the right amount of luck to usually limit decisions to the best tactical alternative.  Ninjato sets a standard for medium weight Euros, especially because it has a well integrated theme.

I was pleasantly surprised by how elegant this game managed to be while still retaining a strong theme.  It reminds me of Lancaster, with its tight and short time clock but the wealth of choices.  But it's not too complex in terms of mechanics.  In fact, it is readily grasped.  It hits a "sweet spot" for me of just the right level of complexity.

Outstanding medium-depth worker placement. With ninjas! Lots of tough choices to make, a suspenseful push-your-luck mechanic when attacking the clan houses, highly evocative theme. Feels quite a lot like a slightly crunchier Stone Age, but with throwing stars, so that's win-win, really.

RATING: 7.5
Certainly a must-own for people that like the Japan clan theme, as I think there are some nice elements from it that are integrated into the play, plus the art is amazing. You do get a bit of the fill that you are gaining some skills to go in and attack guilds to get treasures.

There are a couple of solid, noteworthy mechanics to this one that elevate it over pure set collection: you can acquire skill cards that give you victory points, you can use the set collection to gain control of envoys, which enables you to get points or you can get rumor cards which are end-game scoring. What's cool is that in taking out a house you set up in-game scoring for that house and also collect treasures, making the choice for which house to attack to be interesting. Also, I like that you can use stealth to play low cards or attack to play high cards to go after the various houses.

RATING: 7
A light-medium game similar in feel to Stone Age (worker placement and end game scoring of sets of cards). The game plays quickly, lasting only 7 rounds with each player receiving only 3 actions. The board is beautiful but becomes cluttered and messy with the ridiculously over-sized wooden shurikens used to denote activated actions.

A neat action-selection, set collection, area control (sort of) game. I love the theme and the basic ideas and flow of the game. Also, the tension you feel from the fact that you want to do a bunch of stuff -- steal from houses, acquire fighting style cards, collect sets of envoys in the "right" color -- but you only have a few actions with which to do so! However, the luck of the cards -- combat cards drawn into your hand (although they are face up), but perhaps more importantly, the way the guards happen to come up) -- is a bit much for me.

I'd play it again, but definitely don't need to own this one.

--- Summary ---
Board: several houses in center, each of which gets a random guard assigned. Action areas around the edges.

7 rounds, 3 of which are scoring rounds. Each round, players will get 3 actions (using the way-over-produced-but-so-cool shuriken-eeples!); in turn order, place one next to a location on the board.

The areas/actions:
- Dojo. Draw cards = 4 - (cards currently in hand), min 2
- a House. Attack! Either by stealth or strength, using the dojo cards. Stealth: card should be lower number than guard. Strength: higher. If you win, take the lowest value treasure and place it on your shuriken. Then either run away with the treasure, or try to steal more (3 treasures/house). If the latter, draw another guard. If you lose, you get to choose 1 of the treasures you looted so far, discarding the rest. Some guards have a red symbol; if you find them, the house is alerted: add another treasure, but must defeat Elite Guard (stronger; worth bonus VP at end) to steal the last treasure.

There are 3 factions in the game, important during scoring. After emptying a house, you must change the house alignment.

- Sensei: acquire new kung fu style (discard a card equal to the number on the skill card; free if you already have that style!). These modify your card numbers during combat, or help in other ways.

- Palace.: discard treasure (required combo shown on card) to earn immediate VP and take one of the Envoy cards displayed (place face up in your play area). During scoring (end of rounds 3, 5, and 7), the player with the most number of envoys in the highest faction currently on the board scores VP. Ties broken by envoy age (shown on card). Second place gets a Rumor Card.

- Pavilion: get rumor cards (scoring bonuses; give you multipliers at end-game scoring; better multiplier with more matching cards).

It could go up to 7 in the future. The theme is very cool and the ambience provided by the artwork and the wooden pieces (shuriken) work pretty well in getting players involved in the game despite it's nothing but a pure abstract euro game. 
The strategy feeling happens to be a bit distracted by the randomness on some elements that I don't particularly like and appreciate. I also don't like some (it seems) unnecessary management elements regarding not the gameplay but the structure of the design such as the setup, changing turns, finishing the combats (winning and not winning) and even the maths at the end of the game for determining VP's.
Still a good game to play though, specially for the non-usual provided Ninja and obscure environment.

Yet another worker placement, but the push-your-luck mechanism and the freedom to choose your own path are a breath of fresh air.

RATING: 6
Interesting game.  I liked the theme a lot, and I enjoyed the push your luck mechanics for raiding houses.  I especially liked the tension of having very few actions but wanting to accomplish a lot of different goals.  The shurikens make for awesome workers, and the game looks good other than a few odd graphic design choices that lead to some confusion on the dojo (sensei?) cards.

On the other hand, I think that several of the mechanics serve to exacerbate the role of luck in the game.  The open drafts for everything are based on the luck of the draw, and for both envoys and the scoring cards it can be incredibly swingy based on what comes out.  In our game, very few blue envoys came out, and that was a huge benefit to the guy that managed to get the first one (me!)  Even worse, most of these cards just sit there if no one wants them, so these markets can become stagnant.  It feels like that part of the game is a little half-baked, and the scoring cards are pretty uninteresting.

Perfectly decent, but far from spectacular. I suspect I won't remember anything about this game a year from now, with the possible exception of the (ridiculously overproduced and oversized) throwing stars which whilst entirely unnecessary did add a small amount of theme to an otherwise entirely abstract game.

It's a pleasant game of set collection and push-your-luck. Collecting the weapon cards at the start of the game (the ones that allow you to manipulate your cards) seemed a bit of a no-brainer and consequently, I won by a country mile.

Enjoyed playing it 2 player. My wife thought it was okay, but it took until the first scoring round until she truly got it.  The gameplay itself isn't complex, as it's just an open worker placement (by OPEN I mean your workers "shurikan" don't actually block anybody else from making the same action).  However the scoring is fairly complex as there are almost 3 layers of scoring you have to take into consideration when making your moves.  Only played 4 player once, but a big variance in scoring between 1st and 4th. 2nd time through two player with my wife she enjoyed it much more understanding the scoring.

RATING: 7
In short, Ninjato has the luck of Stone Age and the depth of Caylus.  It's more sprawling than either, and there are so many paths to victory that it's difficult to assess one's score.  The environment is gorgeous and the choices are meaningful, but they decline quickly for players who don't invest in the turn order.  Fewer choices prevents vapor lock, and lady luck keeps everything bubbling along nicely.  But the luck vs. control issue boils down to time: it's a tad long for having less control than other choices. You will have an opinon.

Not exactly what I expected. For some reason, I expected the game to give me some kind of sneaking around feeling. Still a good game though. Not sure why people refer to it as worker placement. The wooden stars are simply for marking actions and the stack recording turn order.

Theme is carried out well. Sensei teaches you skills that help you rob clans better. You then offer your stolen goods to the people to spread rumors (end game points) or to envoys of other clans (or back to an envoy of the same clan).

Very tactical, with risk mitigation and timing.

First Impression:

A pleasant surprise. A good medium euro with a good working theme.

The Good: Theme. You are a ninja that trains, prepares and then goes either blades out or sneaks into guarded treasure houses to prove his worth to their owners. Now that's a theme in a euro! The mechanics work, and the winner trully feels like the best ninja of them all. There is limited luck, and since it comes from a push your luck aspect, I'm completely okay with it, I even find it good and thematic. Your decisions may seem few every round, but they're all very difficult and every round feels rewarding as you'll definatelly try to show off your skills often.

The Bad: End game scoring is a bit more convoluted than I'd want, and the purple cards seemed very arbitary and the only thing in the game that made little sense thematically. 

Overall, I really liked this game! Though a game of 2011, it definatelly is very modern in my eyes!

Ninjato is a tense, middle weight game. An excellent use of shifting allegiances (to the house clans and not necessarily other players), push your luck and multiple scoring paths. This one is fun and quick with quite a few subtleties in the decision process. Oh, and the theme isn't just tacked on to cash in on ninja-appeal, it is actually woven into the game mechanics. 

Regarding the comparison of Ninjato to Stone Age:
The games share some similar mechanisms but play very differently. The biggest difference (for me) is the way that players interact. In Stone Age if you want to affect other players you block them from taking a space. In Ninjato there is no blocking, the action selection is all about timing. Thus, if I want to affect another player I will raid a house that they have envoys to support and take it out- I am hurting them while I help myself.

Can be a bit swingy but still plays well with 2 players.

This is one of the prettiest games in my collection. It's also fun, so I don't even have to feel guilty for keeping it around based on its looks alone. The rules are fairly simple, although it can be a little tricky to explain to new players, due to the circular nature of its actions and consequences.

To put it another way, the game sort of wraps around itself so that it isn't completely obvious what you are trying to accomplish. You steal treasure to dishonor a house, give the treasure to the elders of another house and then do your best to elevate that house through robbing more houses...

See what I'm saying? It's a little obtuse, but the stunning artwork and the clever mechanics really nail the theme. Once you get over the hump of connecting the dots between the rumors, elders, houses and treasures, the game runs quite smoothly. I could see it getting a little bit repetitive over the long haul, but for now I'm quite smitten with it.

Een workerplacement die je meeneemt naar japan en de ninja's

De spelers zijn ninja's die de huizen van grote families binnenvallen om daar schatten te stelen. Maar dat niet alleen. Hiermee proberen ze ook invloed uit te oefenen op de machtverhouding tussen deze families en hun eigen pionnen zo goed mogelijk voor de dag te laten komen.

Dit spel heeft denk ik wel een beetje last van koningsmakerij en zal uiteindelijk de speler die het meest word geholpen door de andere spelers met de winst aan de haal gaat. Verder wel onderhoudend, maar niet super bijzonder.

You have 3 actions per turn and 7 turns. You score after the 3rd, 5th, and 7th turns so you have to plan accordingly. You can control the people of a color by buying their influence or try to steal the treasures from houses and get the 5 houses under a specific color or go for long range scoring with the special cards or buy more skills.

A game about being a ninja clan? Heck yeah, count me in!

Ninjato is a relatively simple push-your-luck worker placement game. It has some interesting ideas (the two ways you can push your luck for treasure; trying to get majority of a particular house on the board), but ultimately doesn't have that 'Wow!' factor: there are simply way more sleek games than this one. While the push-your-luck aspect of fighting or sneaking into the different houses is cool, it can completely screw you over (which happened to me the first two rounds) while making it a breeze for your fellow players. That can be frustrating, especially since the game only has seven rounds. I'd play it again, but may give priority to other games.

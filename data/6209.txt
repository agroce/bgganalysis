In the same league as Lunch Money and Chez Greek. I prefer the theme of Lunch Money, and the graphics weren't inspiring either.

This game has it all! Good gameplay, nice balance between tactics and luck. What can I say, this one is here to stay. It is great for those "in between" moments. I own this game for years and we keep playing it. Also played 3rd edition and I prefer this one.
Number of plays is more like 100+.

RATING: 8
The game is quite fun.  There is only two problems with it.
1) It is quite confusing to new players.  The first couple of rounds are wasted on them.
2) It can turn into a very long game.

That being said, it&#039;s still a lot of fun (zot. Zot. ZOT!) and was enjoyed by all.

Fine game as a quick space battle, not too good if too prolonged. While playing, I always start thinking of ways to add more strategy, that's why I bought Twilight imperium instead..

12/31/16:  Bang! in space.  Nice fun artwork.  This is more of a filler than a deep strategy game.  This is something that I would have loved in high school, and would have had a great time playing.  However I got rid of this because I don't think that I'd ever play it with 3-5 players, and with 2 players I'll always end up playing Star Realms instead.

There really aren't that many quick playing games like this, so I may regret getting rid of it, but it's very unlikely to hit the table.

I enjoy fast battle games but this one just didn't work for me. A bit too much depends on the luck of the cards. Hellas or Battle Cry are better quick battle games.

RATING: 5
Player elimination is a real big problem.  First game I was elimanted before I even took a turn.  Engrossing yourself in the theme (aka, sound effects for everything - "Launch the fighters!  Soon, your empire will be crushed under the might of the Mentaks!") is the only saving grace.  Wife's facial expressions are an added bonus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was a real surprise! More depth than I expected due to the movement rules, and real tactical choices each turn heightened by your 'racial' special ability. Great little game that I would be happy to play two or three times before a more serious game.

Like all things Fantasy Flight, it is full of luscious artwork. Unfortunately it is a poor rehash of Modern Naval Battles. I wouldn't replay this without house rules.

Like space based card game. Suffers from gang up on one player syndrome. Because it's based on eliminating players, he really isn't good for a large group. Some people will be waiting with nothing to do for most of the game once they get knowed out. With small groups (3 seems ideal) is simple and fun fair.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
How come nobody told me this was a Twilight Imperium universe game?  I love it!  A really fun, quick, and satisfying two- to four-player star fleet fight.  Tons of luck, but it's like Euchre... the game is over too fast to get mad about one lousy hand of cards.

This is good fun with a few players.  Player elimination can be an issue if players are vindictive.  That might be an issue or might be that much more fun either depending on who you play it with.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Really quite dreadful. Arbitrarily pick on someone to attack. If you draw good cards you'll do well. If not you'll be eliminated and sit out for 30 minutes. The theme and novelty of making laser noises sadly aren't enough to save this one. The mechanics seem very dated by modern standards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game felt much too random.  If you end up with a weak set of ships to start, it's possible that your neighbors can destroy one of your flanks and then annihilate your flagship very quickly, maybe even before you've had a move; once a flagship is left open, that race might not have much of a chance to recover.  Also, I don't like games in which extremely early elimination can lead to the first people needing to find something to do to kill over half an hour while waiting for the others to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Good game, plays fast. Not a very heavy game to play, but when you need a break from some of the other games... this is a good choice. Rules are very clear, no confusion for my gaming group.

RATING: 10
A satsifying way to kill an hour with friends.  The required use of player sound effects leads to hilarity in every session, as players try to outdo each other when using the "burp" cannon.  Try it if you dare, because you'll want your own when the game is over.

Player elimination, too random, but can be fun while you're still in the game.  I like the artwork on the cards, especially compared to the 3rd edition.

RATING: 7
A pretty good, tense game.  It might have been better done with a castle and walls theme, but spaceships work as well.  The one problem I can see is that there's potential for a game to drag on for a very long time, but this may be a misfounded fear, as it hasn't happened to me yet.  I think the luck factor some people seem to worry about is mitigated by the fact that you can discard your whole hand for a new one every turn.

RATING: 6
Magblast first edition was awesome.  This is one of the games I get severl copies of to give to friends that like it.  I was excited for 2nd edition until I bought it.  I don't like the art, and it lost the color tot he cards.  I still love the game, but Fantasy Flight messed up the cards by changing the art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Simple card game which is very random, and has a few problems: too long a game length for its randomness when playing with lots of players; and potentially quick player elimination (even within the first turn).  There are some tactical decisions to make.  The worst randomness is in the ability to get new ships, and how strong those ships can be, which tend to determine who wins.  Probably good for kids, or for adults feeling brain-fried.

Good. Pretty random, but lots of goofy space action.  Pzow!  Zzzzap!  Pchew!

RATING: 2
How appropriate that John Kovalic will be doing the artwork for the 3rd edition. This game reminds me a lot of Munchkin, thus my rating is similar to that for Munchkin. A never-ending, repetitive mess of a game. And yet for a never-ending game, a player can be eliminated within the first 5 minutes. What is that player supposed to do in the meantime?!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure why this game gets knocked around by some players.  We played three and four-player games of this all weekend and had a blast.  Other than allowing a mulligan if a player had a terrible ring of starting ships no tweaking was necessary.  I don't think I'd want to play it with more than four, possibly five, but it was a lot of fun.  (I like Kovalik, but I don't like his new artwork for Mag-Blast 3rd Edition.  It seems totally wrong for the flavor of the game...if they're sticking with the TI theme.  It would be like having Charles Schultz draw Hellboy.)  Even if you get totally screwed, it plays quickly.  It has a high luck factor, but if you don't take it seriously, it's a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably my favorite card game.  Space combat.  Destroy everyone elses flag ship.  Lots of luck involved but great game with 10 difference races to play each with their own special ability.  Tried 3rd edition and didn't like it as much.

Ugh. Completely luck-driven game that's broken so many ways that the king's men would be able to put Humpty Dumpty back together first. If you never draw the cards you need, you're left discarding and drawing. Wow, fun. Would have been better as a CCG, but even then it would have been utter trash. Stay away. FAR away.

RATING: 8
A very fun space battle card game. You must protect your Flagship at all cost, using cards to attack and defend without any dice rolls.  When blasting enemy you are required to make the "laser blast" sound effect, which makes for plenty of silly entertaining games. Try it - You'll like it.

This is a fantastic game.  I played this at a church adult retreat and many guys got into this and continue to play today.  You do not need to be a gamer for this but know that this is a guys game.

There is a significant luck-of-the-draw aspect, but the playtime is a bit too long for a filler.  However, with the right crowd, it is a whole lot of fun: taunting and threatening and pointing at the other guy.  Playing with timers can help folks from over-thinking and just shoot!

Second edition is the best. Glad I bought it when I did.

Yeah, too much luck and drags too long with many players.  Needs more defensive cards or some type of tweaking (maybe two symbols for a ship?).  Also, races are greatly unbalanced, especially the one that can discard two symbols and block a blast.

Find we play this one quite a bit though. Has a decent fun factor. Have played this at least 50 more times than I've recorded.  Even my kids like it, so up the rating.

RATING: 6
A game where you play cards and make noises.  It is great for middle-schoolers because the length, complexity, and depth are all a bit lighter, but it still involves tactics.  Ultimately not satisfying because it is prone to "rapid elimination", where one player will be made vulnerable and then be eliminated before he can react...therefore, a stomp the leader syndrome arises.

Silly space-battle fun, but terribly unbalanced and luck-driven, even for a game that light. Worse, it's all about player elimination, and I suppose it can take quite long with many players. It may be better with some house rules.

Not a bad game.  Players who get knocked out early will have to find something else to do for a couple of hours though. (We played a 5 player and 2 of the players were out early, then had to wait for a while).  2 player would turn into a slugfest.

Cool game ,but the only problem is that when you get a poor card draw you get pooched. The other players see that you have no defense and will all attack you. I do like that you get to move around your ships to the different areas on your mothership so that adds a bit of strategy.

RATING: 2
I hate games that give the illusion of making important decisions when in fact it's all random based on the whims of the game and players. Mag·Blast has one of the strongest cases of this I've seen in a game. Combine that with rules that enforce annoying humor (namely having to actually make the sound of firing a weapon) and one gets one of the most annoying games I've ever played - one of the few I will never play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light, fun game. Lots of great "Take that!" moments. Very luck driven, so not for those looking for serious strategy. Also, our games seem to drag with more than four players. Best with 2-4, IMO.

I got this game for a 20s (20-30 year olds) party expecting to play maybe once.  I was surpirsed when they wouldn't let me put it away.  We played with 8 people at least 3 times.
This game is largely based on luck sometimes, but its one of those games that is just simple fun.
Replay is very good, but the time limit of 20 minutes is an absolute lie.
1-2 hours for more than 4 people.

*Edit* I don't know what I was talking about. This game always takes like 10-20 minutes now. I gess playing with a large crowd for the first time can dramatically increase time.  One day in the span of an hour and a half we played 7 times with 4 people.

The "burp" cannon.  The "flatulance" beam.  The "nose-blow" laser.  All the weapons a sci-fi card game needs.

The second editon is a great game to play with children ages 6-12 without being mind numbing. It gives a space combat flavor without being rules heavy. The rules are a little disorganized but otherwise clear. I don't like the third edition with the cartoon art because it loses the serious sci-fi appeal for kids.

This game seemed excessively random.  Every turn I was swapping most of my cards in hopes of doing anything useful while being pummeled by one neighbour.  Our neighbours were both ganging up on the remaining player (leaving us alone) because he was more than a match for both of them together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cute game about battles with small fleets of starships. Rather high luck factor but balanced out a bit when playing in teams. Unfortunately it seems best practice to always focus on eliminating opposing team members on at a time.

The race abilities seem to vary quite a bit on power. Some are strong all the time whereas others are situational and still pay off little. If I remember correctly, one race could steal a ship three times per game, which is rather broken as ships are the scarce commodity.

I'll play if proposed, but this is not for me.  Too chaotic.

RATING: 7
A good filler or party game if you are in a take-that mood. Surprisingly good with 2 players, maybe because you avoid the waiting time involved with player elimination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Quick and easy with 2 players, although not at all challenging or engaging. 

Horribly tedious with 6 players with absolutely nothing to do when not one's turn.  Please just shoot me before making me play this with a large group again.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice upgrade from the 1st edition. The card stock is thinner (and cheaper). Differences in card design means you can not mix these cards with the 1st edition. (too bad) I rated this one half of a point higher than the 1st edition due to the nice additions to the game and the improved art work.

RATING: 6
Fun and furious, but very very luck dependent in 2-player play.  Traded.

RATING: 7
I'm totally digging this game. Only played with two players so far.  Looks like would be great with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Too random; card draw much more of a factor than strategy.  I consider a game broken if it's possible to be out before one's first turn, which it is in this game.  Good atmosphere, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Strange game because it can vary so much in 'fun' factor from game to game.  One game will have everyone yelling threats, cursing opponents, and generally having a good time while the next one will degenerate into an 'are they done yet?' stalemate between people.  I would personally suggest some sort of varient that speeds the 'end' game up, as the game can drag on forever at times once you get down to the last two people.

I suggest Bang! over this game.  It is the same basic idea but much more fluid and less frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice, but light game. Entertaining. Well worth its price. Best as a quick two-player game - it can drag with a large number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun. Game can last for hours but also can be played in a couple of minutes. Depending only on the cards you get. I truly liked the 2ed's graphics, they looked quite like the graphics of Master of Orion.
A way to spend some time. Not great tactics or big plans involved. An easy and nice game.

[i]Great fun.[/i] The artwork is much, [i]much[/i], MUCH better than in the third, [i]and newer[/i], edition.

(5+ plays) Too much luck.  It would seem to have some strategy, but it is phantom strategy as it comes down to lucky card draws for the two remaining players in the end.  It reaches a 5 rating because of the noise-making.

Light, fun strategy game with lots of theme. Makes a great filler game. I've seen complaints that you can get knocked out before your first turn. I think my copy of the rules says you can't attack someone who hasn't had a turn yet. Even if they don't, that's an easy fix to a perceived problem.

Got this game early after getting into board games.  Remember it being ok.  Don't know if I will play it again.

Remember it being relatively short, but somewhat interesting in trying to protect your mother ship while destroying the other guy's ship.  But don't remember being jazzed about what should be a really great theme.

Great little game that my son and I like to play. We have instituted some house rules that really help. The rules are: we roll a d6 on a blast and roll of a 6 is a miss. Also, we go two rounds before you can attack or use your special power.

I like 2nd Ed. better.  The cartoon theme of 3rd Ed. edition bugs me.  Good game.  Do not play with more than four or the game grids to a halt.

Played 1st game 6-22-06; rules are quite clear and are only 3 pages. Very easy to catch on to.Stick with 2nd ed if you don't like the more cartoonish art of 3rd edition (due out approx. late July 2006)Don't expect deep strategy and you should like it. Playing 3-player got five games in in 2-1/2 hours at a church game night. Shortest game was 10 minutes; longest was 30 minutes.

This is my all time favorite game!!!  If you love sci-fi and fast paced exciting games you can't go wrong with this game.  I throwout the sound effect rule, it's a bit silly.    However, this game is so addicitve its not even funny!  Of all the games I own this is the most requested game I have.  No other game can touch Mag Blast in the fun department.  Go out and buy this game!!!

Even with more cards adding new circumstances, 4 More races, and a few new rules to think about, the time it takes to play this game has not increased one iota.  Now that&#039;s good stuff!

I think I like this best as a two-player, but this is great with three or four as well, although play-time and down-time expands as the number of players rises.  Fun game, fast-playing, and a good combination of luck, skill and individual rule-breaking which keeps each game fresh.  This game always makes us laugh, even as our ships  get blown to smithereens.  I really like the artwork in the 2nd Edition best.  With one opponent or more, this is a game I'll always play.

What sin could a man commit in a single lifetime to bring this game upon himself? Is it against the Geneva Convention to force Saddam Hussein to play this game for the rest of his life as his punishment? All luck here. A truly awful excuse for a game. Players can easily be eliminated before they even get a turn (Gee, that sounds fun!). I ended up giving away my copy of this "game" to one of my friends. I really felt guilty afterwards. A shameful waste of time.

RATING: 6.5
Being a Twilight Imperium fan I love the theme.  This is a light filler game full of space combat. I found it to be a little longer than it should be for what it is, but only ever so slightly.  Gameplay is quick and we played with the requirement for space laser sounds upon card play, which improved it (despite many of my cards not being played due to forgetting to do sound effects).  Unfortunately at it's core it's an elimination game but it's play time helps keep this more reasonable than some games.  I didn't mind this one bit.

This is a great game. Elimination can be a downer, and I think some powers overpoweredÂ… Only time will tell, but setup is painless and play is quick. I can't wait to see the way balancing is achieved with 4 players.

Only played it with exactly 2 players, but lots and lots of times, often for hours. A 2 player game can take anything from 5 minutes to 1 hour, is never, ever balanced but always fun for fans of space action and producing your own sound effects. Real Sci-Fi lovers should prefer 2nd edition over 3rd because of the more realistic visuals, although 3rd offers some minor gameplay tweeks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
10+ plays, 3 and 4 players. OK. Tried different variants of instead of last man standing wins, you get points based on what you destroy... better that way. Want to like this game, but don't. Maybe try with some more tweaks, but not going to suggest again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a solid filler with a fun theme.  The only downside is the variable length.  A game of mag blast that goes over an hour with only 3-4 players can be a bit annoying, especially if someone is eliminated early.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun, very remiscent of games like Family Business, Battle Cattle, etc.  Great theme, nice artwork, only negative is that the game can drag on a bit if players don&#039;t move quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It is a fun game. Cards decide most of your strategy. Starts with your species and ends with getting the wrong blasts for three rounds and no new ships... luck rules. Like i said it is a fun game where the players have to make funny blast sounds to make it a hit. Too ambitious = frustration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun, light but strategic, battle game. Sound effects required but it isn't all just kicks and giggles. Take time to enjoy it and try the multi-player aspect. UPDATE: After several plays this game can get a bit long - especially with more than two players. Alliances between weaker plays to gang up on apparent leader can cause a see-saw effect that prolongs this game. I prefer it as a filler and sometimes it goes a bit long for that category.

Takes first edition and adds more things to it, but the balance of cards needs some work.

RATING: 5
This game is playable, but it's not on my list of favorites.  I will play if my gaming buddies are in the mood for this one, but I certainly don't suggest it!  The mechanics are simple enough, but it is really more based on the luck of the draw with a bit of strategy in placement of ships and play of cards.  It's much more fun with several players.

A fun game of space ships.  It's all about the cards you draw (high luck factor), but it's fun to play and usually quick, so I don't mind loosing all the time.  Make sure everyone playing makes sound effects, it adds a lot to the game!

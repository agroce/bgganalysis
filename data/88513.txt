Simplistic version of Kremlin, although I prefer Nothing Personal. This is quicker, however.

RATING: 6.5
+ The cajoling between players makes this one of the most social board games that I've played; The theme is light-hearted enough to take the teeth off of the back-stabbing that would otherwise lead to hurt feelings.
- Components in the game could be of better quality.


Why it's previously-owned:
This really didn't hold a candle to Cosmic Encounter as far as enjoyment level goes.  Both have negotiation and back-stabbing, but CE has so much more.
This was traded away for Firefly: Artful Dodger.

I had high hopes for Chicken Caesar, but to be honest I had never looked at the rules before having the opportunity to play. It was really just a lot of moving your chickens around in offices, voting, and taking small little actions to finangle your way to the best set of office tokens on chickens. It never actually felt like I was *doing* much of anything... I know higher player counts than 3 might be more interesting, but it's eh. I don't really care for it.

Amusing little negotiation game.  FLGS has a store copy that I'll crack open every so often.  Main benefit is that it's amusing and doesn't really overstay its welcome - mechanics are a bit fiddly / nonsensical.  Not sure how many strategies there are.

Fun negotiation game. Has a definite "rich-get-richer" issue, especially when combined with the fact that your chickens can be eliminated.

One of the most enjoyable games I've had the pleasure to play.
If the players are intent on keeping their chickens alive the game will drag, and probably be less fun. But if death isn't seen as something to be avoided at all costs the game is good fun.
Also has no randomness as everything that happens is chosen by a player.

A negotiation and voting game set in a chicken coop with a government inexplicable based on the ancient Roman Republic. I really like it, with its very streamlined mechanics. The theme seemed problematic when I first heard about the game, but they work, giving the game a lighter feel than if it followed a more serious theme.

So far, it's been good. Three players seems not quite ideal, but did cause a lot of brain-burn in anticipating where the vote marker would end up. 

I'll need to play more to see how experience informs play on this, but the interactions of the offices and voting does make for some wickedly delightful screw your neighbor decisions.

RATING: 3.1
I am a fan of Kremlin.  I think it is that it brings negotiation and backstabbing in without making things too complicated.  That way you have fun, instead of worrying about rules,  i.e. how votes split, tiebreakers, who should do things first, etc.  You can tell Chicken Caesar tried to be the new Kremlin by trying to remove some of the luck involved.  However, in doing so, it forgot to make things fun. Yeah, negotiation games are horribly table random.  If they aren't fun or funny, as it may be, then everybody leaves with a bad taste in their mouth.  It is bad enough that you don't have much control.  To make the game have this illusion of calculation is just adding injury to insult.  It makes me so glad I own Kremlin.  I'm a Eurogamer, and Kremlin is Ameritrashy, but Kremlin really is the quintessential influence/negotiation game.

Played a terrific game at Euroquest 2011 with Game Designer John Sizemore and 2 friends from my local game group in Baltimore. This game has a lot of unique elements to it. The way in which roosters ascend in rank is fairly well done. The elections are excellent, very neat mechanic. The tax collectors and guardians are very good elements. Money element seems balanced. Had a GREAT TIME playing a fun political game.

Cons: I thought our game was too bloody. I felt like I never really got a chance to "get attached" to my advancing roosters before they got killed off. The designer did remark that our game was especially bloody, but I would like to see fewer deaths and more negotiating. It's probably our fault we did not negotiate enough, it being the first game for 3 out of 4 players. I would take out at least one of the Traitor cards. The theme is wacky, and takes the seriousness out of the game, but will help sales if this game goes into production. If Nevermore names it something boring like "Consuls of Rome", it is not going to sell. But with a name like Chicken Caesar, it is just strange enough and good enough that it may break through a crowded marketplace.

I highly recommend this game to others, and can't wait to play it again.

Weird Roman chicken theme. Yes, Roman chicken theme. Your moves in the game can be calculated so there doesn't seem to be a lot of room for negotiation anyway.

Pros: Designed tightly and seems balanced.

Cons: Not terrible but really uninspired art, probably due to the weird Roman theme clashing with the chickens. More functional than comedic.

I was hesitant to play this game, because I'm not the best at manipulating tables or making "mean" plays - but the mechanics of the game made it much easier to do both of those things, and I ended up really enjoying myself (and am looking forward to playing it again).

I thought the theme was also very clever - and not just the title. It kept the game light, even as our roosters were dying left and right. The artwork supplements the theme nicely, and I thought the rooster cards in general were quite well done.

A game of politics most fowl.  Wait, let me try that again.  A political game of beak-stabbing and press-your-cluck.  No, no, no!  One more time.  Politics in the Hen house.  Can you rise to the position of Caesar, or will you suffer a Coop-d'etat?  Augghh!!

Seriously, the puns flew (oops!) fast and furious in this game of Roman politics in the chicken coop.  Plenty of political intrigue, deal making and breaking, and other fun.  It looks complicated at first, but ends up playing rather quickly once you get the hang of it.  I don't quite have the strategy figured out, but it's definitely worth a few repeat plays to try it out.  So don't be a (wait for it) chicken, give this a try!  
And yes, the very bad puns were part of the fun.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A negotiation game with a fun theme about chickens in ancient Rome. Quite a lot of moving parts to keep track of in the beginning, but after a few rounds it settles into a nice, cutthroat pattern of jostling for position, bribery and general conniving. 

Rating almost certainly will increase with more plays.

Slightly awkward game of political backstabbery - the political hierarchy and voting mechanics are unique and it works despite the theme hinging on one huge pun.  Like any game with open negotiation it can get bogged down, but had fun playing it once.

It's a very fun game, and a much cleaner game mechanically than my favorite backstabbing negotiation game, junta. However, in a way this cleanliness takes something away from the idiotic unfairness that makes these games such a hoot. It's still a good game, but I don't think I'm dying to play it again.

RATING: 5
Area control/negotiation game - get your Chicken meeples into various roles in the Senate of the Coop in order to influence outcomes and gain role tokens which will earn points at the end of the game - each Chicken may only hold one of each role token so progressing through the roles is important - although additional role tokens may be awarded postumously! Role tokens are always worth points but sets on Chickens (dead or alive) are worth progressively the most points.

This game is all about the negotiation as the actual game mechanics are limited.

All the bits are very good quality and the art is good - I got the kickstarter upgraded Chicken meeples and stickers which are a very nice enhancement - although they do not fit back into the box? - doh! The rules are Ok but you will need a bit of study/re-reads as a couple of the mechanics are not set out as logically as they may have been. Definitely better with more players.

I was so excited to play this game as it features a lot of negotiation and high screwage potential but it just left me a bit cold. The main reason is there's little you can do from turn to turn other than hope someone will take your bribe instead of that of an opponents. Taxing is boring, placing vigils and traitors is only slightly better, the consul does basically fuck-all, and the senate doesn't even get going until the third round or so of the game. Then, when there is something to do, it always comes down to a vote which you may get shafted on due to your place at the table. At least there are so many, many rounds - too many for a game of this depth. It just felt interminable and I wanted it to end even though I knew we were only two rounds from the end. Bummer...

The rules can be a small hurdle, but this is how negotiation games ought to be. It's really a close cousin to City of Horror, another such game I appreciate--it's got fewer special actions and powers and far more room for wheeling and dealing, though. This is vicious and awesome.

Plays quickly and has lots going on, but seems like it gives a huge starting position advantage to the 1st player in a 5-player game. Money distribution can also be uneven and the 'memorialize' action seems exceedingly risky in most cases.

Would play again (especially because you can do a full 5-player game in an hour) but not something I need to own.

RATING: 8
(12/2012) The humorous title belittles the deliciously intricate, Machiavellian, cut-throat, knife-fight-in-a-phone-booth politics game. The game mechanisms are deceptively simple, leading to reckless wheeling and dealing, in order to get one's chickens into positions of power. The action is fast and furious, amoral, chaotic, and unpredictable, just like politics should be, except it is with chickens. The theme is well integrated, and since it is about chickens, one cannot take it too seriously--we were laughing and chuckling all throughout the 2+ hours of play.

The voting mechanism is probably the most innovative aspect of the game, where turn order, where the Suffragium marker is, and the personal aspirations of each player will determine what chickens will be elected into specific offices. Each office has a specific power, and that power is shared by three different chickens of descending seniority, with the exception of the Censor, where there is only one chicken. The Caesar merely gets money, but can veto one election. The Consul can bestow postmortem achievements on dead chickens, if the bribe is right. The Censor can exile a chicken from office. The Praetor can set up the guards to protect each office from the foxes surrounding the coop. Finally, the Aedile can levy taxes. As chickens hold various offices on their way to becoming Caesar, they collect achievement tokens, which are first "banked" to the specific chicken, with extras being turned into cash. The tokens can also be later attributed to dead chickens through the Consul office. The key is to, as a whole, collect larger sets of specific office tokens to score significant amounts of VP.

It is the interplay of the upper and lower offices that makes the game intriguing. Money is VP and is also used for bribes, but tax too much and more foxes show up to eat more chickens. While the Praetor is in charge of protecting the coop, since the office is shared with two others, a player does not have complete control over the distribution of guards for the four non-Caesar offices. The Censor can remove himself or another chicken, depending on if he is in danger of being eaten, or if he suspects another chicken is getting too powerful. The three Consuls can accept bribes and bestow improvements to monuments for fallen chickens. If the Caesar can preside over a turn without losing any chickens, he can remain for another turn, enabling him to make even more money. However, the stress will eventually kill him, leaving a vacancy to be filled in with an election of one of the consul or praetor officers. Bribes can be made to buy votes for or against, which makes this a very wheeling and dealing kind of game. As described here, this probably doesn't make any sense. It is one of those games that simply needs to be played to fully appreciate the whacky-ness and complexity of the game.

The components are very good, especially given that this was a Kickstarter. We all wish there were more instructions on the board, however. It turns out although the game concepts are very simple, the rules are extremely dense, with paragraphs of many, many sentences to explain a procedure, so the rules had to be consulted continually to go through each phase of the game. Rules explanation took over an hour, at which point some of us were ready to throttle each other. Our first game took just over two hours. This has been compared as a streamlined version of Republic of Rome. Possibly more accessible, yet just as meaty. Such a political system would be at home in a game like Twilight Imperium! Initial rating a solid '8'.

I played Chicken Caesar at Dollar Con and it was a blast. I believe it will be an often played game for groups which enjoy negotiations and exploring a wide range of strategies.

My favorite of the dozen or so games I played at Dollar Con.

2014-01-27 Changed rating to 8 as it can be hit and miss depending on the group. Still qualifies as a "10" when we play as a drinking game (a player must down a shooter every time he or she loses a chicken).

One of the best game box covers I have ever seen, love the theme.

Unfortunately, I only got this to the table once, and it fell kinda flat. It may just have been us, though. But then I decided that I would rarely bring this out over other negotiation games (Lifeboats/Rette Sich were Kann, I'm the Boss, Intrigue), particularly since the rules for this one are too complex for my family and casual gamer friends.

RATING: 5
This is more fun than my rating suggests. In every play people have laughed a great deal, and thoroughly enjoyed the backstabbing and negotiation. The game works best, in my experience, when people play fast. The voting, the negotiation, and the suffragium marker need to move along quickly. When people stop to think this game through carefully it tends to drag this game out. The more we play this as a strategic effort the less I like it. But when we play it as a rapid-fire attack-your-opponent game the social aspects of the game shine.

For most people I think this game will rate in the 6-8 range. My rating is on the lower end because every I've had to teach this every time I've played, and that takes a while. I would rather jump in and play this several times with the same group. My estimation of the game could rise in that situation.

Fairly simple and enjoyable game of political maneuvering. I like the frivolity of the thematic setting, but others might not enjoy it so much.

The game needs to play fast to be worth it. If it stretches past 90min I think it has taken up more time that it deserves.

One thing I dislike about it so far are the winning conditions. I find them thematically somewhat disengaged by the 'set collection' element.

RATING: 4.5
Played twice, 5p, 6p.  This game is strange, in that it has a curious mix of fairly think-y mechanisms with a goofy theme.  This is really not a good game for me, since so many actions are up for bid, very similar to (Traders of) Genoa.  Without some house rules (specifically, about bribes) this game can devolve into a long tedious mess.  It is quite easy to be left with one (out of 4-6) player piece to try and score points with.  However, this is not as desperate as it sounds, since the players will "go after" players who have more scoring pieces, etc., since the game ends when a player has no more scoring pieces.  I'd play again, now that I have a better idea of how long it will take to play, but I don't think 6p is the ideal number.  Second game, with 5p, was literally one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had, and was an example of how a game like this can be completely broken by people that want to throw the game to a specific player.  I really see no reason to play this game again ever.

The Gaius family motions that the senior Aedile from the Pontius family be given up to the Fox for the good of the Coop. Wait, what?

This game takes political negotiation games and adds exactly the right dose of theme to make it wacky, chaotic fun rather than the recriminatory brawl that can result from other examples of the genre. Just the box is enough to trigger laughter, and the game itself only gets better from there.

My big find of 2014.  Picked it up at Orccon flea market after admiring its theme from afar.  After a ho-hum first play, I tweaked the rules slightly... 3 coins to start and the tax rates fluctuate by one space instead of two, and the game shines.  Loads of fun... many moving parts, but they fit together well.  The "open season" bribery aspect is terrific, and the games I've played to date have all been surprisingly close.

(After one play) Plasy smoothly, but ends up fairly predictable in the decisions and outcomes, even with the table-talk and deal making/breaking. Despite open information, it's the sort of game where perception of who the leader is ends up mattering more than who it actually is and you need to mentally calculate each players' score and what they need to increase it every turn to keep abreast of the state of play.

The big problem with this game is that it is wide open for a player (or players) through maliciousness, or inexperience, to utterly tank the game, or Kingmake. So much so that it rather makes it not worth the bother.

Not a bad game. I'm not a fan of the negotiation parts, but the placement of your chickens, how much you try to keep them alive, and what you generally spend your time and resources on make for some interesting decisions.

The designers (led by John Sizemore) gave a demonstration and play of this at Dollar Con, and hilarity ensued.  I lost miserably, but the game was hugely fun.  Bribery and backstabbing are the order of the day, and the theme just ices the cake.  The artwork is terrific.  This goes right to the top of my buy list.

Update:  I taught(!) this (not always perfectly correctly) three times at the Fall 2012 Dollar Con.  Any game I'm willing just to play three times in one weekend has to rate a 10.  Kudos to John and Brian, who have created a masterpiece!

If you enjoy games where "you do unto others before they do unto you" then this game will appeal. It reminds me of Quo Vadis in the underlying structure and voting movements, but there is more depth to the gameplay. Blackmail, persuasion and backstabbing abound to make this a really nasty game.
GREAT FUN!
I am looking forward to my next game.

First play, 5 players: had a BLAST!  Definitely must put a time limit on negotiation (the rules suggest 10-20 seconds, and that would be good).  Played with intense negotiators and it took us waaaay too long. Must be willing to bribe and break promises in order to win.

Don't know why, but the game didn't get me. While playing, it felt like the game was playing itself, rather then I was playing the game. 

I mean, for the Aediles in most cases they just want a high tax rate, because it gives them more money (excuse me, I mean Frumenti), and most money is the goal of the game. The Praetors will place all Vigil-cards on locations where they have roosters and the traditors 
where they have none. The Censor simply choses the rooster of a player who is doing well at the moment and the Consuls, why shouldn't they approve the proposed monument if the pile of money underneath is big enough, after all, again, the goal is to have the most money, and maybe 1 player would have a greater return, but you also win against the other players. 

In some odd cases an other choice can be more logic, but for 90 - 95% of the time that is what every rooster in every office will do.

I guess the flavor of this game should come from negotiations, but even there, there is little margin to convince a player from doing something at a reasonable price.

Lost points because of the stupid chicken theme. Would have been more engaging had it be Rome (or 'space Romans' or whatever). 

While does remind me of Republic of Rome, it's a bit disingenuous to call it RoR-lite. CC, while certainly shorter, also stays on the table too long (for what it is). This mainly due to the negotiation. Even with it's "10 second limit" rule -- which is impossible to enforce -- the negotiations just make it drag. 

Not bad, but a missed opportunity.

A fairly simple, blood thirsty game of negotiation.  The "chicken" part of the theme seems tacked on, but is the game itself is mostly abstract anyway.  
Not a favorite in the collection, but fills a niche I didn't have covered.  I think I'd like it more if it was slightly more involved beyond place/resolve/vote.

There is ZERO luck in this game. You play as friendly or as bloody as you like. Turns flow fast and smooth with plenty of bribing/negotiation. Points are scored by collecting multiples of tokens- the catch being each chicken can only hold one of each token and sometimes a chicken may die before attaining all of them. No worries! Death is just the beginning in Chicken Caesar.

It's all about negotiation and setting yourself up to be more of threat than what you let on. A lot of bluffing and backdoor politics. You have to be a bit devious to win at Chicken Caesar, but I've yet to find someone who finds it too cutthroat. It's light-hearted in nature, yet devilish in execution.

A few things wrong with this one:

1.) Rules pretty hard to follow even though the game itself is pretty simple.
2.) It's one of those games where the other players can take someone out of the running in the very first turn and the player in question won't be able to stop it. In our 6 player game, 2 players were basically eliminated from the running after turn 1 (they both lost 2 of their 4 chickens)
3.) Game takes a long time for what it is. I would have enjoyed this a lot more if it were a filler (30-60 minutes).
4.) It seems to have a major first player disadvantage factor in the 6 player game. Everyone except the first player gets 2 chickens on the board.

Thanks Quinn!

Get VP's by holding offices in the pseudo Roman government of a hen house. Higher ranked seats get more VP's and more of one type have compounding effects.
Essentially no luck involved at all which is good. However nearly all decisions in the game are made by popular vote. Including who is nominated, who dies, etc. 
My final verdict on this one is still out. Seems like the winner isn't necessarily determined by individual skill (even negotiating skill), nor who the other players want to win, but more the one who cumulatively has the least animosity towards them.

Still in development, but working toward something like a zero-luck update of Kremlin. We don't have Kremlin's hidden faction mechanic, which is a pity, but we do have brisk gameplay without dice, which Kremlin lacks. Of course, there's plenty of opportunities for negotiation and backstabbage, too. The voting mechanic is, so far as I know, totally unique. The scoring borrows from Tigris & Euphrates, but (unlike T&E) allows some benefit to a big score in one area. This is going to be a fun and unique game.

UPDATE: On the boat!

This is a pretty nifty little negotiation game.  The rules are clear, concise, and well-designed.  The game flows very smoothly and doesn't last too long (once you know what you're doing).  The theme is goofy which you can have fun with if you're into that sort of thing like I am and games of this variety always offer a lot of engagement that can be fun as long as you and your group allow the double-crossing and back-stabbing to roll off your back.  The scoring system is clever and the different mechanics of the game all work very well together.

After our first play I thought it was too easy for Caesar to die in office but after thinking on it I think it is actually pretty perfectly designed.  Not only is the office of Caesar powerful both in scoring and money-making potential but the veto ability gives you pretty good control over the game which you can levy with other players to your benefit or simply to advance or save your own family.  Also, without the high death rate of the Ceasar the game would increase in length, which as I said, already hits a good tempo.  So while it is easy for the Caesar to die in office I think it needs to be for the balance of the game and if you do manage to manipulate your family into the right offices or pay for the right favors to survive a second term in office (or even survive both terms) you will, and should be, heavily rewarded for such play.

We played with 5 which felt perfect though I can't know for sure having not played with other player amounts.  I feel like fewer people would give each player too many family members in office and allow them to game the system too well without enough risk and more (6 is the max I believe) would narrow your options too much to where some of the strategy of the system is drained from the game.

The game isn't without its faults.  It's not as deep as I like a game of this type to be and for that reason I don't see a lot of replay value in it.  Nor does it make for very interesting plays once you've discovered and used the few tricks present in the system.

My group is also pretty deep on the casual side of playstyle and more hardcore gamers would certainly drain any fun out of this game as each bribe would turn into an analytic economic calculation for the best return.  For me, in order for negotiation games to stay fun you need a quick impulsive mindset when approaching deals and you need to occasionally make mistakes, otherwise it just turns into math homework.  Hardcore gamers might also not be as adept at letting the nastier elements of the game go.

I know it seems contradictory to want a deeper game that I also want to continue playing with a very casual crowd but that's how I feel.  This is an excellent and superbly-designed game, I just wish there was more to it.

Chicken Caesar apparently started with an attempt at creating a zero-luck Kremlin: dice rolls are replaced by negotiation and a unique voting system.

Each player takes a family of roosters, who may take up offices with the Aediles (set tax rates), Praetors (defend against fox attacks), Consuls, or become Censor (KGB chief) or even Caesar. Being in office grants a token; points are awarded for sets of the same token. The powers interlock cleverly, both with each other and with the voting system. It's possible for a player in the right places at the right time to do exceptionally well, and though I haven't see it done [i]deliberately[/i] I can imagine what actual skill could look like.

Happily, or unhappily, it can certainly provide "Kremlin moments" -- joyous (?) exclamations when the Traditors are revealed and half the roosters on the board die, when someone successfully stacks an office, or a vote is unexpectedly confirmed (despite a hefty bribe to the contrary!). I was afraid that it would be Kremlin with all the fun surgically removed and I am delighted to find otherwise.

The obverse is that it seems more chaotic, and with a lower emphasis on negotiation and forward planning, than expected. 

In practice, the increased player agency makes teaching a chore and play somewhat more difficult than Kremlin. The result is that I don't know what niche the game is for: not heavy, not light, but a sour spot in-between?

One quibble is that the components could have been designed to make things a little easier (like an indication on the board of the special rules regarding bribing a Traditor at the Consul's office, or on the tax track of how far up and down the middle Aedile can propose a rate in different circumstances). The special handmade upgraded rooster pawns seem worse -- harder to see the numbers on at an angle -- than the basic blocks. John Sizemore's advancement flowchart should have been in the box.

An ambivalent 6.

I enjoy negotiation games. For example, I can really get into a good game of Diplomacy or Intrigue. Chicken Caesar has some interesting ideas, but seems under-developed. For example, the idea of promotions and voting for political positions is solid. Many of the rough edges can be forgiven because open negotiation, as a mechanic, tends to smooth things out. But negotiation is not enough to save CC for me. There are many interlocking systems to keep track of, with euro-style VPs (or money) to earn. On the other hand, all of these points hinge on a system that combines auction mechanics (i.e., bribes) with open negotiation -- and it just feels off. Whoever holds the "chicken meeple" has so much power to cast a deciding vote that he can demand payments from others. These payments are essentially windfalls, and have nothing to do with negotiation skill. Instead, the payments have everything to do with where you happen to fall in the turn order for that round. It just ends up feeling arbitrary. On top of that, certain bonuses, penalties, and votes (especially accolades and Caesar's veto) can seriously hurt a player without any recourse, or even an opportunity to negotiate. Overall, the game is opaque in certain places, arbitrary in others, and frustrating all around.

Very happy I kickstarted this game!  Played with 4, 5, & 6 players so far (like 5 the best). Finally, a roman politics game that appeals to me.  Theme-wise, I love how the game is completely deadpan serious with its ridiculous premise. All the art is regal and there are no cards with funny text to read; the humor is intrinsic. 

The game also has stricter rhythm than most might expect.  Each office does something different, each round has segmented phases where the rooster token is passed from player to player as death, taxes, & appointment to new positions is proposed and seconded.  Light enough to be a gamer party game, heavy enough for new gamers to sink their teeth into.  It's a totally sweet game.

In theory, with calculation-prone players, this should be a horrible slog in which everyone calculates the exact value of every single move and then charges you that much for it...

...but I have yet to play with any of those people, so it's instead an elegant, fun political game with a very clever voting mechanism that moves briskly and bloodily and is generally a hoot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Elegant, I liked it a lot. At first glance it looks like Quo Vadis or Lifeboats, but it doesn't feel broken as these do (to some extent), and traversing the board isn't the point so much as collecting "insignias" for occupying each space. Many actions are joint (using voting-like systems) and have repercussions beyond, say, harming a certain player.

I do have a doubt or two, mainly regarding the question of high taxes and upward mobility vs. lower risk of fox attack. If there is a fox attack, the results could be hard to predict. How often is it possible to calculate that a high risk of fox attack is desirable?

...Revisited months later. I wondered whether playing vaguely similar games (such as Putsch or Democracy: Majority Rules, games I give decent ratings to only grudgingly after inventing variants) I would find Chicken Caesar not as entertaining anymore. Fortunately I still find this to be a slick game that asks players questions I enjoy thinking about. It seems chaotic, but it's completely deterministic (though with a little secret guard deployment) so I often have "aha" moments where I see the outcome of something and think I might've been able to predict it. (Although, actually paying close attention to the movement of the voting rights marker is pretty Euroey/tactical and not a ton of fun in itself.)

That said, I started to feel a lot of deja vu with the patterns of fox attacks. I'm told this game is usually played with a high tax rate but I still can't imagine how the Aediles can think it's good to have taxes high when this creates a real risk of killing off your rooster in exchange for just another coin or two. The game is inherently rigged against that office.

So, what I tend to see most turns is that the tax rate is lowish. The Consuls can buy off one traditor so there is usually not a death there. (I missed this rule back in the day and I think I dislike it.) The Censor can usually guess whether he needs to go into exile, so there is usually no death there. The Praetors usually don't assign traditors to themselves, so no death there. And the Aediles, finally, usually see a single death, unless none of the Praetors tried to save any of them. And this single death also brings down Caesar.

...Tried 4p instead of 6p. Deaths seemed slightly less predictable but alliances seemed more likely to cement into a 2-on-2. More willingness to raise taxes meant the game had tons of money. The Censor's ability to save someone other than himself for a measly dollar is never ever used. Praetors throw traditors at the Censor's office and don't even have to feel bad about it because they know he's going to take off.

I think the game is held back by the chore of calculating point deltas (such as when a Consul considers taking a bribe) and doing ply analysis to guess who will have the vote when.

I think my tastes are drifting away from this kind of game, but this is still among the best in its class. It's not a large class.

Seems to be a cross between a job promotion game (King Me, Kremlin), an area-based voting marathon (Mall of Horror), and a geometric scoring of token sets (lots of games).  And while I'd agree with the designer that the style of voting in [i]Caesar[/i] is out of the ordinary, but I'm not sure that the voting method is particularly exciting.

But there are special powers associated with the job titles (a plus), and the taxation and fox attack mechanics give the game an interesting spin.  I'm still not convinced that the monument/accolade phase is mechanically sound, since I don't see why anyone would accept a bribe unless the offeror is clearly losing.

I'd play again, and my rating could honestly go up or down - which is fairly unusual for me.  Unusual is a good thing.

Took a while for things to move smoothly. I think a second play would take much less time and go over very well. Once people are used to how it works, it's a pretty good game. There are just several moving parts that make entry a bit prohibitive unless you play it multiple times.

The different offices balance pretty well. Caesar is practically a death sentence but you get a lucrative insignia. Aedile is also a death wish. Praetor seemed pretty powerful, as well as Consul once multiple players are attempting accolades. 

The voting process is a bit weird at first and I felt the rules were a bit out of order.

Unique theme and gameplay made this a must have kickstarter project for me and I'm glad I jumped on board.  The play is interactive and people who enjoy negotaition, bribery and backstabbing will be right at home at this one.  For all that its really a convoluted set collection game with just enough moving parts to be a bit heavier than you might expect of a primarily social game with a pun for a theme.  I actually found player positions rather hard to read without taking a lot of time to calculate... which doesn't matter too much unless you are expelling people in the Censor's office... but can reduce my enjoyment of a game if it doesn't clear up a bit with experience (Update: I'm still having trouble picking out the leader without mathing it up... but I'm not finding that to detract from my enjoyment of the game at all.)

All in all a solid game that is probably a bit too group dependent. I ended up having a lot more trouble getting this to the table locally and ended up trading this away.

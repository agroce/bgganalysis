Excellent game that's light on time and heavy on probability.  We completed our first 3-player game in under 15 minutes and had fun doing so.

The game is too simple to keep me interested. It's maybe worth playing once or twice, though I had to coax people to even get a second round. I can't imagine it being a game you play week after week, or even more than once or twice a year. There's just not much there, with little variation between plays.

Too much luck and in my opinion it's as boring as yatzy.

RATING: 7
Good dice filler that was better than expected. In most cases, it seems better to keep your gems for victory points rather than spend them for their special abilities. But having the option to spend them for a potential bigger payoff is a nice Press Your Luck element.

Too much going on for a quick dice game - we have to ignore the gem's spending power.It was a great value, even if we had to modify the rules for kids.

The more we play, the more I love this game! We take out the special powers when playing with the kids and I just love the look and feel of these vibrant gems! Especially love the ruby and sapphire!

RATING: 7.5
Fun little game with a quick pace.  Game doesn't drag, since its length is tied to the amount of gems in the bag.  Be careful spending those gems, though--the first time I played, I lost to my wife, 14-83!!! :D

I love the little gem stones. Kickstarter Collector's Edition--Acquired via Kickstarter.

RATING: 8
Dice quality was poor in the first edition. Most pips have fallen out from just rolling the dice in standard gameplay.

With that said - If my wife and I had to pick a game under 30 minutes and call it our favorite, this would be it.

I backed the first and second edition on Kickstarter because dice, gems, and dwarves. We were not disappointed. Everyone that we've broken this out with has enjoyed it.

Simple dice game which did not quite keep me entertained. There's quite heavy rich get richer aspect in the game but in a short game like this I can live with it.

- Dig Down Dwarf: Gems of Norcia

I seem to be on a rough patch with Kickstarters lately... It's been a long time since I've truely received a great game from a campaign. That said, this isn't a horrible game. It's just not a particulary good game.

Updated: 1/14/2015

I played this as a two player game and I feel it worked out very well. With two players there is more of a combative element to the game that is missing with a larger group.

Print and Play version. Unique, liked gameplay, my husband tried to stick me with the negative points from the citrine, but I showed him with a SWAP power! I think I will make up a more detailed reference card and print up a couple copies. We found ourselves constantly checking the rulebook on the different parameters for powers and rolls.

This is my kid's "go to" game.  It's quick and because of the luck of the dice, they win often (which beating daddy is a luxury to them).  I enjoy it well enough.  It definitely is a good/quick filler game.

While the game is based on luck and randomness, it's a fun game to play with kids and teach them various suits that are present in other card games.  The quality of the dice in my set was not good and I will need to repaint the pips.  Some of the gems are difficult to see depending on how your lighting is.  Overall, I thought it was a fun casual game.

Just not fun. Decisions are obvious and mostly involve keeping gems rather than using their special powers, at which point you're playing a game that's like Yahtzee with fewer possible combinations and less skill in figuring out which combination to go for at a given time.

Redeeming factor: The plastic gems are really, really nice. Just the right weight.

I admittedly like dice games (I don't mind a bit of randomness) and I am really liking this one.  The game is well designed, with actual moments where real decisions are available.  Which gems are you looking to obtain?  Which Dwarven power should you use?  Help yourself or hurt your opponent?  How much should you pay for extra rolls?

RATING: 5
Very fast and very easy to teach. There is luck involved as in any yahtzee-dice-rolling game, but some simple mechanics make it a little less luck dependant and develop some kind of strategy. The cons are that if one does get behind in the begining of the game he will get less and less chance do reach out the other players, because he won't be able to use the mechanics that mitigate the luck, while the winning players will be able to use it frequently.

Can't say anything about components because I played my own PNP version.

Possibly the most fun game I played in 2014. No matter who we played with, everyone seemed to get into dwarven character and have a blast. No play session ended with one game, often going 3 or 4 before packing up. 

There is a LOT of luck needed to win the game, but every game is anyone's game. The thematic element is really what puts it over the top.

How can you not like this game? Sure it's random--it has dice in it. Certainly, I've seen other games that mitigate dice better. Alea Iacta Est comes to mind in a slightly heavier weight bracket. Neverthless, with such a small footprint, great components, simple rules, and fun gameplay, it's hard to go wrong.

Game plays fine.  Gems are nice.  Fun with the kids.

Art?  Not so much.  Dwarves don't look so hot.  Not so sure the unlocked stretch goals to add new characters was a good thing.

Gems are nice and this is a fun dice roller but the dice are very poor quality. Wish the focus of the game was actually nice enough to use more than few times. Bag also came undone almost immediately

This game is like Yahtzee, if Yahtzee was actually a good game, instead of something you play because there isn't a better version of it.

Except now there is a better version of it, one that actually is a pretty good game.  Doesn't take as long either.

The components were crap. Between the poor choice to use square cards and the dice with pips falling off, pretty much tossed out this game and put the gems into my collection of misc gaming components.

The game itself was fun to play and I've backed the 2nd edition, which both improves upon the quality of the dice and gets rid of the square cards.

nice jewels and bag but the dice are v poor quality and not flat on all sides. Game is nice and quick though with interesting push you luck with the decision to spend gems to reroll the dice and get the better jewels in the middle. Like the '1' cant be rerolled and '6' can always be rerolled though the dwarf powers appear to be understated with only 1 or 2 powers being activated during the past couple of plays. Glad I kickstarted this at this price.

A very simple but fun dice chucking game. It has some rich get richer issues as players have more options the better they fare, but as the game plays quickly that is not a major concern. I replaced the (faulty) dice with translucent casino dice which fit the theme much better.

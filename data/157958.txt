RATING: 3
Somehow this game chose everything unsatisfying about running dungeons and made them the focus. First off, this game is like playing 4 boring single player games in a group. Character interaction is limited to combat where one player acts like the monster. Somehow the cards and rules made a simple rock paper scissors system seem convoluted. Beyond that, many cards will automatically kill you, including cards that should be helpful. Death means you are either taken out of the game until it ends, or you use the house rule that you lose all your cards which means the game is a slog of moving from room to room until someone leaves with 100 gold. If anyone wants this game from me, you can have it.

It is a typical ameritrash game. It is a fast-paced game of dungeon exploration and looting for one to four players. You take on the role of a hero who sets out to explore Dragonfire Dungeon and claim more treasure than your rivals. Along the way, you'll need to evade traps, battle monsters, and find your way through the labyrinthian dungeon, all while trying to avoid waking the dragon who sleeps atop the treasure heap at the dungeon's heart. The player who gathers the most loot – and makes it out of the dungeon alive — is victorious! It has a nicely done rock-paper-scissors type combat system, and very nasty cards. Be lucky if you can exist alive!

RATING: 1
Revised rules takes the only salvageable part of the entire game and tosses it out the window for rock paper scissors. So now you have a randomized movie, not a board game, with random instances of rock paper scissors. How the hell is this supposed to be a game?

There is probably no other game that kills your character off faster than Dungeon Quest, e.g. sometimes literally on entering the board. There is probably no other game where that is also fun. The promises and hazards of dungeon crawling include anything from finsihing as a hero with so much treasure your character is hoping he/she will never have to crawl dungeon again - with the dragon in the treasure chamber still slumbering - to avoiding or blundering into traps, fighting all kinds of monsters or dying alone and wretchedly in a closed up chamber near the entrance, clutching a single gold coin. That is a very wide scope, and the player has to be able to deal with it. The reward is always the adventure itself, with its surprising twists and actions, whichever outcome lies in wait.

RATING: 7
It is a luck driven game without a doubt, but with that said, there is some strategy to the game and while there is some strategy to be had, the tactical choices that one makes during the course of a game do not always pan out.  I actually think that a 4 player game provides the most information as to what moves would be considered the right move.  Even with all things planned out, it will come out to the luck of the draw or dice in the end.

The game doesn't take all too long to setup, play or cleanup.  Sometimes play time will be shorter than setup time.

If you want a strategic romp look elsewhere.

This game will be the funnest when everyone understands that you are entering a dungeon with no planning and hoping to come out with treasure while fully realizing that there is a better chance that you will ultimately die.  There is very little logic to the game and everyone is more or less at the mercy of chance.

I have personally found it more interesting if you understand the relative percentages by examining/analyzing the cards and tracking success percentages as the game progresses.  I think of it in the lines of counting cards when playing Black Jack.

Fun game of dungeon crawling with luck/unlucky elements.

Great components as usual from FFG. It is quite good to play solo or with the spouse on a sunny afternoon or evening.

Certainly not comparable with Descent2, but far better than I thought.

1 1/2 thumbs up and the 8.0 rating is certainly deserved.

RATING: 7
Dungeonquest is fast-paced and fun and the rules you need to know before you start playing take just a few minutes to teach. As you'll read in every single review of this game, it's highly luck-based. This is not a tactical RPG but rather a quick and fun romp through a dungeon that is accessible to players of all ages.

It reminds me of the Fighting Fantasy books I grew up on in some ways. Particularly the way taking a wrong turn can end your adventure in unlucky fashion, or a random encounter that should end in your favour doesn't. While it lacks the sense of story of those books, DQ has all the twisting and turning passages, deadly traps, encounters with monsters you're always better off avoiding... that feeling that every move could be your last. 

The components are really nice. Miniatures and lots of fun tiles, tokens and cards. For fast setup, you'll need to keep everything well organized. 

My first few plays, I loved contemplating my randomly drawn character and rune at the outset, fantasizing that I would survive with my cunning and my unique set of tools. It's not the case. Sadly, death is frequent and is usually the result of bad luck, so I stopped investing myself emotionally in my characters. That's a big part of the thrill of this game but it's also its biggest drawback. The objective is to survive the dungeon with the most loot, but realistically it is just to survive.

Characters do not interact--you are playing your own game vs the dungeon more than you are playing against your opponents, but since the turns are short and exciting, everybody feels invested at all times.

This edition includes the Catacombs, a brilliant feature that gives characters a greater breadth of options and gives the dungeon an added dimension with little added complexity. 

When your character dies, you can just start over with a new character and 0 loot and still have a decent chance of winning. Since you can move your new character along parts of the dungeon already mapped out by previous characters, it's fast to catch up. Therefore, character elimination does not equate to player elimination and everybody gets to have fun till the sun goes down and the dungeon is sealed shut.

A great feature is that the game can be modified with a little imagination. One day I am going to ramp up the character abilities to see how that affects the fun.

Hahahaha oh man, this game. Up to four foolhardy adventurers reckon they've got what it takes to earn fortune and glory in the dangerous depths of Dragonfire Dungeon. SPOILER ALERT: they really, really don't. It's entirely possible to set foot on the first tile of the dungeon, set off a trap and have your head removed from your shoulders immediately and humiliatingly by a swinging blade. It's also possible to tread your way through the winding tunnels and passageways, steal incredible riches from under the nose of the sleeping dragon, carry it all back until you can almost smell the fresh air of victory, and die of a tiny spider's bite as you paw feebly at the exit door. Hey, it's even possible that you get out of those cursed corridors with something to show for it, but just know that the chips are stacked against you. A hilarious and unfair push-your-luck game, DungeonQuest is brutal and wants to punish you for your hubris, and I love it for that.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This is better than the 3rd edition, as the combat in the 3rd edition was just dumb.  The combat in this isn't exactly what I would of liked to have it changed to, but at least it's short.  This is a really fun push your luck game that always offers tons of laughs and an awesome story.  Not something I need to own, but something I am sure I will be playing for many years to come. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy the simplicity of this dungeon crawl. I also appreciate the meta-game that comes up after multiple plays — the temptation (and possibly pressure from other players) to push toward the centre if you start one particular game with early luck. You wouldn't get a feel of that part of it just playing it once.

I don't enjoy the combat, but (again) I at least appreciate its simplicity. I understand the previous edition had an "improved" combat system which turned out to be clunky and didn't have a lot of fans. Yeah, this is glorified RPS, whatareyagonnado.

While I haven't played a tonne of dungeon crawls, as it's not normally my cup of tea (Dungeon, Drakon, D&D Castle Ravenloft, Descent), this is my favourite so it's a keeper.

There is still no good successor to Sorcere's Cave. 

But this one is OK, especially if you replace  the card-driven combat system (e.g. get out the dice from One Ring / Hobbit Tales). See also: Middle Earth Quest (tiny, picky cards), Star Wars Rebellion (not improved by the addition of more plastic minis...). However, for a good card-driven combat system; see Richard Sivél's Friedrich.

Component quality and artwork are up to the high standards you would expect from Fantasy Flight Games.  Not a game for everyone, but I really enjoy it.

A better version of Talisman, but that's the best anybody can say about it.  The game is almost entirely driven by luck, with very few strategic decisions.  The more interesting decisions used to be in combat in 3rd edition (with a lot of interesting combat cards), but that was removed in the Revised edition and replaced by a simple rock-paper-scissors system to resolve combat. Awful game.

This is very random - second game I drew a trap tile and failed the test in the very first room - dead. The good part is my opponent was able to go through his whole game in about 15 minutes - nearly escaping but dying at the final room - was epic. The play time and fun of watching the other player(s) means dying early is not as bad as it could be. Great components (a few rule ambiguities) but a fun game for sure.

Lots of fun- played it twice in a row. First time three of us died in the dragon chamber, one died on his way out by drinking a potion. Second time one escaped with two dragon treasure with only two possible sun turns left.

Interesting game in that there is player elimination, lose your turn (or turns! as in up to 4!!!) events, all sorts of "criminal" infractions against what is considered good game design these days, but it still moves fast enough for these to be forgiven.

So far it is fun, but as we play it, it's superficiality may become apparent... but then again, the dice odds design of the game may keep it fun. Will have to see.

Lots of luck required, but it's OK given that everyone suffers for the most part.

RATING: 8
Competitive multiplayer solitaire roguelike experience. I don't like playing multiplayer solitaire games at all, but this hits ALL of the right feelings that I want in a roguelike board game. Being able to play as a monster to screw someone else over and make them lose over half their life in a single battle is satisfying. Going into the catacombs and popping out right next to the treasure room is satisfying. Dying by any number of means is satisfying. Successfully leaving the dungeon with less than 100 gold and being the only person alive while everyone else got too greedy is immensely satisfying. This game satisfies me.

The global ideia and some of the events are fun, but the players can´t control any events at all, usually not even where they are going...and, after all, is almost certain they will die and there´s nothing one can do about it!

As short as a dungeon crawl can be. Not quite filler but highly random due to card draw and dice results. Players can be eliminated rather quickly even though there is an opportunity to play rock-paper-scissors with cards in monster combat.

A huge amount of tiles but could use a card expansion or something to increase replayability. Gets a small pass on the theme.

Scraps the awful combat system from the third edition in favor of a breezier rock-paper-scissors style mostly identical to the original game. Character abilities have been tailored to reflect this as well. 

The scattered other small changes (monster hit points are now on cards, tokens are now placed on spaces that have been searched) make this one the Fantasy Flight edition of choice. 

Just know that your fate is dictated almost entirely by the draw of the tiles! And the will of the dragon...

Very fast and easy dungeon game that plays well solo because of the challenge. High production value.
In 2+p mode surviving is not that difficult, scoring high is.
The game is simple but they give you two rulebooks: awkward.
Setup is not neat as there are too many decks. At least one should be dropped to give place for the monsters deck on the board. Body and cript decks could be - should have been - merged.
The stair counters are cumbersome and not necessary: the triggering card would better be an automatic catacombs entry option; or just increasing the number of printed stairs would achieve essencially the same result.
Art is adequate to what feels like light Medieval Sadistic Gothic Horror!
Language imprecisions and a few omissions spoil the fun a little.
The solo play would be improved by a custom combat die and a plastic pon can replace the flat sun token.
This is a solid fast game that I'm comming back to spend a few spare min, but do not expect profound meaningfull decisions.
Very good for young players under adequate supervision.

Played it at Essen 2014. While the general idea of the game might sound intriguing and the production is pretty good, the sheer amount of randomness just kills this game for me. The game can actually kill you in the first two turns without you making any meaningful decisions...

This is a perfect example of a game that plays you instead of you playing the game.

Don't feel the need to play this again.

It's Dragon's Lair, the board game. Fun occasionally, but not really worth keeping unless you have a group who enjoy this sort of pseudo-gaming experience where you roll a die to see whether you live or die. Every turn. It constructed a funny narrative almost every time I played it, but the *activity* of the game itself was so uninteresting that it wasn't really worth framing as a board game. I've often considered myself an Ameritrash fan, but this one just strikes me as Ameritrash with no real meat to it. Ameritrash as an activity, rather than game. A nostalgic favorite for some, I'm guessing, but I certainly won't miss this style of design.

RATING: 7.5
Make no mistake, this game wants to kill you.  DungeonQuest is merciless to the heroes, the luck factor is rather high and the encounters can become somewhat repetitive.  Yet, I find myself playing this game for its speed of play and simple approach, and the random dungeon chamber mechanic is brilliant.  This newest revision reverts to the old rock-paper-scissors approach to combat (3rd edition combat was very "clunky") and it adds a few new rules, such as seeing into adjacent rooms before entering them.  I also like how the hero figures are compatible with Descent 2nd edition.  If you need a dungeon crawling "filler" game, this one is hard to beat.

You can find our dice reroll combat variant here.  Also, check out the additional hero choices offered in the variants section!

My GW edition is battered after 30 yrs of loyal service. May be time to let her rest and go for this spangly new one?! 

Dived in at 29.95 from chaos cards. end of an era, beginning of a new!

Things we observed: a few extra heroes wouldn't go amiss, and fighting is still a bolted on clunky load of crap. Once in the catacombs you are on an inevitable death march of doom, a place to be avoided at all costs. 
But you are soon over that and back into the fun and chaos! My 2 little ones (7 & 9) loved playing too. We all have a ton of fun with the new one. What a result!

This is less a [i]game[/i] game and more an [i]experience[/i]—you play it for the express purpose of stepping into a dungeon and seeing what happens next!

And instead of being a "standard" fantasy dungeon where you murder everything in front of you and load up on loot, it's more of a "realistic" fantasy dungeon where you are mostly just there to supply the scary skeletons and spilled coins for the next adventurer.

The shockingly sudden unfairness of it [i]is[/i] the game, and makes winning—even if you only crawled out with a free sack of rope to show for your suffering—super-sweet.

[b]At its core [i]DQ[/i] is a push-your-luck story generator.[/b]  Anything done to monkey with that misses the point entirely, and, to my mind, breaks the game.  There are lots of other dungeon crawl/home invasion simulators out there that do the superhero thing—this one's the Coen Brothers version where we are the stupid criminals, and get exactly what we deserve...

So let go of that rock in the middle of the river and just go with the flow:

RATING: 2
Be forewarned:

1. Player elimination
2. Massive randomness- decisions pretty much don't matter
3. Game plays itself
4. You have stats, but they aren't used 90% of the time.
5. Combat is Rock-scissors-paper.  Every fight is the same randomness, regardless of character or monster involved.

The only good thing about the game is nicely made components (Fantasy Flight + $$) and the catacombs mechanic is kind of clever (for a hack anyway- it clearly was a workaround for dead ends).

Play this if you want a random-how-do-I-die generator.  Even Talisman or Relic have way more meaningful player choice than this game.  If you want to laugh at arbitrary misfortune, you'll have a MUCH better time with a game like Galaxy Trucker.

Not sure how much difference there is to my 1985 first edition. It's closer to the original again compared to the previous 3rd edition, mainly due to dropping the elaborate combat system. The catacombs are integrated which were an expansion to the original Swedish and English version. Simple good fun in any case.

3 grand adventurers went into the great dragon catacombs.

One found only monsters, living and dead. He got quite far, but he just didn't have enough strength to defeat them all.

The other one found magic potions, jewelry and secret doors. Ohh, those secret doors - one leads to another, again and again. How can you resist? But that was the end of him. Locked out, dead end after dead end with no way out. In a midst of all the valuables, waiting for the final hour.

The third one was the luckiest. He got the farthest. Like the legend say, right near the center where the dragon's treasure is. He was so close that he could already see it, but in the final room there was a strange metal spring sound. The armor was too thin - the blade trap cut him in half.

These are the stories this game tells. Love it!

In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...

While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, DungeonQuest is unique in that the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra’s keep on your own!

It's roguelike, the game. Random, and hard.

This is a fantastic game as long as you don't take it too seriously. You will laugh and howl at the misfortune of not only your opponents but yourself as well. The gameplay is very simple and on your turn you get to do one of 4 things. You keep going around exploring the dungeon, running into monsters, and finding bits of treasure. If you are really lucky you will make it to the dragon's hoard at the center of the board. But just because you made it there, it doesn't mean you will make it out in time. The presentation is really top notch on this version of the game, with the only minor nitpick is that the dungeon icon on the tiles could have stood out a bit more. Really this a fantastic game and I am glad I finally picked up a copy.

The revised edition of DungeonQuest is great.  It still is a hectic, uncontrollable, deadly, and insane adventure, but streamlined tremendously.  The dungeon tiles are even clearer and easier to use.  The combat system is simplified drastically to a more appropriate paper/rock/scissors system, while the monsters have been given two simple stats and all-purpose "monster" tokens which work much better.  Overall, the experience of the revised edition is what the first edition should have been, and the fact that FFG paid attention and fixed the issues which were problems says a lot about them as a game company.

I've been having fun with this one recently with my 5 year old son. A lot of roleplaying and silliness ;) We find ourselves 'tweaking' the rules to suit us; the Bottomless Pit for example...

Still trying to find a decent Combat variant system as the official ones are a bit pants to be frank.  

I had this and Talisman back in the day. I'd pick this over Talisman any day of the week.

RATING: 2
Had one player eliminated on turn 3 due to no fault/mistake. Almost no player interaction. Knew who was going to win with 100% accuracy with 40% of the game left to play. The monster fight mechanic is poorly developed (if you're going to do a VonNeuman mechanic, you have to give players information that they can use to get inside the head of the opponent, there was none here - I always played randomly). It's a game where you can pretty easily be eliminated on turn 1 with a poor die roll.

I DO NOT CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY!!! I Love this game. Dying on the first tile is amazing! So... you get to sit back and eat the Cheetos that other people brought to share while they play the rest of the game only to die a tragic death by a giant centipede. That is the risk they have to take to play this game.

RATING: 10
This is a rework of an old GamesWorkshop classic.

A quick-playing game of dungeon exploration where each player  picks one of 6 heroes and ventures into a dungeon full of deadly traps and nefarious monsters. Your goal is to get into the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board which is guarded by a giant sleeping dragon,make sure you don't wake him,  steal any treasure you can find and escape before the sun sets and the dungeon is locked down for good.

Survival rate in this game is about 15%. But if you play with the intention to see how far you can get and in what horrible ways you can die, this becomes a lot of fun.

Players who manage to get out alive, tally up the Gold value of their stolen loot and the winner is determined by the one who has the most Gold. 

The funnest aspect of this game is it's never really the same as the layout of the dungeon changes every game. On your turn each time you move you draw a tile from a stack of 117 tiles. Each one depicts the room you currently enter.Then you draw a card, and find out what the room contains.  There are winding corridors, rotating chambers,treacherous bridges, cave-ins, and even rooms that let you enter the Catacombs-the lower levels of the dungeon that hide greater treasure and greater danger.  

In the ten sessions we had only one character gout out alive so far It was Krutzbeck with a whopping 4310 Gold 
after plundering the catacombs and Treasure chamber.


Recommended to fans of light, casual games that don't mind randomness and luck.

Compared to the previous edition, this is an improvement. The new "How to play" rulebook and the "new old" combat rules make it a very simple game to start and to play. You read a few pages of rules and just let yourself carry by the - fast - flow of this funny game. FFG should make more game like this : fast, thematic, fun...

Yet you should know that this is very luck driven. And i am a fan of "Tales of the arabian nights" and "Talisman" ! But this one leaves you almost not choice, it's just (bad) luck punching you around ! If you don't get the joke, give it a pass...

RATING: 5
As I would expect from Fantasy Flight Games, the production quality is outstanding. The game play isn't very rewarding. The shock value of instant death might be funny the first time or two, but wears off quickly. It's likely my mistake with this one is playing with my kids. Perhaps played with adults, there would be a bit more social aspects to make this game fun. Like deriding your buddy for leaving the dragon's den too early in hopes you can make him wake the dragon. Not sure I care to find out though.

No strategy what-so-ever.  I like harsh games.  I like risk-management games.  I hate no-brain games.  There is only one meaningful decision to make in the entire course of play, and that's what character you use.  Everything else is to the fickle whims of chance, and there's no other way (than choosing your hero) to shift the odds.

13-Sep-2016:  Man, for a game that's about 95% luck and is full of utter randomness, this is a ton of fun!  Basically, you take the role of a hero going into a dungeon to steal treasure from the sleeping dragon.  You move through the dungeon via random tile draws, where you'll encounter traps, treasures, and monsters.  In some rooms, you'll have the option (or even be forced) to enter into the even further underground catacombs.  If you're lucky, you'll steal some treasure from the Dragon.  And if you're even luckier, you'll actually find your way back out.

This game is super light but very entertaining when played with that attitude.  You need to know going in that you could die on your very first turn.  Each hero will have his/her own story and adventure and most likely, glorious tale of death.  I love making the dungeon as you play.  And while the monsters are all basically the same, combat is quick and mindless, so it doesn't really slow the game down at all.  In fact a lot of the things you run into feel very similar, but it plays quickly enough, and I'm really enjoying the stories I've created so far.  Good stuff!

Still as fun as ever, with yet another attempt at improving the combat system. I definitely think that this is the best version of that yet, but it still needs to be a little bit faster than it is. I wish Fantasy Flight would just implement one of their many dice systems here. Otherwise, this is largely the DungeonQuest that it always has been. Brutally difficult, but always fun.

RATING: 7
Best version of this classic "shut down your brain" dungeoncrawler-lite.

Newbies beware: DQ is essentially a box of random mishaps that befall your characters at every turn, so don't come here looking for deep gameplay experiences and/or strategic flourishes. Its mostly about seeing how far you can push your luck before the dungeon kills you. Its usually a "final game of the night"-type of game which you bring out when you want to keep playing but your brain is fried. Its a perfect way to end the night with a laugh after going through other, meatier games.

FFG did a great job streamlining the components and rules on its original release and this "revised" edition besides adding some additional variants solves the only issue with the previous release which was to shove in a completely unnecesary strategic combat system. This one brings back the "rock-paper-scissors" mechanics that dial the monster combat back to what it was supposed to be: a minor inconvenience during your usual dungeoncrawling rather than a game-stalling event. This was probably something most people were house-ruling anyway with the previous version, but it's nice to have it on a proper release.

Definitely the version to get if you are looking for this game. Beware Dragonfire dungeon!

The idea of this game reminds me a lot of [thing=1339][/thing]

It has more card types than Dungeon!, the combat dice have been replaced by cards (far worse system), the subterranean dungeon have been introduced and very few things more (like player elimination).

The game really feels old, despite the great graphic design. The worse parts:
-> No real decisions; they are very few in number and they are obvious. That eliminates the tension for me (no matter what you decide, luck will dictate your fate).
-> Player elimination: players can be eliminated really early in the game (in my first game, a player succumbed to a direct death effect in the 4th turn). I love how Dungeon! handles this.
-> Combat system: totally luck based, but it could have been simplified by just rolling dice, which would make the game faster and shorter. The duration is not excessive though.

Defintly, it's a game I will try not to play again, if I can.

Breakneck dungeon raiding. Very little character development. Crazy amounts of luck, very little is under the control of the players. Good fun regardless. Very difficult to escape alive with any loot!

RATING: 7
Enjoyed playing this game, although it's a bit frustrating to so often make so little progress. I have to admit that I've met an untimely demise far more often than I've escaped. There's a 'gamey' ploy of exploring only until any treasure, however small, is found and then getting out, on the basis that the other more intrepid adventurers will probably die. But that's not really in the spirit of dungeon exploration. I've thought of employing a house rule whereby every adventurer has to explore towards the central treasure room until someone gets there and then everyone can turn tail and get out asap. In practice, rarely would anyone take the easy option, either because no treasure could be found, or, more likely, because they want remain part of the fun and not sit waiting for others to finish.

And mutton. Lots of mutton.

This is one of my favourite "dungeon crawler" games. It´s a very simple, hard, funny, easy boardgame, but with an EXPLORATION side which I love. It´s very difficult to finish alive in this dungeon but... who cares!! When we play it, there´s lots of laughs and fun!! It´s a great game but it´s not for every taste, for sure. Just pure fun! ADVENTURE involves UNCERTAINTY (which is unexpected and cannot be controlled), and I think this board game reflects this very well.I love the fact that you start the adventure but you don´t know how and when is going to finish.

I wish there were more strategic/tactical choices to be made in this game but, really, there are none. This game is nearly 100 percent luck. Maybe, even totally 100 percent luck. That's too bad because I really like building the dungeon by drawing the tiles. If only there were meaningful choices to be made along the way. If only the combat system was an interesting little side game of tactical delight but it isn't. Combat is a boring rock paper scissors affair. This game could be so much more. It's disappointing but still fun on occasion.

:d6-1: 4/2/16 what I recently wrote: Going on my list.I have an oddball sense of humor. Plus, with solo gaming, no one will look at you funny if you make sound effects as they fall . . .

Did I say that?laugh

I love mazy pathy explory tile laying explore as you go things. This one might depend on my mood. If I am in a pissy mood, this might cheer me up, in a twisted way, seeing the heroes biff it no matter how hard they try. No soup for you!

That's not how I am, actually, I'm a nice person. But seeing as how, in a meta, fantasy, almost rpg way, I could see if they were fated for certain doom . . . Or other days I could play from the idealistic adventurer, we can do it point of view.

And mentally play Taps, if they get crushed, and hold a parade in the nearby town if they succeed.

I have a good imagination. So depending on my mood, I could play the game from a variety of perspectives. Evil mage watching them toil helplessly against their fate, may be a frequent one.

I enjoy this game. I really enjoy it. I just do not like how long combat takes. I like that there's a 22% survival rate. I like that if you're not paying attention, you can get lost in the dungeon and never make it out. I like that the "no event" cards you draw are worthy of a sigh of relief. 

I like how sometimes, the dungeon just shits on you. Forgive my language, but the dungeon can be quite a dick. It's hilarious.

This game is brutal and you will be tossed around like a ragdoll dwarf with a broken physics engine!

However I find this game fantastic. Yes, your chances of survival are slim (what is it? 13-15%?) and yes it is a game where you should take tons of "Good Luck Pills".

For me it is not a problem that the game is so heavily based on luck. You walk in to an unknown dungeon and you simply dont know what will greet you. 

Last night our final hero dodged arrows, jumped over a bottomless pit, fought monsters and reached the halls of treasures. He was actually trying to leave the dungeon much earlier with only 30 gold coins but the tiles forced him to stand next to the dragon. He grabbed what he could since he was there and continued on his journey to the exit. After another round of dodging, jumping and fighting he could see the light of hope geting closer and closer. He was on the last tile before the dungeon exit and needed to roll the dice one last time before he could walk out to his wife and sixteen children. The sun track was on three and all he needed to roll was a 4-6. Everybody was silent and only the  roaring stomach of a hungry hero could be heard. The dice was Thrown and soared through the air knowing it was about to serve destiny. Bounce, bounce, roll and slide...

The End

Well, this is clearly some absolute nonsense. It was explained to me beforehand as such and it did not fail to live up to its billing.

For a beer and pretzels type game it seems a bit rules heavy and for the amount of luck (which is about 98% of the outcome) it is a bit long.

It was fun in a stupid, end of the night kind of way but not something I would ever be looking to play again.

I got no treasure, got shafted by my fellow players and didn't escape the dungeon. Nevertheless I did enjoy it, so will happily play again

It's fun watching things unfold, but random to a degree where I had a hard time getting too invested in achieving any goals or living or dying.  The catacombs aspect and the chamber tiles are the most interesting elements here.

DungeonQuest suffers from three issues:

1) It has almost no strategy whatsoever, zombie dice has about as much strategy as this game. (perhaps more)

2)  You can be eliminated immediately

3) It has a lot of pieces and takes a long time to setup for such a short game.

All of these things being said, you may ask why did I give it a 7 and buy the game?  Because as much as these things annoy me, they also make the game great.  The pieces and art add to the games theme, and the dumb luck of the game adds to a certain comedy, particularly if someone gets eliminated early.  I would still have preferred a much easier to setup version of this, but all in all, it is a good short-medium length luck game if you need a break from heavier games.  I can also guarantee many good laughs.

I got this for nostalgic reasons, as I played the old version as a teenager. This is pretty similar, and as described, a near guaranteed death experience. My son (9) doesn't like it as is, because of the likelihood of dying early in the game. However, we play a child-friendly version with torchlight variant and a few other tweaks to make it easier. With these rules it is better in my opinion (see my post in July 2017 for "child-friendly" variant rules). My rating here is for the original rules.

Ok artwork, the Runebound (?) setting isn't my thing, and a couple of Catacomb cards only contain text, which is a bit lame. Room tiles and the board are nice - but why are monster cards denied a slot on the board?

Probably a good game with your mates after a few beers, but kind of odd that the presentation otherwise is serious.

Fun, silly game.  I do prefer [i]Deep Sea Adventure[/i] for this type of game, though, because it's so quick and direct.

UPDATE: And I prefer Clank! because the game itself is better.

Painted miniatures - Old School dungeon crawler which is either incredibly good fun or utterly frustrating. With a 15% success rate, you'll be pulling your hair out whilst laughing at your demise. Good fun if you can get past the first 2 turns without dying!

It's terrific fun and once you're all set up it's simple to reset and have another go if you've died really quickly.
I think that's one of the strengths of it. Once it's on the table you can whip off several games in a short period of time.  For this reason too, I don't get as frustrated as some others when I die so fast. 
It's not an immersive game - its no Darkest Night or Mage Knight.  

Update 2016: I've really been enjoying this game a lot of late. I am removing it from my trade list, and am increasing my rating to 7.5. I can't have this much fun and not give it at least 7.5! Additionally, I am not finding the set up to be nearly the bear I once thought it was. Maybe it's just simply that I am more familiar now. Well, whatever the reason, I am really enjoying it (I don't even mind the fatality rate!).

Slightly less cool compared to the GW edition, if only because they didn't make the card decks look like the thing you are drawing from (crypt, corpse, door, etc.).

Still, great stuff and retains nearly all of what makes the original so damn good.

This is the best version of this game. It has the right balance between risk and rewards. It is simple, fun, and tense. Rules have been clarified, mechanics have been simplified. You cannot wait to have a mother turn! Fast and furious as the sun goes down and the game ends in excitement!

Nostalgia fix. *Fourth edition: please reduce the number of cards/decks, and include more decisions, skill and less luck. I.e., make it into a modern game. Looking great, though!

p.s. If re-spawning makes the game playable, why not just make it 'Standard'? e.g. Optional rule:
If your character dies, you cannot win.. instead, you play the monsters (until the other players all die).

Why have a dragon on the box, if you don't have to encounter it? Expansion.

This game has almost nothing at all, in common with [gameid=1339], other than having a board and using cards. [gameid=1339] is the better game.

Boyfriend would probably rate this a little higher - maybe 7.  For me, personally, it's far too luck-based and I get really bored before we get far into it.  Speaking of far into it - if you play with the sun timer, you will never get very far before the game is out.  Even with 4 players we have never filled the board more than 50% with tiles.

The good:
* Definitely a different game every time you play.  Sometimes you'll do well and other times you'll die in turn two. 
* Nice art.  The multitude of cards fit the theme and do contribute to a somewhat immersive game.
* Unique heroes - you'll all have different strengths and weaknesses which should play into a strategy.  (Except having a strategy is very hard.)

The bad:
* Set-up is slow for a game that can be over very quickly.  There are a LOT of cards and of course each little deck will need shuffled.
* Sort of confusing.  Basic rules (move, draw cards, roll dice) are simple enough, but there's just so much going on it's confusing to new players.  What do you do in this type of room?  What do you do in that type of room?  Should I opt to take a crypt card or not?
* Fiddly.  I think the above explains that, but there's just so many cards and little things you have to put on the board and keep track of, all of which could mean nothing when you die on your next turn.
* Way too heavy on luck.  I don't mind not solving a case/winning a game the first play, but there is really no strategy you can use here unless your only strategy is to search every room, find some treasure, and then head out and wait for everyone to die.  We've had people get "stuck" after rooms rotate, people get into the center and get 1200 gold and then not be able to get out before time runs out, and many other random "oops you lost" scenarios.
* Heroes have special abilities, yet...it's difficult to actually play them in any way that actually makes use of them.  Again - luck.
* Monsters are very lackluster.  It's basically a game of rock-paper-scissors to beat monsters and we have yet to have anyone encounter a monster they don't beat fairly easily.  Why even have them?!  I've yet to see anyone die from reaching 0 health from monsters - it's usually trap cards that kill you.
* The timer...we just usually opt to play without it and play until we either both die or both succeed.  (Or one dies and one succeeds.)

Big Warning: This game can be also very frustrating as there are Million ways to die instantly, while only 1 way to survive and win :)

Bought it in a sale, thinking it would be too random for my taste. I've never been so glad to be wrong. This game is a riot. 

Die in the first turn? Grab a spare character (or his 'twin brother') and send 'em in again. Die one space away from winning? That's just the dungeon's way of making you a hopeless addict. One way or another, it's over soon enough to have another go. Keep a high score in the box so nobody tries to sneak a win with 10 gold coins. Oh, and when you fight a monster, don't bother with the combat cards - just play actual rock-paper-scissors with another player. Much quicker and funnier.

Another train-wreck, and pointless update...

I own the GW Edition, so only need to limit each room to one search, and use one of those FFG Gold Plastic Tokens to keep track.

Looking into adjacent rooms and placing a Room Tile there is no problem either.

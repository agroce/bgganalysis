RATING: 6
Rating is provisional and based on 1 play which was a terrible game.  I didn't buy shares early and got locked out of buying shares. It seemed a weakness that there was no catch-up mechanism so I had to sit through the entire 90 minute game knowing I was last and not being able to do a thing about it.
Next game I won't make that mistake.

Update: Played again and it was better, but to be honest I think it is too long for what it is.  There are a lot more games I'd rather be playing.  For me not exciting.

- The game can be rather opaque in understanding the long term ramifications of something, especially sub 4-5 plays of it. After almost 20 plays, I still regularly both stumble through (plus lose), and learn something new. Not a game that supports a mixed experience group well without seriously getting the newer players up to speed with the analysis required (which is woefully difficult to do effectively). It's a game of incentive/partnership management with a serious meta component that evolves based on the group. Second, it's a game of pacing, some strategies (like FCM) will depend on a shorter game, where as some depend on a longer one. Understanding how to read the game pace is of a massive benefit and central to the game. Controlling that pacing is key, and good luck doing so in your first series of games. Reading who is going to help push that pacing is both important and difficult. I actually think that's one of the most difficult tasks; especially since it's controlled by the auctions/actions/plans/desires of the rest of your field. Last, it's a game of position management; "sometimes it's better to ensure you don't make a buck (or 2) rather than my coffers to fill."


Tweaks lots of things that I find enjoyable. My worry is related to the first point; once we get a core group who are experienced with it, how effectively will other players be (and thus, how much enjoyment will I be able to squeeze out of the game when there are new players)? In particular, how will having someone who isn't reading the game state in the game effect the ability to accurately predict that pace and what sort of chaos will that introduce? Extrapolating from other games would tell me that you still achieve some enjoyment, but it's much more long term marriage, not dating passion. Some games fade exponentially then, some don't, and (much like the butterfly effect here) I'm not sure where this falls yet. 


25+ games in, I'm not sure I buy that the auction action is *hands down* the most effective action you can take. I agree that it's the most *dangerous* action, but not necessarily an auto action as I've seen some folks make it out to be. For that, I think it depends upon the group. I've seen people auction every chance they get and still place last because they are in a group of people who don't value the auction. Conversely, I've seen people use it sparingly, but everyone does and it becomes much more potent. Proper valuation and speed of paper movement is also a group-dependent factor; if everyone wants to drag it out, paper is more valuable, but if some value the auction and some value the paper, then even though the game may end in 5 rounds, the paper has a real chance of winning (thus, the commitment starvation game is tougher to accomplish). A different group which built/dev'd less would make it happen more often, which brings me back to the core point; it's an emergent game of groupthink, and controlling the pacing means having to understand how the rest of the players view the game. If this game took 90-120 minutes, I don't think I'd rate it a 9, but at an hour or less, it's jam packed.

Interesting quick train game. The use of stocks is interesting, where you have to buy stock to put money in the company, but the more shares that are sold, the more diluted the profits get. I haven't played enough to really figure out the best way to optimize profits, and I keep over-investing late in the game forgetting that shares are worthless apart from the profits they generate.

John Borher packed a ton of depth into a short game here, excellent all around, really an achievement in board game design. It's a nasty portfolio game where victory requires smart bidding, properly timing auctions, and wrecking other people's companies. The underlying mechanisms inevtitbaly lead to collusion, a dynamic and brittle landscape of  short-lived alliances and plenty of back stabbing, which all takes place in a 45 minute game -  brilliant!

A game for connoisseurs of player interaction. Short, sweet, and shoots for the head.

Everything you do doesn't just affect you, it directly helps or hurts everyone else in the game. It ties you to other players' fortunes, mis- and otherwise. And there's no randomness.

If you find yourself shackled to someone when they make a mistake, sorry, but it sucks to be you. It's entirely possible for the newbie at the table to latch onto you and drag you down with them, and not have any idea that they've lost the game for themselves and others.

Once everyone knows what they are doing you'll find in Wabash Cannonball the best experience boardgames have to offer.

Original Wabash Cannonball: Hmm ... I think the game is good, eventhough I wasn't really successful and so I don't think this game was made for me . I don't like to share my stocks and prefer to build up my own company. I guess auction-games just aren't my kind of game as well and not to mention the ridiculous components.

Chicago Express: Much better experience this time with decent components and the knowledge how this game works. After my crushing defeat in Wabash Cannonball, I was able to win in Chicago Express.

A fairly simple network building game, with increased complexity due to the auctioning of shares in various companies (comparable in mechanics, although much lighter in complexity, to the 18XX series of train games). It's a competitive, meaty, strategic affair, with no luck involved - a really solid design, with nice production values.

2010-04-14 (rating 9):

An excelent game. No luck, no chance. Players interaction however adds some unpredicatability to the game (especailly when played with more players).

Also it seems that making bad share purchases at the begining of the game (especially first purchase) will almost surly leave you on a loosing position.

The rules are simple and clear and the game is much fun.

Seems like Imperial on Rails.  So very hard to tell how you are doing.  I was totally lost for most of my 2 games, and it is too abstract for me. But it is very enjoyable and I would like to play again, and I love the little Trainimeeples.  This is all about the partnerships you make.  I found myself wondering how this was different from Diplomacy a few times!

RATING: 7
2 plays / 4,6 players (1 play Wabash version)

LIKE: Quick, simple turns, but deep.

DISLIKE: A game, at first, feels like a black box. Sometimes auctions involve knowing exactly how much to spend in an auction and when. Sometimes players could feel behind in the whole game. Experienced players have an edge. The early "Wabash" version felt bland, lacked theme.

OVERALL: I like it. It's a game where some subtleties are lost on me because you want to try to get someone else to invest in a line that you may have a better position on, especially on the turn or two after them. Buying a share also dilutes the company, which at times I'll forget. It felt very competitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love the idea in this game. The train theme is very strong and the production quality is very high. But it doesn't seem to play very well in the end. It is a majority-shares game that unwinds rather craftily. It seems to not play well without the full complement of players which is very unfortunate. I have other train games (the excellent Steam) that just plays better overall if route building is desired.

RATING: 6
Basically should always be great fun. However, can turn into a rather flat experience if all players end up with identical portfolios. The only way to gain an edge over others is either to get the shares cheaper or diversify your portfolio from the competition. Once everyone has equal shares, no one has any incentive to waste actions on developing the companies. Hence, I think the game could benefit from some other ways to earn money besides the companies paying dividents.

After all these complaints, it is just fair to give the praise. The game looks fantastic, plays fast, and the basic rules are super easy to remember since they all have a real life correspondent. For a 60 minute game, Chicago Express is time well invested. Be it any longer, and it would certainly see no table time.

I'm pretty wowed by this one -- CE is top-notch gaming. It's easy to play, but the ability to play [i]well[/i] is going to require a lot of hands-on experience. Luckless, totally open information, shifting alliances. There's potential for ugly, cut-throat play here that will open my group up to some frightening possibilities. Components-wise, the trains are cute, but I'd prefer the more austere Winsome-style cubes for manageability (I can't believe I'm saying that...).

The first Winsome I played and a great example of track building with co-opetive share ownership (own too much and your minor investor/other players might screw you over), vicious track lays possible and lots of fun to be had….wth the right crowd. Like all Winsomes it needs to be played cutthroat, it deserves nothing less and only works well when the people involved care about the system.

The problem of the game is every time most likely the players will use the same strategy: bid the same companies' shares, place the same routes to same cities...

At the end, I sold it with unopened expansion in a cheap price

11/2014 - Played at Patrick's house weekly game day with new dreadlock guy.  I found the game very interesting and I think the stock system is a cool departure from other train games I have played.  Having played the "Wabash Cannonball" app a lot, I'm not sure that this one has too much replayability, but I wouldn't mind owning this. 

10/2015 - Purchased from CSI. Looking forward to trying with dad.

Mezcla genial entre juego de trenes y juego económico. En el aspecto ferroviario hace algunas abstracciones para que no tengas que preocuparte de cosas como el transporte de mercancias, aunque ofrece sensaciones similares a otros juegos de trenes más pesados. De esta forma el juego realmente depende del aspecto económico: las subastas; el modo en que obtienes y compartes compañías de otros jugadores; cómo haces alianzas temporales con ellos; la tesorería, los ingresos y las oportunidades de crecimiento de las compañías, etc.
Tiene una gran profundidad alcanzada a través de reglas sencillas, duración de la partida relativamente corta, hasta seis jugadores, y componentes expectaculares en la edición de Queen (aunque la mía es una versión casera).
-------------------------------------------------
Great mix between a train and an economic game. On the train side, it makes some abstractions so you don't have to deal with delivering goods for example, but it offers similar feelings as other heavier train games. So the game really relays on the economic side: the auctions; the way you acquire and share companies from other players; how you make temporary alliances with them; treasury, income and company development opportunities, and so on.
Main features are deep game through easy rules, short playing time, playable up to six players and really superb components on the Queen edition (although mine is a homemade version).

A light train game.  The one I've played so far was a 5-player game having 4 new people (including myself).

I don't like that the track indicates the overall value of the train line (e.g., instead of stock price per share).  This means that more owners/investors = a sharp dilution of earnings.  This also means that expected return on investment is significantly lower for train lines with more shares (since the four lines each have 3, 4, 5 or 6 shares).  For this reason alone, red > yellow (imo, of course).

I also dislike how diversity can equal winning.  As in someone can benefit greatly from free-riding from another player's managing of a train line.  Yes, that's part of the game, but if two players cooperate for one train line, or if one owner/investor fails to assist with a train line, it can significantly affect the success of that line.

In addition, I dislike how the mid-to-endgame becomes very obvious in terms of return on investment.  It seemed like further purchasing of additional shares would not be of benefit since the player would not earn back more than the cost.

Even in view of the above, I would like to play this one again.  I'm not sure whether or not my experience and conclusions are well-founded or accurate.  I could be way off.  I'm willing to give this another shot.  It's a nice lighter train game and doesn't take long.  I do like the action mechanic (the dials).

1st play: I wasn't sure what to expect with this but the system was fun.  Trying to speculate on the future growth of the companies and the ability to buy into a company just to send the trains off in the wrong direction is an interesting system.  I'm not a huge fan of the train theme, but the game is great.  The production is good and the actions players take match the theme perfectly.  

2nd play: Wow, I knew I liked this game, but playing it again, I liked it even more.  There is a TON of game packed into 45 minutes, complete with auctions, route building, and opportunity to punish players who are overconfident in their position.  Manipulating round timing and ensuring you don't overinvest in a stock are very key to success in this game.  I haven't added the expansions yet, but I think they will add to the experience.  This is an example of a simple system that gets out of the way of the players in just the right way.

RATING: 4
I'd rather play: CARCASSONNE (multiplayer investment)

Overall, I can see what the appeal is of this game, but really the number of mechanisms it needs to engineer (!) the dynamic is too many. 

Ultimately, you are trying to time things appropriately, but I think often the granularity of the decisions can be so dense you are really just trying to make a read on player tendencies as to whether you can get that share or not. That's fun, and skilful, but for mine other games just do this more elegantly and more quickly. It's certainly not something I want to even spend an hour on with so much opportunity for seat order and kingmaking to intervene.  

I played this a lot on iOS and I can't fathom how anyone could enjoy the constant calculations in real life. It must create a lot of downtime. 

Games like this make me think the triumph of modern boardgaming is how they can take the tenets of gaming institutions like Role-playing, Wargaming and Train-gaming and make their dynamics accessible. The busyness of the theme could be very appealling to those who need  a real-life context, but I'm very happy with abstraction.

Very elegant game with a limited set of rules but huge depth. Players compete for shareholding of train companies while extending rail networks and developing towns and the land.

Combined shareholding creates temporary alliances, but if one allows la large majority to emerge, the minority shareholder may poison the company.

Very interactive game, thanks to the share bidding auctions and spatial competition. Lot's of screwage and unexpected moves.

The game plays at a fast clip, and because of the internal timer of game end conditions, is finished within one hour, while creating a great play experience.

A great entry to shareholding games, playable with non-gamers.

Buen juego de economía, se trata de invertir y comprar acciones de compañías ferroviarias. Muy bien presentado, y bastante divertido, pero con varios peros en mi opinión. Una de las posibles acciones, la subasta de acciones es demasiado clave para el desarrollo de la partida; puede hacer que algún jugador se quede descolgado demasiado pronto si no tienes éxito en las subatas. Parece el típico juego que se disfruta realmente cuando llevas muchas partidas a tus espaldas, hasta ese momento es difícil saber si haces lo correcto en cada turno. Le doy un dignísimo 7.5.

The stock holding and railway expansion elements are nicely balanced and impressively streamlined. The Queen edition components are fantastic (minus money) and dials are a really 'neat' way of managing dividends and rounds. 

There's a surprising amount of room for some deep play  in what remains a fairly simple and quick game of this type. Honestly, one of my only real issues is that the game seems almost *too* short. Another issue is the map/company starting points. The setup doesn't really have anything modular about it and the railway goals (going west) are fairly linear. That being said, I still really like the dynamics of CE. It's a fantastic product.

Note: I think that the expansion Narrow Gauge and possibly Erie is needed to retain my full rating (without going down) at the 5-6 player count. There just doesn't seem to be enough options for clever play mid game if you make a misstep or get stuck in a corner. 3-4 seems like there's enough room for manipulation without necessarily adding expansion options.

2-6(4)

2p worked, but I think it would be much more captivating with a third (at least) to muddle the ownership pool and make things a bit less zero-sum. Still, the decisions are pretty engrossing: you want to dilute their ownership and force them to overpay to maintain control of their own company, but if you put their company up for auction you might be using your action to fund them! Or, alternatively, trying to bait your opponent into taking a portion of a company you already have several shares of in order to use their overbid to fund a company you mostly own.

Also great is that it bucks most auction games in that you're not purely trying to get the lowest bid. Sometimes you, crucially, want to overbid to get your company income high enough (indeed, if you cut-rate bid your own stock all the time you might have a critically underfunded company!). I feel the game may run a bit too long if people evade auctions too much, but still a good one.

A highly distilled railway game, full of tough decisions.  Chicago Express engages from the opening auction, through a desperate rush for the limited actions each turn, to the closing dividend. It's really interesting how share purchases affect both the company's ability to extend its network and how its dividend will be divided.  It feels as though margins for error are slight. There is plenty of scope for players to cooperate and to block or send competing lines in costly and unhelpful directions. Definitely a game with a learning curve.


Queen Games has transformed the pug ugly Winsome edition into a handsome game.  My only quibble is with the paper money (in not very useful 1-5-25 dollar denominations too).

After the first play, it is obvious that once you get behind there's not a lot you can do to catch up, so trying to cheapskate on turn 1 and 2 by not overpaying for company shares does not work. The main problem is that every play is pretty much the same.

I did not find this game to be particularly interesting.  Yes, money is tight, auctions take place, and you ponder how much money you are making relative to other players through the share selections, share auctions, and dividend mechanics, but none of this rises above being of moderate interest.  (Perhaps I am just not a train loving gamer.)  

The rest of the game mechanics: building tracks and improving hexes feel like uninteresting adjuncts, as they served little purpose other than to feed into the "division of dividends" mechanic which as stated, was just not that interesting to me.  I would rather play RR Tycoon (or even Steam I suppose) than this.

Extraordinary game ! 

With a few simple elements, 3 action tracks of different length, 5 railroad companies each with a different number of shares and a board made of hexagons of 3 types of terrain and 2 types of cities, the creator of this game has set up a "game world" of complex interwoven relationships between the players and the environment they live in for the duration of the game. 

These relationships give the players a fascinating situation to analyze before they make a decision and choose an action.

Although they are very different games I must say that I didn't have such pleasure while discovering a game since Puerto Rico.

Bravo to Harry Wu, Winsome Games and to Queen Games to have made this game widely available !

This is an initial rating after just one play. I have the same feelings about this game as I did about Tigris and Euphrates after the first session. I felt as though I was stumbling around in the dark as regards to strategy and tactics but know there is a great game waiting to be uncovered. After more plays I can see this rating rising and Chicago Express comfortably breaking into my top 10.  

UPDATE: This has become my go to game for 3/4 players and has quickly become one of my most played games.

Rating based on one play.

This looks like a really deep, interesting game packed into a short time line and a small rules set.

I felt pretty lost about what to do and what to bid throughout the first game, and I only started to get a vague idea as the game finished.  That's a bit of a drawback, but I'm interested in trying it again.

RATING: 8
Offers excellent play and tough decisions in a short time frame. Borrows some mechanics from older games (Power Grid and Imperial come to mind immediately), but manages to cut the game time in half without taking anything important out of the game.

The game might have a slight "once you are behind, this game is over for you" problem, I have to investigate that further, but it might also depend on the number of players.

RATING: 8
Efficient and thoughtful.  While the MSRP of the Queen version still strikes me as a bit high, I think it offers a tremendous bang for the buck in terms of game play versus game length.  I think it's very "toolsy" in terms of the roles it fills (economic, train, stock, alliances, etc.), and I see it as a sort of training gauntlet for a lot of key game situations.  I still look forward to learning what it has to teach me.  Best for me with minimal AP, and I think it virtually demands similarly-skilled opponents.

Easy to teach and even the people not very enamoured with board games like it, and will discuss strategy after the game! This game is brilliant ... BRILLIANT!

The short play time, the multitude of decisions, the wonderful board and components, and the economy and route planning all make a winner. Do yourself a favour and try it.

I lost my first 4 games playing/teaching this, but still enjoyed it. Last game I wasn't teaching and I decided to be creative and let go of my inhibitions. I didn't try to prevent others from obtaining equal shares in companies in which I was the majority shareholder. When I was ahead on dividends I withheld on the urge to buy more shares. I waited for others to make moves. It becomes an almost existential experience. A slight pull here and a push there - controlling other's actions whilst concealing your own. Needless to say, I won - more than convincingly ... fantastic.

Latest session (5 people), I taught the game again, and got beaten again. Same story, everyone loved it and would like to play it again... my wife now knows most of my strategic thinking , having been present for most games - she is going to be tough to beat for awhile.

RATING: 9.75
Clever, and an entirely different train game experience, coming from the world of Ticket To Ride and Age of Steam. I like it, though it has a bit of a Puerto Rico feel to it in terms of figuring out when the game is about to end.

Definitely brutal, but not punishing in the way that one feels like they made a little mistake at the beginning and now they're hosed; feels more like a euro train game, with high-end elements of each.

That it can be played in about an hour is a huge bonus, since most of the high-thought games I have don't fall into this category.

Each time I play it I like it more, every game seems to end differently; had a 2-player game that I thought would be boring because of the auctions, and it turned out to be amazing -- it exposed a completely different strategy that also worked quite wheel (and beat me soundly). Wonderful game.

I normally do not like train games or auction games but this played quickly enough, had a variety of options during turn play and fairly straightforward winning conditions for my liking. Our game with three players came down to the winner winning by one dollar over the tied second place players.  Nice close game.

This game is quite the interesting economic/stock market game. You invest in rail companies that are competing to get to Chicago, and they pay out dividends split among all of their stock shareholders. Selling additional stock of a company can bring additional players into the fold, but also dilutes the payout of individual shares.

Two concerns with it:
1) As Matt said, this needs to be played with poker chips instead of paper money.

2) I'm worried that there is an optimal strategy and runaway leader issue. Once you've got a particularly profitable rail, if nobody works towards giving your color of stock to someone else, you WILL win.

Regardless, I'd love to play it again.

First play.  I have no idea what happened in the game.  I nearly understand the basic mechanics,  but how I use them to influence my result is still a closed book to me.  That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the game - on the contrary,  I want to play again soon.  The biggest concern I have at this point is how one reins in a leader - if they are getting more income,  they can afford to outbid on new shares,  so they get more income, .....  Maybe the trick is not to let someone get too far ahead in the first place.  We allowed a player to get all 3 PA shares early,  and with his decent initial income, he stomped us.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games that I have a difficult time rating.  For such a simple rule set, it's astonished how deep players can dive into this game.  It's a game where every decision matters and one where players need to be vividly aware about the other players, their capabilities, and goals. It's also a game defined by shared incentives and emerging alliances.

That being said, this is a very opaque game that is difficult for new players to value.  And while I consider myself a fairly accomplished gamer, I still have a difficult time valuing decisions in this game.  And that's where the game becomes problematic; if players don't know how to value the decisions in the game, the decisions feel random and lackluster.  And perhaps worst, their uninformed decisions will inevitably effect the positions of other players at the table (king making). 

This is a gem that simply needs the right set of players.  And if players are new to this game, it may not be a bad idea to go over strategy/tactics.

Látatlanban vettem meg anno a játékot, nem nagyon nyomoztam utána (ma már ritkán teszek ilyet). Sokkal szürkébb játékra számítottam valamiért, de kellemes meglepetés volt. Ehhez hasonló játék, amivel játszottam, a Stephenson Rocket volt, de nekem ez sokkal jobban tetszett elsőre. Az akcióválasztási mechanizmus újszerű, a szabályok egyszerűek. Nekünk a Chicago fázis kicsit későn jött, az utolsó társaságnak nem volt szerepe a játékban. A játékban az utolsó kör döntött...A játék összességében nem volt rossz! Kicsit talán száraz. Ha brókercég HR menedzsere lennék, a felvételi tuti hogy egy Chicago parti lenne, vagy egy Acquire :)

Now that Queens is going to print the game, hopefully with better graphics and components, I am now looking forward to purchasing the game for myself.

First game with 5 other players.  The game is very cool.  Very unique and different from the rest of my collection.  The game is so simple to learn but there are so many things that you need to take into account to win.  I really like that you have alliances that form because you share stocks with other players and it is actually very beneficial to have alliances since you only have one action to help your company grow.  With other players being in the same company they have a lot of reasons to grow the company and helping you at the same time.  At the same time trying to time it just right to get that extra share in the company so that they are helping you more than themselves. It is really cool how the game just flips upside down so fast on you.  Playing a 6player game felt pretty contrived though.  You do not have as much control since 5 other people gets to go in between your turns.  There are also not enough shares to go around until the game ends.  I think in 6p games the only way to win is to get stocks from each company so you are in cahoots with everyone.  I think I'd have to add some variants for a 6p game to be more interesting.  I still liked the game with 6p, but I can certainly see why the game would be better with 4.  I re-read the rules and missed 4 critical game changing rules, for the better.  I can't wait for the next game.

When the ruleset is simple and elegant, and the game is surprisingly deep, you know you are in front of a very good game. The fast playtime is definitely a bonus. Chicago Express, at its chore, is a game about construction of incentives for other players. It is extremely opaque, and the very nature of the game (every decision has cascade effects on every player) makes it a strange beast to ride: I suspect that very often the victory is handed to a player by a (very difficult to evaluate) mistake of another player.
Needs more plays to fully appreciate. Too bad it seems too chaotic with 5+ players, and doesn't work with just 2...

Initial Impression: I played this game once, loved it, and went out and bought it right away. This is an amazing game about player interaction, manipulation, and motivations. The turn structure is extremely simple I've taught it to non-gamers. However, the game unfolds itself only after a number of plays, when players begin to notice that they're not really manipulating shares and train companies so much as each other. I've got to play more of this game.

Takes only 30-40 minutes for a 3-4 player game.  However, I'd rather spend that time setting up an Age of Steam or 18xx game.  The production quality is very poor, but that is expected for most Winsome games. Print-and-play anyone?  

Update: Queen's version of Chicago Express takes care of the production quality issues.  As for gameplay, I still feel that the share dillution is very arbitrary as far as who gets targeted.

RATING: 6
This is a economic auction game that reminds me both of the 18xx series and Modern Art. I would like to play Steam Baron and compare those two as well. You are bidding for share of companies and player actions will determine their value. There is skill in judging how much to pay for a share, but also skill in manipulating the expansion and development of the companies. Good depth and relatively short play time.

Update: While recognizing it is a good game, I have to say I don't enjoy playing it much. It seems to me it is all about those share auctions, and one wrong move ends your chances.

[i]Posted: 4/5/11, Rated: 8[/i]

It's confession time again.  I own [i][thing=421]1830[/thing][/i], but I don't feel that my understanding of its genre is sophisticated enough to appreciate it.  [i][thing=94]Union Pacific[/thing][/i] is more my style.  [i]Chicago Express[/i] appears to be the "missing link" when it comes to train games: it has just enough share auction and corporate valuation to be intriguing, without a lot of rules surrounding it.  In fact, I think the gameplay has been smartly pruned down to the bare essentials for a game of this type.

Side note: some people say a rule set is "elegant," others say it is "pared down."  Either way, you have a game whose rules are simple to understand, yet encompass a surprising depth of play.  [i]Chicago Express[/i] is one of those games.

I love the artwork of the board, and the wooden train markers.  The company status boards look sharp, and I appreciate their being double-sided to support an individual preference for organization (I prefer the side with $1, $5, and $25 spaces).  This is a game I definitely want to climb back aboard!

Two playings, 3 and 4 players.  It only has 4 pages of rules, but halfway through the third page the 18xx'ers I was explaining it to had all gotten glazed looks from confusion.  Its not that the rules are hard, just that it is difficult to see how they work together, i.e. "What should I be doing".  However, after finally playing things become (somewhat) clearer.  There are a lot of very closely but non-intuitively linked things happening here, looking forward to more plays to begin to figure things out.  I expect my rating will raise with further plays.

This game is absolutely brilliant.  I really enjoy seeing how poeple interact each and every game.  About fifteen minutes from the end of the game, it is clear that one or two players are not in the running for winning the game.  This is common with many games, and I feel that fifteen minutes is not long to be out of the running.  They become pawns of the leaders since they are not going to win, still must take turns, and still have influence through thier owned stock.  It is really funny to see what happens when the these people out of the running begin making meaningful choices that impact the players in the running.  I have never played a game with a similar negotiation element, which makes the game is fantastic.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2012/01/chicago-express.html]Chicago Express[/url] no defraudará a los amantes de los tren que no deseen hipotecar varias horas en una sola partida. Ofrece una experiencia adecuada en 60 minutos o menos. El juego es rápido, las decisiones tienen un impacto significativo en la situación financiera de las empresa y en la economía propia de cada jugador. El dinero es escaso. 

Chicago Express es definitivamente un paso adelante en los juegos "con temas de trenes" respecto a al  Ticket to Ride (pero muy por de bajo de un Age of Steam o Railes, y ya no te cuento los 18xx). Al ser un juego "no dificil" en su dificultad debemos ser conscientes y conocer un poco con quien lo vamos a jugar al no poderlo catalogar de juego familiar, ni de iniciación. Deben gustarte los juegos económicos, debe gustarte la subasta pura y dura, siendo esto último no agrado de todos.

Chicago Express es el juego económico que más me gusta con diferencia junto al Imperial. Creo que es una buena opción y un buena buena pieza en cualquier colección que se precie.

The first play or two are incredibly difficult to wrap your mind around - this likely turns many people off.

Just played my first game today.  This is a very well designed and tight game of stock speculation.  I love how paying the lowest price for a share does not necessarily equate to the best move, as the railroad only gets money by the capital it raises from shares sold and developed forest hexes.  Looking forward to repeated plays and developing various strategies.

This game makes you think from a different perspective than most.  It reminds me a bit of Blue Moon City in that it feels like it's "cooperative-competitive" (though more complicated strategy-wise than BMC).  In my first game, I won by a dollar and it was fun and interesting, but hard to figure out the right move.  I made a few moves that I thought were good, but mostly I was just doing what others were doing and what seemed to make sense.  Second play was fun again and I felt like I knew what to do on my turn for the most part.  I do feel like everyone is almost as much at the mercy of the other players as they are in control of their own destiny.  Fascinating game.

Quick invest and build game.  Nice components.  The rules are kind of odd.  Short and simple and yet there are almost as many exception rules--Industrial Cities are handled differently than regular cities, Detroit is handled differently than the other industrial cities, four end-game conditions.

UPDATE: Played further games, and I don't know if I like the way the limited stock plays out.  Depending on who gets what in the first half of the game, the second half can be a forgone conclusion, without any real way of changing the game state as the stocks sell out far too quickly

After only three plays, the luster of this simple design has gone completely. The game feels very scripted in such a way that when playing with more than 3, it can break down. In my opinion the game is only decent with 3 and recommend never playing with 5. With more people, Why not an increase in Action Rounds available?

A large problem is playing this with players who aren't on the same play level. One player can make a mistake and cost another player the game. 

The best thing about Chicago Express is it's greatly improved production value over the original Wabash Connonball by Winsome, which didn't even come with a box.

---------------------------------------------------------
Quick-ish rules explanation:
This is an amazing stock train game where 4/5(black) trains race to make a connection from the east coast back to Chicago. The game starts with an auction, one of each train stock, not counting black which may come out later. On a players turn they can take one of four actions;
1.)Auction a share - just auction a share up for bid. The winning bid is paid directly to that companies coffers.  Players can start an auction and pass if they are just devaluing a train. Theoretically everyone can pass and the stock gets pitched, but I don't see that ever happening.
2.)Build a house - Build a house for free on the board, increasing the value of that tile for the connecting or eventually connecting trains.
3.) Build trains - Pay money from the train's personal supply to build across the board, increasing stock value along the way. To build from a train you must own at least one share in the company. Only one train can be in forest and mountain tiles, but other tiles can be shared for more $$$. Reaching Chicago gives a big, one time payout and the first time it's reached it starts an auction for the black train.
4.)Pass - Moving one dial one spot forward and not taking an action.
The board itself shows each of the actions, along with gauges on the board linked to each. When you preform each auction you must move the gauge up one on the appropriate dial. When a dial red lines you can no longer take the action that round. When two dials red line the round is over, trains pay share holders and the dials reset.
The game ends if one of these conditions are met;
1.)Detroit's value hits 8 (Detroit moves up one after each round.)(Never seen it happen)
2.)You are down to three houses left in the supply.(Think the lowest we've seen is 8.)
3.)Three train companies run out of trains.
4.)Three companies run out of stocks.
The round is then finished and money is counted. Richest player wins.
---------------------------------------------------------
Well, now that I've made this game seem fairly boring and simplistic, let me assure you that this game is in fact possibly the greatest game ever created. Yes, actions are simple, but every play changes the outcome of the game. Projected profits of companies can be derailed. Sudden jumps toward Chicago can make trains significantly more valuable. It's amazing, and it's all player drive. No deck of cards being randomly draw, telling you what is happening for apparently no reason. The reason in this game is found by looking directly into the tiny beady eyes of the monsters you are playing.

I'm sure this game stinks with no table talk. People just keep to themselves, no taking of trains before they reach Chicago. For the most part, I wouldn't know because all I do is table talk. I want to know if you will be willing to suddenly run the red train south through the mountains crushing the blue and yellow train(Each company only has a certain amount of trains, so slight deviations from the path to Chicago will make the trip impossible.) I will try to convince you that allowing Blue to survive will put your grandma's house in danger of foreclosure. Any leverage I can get I'll use to my advantage in swaying people. There is no shame in my game, because when you beat your friends in this, you know you beat them because there was no luck involved.

I honestly can't say enough about the greatness of this game. It's difficult to cover all facets of what makes it so perfect. The closest I can come is the moment when you drive a train into Chicago right before a rival train connects, getting a huge cash boost and they suddenly realize you've made Chicago too expensive for their train to build into. Or when you abruptly send blue through the mountains and cut off a totally unaware opponents train, as they look helplessly at you just as you start twisting your mustache(fictitious or not.)

This game is a MUST BUY.

This game has a feeling of a gaming classic. The design is truly excellent, everything fits so well together. I also really like the colors and overall graphic design, Queen did a great job here. On the other hand, this is not really my type of game. It is hard for me to play this game, I often can't tell what a good move would be. This is the reason I am not rating it higher, but if you know you enjoy games with a player-driven economy, this is a must buy!

A good game in which you buy  stocks of train companies and help your train companies to do the best by building trains across the tri-state area and then a little more to get from the east coast to Chicago.  By doing certain actions like putting stations at cities and making it to Chicago you raise the points/money for that train station.  Fun, legal things to do include making your train cover the mountains so your opponents cannot cross the mountains and get to their destination.  The goal of the game is to have the most money in the end.

Very fun stock game with a railroad theme.  Enjoyed with two and I know it will be better with more people.

May 2010:  I bumped it to a 9.  I have played with all numbers now and I think the game excells at 3-4 players.  Five and six, while fun and challenging, goes a bit too fast.  Also, the Narrow gauge and Erie have added a ton to the game.  I can't see playing without those.  

Found out we played a rule wrong (when spaces are shared by other railways).  We added +1 to the cost, not multiplied.  The multiplication made a huge difference (and a good one, imo). 

Aug 2011 - No bump in rating but have to note that this can be a very mean game.  Will gladly play this with 3-6 people.

Pretty fast rail-building and stock game.  Gameplay varies with the number of players since there are only 4 main railroad companies and each one has a different number of stock certificates (3,4,5 or 6).  Also, there are a limited number of wooden trains for each company and unless you build directly to Chicago (hence the Express part of the game title), you will run out of wooden trains and never reach Chicago.  It follows the typical rail/stock game mold with player money and company money, dividends, and the goal being to have the most personal money at the end.  Wrapping your head around the dividend values is a little tough at first but not too difficult.  Initial stock purchases are typically $12-18 each, which becomes company seed money.  There are tons (~5) ways the game could end so it's kind of tough to remember all of them.  The game has almost no luck aside from not knowing what other players will do so it's important to figure out what is a fair price for shares and figure out how to work efficiently with the limited number of wooden trains.

Others say: The original Wabash Cannonball only differs in the way that dividends are rounded.

#plays (W.Cannonball): ? (best guess is 1)

Trains. Connecting cities. Shares. Gather the most money.

Clearly no Ameritrash affair, but still a solid euro. Also a game that quickly faded from memory, so it hasn't impressed me much. It's not a game where there's a clear route to victory. In that sense there should be a lot of subtleties to discover. With all the other shiny board games out there it's likely I won't play this one anytime soon.

Finally found the game! It will add to our collection of "filler" games - where the term "filler" is more in reference to the short playing time than lack of depth. Seeking this game out came strictly from reading about it on the Geek. Rating is preliminary based on a read-through. Can't wait to play!

First play didn't disappoint. This game moves along very quickly and you realize that every action is critical - the game ends surprisingly quickly!. The appearance reminds you of many stock market/revenue generating train games but the dynamics turn out to be very unique. It may be that the choice strategies and tactics will reveal themselves after some play and restrict the replayability, but at this point I'm left wanting to explore this game further.

Can't make my mind up on this one.

Half of me feels you can have lost the game in the first round, and with more than 3 there is a real impact of kingmaking (either deliberate or accidental). The other half loves a game of depth that has such a quick playing time.

I like the player interaction and the stock mechanic where shares dilute the holdings.

You need at least one partner (who's trying to HELP your company not screw it over) so you can get building routes fast, so you want equal sharing to give both incentives to help it, but if you have equal shares in a company then really you'd rather use your actions on a company where you have a monopoly, or majority.

Turn order is extremely critical. Many of the decisions you make should be driven by where you are in the seating order. If all the players realise this the game shines, if someone doesn't then they can hand the game to another without fully realising why ... :(

On balance I think the game needed a bit more development - shine has gone off, rating dropped and it's on the trade pile.

** Update, now traded - the half of me that feels the game is decided in the first round (although you might not realise it) or over influenced by kingmaking (possibly inadvertant) won out. Still consider playing it, just in no rush to.

RATING: 8
An 18xx game compromised and streamlined into 60 min, w/o the loss of game depth, a very solid design. Player interaction is really high here, as by your expanding actions you will help others. So the aim is to distribute the support or to be the one with the higher reward.
So it´s a very competive mutilayer game, with a degree of tension, player interaction and well calculated decisions.
The weak point is, that the game can be blown by players which don`t understand the nuances of the game. It´s a gamers game and should be never played with family (casual) gamers.

I find nothing more satisfyingly tense and strategic than the bidding portion of this game.

EDIT: Finally docked it a point because, as brilliant as it is if you play with people who know the value of the stocks, how often do you get to play a game with the same group of people over and over again to get to that point.

Also, a really sub-par iOS implementation of Wabash Cannonball kinda ruined the game for me.

What a great game in a small package.  If ever there was an example of not judging a game by its looks, then this is it.  Beneath the plain exterior is a tremendous, nasty and quick playing railroad game.  Interesting decisions,  plenty of conflict and short play time.  We ususally play this with 3 and our games end in under an hour.  My hope is that this game gets picked up by a major publisher and gets the high quality production and exposure it deserves.

It looks like Queen picked this up and is giving it the treatment / wider release it deserves.  If it will make it easier to get WC on the table I'll buy a copy of the Queen version too.

A pesar de ser un juego de trenes, no hay que transportar nada. Simplemente hacer conexiones por las zonas más rentables. 
En juego hay cinco compañías y al mitad de juego entra una nueva. No pertenecen a ningun jugador en particular, sino que cada compañia tiene un numero de acciones que pueden salir a subasta. 
Las acciones de los jugadores pueden ser iniciar subastas, o hacer crecer la compañia (añadiendo vías, o estaciones). Interesante final de rondas (las rondas no siempre duran lo mismo, sino que va por unos contadores de acciones, muy original). 
El juego se acaba cuando se venden todas las acciones de tres acciones, una compaía se queda sin trenes o detroit (que es una especie de contador de rondas) llega a la ronda 8.  Cuando eso sucede gana el jugador con más pasta.
Es un  juego económico bastante redondo. Recomenable.

(1 play) Played this when it still was called "Wabash Cannonball". It then had, like all Winsome Games, really crappy components and looked, like all Winsome Games, like a prototype. Queen Games has now overhauled the game and made it look like some item which is meant to meet the shelves in a game store (This doesn't mean that the Winsome edition wasn't meant to be sold, although it looked worse than even the ugliest Print-and-Play game).

The nice thing about the new Queen edition is: it costs about the same as the Winsome edition (at least here in Europe), but it now looks like a professionally produced game, which makes it worth the money, whereas the Winsome edition was terribly overpriced.

The game itself is a fun, middleweight railroad building game which can even be played by casual gamers. I'm glad that a friend of mine owns it, because I won't buy it myself due to the rather bizarre behaviour of the owner of Winsome Games on this site.

Oooh, this is a devilish little game.  Appears to be a race to build "your"  RR to Chicago, but wait, there's a LOT more to a winning strategy than that.  When to build, when to auction a share, when to buy a share and when to pass on a share, when to take a "null" action, all while taking into account turn order and available actions... Best played with experienced, skilled players, it is definitely a match of wits.

It took a few plays for us to wrap our head around this one two-player, but once we did, we were sold on it.  With more, yes, this game is a masterpiece, but for two, there are still myriad choices and trade-offs, and so far, no two games have been the same.  The timing tactics in this one are by far more intense than most any other game we own.  For an endorsement, and discussion, of the two-player game that's right on the money, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/388865]drunkenKOALA's thread[/url].  I'm in full agreement that the two-player version of this is "freaking sweet."  Plus, the Queen production values are incredible.  The box is waaaay too big, natch, but the bits are superb, as is the board art and dial gauges.

Although this is ostensibly a train game, the map only seems to serve as a way to manipulate stock prices and track precedence in certain cities. 

At its heart, this is really an auction game, and a good one at that. If you're bidding for a stock you have heavily invested in, you may want to bid high, not only to keep your majority, but also to both increase your income and maintain enough money in the company to expand that train line later on. However, if you spend too much, you may leave another stock open for another player to snag at a very cheap rate. Often the timing of the auctions matters more than anything else, and managing your money is crucial, especially early in the game. 

Since I am not a huge fan of economic games, the "penny pinching" aspect of the game is not my favorite. On the other hand, the game has a very simple, elegant rule set, which makes it easy to learn (even though it can be maddeningly difficult to plan out a winning strategy with so many things to consider). All in all, it's a very good game. I'd like to try with more players.

This is the crucial question of Chicago Express, and since the answer changes every game - hell, it changes every TURN of every game - the game is compelling to play.  Plus, it's short, so you can play it twice in an hour or so (unless you're playing with the slow accountants, mentioned above).

Does it end too quickly?  Maybe.  But I suspect this game will be getting a fair amount of my gaming time in the coming year.

This looks like a nice upgrade of Wabash Cannonball, which I have played (spookily reminiscent of Prairie Railroads but I liked it, though not as much as Steel Driver, which also has echoes of PR) but this is probably easier to acquire than SD, which is a limited edition.

UPDATE: Yeah, the replayability was pretty limited. At play 3, I'm about done, sadly. There just isn't as much game here as it initially seemed. It also seems like it's pretty much confined to a sweet spot of exactly 3 players. Extremely opaque and punishing to first-time players; moreso even than 1830, this is almost impossible to play satisfactorily with players of differing skill levels. Also, for us, it was not as short as advertised, closer to 90 minutes than 60, which was less than ideal. And the whole game end thing with the Wabash seemed a little broken. I dunno. Scanning the comments, I feel like most of the criticisms leveled at this game by people who rate it lower than I do are probably valid. But, I enjoyed a few games of it, it's an interesting game system, I'd certainly still play it again, but when the local game shop's semi-annual flea market came along, it was gone.

I seem to be getting generous in my old age, giving out a lot of 8s these days. Anyway, I thought Chicago Express was fun and quite clever. The mechanics of issuing and buying stock are rather unique in this whole stock-buying/train-building genre, so a lot of instincts are wrong (diluting your own shares by issues stocks in companies you own portions of and think are going to do well is frequently a bad idea, for example). The length of 60-90 minutes is perfect too.

I don't doubt that this will have rather limited replayability, like many of Queen's games. But also like many of their games, it's unique, clever, well-put-together, and very attractive game. Time will tell how well it will hold up, but for the moment, I'm optimistic.

A very cutthroat business game!  Do I issue shares to dilute other players' holdings or to add money to a rails treasury that I want to make a break to Chicago with?  Do I build a less than ideal rail network to block off railroads that I have no stake in, but risk running out of cubes and time to get to Chicago?  How much do I need to bid on a share to get enough money in the rail's treasury, but also make sure I make money off from the deal?  All in all, lots of interesting decisions and tense moments as you see what moves your opponents make.  Great game!

Wow, such a super interesting game, that even though it feels like a basic mix between Paris Connection and 18xx (yeah I know I am way off with those comparisons), and the fact that it is played in a little under an hour just makes it even better.  You only have a few basic options to choose between, but that is more than enough.  It makes it even better with a couple of players that haven't played it so much that they know the exact value of everything.  This is definitely a game, that if you have even one of those people playing it could get very boring and disheartening very quickly.

DISCLAIMER: I wrote the iPhone version of Chicago Express/Wabash Cannonball.

My favorite gamers' game.

Mechanically this game feels somewhat similar to Modern Art yet thematically it still feels like a train game. It narrowly beats Modern Art as my personal favorite auction game. The only disadvantages are 1) it's even more opaque than Modern Art making it tough for new players to grasp its nuances and, 2) again as with Modern Art, inexperienced players tend to randomize the winner. But I've realized this is true of any multiplayer game with any depth. Without this quality the game is either too much a multiplayer "solitaire" or its results are too dependent on player order.

A quick note on comparisons I've seen made to Diplomcacy. While it's true that Chicago Express revolves heavily around alliances, these alliances are not the product of negotiation. That is, they are not the result of cajoling, threatening, pleading, and begging as they are in negotiation games (Diplomacy, Intrigue, and sometimes Bohnanza for example). Rather, alliances are a natural consequence of players' current cash and share holdings. Alliances are "game theoretic", for want of a better phrase. Coca Lite discusses this idea at length (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/315482). His posts, and those of J C Lawrence, are required reading for any new player.

Nice quick and simple stock game! It really takes a full game to understand the strategy though. Halfway through the game we all agreed that we understood the rules but still didn't quite grasp how to go about winning the game.

Even after one play it's still a little unclear to me how to try and attack someone in the lead without fucking myself over, too. Definitely need to do some investigation here!

A good auction/railroad hybrid that basically is a more in depth airlines Europe. Funnily enough, for me, the accessibility:depth trade-off that you get when switching between the two is pretty much equal. I think you could go either way here. If you want a slightly deeper vesion, go Chicago Express. If you want a slightly more accessible one, go Airlines Europe. Simple.

Amazing that such a rich game plays at this length. The forced cooperation/timing aspects of the game felt unique to me. The presentation (Queen version)is purty. A very tricky game to play well.

In a group of experienced gamers, lots of tactics/tricks are evident right from the start. But it is still difficult to play well. A marvel.

Rated 8 after one play. A stock game that plays in about an hour. Dang! My first play felt like I was bumbling about, largely because it's tough to figure out how to value shares. But, this was very engaging. Great components, and surpisingly full of theme based on the unique attributes of the different cities you're trying to reach.

One other highlight -- those three action dials that everyone shares and that trigger the end of a round. Very clever.

In general, I'm digging stock/share games like this and Imperial 2030. I think Imperial offers more potential to tug of war over the control of countries... but man.. this game plays in an hour!

Update: I ended up trading for this game, playing it once, and trading it away. I had also played the ios app a bit. It's not a bad game. However, the difference between winning and losing between good players is miniscule... it's a game of eeking out that $1 or $2 advantage. And if someone is unfamiliar with the game... forget it. I respect the slick design, but I'd prefer more wiggle room in the game play.

There are a lot of train games out there and this one didn't do it for me. It feels scripted due to the way the board is laid out and on your turn you can end up with several options all of which will advantage your opponent more than you if you have fallen behind.

I relate to the seeming ambiguity about not counting shares in winning total, but apart from that this is a quick and thoughtful game. The mechanics and exactness of decisions are not immediately obvious which means there is plenty to discover in subsequent plays. It would appear though that it is a game of slim margins and that small decisions are important. I look forward to a second play and applying an 'investment' and return lense to it now that I understand the mechanics.

After six plays, I can't get this game out of my head. It has got so much going for it: relatively simple ruleset, very short playing time for the decision-making burden, very brittle, shockingly difficult to control dynamics, and major screwage factor. Originally an 8. Going up to a 9 now. I just boosted this to a 10. So much game! i'm 11 plays in and still feel like I can't even control it. It is one of the few heavy games that I just want to play again right away.

So far clearly the best of this year's Essen (2007) and I don't see anything that might challenge that position.  The obvious progenitors are Pampas Railways and Wooden Shoes and Iron Monsters.  From Pampas Railroads it borrows the same actions in the same distribution, special dividends and payout patterns, but loses the concentrated value of the development action due to the lower rate of sharing city locations.  From Wooden Shoes and Iron Monsters it borrows the core share dilution pattern and several flavours of end-game clock. but loses   the delicacy of turn order control and the layered aspect of the grouping shares.  It is game in which every decision counts, even the seemingly little ones.  

Wabash Cannonball is a sub-hour 3-4 player ultra-efficient knife-fight of an economic game.  I love it.  The primary patterns are emergent alliances and incentive structures.  Everything you do from the moment the game starts helps someone and hurts someone else, sometimes the same person.  Everything you do incentivises players to take actions that variously help and hinder you.  Much of the game comes down to ensuring that those short-lived emergent alliances, built totally on individual greedy self-interest, work in sum to your advantage.  Everything in the game, including how long the game will last and the rate at which the game will play, is in the player's control and driven by that mesh of incentives and self-interest that the players have communally built.  

This is a tough game.  Really, tough.  There is a lot of butterfly effect and the long term effect of decisions is often difficult to even vaguely estimate.  This results in a strange problem: While it is a game that greatly rewards skill, it is also particularly opaque.  This can often lead to players winning through no great skill of their own, but rather because the other players simply failed to prevent them from winning or unknowingly handed the win to another player.  This is not inherently a bad thing and many games are like that.  The problem is that because the game is so particularly opaque, that seeing that this is happening and preventing it presents an unusually subtle learning curve.  The result can leave many early games feeling somewhat random, and in truth they will be rather random...until the players start to catch on and all the players at the table are of comparable skill.    

What makes this particular trip so interesting is that the game is also highly prone to groupthink until the players really catch on to what is going on with the game.  Most of the groupthink is centred around the shifting alliances of cash and share ownership, and more so than most such games, the groupthink is so easily broken.  Most of our early games had the Pennsylvania reaching Chicago first and being a great cash cow.  The result is that the Pennsylvania shares are increasingly hotly contested -- all until the B&M and NYC both conspired, to their owner's mutual profit, to shut down Pennsylvania hard and fast before it had a chance to go anywhere.  The Pennsylvania players lost big in that game...and I see no reason for any groupthink to be similarly easily defeatable.  Another similar pattern: In another recent game the B&O was nigh to reaching Chicago first.  It seemed obvious that B&O would hit Chicago and flood money into the game.  The fourth and last B&O share was quickly auctioned and the player who already had two snapped it up.  The result was that the player with only one share in the B&O ran the B&O low on cubes so it couldn't reach Chicago, and then did the same thing to the NYC for similar reasons in the next round.  In a few easy actions he very efficiently removed two other players from contention, turning a four player game into a two player contest with 2 also-rans.  The resulting summary is that competition is good, but too much competition will lead to castration, which isn't so good...

Prepare for the game to end faster than you expect.  So far our fastest game was 3 players in 20 minutes.  Most games are under 45 minutes.  The longest was 4 players in 90 minutes including rules teaching.  Several 4 player games have ended in well under an hour including rules teaching.  Let the player to your right run your companies to Chicago.  Pick your partners carefully. Ensure that companies in which you are a minor investor can't reach Chicago due to cube or money exhaustion if you have something better to do.

Control of when the game will end is everything.  Be careful!

Hmm...  I'm a bit torn about this one.  It's a reprint of a supposedly good game, and it looks well-made.  The current version is produced by Rio Grande, whom I like.  Plus, a stock-market type railroad game might be a nice change from the "ship-the-goods" mechanic.  However, it seems that it's still owned by Winsome Games, with whom (for various reasons) I have no desire to do even indirect business.  I may need to check out Steel Driver, which I hear compares well with it.

:indigo: :( :what: :) :D :) :what: As tightly and beautifully designed as any game I've ever played. As many rules as are needed, with no more. As much complexity as needed, with no more. A tremendous amount of depth in a game that you can teach in 15 minutes and play in 45. 50% of the game is in the auctions, 45% in controlling the tempo of the game (and when to trigger the end), everything else is the frosting. Putting a share up for auction can several things at once: it can dilute the value of existing shares, it pumps money into a railroad, it can implicitly offer other players to join you in pushing a road you already own, it can implicitly sow division between the members of an existing partnership, and it means that someone is giving up a chunk of their hard-earned kitty, which is both their capital and their victory points.

Once you understand this, Chicago Express reveals its true identity as a nasty, filthy game of trust and betrayal. It takes a pretty extraordinary set of moves to run companies that make you enough money to win without help from [i]somebody[/i].

Agricola Syndrome is a problem for n00bs -- you'll set up a railroad that would absolutely win the whole damn thing for you if the game lasted twice as many turns as it did. But it doesn't, so it won't, so you just screwed yourself with your pants on, Giselle.

If a dominant strategy is emerging in your group, change up, it's groupthink. A good group who plays regularly will see fads emerge -- you'll go from "The Person Who Controls The PRR Controls The Universe" to "Why Would Anyone Buy Into This Broke-Ass Railroad" and from there to a more moderate opinion over time.

The only knock on this is stockholding games are not everyone's idea of fun, nor are auction games, so some people will not see it. But for the rest of us, it's as good as it gets.

Best with four players, but playable with 3 or 5.

10-04-13 - Played one solo game to get the rules down.  This is a 90-minute railroad game that packs a real wollup of a punch.  This is an auction game for the ages.  While railroading might be the theme, you better your auction A-game to win this one.  The margins are tight, here, and the game will have to be played several times by players before they begin to grasp the order of actions, and when it makes sense to call up a share for an auction.

9/1/08: The Erie expansion makes this game an easy 10.

Wow! This little firecracker of a game is dead simple, adorably presented, and terrific fun. Comparisons to the 18xx lines seem to be popping up all over the place. After playing the game, I don't really understand them. Wabash Cannonball is about as different from an 18xx as Age of Steam is.

A shocking amount of game is packed into a tiny little package. The relationship between players and corporations strongly encourages vicious collusion between players, while the rules for stock acquisition, corporate financing, and dividend 'break points' encourage careful, precise spending that should keep games close among alert players. Speculation is present, as route and income development can be foiled very quickly by a neighboring railroad that suddenly has a lot of shareholders eager to build some destructive track! Auctions should see profit margins sliced razor-thin.

More games, and the Wabash keeps getting more interesting. At first we didn't know what to do with it and thought its function was mostly do set the end of the game on a hair-trigger. Later, we began to see the value of running it directly to Chicago, especially if the round is almost over. Finally we are now learning to value the Wabash as a powerful later-game entity, with a fantastically challenging initial auction based on turn order, available actions, player cash, player position...

For such a challenging game, it's surprising how much control players have. That is to say: when a player discovers a new way to exploit the engine, he can usually make out like a bandit. However, the very next game (and sometimes even later in the same one!), the technique can be neutralized through collusion, or simple caution. The ease with which players can do this owes largely to the nakedness of the engine's pivot points and the large degree of control each individual has over the shape of a turn. This ease, in turn, generates a game where collusion is required but politics are a distraction. This is a rare treat and the best feature of this excellent title.

I love that you can lose the game in the first few auctions and not realize it until the very end of the game.  There is much to explore here, and I am just scratching the surface.  the ruleset is easy to read and remember, but the gameplay is something else.  You need to understand the power (and necessity) of collusion.  You need to realize that the race to Chicago is not the meat of the game.  You need to collude to ruthlessly bring the leader back down and grind his railroads into dead ends in the mountains.  If not, you will probably have a boring game, and ask "is that it"?  It is almost like container in that respect.  The system can be fragile, but if your game is boring, I would place the blame on how the players made decisions. 

After a lot of soul searching, I have traded this great game away.  Although I found it immensely interesting, nobody I play with was ever that enamored with it.  In the end, it made more sense to trade it away for a game that might get played rather than let it sit on the shelf where I could longingly look at it from time to time.  I hope it lands with a good home.

I've played twice.  Each game felt very different. I find that I really want to play again.

The components are entirely stark. The game really is nothing more than a prototype, components-wise. Also, I am not convinced that its really much of a simulation of anything. 

But none of that matters..because the game is genius fun. The turns are short. You can only do one of 3 actions (or take a non-action). There are limited shares of stock. There is limited track with which to build. 

The decisions become very much like a tug of war. Often, you can do little to improve your position on a turn, but you can hurt someone(s) else's.  Its important to recognize your strong choices and develop a bit of strategy. 

A weak player can probably inadvertently throw the game, so its important to play with fairly level skills among all players.

I've played this several times. My game comment was lost when the entry was split with Chicago Express.

Not much to add about this one, except its nice at how quickly it plays....and how opaque the strategy is. Most players will play VERY badly initially. But as the light starts to come on you realize what a great game this is...and all in a tight little package. 

I'd like to upgrade to the Chicago Express components sometime..now that the expansion is licensed by Queen, too.

Something clicked instantly for me with this game, but some people I play with find it to be too "opaque" for their liking. I understand the complaint, but I think this is a game you need to play a few times with the same group to see the intricacies emerge. I hope to do just that!

Wabash is essentially a refinement of the Prairie Railways Series with the math simplified, but with a few interesting nuances added into the mix. Players invest in companies by buying stock, that money is then used to expand routes and to increase the value of the railroads. Actions can also be expended to develop the areas that the railroads are connected to. The end goal is simple: make money.

So as I said, this game is strongly reminiscent of the Prairie Series, in particular, the best game in the series, Pampas. The action here is driven in the same way: by a very finite pool of actions that players compete for the use of. The refinements here are interesting and well implemented though, specifically the different amount of shares and track pieces available to each company as well as the way in which the stock is handled; as it dilutes easily, which creates evil player interaction, which I like.

Just like the Prairie games, this is a game where you want partners though, because then your company will get twice as many actions, and be more likely to get where you want to go. A company left by itself, with no work being done on it, and only the initial share sold can be quite profitable as well though, and players need to guard against that as well.

Also like the Prairie games, the turn order is extremely critical. Many of the decisions you make should be driven by where you are in the seating order. The Wabash is a great example of this, depending on where you are in the order when it opens and how many expansion and capitalization actions are left, it can either be extremely valuable, a way to make a buck or two, or a huge money and time sink that can/will cost you the game.

One question mark for me initially was the track building. The fact that anyone who owns a share can build track means that it is very easy, perhaps too easy, to burn up the company treasury in an aggressive move, and to exhaust valuable track tiles in the process. This creates an interesting tension to the game, and some unique interactions though, and has ended up being one of the benefits of the game with more experience, as it drives some very interesting auctions where a given person does not want another given person to win, because they know they are buying the stock just to trash their position.

The only notable blemish on the game for me at this point is the weakness of the development action's utility in comparison to the Prairie games. In the Prairie games, there are 6 companies instead of 4, and 5 stocks in each of them. What this means, in a game sense, is that there are more companies visiting each city, and each player can own more stocks over the course of the game. What this also means is that the development action, which functions similarly, is much, much more useful on average because there are more places where you have stocks in two or more railroads at the same locale, and hence, you can milk a bigger boost out of the action. The Pampas income calculation scheme also rewards companies for having multiple links into/out of a given locale rather than just being present [i]in[/i] that locale, so, for instance, having 4 links running into/out of a given area, and then developing that area leads to a quadruple bonus to the income...very strong. The Prairie games also let you double develop at a cost, which was inexplicably left out of Wabash as well, even further weakening this track. Given that Wabash is the first game in what will be a series, I anticipate this weakness in the game will be fixed either by increasing the number of rail companies, by allowing the double develop action, or by replacing it entirely. Any of those solutions, or all of them in concert, would likely improve the game system. When these changes occur, I anticipate Wabash's rating will fall. This isn't to say that development is completely useless, because it's not. In a longer game, it can add important value to company without having to expand track and the action can also be a good way to delay the end of the round (this second use is the one that it is most frequently put to).

All of this said, Wabash is a true heavyweight game, yet it is playable in less than an hour. It keeps the interesting alliance system from the Prairie games, but it changes the rules and interactions just enough to be in its own unique category. I think it's ultimately too limited to ever reach above 8 status and anticipate it falling to a 6-7 once revisions are made available (first coming at Esssen 2008). Hard to say though, since Wabash itself seems to be receiving expansions as well, perhaps one of those will push this game in the direction I would like it to go more than the descendant games will, hard to say at this point. 

The bottom line for the present though: if this game was longer it wouldn't be as good as it is, but with the short playtime and tough decisions, I have to respect this one.

Update, Fall 2008: I still really like Wabash but the rating for the base game has fallen to a 7. I wouldn't push it lower than that, but I always prefer to play the Erie version of the game which is at least one full notch better than the base game because of the decisions that it adds to the mix.

Update, Fall 2009: Wabash is slowly accumulating a stable of mini-expansions. I've now started ranking the game as a whole in this entry and then rating the expansions up or down from the base of 5 (average game experience) in their own entries. Wabash is a definite 9 at this point, though I think it's at its best with the mini-expansions (Erie, Narrow Gauge) thrown into the mix when you're playing with an experienced table, as both add some extra things to think about. It's important to take some time to play with each expansion though, as each adds some different texture to the game.

A very deep and tense [u]stock[/u] driven train game with high player interaction. It's more about investing stocks than a train game. Cutthroat, with no luck and high replayability. Rules are simple but it's tough to play well. Best with 4 or 3 players.

 I should give it a go.

Edit: Gave it a go. Did not think much of it at all. The extremely slight similarity to the detestable Aquire is there. Runaway leader problems are surely inevitable in any game where you use money to buy shares and you earn money from share dividends. I had lost the game within the first round but as much as I suspected it, I still played out the rest of the game and was surprised that I came last by a lot less than I expected. I doubt anyone could convince me that this game has something I would really like about it so I probably will never play it again.

I enjoyed my first play of this game.  I liked that the allotment of actions were shared by all players each round.  I'm reluctant to purchase this because I wonder how much replay value it has.  From my one play, and the talk around the table, it seems like there's a best way to win and that players will compete for that path each game.

RATING: 4
Update: Ok, I get that is a good design, but it's just not fun for me. I like the zero-randomness in Luna, but don't like it here. I like the cooperation in Santiago, but don't like it here. I even like the mathy/zero-randomness-not-even-during-setup/stock-based train game Stephensons Rocket, but not this. I think the auctions are what drive me crazy, and that's most of the game. Also the constant math to figure out how to squeeze a dollar out. I guess in SR more things can go haywire with the vetos and mergers that it's harder to calculate things so precisely, which I like, because I [i]don't[/i] like calculating things precisely. A lot of people seem to like this kind of stuff, so I'm willing to accept it's just me. Either way, I'm done. Headed to the sale pile.

-----------------

Preliminary rating. Not because the rules are complex. In fact the rules are incredibly simple. But at the initial auctions I had no idea what to bid for anything, nor any inkling like I should know. After the first few turns, it was clear that I wasn't winning, and I had literally no idea what I could do to better my position relative to other players. As the game was about to end, I think it started to click. The auction prices for shares is about figuring out how many more dividends there will be. Very interesting. I was eager to try again immediately after, but others were ready for something different. Note: it is unlikely that my rating can go much higher, as I tend to like a little randomness in my games, at least during setup. This game has 0. Speaking of which, I just realized this reminds me a ton of Clippers (weird that none of my Geek Buddies mentioned that). Fixed setup, zero luck, multiple lines which are not players get portional ownership of, all trying to connect up with stuff starting from the east and heading west.

RATING: 6
Chicago Express plays very rapidly, even with a full complement of 5, and has the benefit of stripping away nearly all unnecessary bagage which is weighing down other titles in this genre. As a result, the game's structure is exceedingly clear and understandable compared to other train & stock games, allowing the players to discover the ebb and flow of the game on their own without too much problems.

And that is more or less where their problems begin. Apart from a few gamey rules, this game is a complex exercise in n-party Nash equilibria where 2 ≤ n ≤ number of players. In normal language: it benefits a subgroup of players more to cooperate than to fight each other. In Chicago Express the typical pattern of this (usually seen between inexperienced gamers) is when two players divide the shares of one successful company between them, get paid big dividend, and then use that dividend to leverage themselves into other companies, diluting the market share of their respective owners. Once this pattern is up and running it is very difficult to derail it, and usually causes sour faces around the table. In order to counter this pattern, other players need to wrap their heads around a completely alien concept in euro-boardgaming: cooperation. Helping a competitor, expecting to be helped in return, but only to the point where the previously mentioned dynamic duo is reigned in; and all that because the alternative is [i]really[/i] to lose. And no cutting corners either. Players [i]need[/i] each other in order to survive, and that makes it both tough and interesting. Unfortunately to date I haven't played a single game which made the game 'work' as it should have.

Chicago Express makes it extra difficult for the other players because there is an 'entrance fee' of sorts to start cooperating, namely the price of purchasing stock. Other games based on this pattern like for example Die Dolmengötter and Bridges of Shangrila, do not have such an entrance fee, and are consequently more forgiving, and thus more fun to play. You may be behind the rest for a few moves, and still lose all the same, but at least there is a [i]feel[/i] of participation until the end. This has not been the case in any of the games of Chicago Express I have played to date. As a result I'm in two minds about this game. It does the Nash-equilibrium thing very well, and presents you with a tough challenge to boot. But at the same time the current rules create unpleasant game situations [i]very[/i] easily, giving it a masochistic learning curve. I cannot say if the level of self-punishment will subside once you become more experienced; as it stands now it's too much of an effort for me and the groups I play with. So I guess we're all not as hardcore as we thought.

Moral of this story: be careful with this game. Technically it is strong if not very strong, likely 8-material. Practically to date it has been average at best with drawn-out and unpleasant sessions, approximately a 5. I'm averaging to 6, but that doesn't tell the whole story [i]at all[/i].

I like it.  Quite a lot.  Perfect information without seeming dry.  Auction psychology in a perfect information game is new to me, and adding to it the "dilution" factor lends to some interesting brinksmanship.  You may turn a profit by buying this... but will it get diluted further?  And, even if you do turn a profit, would you rather hold onto those dollars for the next auction?

The actual train mechanics are rather inconsequential.

RATING: 8
The game has a lot of depth. So much so that at times I get lost on what the best move is. There is some mental math in it, particularly in the later half of the game that spins me around. With practice I believe all parts will become more enjoyable. 

There is a counterintuitive element about getting stock. In many economic games, acquiring more stock is good. In this one, that is only true sometimes. Other times it really can hurt you. 

For now, it's a great game. Perhaps if I get my arms around strategies in different scenarios I will rate it higher.

A game about stock prediction and is a train game. Little bit different than 18XX game, since it plays so fast and on smaller scale. But it also has no luck and the game varies greatly by player actions. Means it can be sedate or nasty depends on the player.

RATING: 7
Components: Fun, detailed shares. Attractive board with mostly intelligible iconography.

Experience: Auction games are tough the first time around, especially when throwing in the math about how buying a new share will affect the price of shares, and estimating how many times dividends will be paid out by the end. Playing with secret money seems essential.

I like that players have just a simple choice on their turn, to take one of three actions. Extending train lines is fun, and it's clever both how they are funded from the railway's coffers, and how they increase the value of the line. I also like how player turns really influence downstream decisions; not only might my action close off a similar action for the next player, but it might change the value of remaining stock, thus making an auction more appealing. The game moves at a fast pace, and can end suddenly.

A great game.  The stock manipulation of 18XX without the playing time.  Even my friend who "Doesn't like train games" likes it.  Proper bidding in the auctions is the essential skill.  You don't want to bid too much, as the money will rot in the company treasury and you don't want to bid too little as the company won't have enough capital.  Also you want help building up the company, so you need partners.  Diplomacy is very important.  Wonderfully complex for such a short game.

Incredibly tight rules which present a much meatier game than expected. Knowing when to take certain actions seems to be crucial, as attempting to buy stock as my first action when playing this for the first time had created an immense butterfly effect that I could never recover from. Really want to explore this further. Inspires me to want to dive into Age of Steam and 18xx.

Still need to play with experienced players, but almost won a 5P game starting with no shares by making a smart investment on NYC near the end of round 1, and doing nothing but goading others into overbidding every other share and a couple of other actions with NYC. Came second by $3 on the back of that single share finishing on round 4, I doubt that tactic would actually work with experienced players but I found it amusing.

A pure economic bidding game, but not as interesting as Container.  Much less newbie-friendly, as it's harder to value the shares of stock.  Overall, not bad, but seems to require a couple of plays to fully experience what it has to offer.

Update: 2nd game was better in terms of my score and my enjoyment.  May suffer from some runaway leader.  A few turns from the end, it was obvious who would win and there was little to be done about it.  Maybe this shows that it's very tough to recover from early mistakes. 

Rating lowered, as I realize that with open information, there's too much calculating potential value.  Whoever does this best will be the winner.  As I like to play fairly quickly, overcalculating is a drawback for me.

I saw this as Imperial with trains, except I didn't like the shared ownership mechanic - the possibility for sabotage instead of cooperation seemed too likely. Also it looks like it's never good to allow one line have single ownership, as the owner will just get tons of cash.

This game is a really good design. Amazingly quick setup and playtime... but it's not a lightweight game. There's a lot of really good decision making and many opportunities for sneaky plays.

A little auctioning, stock holding and a clever sort of route building make for a very solid game. Again, considering how short the playtime is, I'm impressed. (My group--five generally slow players who had never played this before--played our first session in just over an hour.)

What I liked:
* Quick game, relatively simple
* Easy to teach but does take a couple of plays to learn
* I liked the fact you were dealing with shares and spending money that had been put into the train companies.

What I didn't like:
* Seemed a bit too easy to kingmake

Will need another play to see if I feel any different.

A brilliant design. This thing streamlines the Pampas Railroads style gameplay down to less than an hour that is loaded with excruciating decisions and thought-provoking player interaction. It does have a little too much math, for my tastes, and it is possible to get burned by by making one seemingly minor decision early on that really borks your late-game, but I can take some medicine with my cotton candy. The component quality is really a non-issue for me and I actually think a plain white map probably makes the game easier to play.

I'm really not sure what to make of this game.  On the one hand, it's got some fun stock manipulation and auction elements that I'd like to explore further.  On the other, it's a tight economied evil game of fucking other people over.  Not sure it's for me ultimately.

Simple and elegant, with a short playing time, yet deep and thoughtful. There, that is Chicago Express in a nutshell.  It's a lovely game, and the Queen edition also looks great.  It's an auction game with a sort of area control mixed in.  But done a bit differently this time, with an absolutely brilliant idea of company's money being generated by the money paid by the winners in the share auctions themselves.  There really aren't many games around that pack such a punch in so short a time, so yes, this is a definite must in any serious collection.

RATING: 4.75
Chicago Express is a stock market train game following in the footsteps of the 18xx series, but simplified and made to play in 45 - 60 minutes.

I'm sure there is a good game in there, but it has been simplified so much that it is practically an abstract.  In fact, the low rating is because the theme in regard to how the stock market works made the mechanics more difficult to understand for me.  So the more familiar you are with how stocks work in the public markets, the more difficult it will be for you to wrap your head around this game. For instance, when someone else buys stock in your company, you lose a lot of value.  Normally this isn't the case since the value you lose is made up for by the money that is given to the company (a portion of which you own).

Once you get over the counter intuitive use of the stock market theme, then you find that the game is largely a timing game.  You want to manipulate when the game ends, because the only important factor is cash on hand at the end of the game (without regard for the value of the companies that you own).  This is counter intuitive because you can sell stock to get cash.  And if the companies are not public, then you wouldn't be able to buy them at will.  Anyhow, the theme is marginal at best, and it makes playing the game more difficult in more ways than it probably helps with understanding the game.

I can see the potential for this game, so my rating might go up in the future, but for now, I'm not eager to play again after my third try (and I didn't much enjoy the first two games).  It is simply too abstract and dry for me.  It feels like a math exercise where you're solving for X, and X is when the game will end.

--- Edit ---
I have now played this game enough to see that is has a good amount of depth for the small number of rules it uses.  I normally like games with few rules and a lot of depth, but this one doesn't work too well for me.  I don't like games where I have to work out mathematical calculations.  I much prefer games where it's not possible to figure out the math, so you have to sit back and make good judgement.  

If you like Powergrid and Age of Steam, you might like Chicago Express.  It's not my type of game.

This is another train game where you buy stock in the railroad and it pays out based on how much revenue it generates.  It plays a lot quicker than 18XX and is much simpler.  I almost rated it an 8, but I'm not sure it has a lot of replayability.  There are several end-game conditions.  So I think the key strategy is managing how soon the game will end and adjusting strategy to take advantage of it.  My play was a 6er game, and there just wasn't enough stock to go around.  The only way to generate money is w/stock...and when 3 piles of stock are gone, the game is over.  So stock ran out quickly.  Luckily I had stopped buying after my initial 3 shares.

After another play, this game feels like it is lacking in depth. Dropping from 7--> 6.  Build out fast to chicago, hope others jump onboard to help you get there.

Chicago Express was my introduction to Cube Rail games, and it was an excellent introduction. I enjoyed it greatly for the time I had it, but I eventually grew frustrated both with my skill differential over my opponents, and with the fragility of the game. I will still play it (and like it), but these two items were sufficiently annoying for me to want to pass the game on. I would rather just play German Railways at this point.

RATING: 8
(Chicago Express version).  Players are stock market players, investing in rail companies and influencing their capitalisation and expansion.  Very simple game where players get a chance to do (or do not) one of three actions, then wind the game clock forwards a cog.  Options are auction a new stock share, expand a railway company across the map, or improve an area of the map a company has already reached.  Auctions inject capital into companies, which is spent on expansion, which improves stock prices.  Every so often the game will pay dividends, paying out cash to the players.  Most cash wins.  Lovely looking game, plays fast, but boiled down, it's a very dry exercise in mathematics.  The oversized trains cover the board up fast, making the important details in a hex a pain to see.  It's like Knizia, Moon and Wallace got together and knocked out a train game.

When Arnold Schwarzenegger used to compete as a body builder he had a friend named Franco Columbo.

It's a no-luck (+) negotiation game (+) about trains (+). Every move shifts the incentives of other players in subtle (the development action) or far-reaching (auctioning a share in a powerful company) ways.

The potential downfall of a no-luck game is the tendency for games to fall into particular patterns. Will that occur with Chicago Express? That remains to be seen.

Played once with 2P, once with 3, once with 4, and an aborted play with 5. 2P will probably prove to be less interesting. That's OK, my girlfriend doesn't like it much anyway. I'm not actually sure if I'll be able to get this the play it deserves, but it certainly deserves play.

Edit: My group enjoys it, so it may get the play it deserves after all. Good with 3 and 4; I'm not entirely certain about 5, but we'll see with time. Player's shaping of the situation is incredibly important; know who you're playing with and what they're looking for.

And don't play with Eurogamers. The game is about making more money than everyone else, not making the most money!

Impressive, fast, railway economic game with a lot to look at and consider throughout the game.   There's perfect information and some back-scratching.  Alliances are key, and timing of null actions can be critical.   It's subtle, but easy to learn.  The subtleties start to really shine with experienced players.  One of my favorite share-holding games.  I tend to prefer this over heavier, longer, more simulation-oriented train games.  There's a line where those become more work than game, but Chicago Express feels like 100% game to me.

After 1 Play: The game is deceptively simple. I've not played a stock holding, or "train game" like this before, so I feel like I'm at the base of a pretty steep and jagged mountain. One play is not nearly enough to figure this one out, and luckily one other person we played with and I both want to get back to this. So for now, all I'll say is this game is deceptive...what you want to do, and what you should do dont appear to be obvious.

Other than that; you can buy this cheap, it has depth it seems, good components (although not a fan of paper money), and looks nice and easy to read.

I had no idea what to expect the first time I sat down to this game, but by the end of it I was hooked. I believe this is the first game I played that involved buying shares. Because of that much of what you would do to help yourself would also help anyone else who had shares in that particular company. I found it very engaging and very fun to play because of that. I have a couple of trains games that I like, but I don't have a special draw to them. If you don't particularly care for train games, you may still like this one.

An enjoyable game with a quite subtle share mechanism - it's not obvious what you should do to maximise your income. I've only played once but would be happy to try again. We tended to vastly overpay for shares, and as a result one player ended up with less money than he started with! To be fair it was hard for a newbie to correctly assess the likely range of values but I suspect that subsequent games would be quite tight.

Now that Chicago Express has been played, I can compare it with Steel Driver which is a very similar game and fills a similar niche in one's collection.  Chicago Express feels like a more open game with more choices available.  Let's compare:  SD requires you to auction shares at the beginning of every round whereas CE gives the players the option.  SD requires that companies spend money they have if they are able to do so whereas CE allows you to build routes when you feel like or increase the companies by developing where they already have a route built.  SD ends in 5 rounds regardless of what happens whereas in CE there are multiple ways in which the game could end, but it still has a maximum number of turns.  I'm not even going to get into Steel Drivers end game cube grab again.  While Steel Driver is not a bad game, I can't see why anyone would rather play it over Chicago Express.

This game has one of the simplest rulesets around, but still delivers a real "train game" experience. I have played this with "gamers" as well as my family group with great success on both fronts. Any adult that has ever had to balance a check book or is capable of a tiny bit of math can pick this up, gamer or not.

Is this the best Gateway into 18xx games?

Found a possible flaw that keeps it from staying permanently in the Gateway category. The ability to really screw someone's available track moves the game into the cutthroat category. This is not something that will be apparent to new gamers, but it's hard not to take this action when you know it is optimal, but are still playing with new folks. It will seriously piss them off. 

Still a very enjoyable game!

I found the concept of the game to be interesting and the design excellent. I like the selfishly-cooperative style of play. True to theme, I wanted to be the wealthiest, no matter who I had to step on.

After the auction, a few players predicted the results and proved spot on. Apparently, owning certain stocks at the outset greatly increases your chances of winning. That doesn't sit well with me, especially if I need to teach the game to new players.

Don't shy away from trying this game - it plays to theme and is well-made. Just be sure to bid for Philadelphia.

Train game with auctions, more suited for gamers.  By Harry Wu.

Chicago Express is not for everyone, given that it’s an economic game that relies strongly on subtle interaction through auctions and tough decisions. But it has the advantage of being very accessible, and the simple rule-set and very quick play time makes it easy to get into and come back to. Those who are prepared to return to it will find themselves discovering more depth with each return visit, and a very deep and satisfying experience as a result of the changing alliances that lie at the heart of the game’s engine. The reimplementation by Queen Games has given high quality production values which will please gamers who appreciate the value of a tight and thoroughly rewarding game design that is as deep and replayable in view of its economics and interaction as it is accessible and beautiful. This is a highly regarded title well deserving of the many accolades it has received, and for new gamers to explore and discover the treasures it so readily offers.

Most of my plays of this one are via the iPhone app, not in person. That damn, Carnegie is tough to beat! A brilliant game for torquing the incentive grid while riding temporary emergent alliances to greater effect than your opponents. Er, can't remember, but I picked those terms up somewheres…

While I do think it's great at what it does, the experience is not in my wheelhouse of fun. It's not so much a marathon but rather a very short race in which you're cutting each other's limbs off and seeing who can crawl across the finish line. What I mean is, it's more about the opportunities of others that you destroy than it is about those you create for yourself. That's a perfectly fine Machiavellian experience, but not one I'll gravitate to first on game night. When I do wish to thwart, though, this is a great choice.

An excellent game based on  railroads, obviously. It takes at least one game to work it all out. Clever stuff. Its not really a railroad game at all, but a business / stock market simulator. It does seem like the game can be over too quickly some times.

Rating after one play. It was definitely a learning game I played. A mistake during the first turn haunted me for the rest of the game. Should be interesting to see if more plays will reveal new strategies, or if it is indeed one of those games that is so "mechanical" that if you don't do what you are 'supposed to' during your turn, you can't win.

One plus of this game is that even with a terrible start, game play was less than an hour, so I didn't waste a lot of time sitting around knowing I was going to lose.

Good, fast stock game.  Emergent alliances key.  Bought on the recommendations of clearclaw, MrCranky and statonv. 

More plays will be needed to determine any kind of good strategy. (After more plays, I'm still no good at this game, but slightly better than everyone else around here :))

(Note: I own Wabash Cannonball, which was hived off from CE post facto.  I feel that the formfactor of the original is better than the re-release, and have marked CE down slightly to reflect that.)

I gave this a trial run in Essen and got a full play now at Beyond Monopoly!. I'm not good at auctions, it's much more of a money game than a train game. But I really like the simple dials to track the actions and drive the pay-outs, much nicer than moving cubes on a track. Overall an attractive game and a good experience, but the same old lame auction mechanism and lots of paper money mark it down for me.

Different enough from my other RR games.  It is an interesting & logical mechanic that money used to purchase shares is the money available for building--therefore, you want to buy shares at a high price, yet not so high that you can't purchase other shares.  You only spend your money on purchasing shares.  It is good to have the majority of a RR line, yet if another player is helping you build it (he must own shares in it), you have a better chance of being the first to Chicago, which yields bonuses. 

Nice board & components.

While I enjoyed the stock related things of this game, and building out the rail lines, this kind of 18xx-lite is not really my cup of tea.

I was able to parter with the 2 other players, but unfortuneatly made some poor moves and did some of their work for them.

I don't have enough interest to play this enough times to really value the stocks correctly or to discover the right way to play the other players against each other.

Packs a ton of game in a short time.  I've had games of this I'd almost rate a 10, but it's just so damn inconsistent.  You really need experienced players, and even then the game can be totally crap.  Even after 14 games, we can still screw up the initial auction so bad that someone looks to win it from the second round.  It just behaves a bit like an unstable system.  The smallest perturbations can have disastrous consequences.  I find there is a lot of subtle kingmaking in my decisions as well.  A lot of times I have a choice between hurting one person or another, forming one alliance or another.  Usually the game is so tight there is no obvious answer.  It just delights and frustrates me in equal measure.  I never know quite what to think.

Rating and comment after 1 play:

The hex numbers are small, the scoring in industrial towns is strange and frankly the game itself was not a lot of fun. For a stock market game I prefer [thing=827][/thing] or [thing=433][/thing].
But I did like the turn mechanic, and the triggering of dividends, and the forming of alliances. 

Overall I won;t be rushing back to it, and am surprised it's rated so highly but, you know, it's trains I suppose.

In fact, it's pretty close to Rocket when I think about it.  I think I need to play more...

Strangely similar to Steel Driver, but feels less abstract. It is therefore probably the friendlier of the two. Both are simple market games with hard-to-evaluate share values. In Chicago Express, the difficulty come not only from the possibility of reaching Chicago, but also from the potential for share dilution. This dilution mechanism is one of the more interesting aspect of the game, but still I slightly prefer Steel Driver for its simplicity.

Első játék nem sikerült túl jól, mert az első licitben túlköltekeztem és onnan teljesen beszorultam.

Legközelebb tolunk még, mivel nagyon gyors és élvezetes játék. A licitálós játékok gyenge pontját ez is magában hordozza sajnos: nagyon eltérő képességű játékosoknak nincs értelme együtt játszani, mert teljesen felborul az egyensúly.

RATING: 6
Chicago Express is a short, rather meaty railroad game (of the stock market variety as opposed to pick-up-and-deliver). Since most actions benefit some players and hurt other (or even the same) players at the same time the best actions to take aren't always obvious. In the end, it seems the winner will simply be the one who manages to make the other players hurt him the least.

After the first game I'm not sure how much control one really has. There is no randomness as such in the game, but the direct consequences of the other players' choices mean that in some cases you're simply screwed. Once you have fallen behind the only way to come back is hoping that the other players hurt each other enough to let you squeeze back in.

Now, trying to manipulate those incentive structures so that other players leave you alone and harrass someone else instead is certainly interesting in its own right, and the game is short enough that this aspect doesn't weigh too heavily but it isn't entirely satisfactory, either.

SUPER AWESOME 31st BIRTHDAY GIFT FROM CAITY & BRIAN!!

I've wanted a super decent train game for awhile and Chicago Express is that game. More so, it is a stock manipulation game that uses its mechanics in a way that no other game does.  Spending your money into the wealth of the company and then using that money to grow the company is a really interesting part of this game.  The balance that has to be found between your personal cash and how much you invest in stocks (even at a loss just to stop others from making too much) keeps the brain churning. For all the thinking that you have to do, this turns go by relatively quick that the game is very easy to understand once it begins.  I do find it very hard to cooperate with other players (which is often necessary) while still trying to prevent them from getting a lead. Overall: simple mechanics with huge outcomes. A real neat game. UPDATE: I find that the game has sort of worn on me. It's difficult to determine the repercussions of your actions without doing some math each time to figure out how stock get diluted; how much it affects the other players in comparison to you; if there is enough money being put into the companies, etc. It kind of takes away from the neat ideas in this game and puts too much focus on the raw, calculative pieces of it. It's a fine game and has some real smarts, but not a game to pull out only every now and then. I think this game is best for those people who play it repeatedly, and those just aren't my types of games these days. I like games you can get into quick and figure out while playing. Stock games always have the ability to be misunderstood by casual players as it's hard to gauge how much stocks are actually worth to you in the end.  Some games I can stand this, others I can't.

I had quite a bit of fun playing this - twice in one day.  My rating and enthusiasim may be influenced by winning both times. : )

Nice game - more a valuation (quant) challange than a network-building game.  I liked it - I'm discovering an affection for games in that category... As the game progresses it seems a little to easy to calculate the "ideal" maximum bid (adn what others should be willing to pay).  I think I prefer a game like "Container" in this category where the "quant" is less precise and impossible to get perfect.

Still, a very well designed and tight game.  The elements work well together and it plays fast.

Raised rating from an 8 to a 9 after my 3rd play... this is really good.

It can't get more compact with this theme. Railroad- and stock-holding themed game that plays in about an hour. This is tense, this is brain-hurting and this is fun.

I was suprised how quick and yet both strategic and tactical the game is. Every turn and every move counts. The map could be a bit more variable but it still gives a lot of variability from game to game.

A great starting point to begin with when you consider to get acquainted with train games.

After five games, I still don't know what a good bid is, but I adore playing, even when I come in dead last.  The interaction between a railroad's coffers and its stock value is a tricky one to sort out.  There are no chance elements, but the human interaction makes each game different.

Functional, but this type of fixed game, is so very calculational and static. So much of the game is wrapped up in the initial auction, and the game is so unforgiving to new players, it's very hard to get into the game. With no hidden information, the experienced players can advise and criticize the newer players, which bugs me to no end. Not fun, but serviceable.

In curtc's comment he mentions Stephenson's Rocket. Wow, I haven't played SR in a long time, but that game blows this out of the water. There are so many more interesting things going on in Stephenson's Rocket than in this game. Chicago Express is more like squeezing water out of a rock.

I'm liking this better and better.  It's like powergrid, but better, and shorter.

The strategy is definitely here, but compared to other games, after your first win, you don't realise what made you win.  Those who know how to form a strategy in this game will end the game with three times as much money (=points) as newbies.  This, and the fact that there's no luck or hidden info in this game, are the two gripes I have with this game..

A game of shared interests.

There are four companies in the game and running one in your own is a quick way to lose. So you have to put yourself in a position where someone else pushes while you take the money.

The problem? It's hard to put yourself in such a position without giving money to that person!

So you try to trick everyone so no matter how they try to win, you win more.

First play Jan 2009 - Initial impressions are favourable.  Stock RR building game which plays in only 1 hour.  Much lighter than Age of Steam or 18xx.  As your success can be greatly altered by others players, saying there is "no luck" is rather stupid.  "No dice" is more accurate.  How well can you convince others to do your bidding?  Call it a cross between "TransAmerica" and "Age of Steam".

I think in order to play this you NEED to have all the numbers/dollar amounts, number of trains, number of shares known at all times.  The Ipad certainly makes this much easier.  Playing at the table though this would certainly sloow things down.  
I like this game. I like auction games and route planning; but for some reason I just don't see the fun in playing this one. Don't get me wrong it's extremely well done and very balanced. Guess I'm not one for games that are so heavily dependent on "playing the numbers".

This is a brilliant game design.  And it is accessible to the players I can game with FtF and these are just casual gamers.  Even my 12 year-old has grasped the concepts well after a few plays.  I see some complaints about replayability, but I can't see that as a problem.  I'll happily play this anytime.  

Raised rating to 10 after more plays.

A streamlined, miniaturized version of the Martin Wallace Prairie Rails series.  Not terribly impressed so far, and I can't see choosing to play Wabash Cannonball over the much meatier and more interesting Pampas Railroads.  I find the share dilution dynamic to be a little bit silly.

This game has some great stuff going for it as a family game. Buying and selling shares, building train routes and blocking others. Partnerships are also something that I like about this game. And for those of us who like to play with money(my kids), but frown on it because of games like Monopoly; this game uses it in an interesting way. 
A good next step from Ticket To Ride, without actually being anything like it; apart from building train routes, which aren't really yours anyway. It play in about 45 minutes with 4 players.

Interesting mechanics, but too (multi-player) random with 6 players. I's still not sure if this is a 6 or 7, as it needs to be played with fewer players. At least it was quick (55 minutes with 6 players). In any case I won't buy it, as it's really not my type of game.

I think this is going to be a near-miss for us. I like the stock/investment system and the basic play beats, but the endgame arrives too suddenly. Play is rather like a drag race whereas I'd prefer to run a couple laps on the track. More plays will tell the tale but I think Chicago Express will have a hard time getting to the table ahead of the four or five business and development games that we currently have in the rotation.

Frankly, I had higher expectations when playing this the first time. First because it is quite clear for every "owner" of a Train company where to build. So where is the challenge in this game? Is it really and only the stock holding (which would be not enough to keep it interesting for me).
Rating after one play and further plays can alter my rating. Add: After a second game I had to rise my rating up to 7.

Simple rules, pretty components and quick sessions! A good introduction to train games and the concept of shared ownership without getting bogged down in rules and stock market lingo. It's funny when players realize that buying stocks for cheap is probably not a good deal, because the trains will run on that budget! 
I really enjoy the way the dials focus and limit how many times you can do each action per turn. Plus, passing and moving a dial is a completely valid move.

RATING: 8
3 or 4 player (more if you have the narrow gauge expansion).

Alterations/House Rules: Poker chips; possibly large cubes instead of the paper shares; Erie expansion waits for more experienced play.

Touchstones: Game length variable; Temporary emergent alliainces; Initial auction guides prevailing alliances; Simple options per turn; Fractional incentive management; Tight auctions for very few shares; Asymmetrical; Wabash can break-out of mediocrity if played right; Blocking; Sabotage; 'Gotham gambit' if playing with three.

Broadest structure: Determined by players wanting the short game and those wanting the long game, combined with the particular railroad one buys in the initial auction. The first three auction actions are almost as important.

Sand timers: one-minute minimum, and an invitation to take longer when needed. This is not a game for the impulsive, and breaking the tempo is a good way to remove those 'building' their way to the finish line.

This game responds to temporary alliances.

A quick-paced stock holding game in the vein of classic train economic games. The game is unique in the way actions are chosen. Select to add trains, make spaces more valuable, or buy shares for a number of times then trigger a payout. It feels like you have more control over the well-being of a company you invested in here. I enjoy how the only money a company has to build trains is the money the players spend to purchase shares. This creates an interesting balance between keeping you money to win vs. investing in the company that may pay you more in the future. The game arc is determined by how much the players choose to spend on shares. Stock games can be a hard sell, but Chicago Express has great quality components and is exciting to play.

Played Chicago Express version.  Good components, decent enough derivative train game, but the game balance seems a little odd.  Tends to reward people who own the only share in a crappy railroad, since those tend to be worth more than most shares in a very good railroad.  The only really bad decision is to own 1 or 2 of 3 shares in a crap railroad.  This creates a pretty odd incentive for the players, as controlling your railroad well can sometimes be a mistake, as it causes others to put you up for auction, thus ruining your take...  Good stock games have a mechanism to make up for this, like letting the railroad pay its controller at a certain point, either at the end of the game or at some point in between.  Imperial has payouts for the taxation phase.  This game should have the cash remaining in a railroad pay out to the stock owners at the end of the game or something.  OK game.

Second play I liked it better and didn't seem to have the balance issue I complained about at first.  Part of this was experience, I knew when to get off that horse before everyone else tried to get on.  It still doesn't feel thematic to do that, but it doesn't hurt the gameplay and the theme is pretty strong otherwise.  Good game.

A delightfully devious train game that offers a lot of game in a very short play time.

RATING: 5.5
I played this once, and found it to be very deep and newbie-unfriendly.  The game only takes an hour, but it requires careful consideration of every move,  because one wrong play (even in the beginning) can make you lose and give the game to someone else.  Each play that you make can radically change the strategies of other players, for good or ill.  That does make it an interesting game if you know how to play and are willing to burn some brain cells in figuring out which action to take, or how much to bid on a particular stock, for example.

This looks like a train game, but it's basically a stock and dividend game, where you can make existing stockholders lose future earnings potential by capitalizing their company to dilute their stock holdings.  Knowing when to capitalize, when to expand track, and when to develop the cities on which existing track lies is the heart of the game.  For example, "If I capitalize this stock, and the player to my left wins it, he'll be in a great place to expand that companies track lines.  Do I want that?  Maybe yes, if I already own that stock -- we can work together to expand it."

Tricky, tricky game, one of the kind that JC likes.

I like Chicago Express reasonably well for what it is. It's a nice compromise between a heavy train game and something like Empire Builder or T2R. However, there are two major caveats. One, you really need to play with people who are of the same skill level for it to be optimal. Inexperienced players who make rash plays tend to unknowingly king make which can be maddeningly frustrating. Two, I find it to be a game that can be really hard to make up ground in. If you get behind, you're pretty much playing for third.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Chicago Express is a nasty, chaotic, but almost wholly transparent beast of an economic railroad game-- the game provides the game state quite readily, but due to its highly overlapping-player-driven structure, the game is chaotic (but not random!). As players collectively invest, divest, sink, or float railroad companies within a variable-length game, the elements of collusion, collision, and conflict are high: alliances shift, meld, and molt as the game progresses. The variable game timer also allows players to disrupt long-term strategies by cutting the game short and punishing short-term strategies by stretching the game out: depends on the current nature of collusive relations!

The entire exercise feels like trying to hold a river: it requires one to let go of the holding and stopping, and learn to divert the flow instead.

Note: This is another game that suffers from "fee air!" syndrome -- some may see this as an opportunity to fit in more train games!

RATING: 8
The rules are deceivingly simple, and it is probably the game in my collection where understanding the rules and playing well are two completely different things.

This game has layers of complexity in terms of optimization. The share auction is a very central aspect of the game, and the ability to correctly evaluate the share price is probably going to determine your success in this game.

I still have not played this enough, but I can see this game continue to fascinate me with simple rules and difficult decisions.

Very clever game. More of an investment game than a railway game.

This game deserves an outright 10 when played with a good gaming group but unfortunately the mechanics are also quite fragile and if one player makes a silly move it can throw a game.

Also it really only works with four and it's quite finely balanced here. The fact it only works well with 4 means it's difficult to actually give a 10.

With the wrong group of players it's 8/9 at best, still well worth playing though

Re-editted, had a fairly poor game of this despite playing it with a group of good boardgamers. It's still a good game and I remember games of this at uni which were fasinating but maybe the blocking/ruining of other companies, auctioning to devalue shares and importance of null auctions are all a bit obtuse strategically?

Either way I think if it is this difficult for other boardgamers to pick these tactics up and have a fierce and cut-throat game then maybe ut shouldn't score above 9

Someone had commented that Chicago Express is "18xx Uber-Lite", and they're right. I've played 1870 and several other 18xx games, and was always impressed with the mechanism where players buy stock in a railroad company, but they don't necessarily "own" or run the company. The other fascinating concept was that company money and the players' money were kept separate. The key was to figure out how to make that money that was in the company's coffers to pay out back to the player for the win. However, this was always tainted by the cumbersome upkeep, numerous convoluted rules, and exhausting play time of 4-6 hours. Chicago Express strips it down to the essentials: the stock ownership and separate money ideas are still there, but the track laying, and income generation are much, much more streamlined. There's even an innovative action-tracker mechanism, represented by three dials on the board, to trigger when dividend payouts are made. The more stock one has in the railroad, the more income they make. However, the railroad's major source of income is through issuing stock. If no one buys the stock, it is possible that the railroad will come to a screeching halt in terms of expansion, and hence income for the players. The flavor of small railroad companies emerging amongst the bigger companies in 1870 is preserved by the inclusion of the Wabash Railroad, whose entry is triggered late in the game by someone being first to building from the East Coast to Chicago. Will this fledgling company make an impact on the bottom line? No one knows for sure. The only weakness I see is in re-playability, as the board lends itself to stereotyped opening play. Otherwise, it is perfect when I have an 18xx itch to scratch, but not much time or brainpower/stress to spare. Initial rating '9'.

Update (07/14/09): Played this for the 2nd time. Rules were easier to pick up this time. Wow! 18xx-uber-lite in 60-75 minutes! Got creamed by the guy who had a monopoly on the Philadelphia RR, but did well with the B&O myself. Interesting strategies to figure out. Wabash actually came out much earlier and was pivotal in generating the cash that allowed that player to win. Still concerned about standard "opening" play, as this could get figured-out with a relatively few plays. 

Update (07/04/11) 4 plays: I am starting to get disappointed with this game, as it seems to end too quickly. It scratches the 18xx stock/train itch within a quick hour, but man, it is over just as the fun was beginning. After playing Baltimore & Ohio a number of times, which is thematically and mechanically very similar, I prefer B&O over this any day, due to its more substantial and meatier gameplay. I'm downing this to a '7'.

Update (01/14/12): After playing German Railways, I'd rather play that to get my stock auction fix that CE has, as CE ends too quickly for my tastes. GR has the novel action draw mechanic that makes for exciting gameplay, and is a bit longer for a more satisfying experience. I'm downing this to a '6'.

Update (07/07/12) 6 plays: We brought this out thinking knowing it would be a quick train-stock game that lasts about an hour. We quickly remember why we don't play this anymore, as we're not good at it. The game is so fragile and volatile, one mistake early on could break the game in someone's favor. Within the first turn or two, some of us could all see that the game was getting away from us, and squarely in control of the two richest players, and there was no way to rein them back in. Perhaps we need to play this more to "get it", but for now, there is bad taste in some people's mouths. Groupthink has already concluded that play will be relatively scripted.

This game crams a lot into the playtime despite combining both network building and share dealing.  I simply don't have enough time to explore 18xx - I'd much rather play this half a dozen times over the next year than 1830 just once more.  That is not a criticism of the (excellent) game of 1830; it's a reflection of my limited free time, and how my gaming habits react to this!

I've decided to replace this with American Rails for reasons mainly amounting to taste.  Both very similar games.

RATING: 8
A short railroad game that is more focused on shareholder manipulation than on actual railroad building. Encourages organic alliances and lively discussion because players own partial stock instead of a railroad company outright. The game has no luck and a noticeable 'butterfly effect' so it is not forgiving. However, even a full 6-player game can usually finish within an hour and there is plenty of meat throughout that hour.

Uhmm... he jugado varias partidas a este juego y me he convencido de que los jugadores deben empezar con la mitad del dinero que establecen las reglas. De lo contrario, la compañía roja adquiere ventaja sobre las demás y, por ende, sus accionistas. Con la mitad de dinero, la compañía roja no tiene asegurado llegar a Chicago por lo que debe obtener ingresos de su trayectoria o esperar a que los accionistas posean más capital. Esto introduce un equilibrio entre todas las compañías: las que ofertan más acciones se harán con más fondos a cambio de menor rentabilidad; las que subastan menos acciones darán mayor beneficio pero a cambio de mayor riesgo y de un desarrollo más lento.
Con la modificación comentada, el juego adquiere auténtico interés y es equilibrado. El jugador puede meterse en la piel de un inversor que busca, unas veces, lograr la mayor rentabilidad y, en otras, debilitar los ingresos de sus rivales.

RATING: 8
A no-luck share auction, track building and city development game where you share ownership of companies and try to drive the dividend value up to make more money than your opponents.

So far this has been "THE GAME" of 2009.  A train game with shares and no luck that plays in an hour or less, and so far has never played the same way twice.  There must be a big butterfly effect here.

RATING: 5
As a big 18xx fan, I really ought to like this minimalist shares and trains game, but it strangely leaves me unmoved, possibly beacause there's little subtlety involved. Auctions are easily won by the person with the most cash, 'trashing' (here it's treasury and track trashing rather than stock trashing) has no downside for minority shareholders. I just can't get into the manipulation of groupthink that so many Winsome games seem to be based on. The DTP production quality of the original Wabash Canonball version really was a disgrace in a product offered for sale, there are free downloads with better artwork.

This is a really neat stock game, the best one I've played. Railroad companies are really small--there are so few stocks it's hard to get in on the big ones and the values adjust accordingly--and on the whole I think I like the auctions for that reason.  The dials are genius and the game is nice and quick.  I like it and would love to play again. 

I know it's good with three and four, but cannot speak to other numbers of players. (3 plays)

Fairly strategic economic game.  Not really a pick up and deliver game, much more like Union Pacific (which I think is better than Chicago Express) where you try to dominate shares (but in CE, you want others to buy into the company to help build & drive expansion).  You can win by getting others to overspend on stock auctions so they lose money.

From the words of the publisher himself: "Don't worry yourself needlessly Sheamus, this game is not for you."  That seems to match the "You won't catch me dead playing this." rating of 1.

Actual rating though?  Much closer to 8.  I don't like how generic the mountains feel, and how they are more valuable than some of the smaller cities.  I also lament the lack of a true "pick-up-and-deliver".  These things don't take away from the fascinating share auctions.  A share is just so hard to accurately value in this game.  Also, it is always fun to play with trains.

Nice to play a game in which there is neither luck nor hidden information involved, the game doesn't give you many clues as to what the best course of action might be on your turn and this makes for difficult but interesting decisions.  The game has few rules and it plays fairly swiftly with little downtime.

I applaud the strictly player-decision basis of the gameplay, but it might not be to everyone's taste.

Great "train" game. After 7 plays I'm still looking for the right balance between bidding high to get shares and not being lured into buying expensive shares by the other players. As I have lost pretty much all of my CE sessions so far I think I still have a lot of things to learn, but I just never get bored of this game. 
It's also quite challenging to "think out of the box" and not focus on playing with "my" colour. Funny how some people seem to get very annoying when you buy a share of "their" company. :-)

The only flaw in this game is the players you play with. This is an intense experience in building some railroads and manipulating the market value of said railroads. An interesting game where player alliances and decisions really matter. The problem with this, like many auction games, is that when players don't recognize value or understand the ramifications of their decisions, then the game is skewed. I have played at least one game of this where I was just shaking my head in disbelief at other players decisions. This takes away a lot of the fun in the struggle of the game for me. Regardless however this is still an outstanding game.

I am not one hundred percent sold on this.  I enjoyed my play and will play again, but I am unclear on whether or not it needs a catch the leader mechanism.  If there was one, it sort of eluded me, other than the dillution of stock.  But even there, the top stocks were sold out, and no one seemed to hurt much.  That said, my first game was reasonably close.  I think a lot of the hubub may be coming from folks who did not play the cousins of this system like Pampas Railroads and Prarie Railroads.  They were quite similar in feel and gameplay.  Good games as well, but they DID have a catch the leader mechanism.  Of course, the spartan quality of the components really irks here.  Not only are the graphics asthetically primative, in this case the small board size impacts utility as well.  The rating could improve, but it might also sit here like a rock.  

UPDATE: Played the new Queen version.  It was as beautiful as it was functional.  The new graphics sped the game along.  As a result, I have added a full point to my rating.

Big disappointment.

This game is shallow, schematic, uninteresting.  There are set tracks into which the game falls every time...  There aren't many real decisions, choices (or rather there are micro-moves which have a meaning - I hate it) .
All in all - for me absolute failure in the field of 'quick stock railway game'.  Maybe such games are just not fit to be shortened or simplified...

I'm not a fan of economic/expansion games but this is one of the better ones.  The built in timer ensures each game is fast paced.  The auction rules remind me of a less offensive game of Monopoly.  Eventually one player will come out over everyone else by a country mile and you can call the game there.

I was really looking forward to this as some buds really like this one but it didnt fully "deliver" for me, punn intended of course... :) 

All in all it was good, fast moving, short game time, NO luck, yet something seemed missing for me. Maybe because we only had 3 at the table, maybe it was more subtle that it appeared but I thought overall it lacked depth if anything. 

More play might be needed but so far it just seemed like Acquire where you pick your poisons and run with them. A little more than that but I found some of the decisions uninteresting like developing and building. It really didn't matter a whole lot where you built because developing was virtually the same everywhere you went. There just wasn't much variance which I guess keeps the game tighter but I mean you develop for +1 income or +2, whoopdie do. You build here, or there, developments seem mostly the same everywhere and they are spread out so this makes the building less interesting. Now this is only after one game so maybe I have to eat some of those words we'll see, I'd like to really since I own the game. 

The ONE thing that really mattered though was the screwage, at least in our game. There is a way to get cut right off which I found surprising, so if you don't build fast enough and don't pass the potential "cut-off" that company is going to hell in a handbasket pretty quick. Also, Chicago is a MAJOR bonus, well it isn't hard at all to sabotage someone trying to get there since a company can barely make it as it is with maybe 3 tracks to spare, so anyone that owns only one share to someone's else two or three can just branch off a little and voila, screw job. 

So for me more play is needed to see if this all comes together, due to the auctions and the board I think this would be best with 4.

This is not Age of Steam.  This is not 18xx.  Anyone who tells you that they are similar needs to play more of all three.

Fun, tense, very difficult to calculate, zero luck (except for who starts), and short.  We played our first three games, plus rules explanations and post-session analysis in 3.5 hours.  Most plays are running about 45 minutes.

As we were going over the games afterwards one player asked another, "So do you like this game."  He answered, "Uh, we just spent 45 minutes arguing about optimal opening builds and stock prices.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure this game kicks ass."

This game is filled with agonizing choices, and I love it.

-- Update (13 plays) --
This game is still amazing, but Pampas Railroads has bumped this rating down a bit. I'll play either one at any time, but I have a slight preference for Pampas. One regular in my gaming group prefers Wabash over Pampas, but even he says that it's a razor thin margin.

Economic engine game that involves buying shares in train companies, and then building the train systems to cities throughout the eastern part of the country.

CE edition: Great looking, fast playing. Simple rules, but very deep gameplay. Focus on "playing the players" rather than "playing the system".

While the Queen edition looks like a eurogame, it doesn't really feel like one. Unlike most euros, in CE everything from pacing and timing to money levels in the game is based on the players' actions, rather than on a more fixed framework. The game provides the basic rules skeleton, but the players really, by their actions, determine how the game is going to develop. Think Modern Art with trains. :-)

A lot has been written about the temporary alliances, and they do seem to form the heart of the game.  Ultimately the deep interaction is what gives the game its replayability.  A lot of game in one hour.  

I'm six plays in now, and seem to be getting worse at the game with each passing play.  Moreover, the game is revealing itself as a sharply negative game at its decision points, by which I mean so many of its decisions are about destroying opportunities rather tahn creating them.  That's perfectly valid but not what I find fun about games.  I respect Chicago Express for its simplicity of rules and depth of gameplay, but I'm not sure I need to play it again.

RATING: 7
Torn in how to rate this right now. So, this is a place holder rating for me until I can get it played again.

It's a pretty good game and I put it on weight with Steel Driver (I may prefer Steel Driver more right now, but I'm not sure). Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express is pretty easy to learn, it's got lots of tough competition for shares and vicious bidding for the short share companies.

I don't feel the trainy aspects of the game really, but I most definitely feel the company aspect. 

So far, in my 3 games, the Red line has been huge. I have a lot of thoughts on the game, but I'll have to pen them later.

Very competitive, good economic game, but not much train feel for me. I like it a lot, don't love it, and I love being able to burn an action I think you were going to take.

I actually think both versions of this game are great. The Queen set is beautiful, the Winsome set is sparse, but damn portable and completely useful.

I think it's definitely worth playing and you should play it more than once to get a feel for it.

Do not get locked into a style of play and know that you can screw with players by taking null actions just to burn an action track. It's brutal, but very effective.

RATING: 8
A fine light-medium weight railroad game that scales well for two to six players.  Although I haven't yet, I think that it will play best with a full table.

A fairly simple game system, where players are allowed to take only one of three actions on a turn... and, especially later in the game, one action is never enough.  Because there are only three things to do, some games can feel a little repetative.

Because the game virtually forces players to ally through similar share purchases, there can never really be a "I'm playing for myself" feeling. (and, if players allow this to happen, they might as well toss in the towel... giving a player sole control over a company for the entire game is suicide)  Because of this, my rating is lower than it could be.  It's borderline co-operative play with lots of table talk, and I really don't like co-op games.  If you are a major player, help your allies; if not, screw the others at will.

After playing a few more times my rating has gone up, I recommend the game with 2 or 4 players only... when playing with 3, one person invariably gets an extra share at start and can easily halt purchase of at least one more giving him a distinct advantage; with more than 4 at least two players will start without a share which can be devastating in the early rounds.

One last thing... regardless of what the designer's intent (and it's not specified in the rules), play the game with hidden money.  It will add just the right amount of memory element to an already fine game and provide players with that 'extra' element of risk.

Very tight, well-designed game of great strategic and tactical depth. Involves auction, stocks (including dilution), resource development, and even a bit of board movement tactics (vaguely like Through the Desert or TtR). Winning demands temporary collusion with other players. The parts work together seamlessly: I admire its design.  As a casual gamer and/or a person of limited intellect I'm not sure my brain can calculate all the opportunity costs of the various options each turn. But I find myself still thinking about it, so score could easily go up as I play it more.

I'm blissfully enjoying Chicago Express (along with it's expansion) as a 2-3 player game.  I love the ebb and flow in this highly interactive game of railroad economic manipulation.

Much more of a stock game than a train game, which is a good thing in my eyes. Unfortunately, this also means it gets measured against [gameid=5], and CE comes up well short. 

The playing time is mercifully brief, I'll give it that. Our game seemed to put more weight on auctioning shares, so that turned out to be the trigger for the game end. I'm slightly curious about what opening bids for the initial red share tend to be, and what strategies are employed by those who win without getting to Chicago first and/or snagging the Wabash shares. But not curious enough to play again or do much reading on it.

This is a preliminary rating and I have a strong feeling I'll be bumping this up to a nine. It's sort of like a connection-building version of Imperial. There is a lot of subtlety here that will be explored for a while to come - players sharing a vested interest in companies together, and in different company combinations with other players, makes for a lot of options. The game play is wide open strategically and extremely tight mechanically. We had a real tough time understanding how to value the auctions. By the end, looking at those fat company coffers, we realized how grossly most of us had overpaid for things. I'm sure I'll have more to say about this one after more plays.

No silly diminishing returns on the score track like in Railroad Tycoon.  No pick-up-and-deliver either, which is the best part of RRT.  A lot of auctions, which seems necessary but is the one inelegant part of an otherwise elegant game.  After 3 games seems to have some danger of games being too similar to each other - unsure of lifespan.

Some ideas are cool, like putting money into the companies. A lot of math involved with dividing value amongst shares which I'm too lazy to do at the time of bidding...

A lean, mean, stock manipulation machine. You buy shares in railroad companies. These shares are auctioned, so getting a deal may undercapitalize the company and paying a premium may boost the company's long-term options. Any player with at least one share in a company can take an action on behalf of that company. Actions are simple: auction a share, lay track, or develop industry along the track. 

Alongside Imperial, Chicago Express easily takes the cake for "easy to play, yet somehow totally opaque." The whole game is about predicting and influencing what happens around the table between your turns. You can form temporary alliances with other players but it is a very tricky business. I enjoy this game, but several plays in I don't feel terribly good at it, and don't know what exactly I need to do to improve other than play more. Not a favorite, but fast and reliably interesting.

This game seemed very unforgiving. If you overbid in the first couple rounds, it seems you can end up behind without anyway to catch up. Multiple people can buy shares in the same railroad, so your partner may help you or ignore you. At least it is fairly fast moving.

This may rise with more plays.

This will be a purchase at some point - its a great game and one where you play the opponents more than the board therefore it won't get old fast.

However the bidding mechanics make the game slightly opaque for newcomers and its not a favourite mechanic of mine. Combined with the arrival of the i-app i can't see this becoming a favourite.

Not my favorite railroad game, I think it may lack a bit in the replayability arena, as the basic strategy seems to be "Make a bee line for Chicago."  I think if there were more shares out there for the railroads and more incentive to do things other than go to Chicago it would be a better game.

Very clean and clever game design. I think at its core, this is a speculation game. Because of the limited number of stock certificates available, the auctions are extremely important moments of the game. And in my book, there's nothing more replayable than an auction system. The mechanic of then playing the board, in response to your opponent's holdings, creates an uncertainty in future value. Brilliant player vs. player interaction.

I have to say, the improved artwork in the Queen Games version definitely enhances the feel of the game, making it seem more legitimate.  It's sad to admit that presentation makes such a difference, but it really does.

RATING: 6
An intriguing game which is taking me a little while to figure out.  Not being an expert in stock games, it is difficult for me to evaluate the relative value of each stock.  The biggest plus to Wabash Cannonball is the quick play time - it feels like a fully involved game without a large time commitment.  I hope to be able to play this one more so I can revise my rating and say something useful about the game.

Update: While there is a very vocal band of supporters, I just don't find myself wanting to play this game all that often.  Part of it has to do with the component quality, but part of it is just a general feel of ambivalence toward the game.

RATING: 6.5
This is one of the games genres that seem to be over-saturated in the boardgame market. Shares and trains combined.

The game is highly focused on the bidding aspect. Working out the correct value to bid is critical to winning. You can't monopolize a company, because you need other people to help you build, so you'll need shares in various companies that do well.

Its quick, but not my type of game. I've probably seen better implementations elsewhere in other games.

Economic, trains, transportation - no luck. If we had someone to teach us this game. Auction, network building and stock building. Would be a totally new venue for us. Relatively short playing time but still complex gameplay. It seems this game woould be a very good way to enter into the world of railroad games genre.

Update: We are just scratching the surface of the game, I am still puzzled as to what strategies would be the best to implement. Sure, controlling the game ending is very important, but I am still not sure of whether it is good to own a lot of shares or how many shares you need to collect a good amount of money.
I love how you compete and cooperate at the same time, and this mechanic still fascinates me that you do not own a company but you build up companies together.
I also like how the game mimics certain features of share holding, company development and receiving dividends.
is a puzzling game for many reasons. The auction part is crucial and a very intriguing element in the game, and we are not very experienced in this field yet. Today we had a four player game, and had quite a few aggressive action turns to get the shares we wanted. We will sure have to work on this element, and I am curious as to how we will do next time. The four player game is so much different and tense than the two player one.
It will take time to play CE reasonably well. There are a lot of subtleties in the game.

While luckless, there's still a lot of room to determine your fate beyond what actions you choose. Players will be both friend and foe on each turn depending on stock ownership, and even those who are allied with you might seem like they're helping but you'll need to be keeping an eye on what their true intentions are as there can only be one winner. A move that helps you both might also be helping them further down the line by blocking another of your investments or just eating up your investment potential to better serve them.

Fantastic!  I'd much rather play this strategy-dense, streamlined-rules, somewhat-opaque-at-first, 60-to-90-minute game of railroad 'n stock shares than the good (but long and fiddly) railroad game Railroad Tycoon, or the very good (but long and somewhat fiddly) stock shares game Imperial. 
 
'Chicago Express' is notable for handling 6 players very well; you have less control over your fate, but it moves along quickly, turns are short, and you always feel involved trying to reason with your opponents or bidding in stock auctions.

Update: OMG, how the  can anyone find this fun? Are you freaking kidding me?

If you're not practiced at the game, you'll discover that you lost the game in the initial auction, and the rest of the "game" is just confirmation of that.

If you are experienced at the game, how the heck can you possibly not just do the same thing every time you play it. It's not like there's any variety in potentially successful strategies.

The game is entirely decided by who got the best deal at auctions, so I really don't understand why there is a board or a theme.

I'm fascinated by this game: super simple rules and no luck, yet every action has dramatic ramifications. This is an financial beast which can be taught in five minutes and routinely finished in less than an hour. A teaching session will end in an hour and a half or so.

The game's depth makes it a bit unintuitive, and it's easy for newbies to give games away. But I'm perfectly OK with that: I love how the game uses other players as elements of chaos and uncertainty, instead of using dice rolls or card draws for the very same purpose.

Every action matters. Every dollar counts. Newbies will unintentionally give games away, but veterans will too. But that's because the game is deep. Because you don't truly grasp its depth with just a couple plays.

One of my most played games as it's fairly easy to learn and plays in about an hour. Great social interaction as all decisions are influenced by others, making it more tactical than strategic. Only complaint is that the game is often subject to kingmaking. But for a game that is usually < $20, it's an extremely good value.

RATING: 5
Not bad, but not that good either. 

Chicago Express suffers from the same thing most games with no luck, random elements or hidden information suffer: the later rounds of the game are not fun gaming, but boring arithmetic chore since decision trees are narrow and you can just calculate values of all your possible moves. Especially late "auctions" are silly, since the exact value of the share is easy to figure out.

Big plus for snappy playing time. There aren't many economic train games around that play in around an hour with six players.

Other than wargames, the finest thing in gaming is when, as the last action of the game, you auction a stock to dilute existing shares by $2 each, and you beat the holder of one of those shares by $1.

This game is just about perfect: simple, easy to teach (although the first game [i]definitely[/i] doesn't count), fast-moving, plays in about an hour, and the zero randomness means you're playing the other players, not the game.  There are quite a few people I won't play this with, though; if you're not ruthlessly playing to win, then you're the puppet of someone who [i]is;[/i] and usually that's not [i]me,[/i] which of course is enraging.

Played once, 6 players.  Much better than I expected, and MUCH faster than I expected.  I'm told it plays more slowly with fewer players, which makes sense.  But in our first game, players had maybe 4 turns each.  Very fun, though, and highly tactical.  This would be a perfect information game if money on hand is displayed.

Imperial style share buying meets Steam style track laying.  The whole is lightly reminiscent of Clippers and is like a hardcore version of Airlines.  Really a gamer's game with good potential for planning and viciousness.  The theme integration is ok and the mechanics are extremely solid.  A touch long but very good.

A light track-laying railroad game with auctions for limited company shares.  It reminds me a bit of a lighter Steel Driver or lighter Stephensons Rocket.  Plays very differently with 3 players versus 5 players (since game starts with four major railroad companies).  At several times during the game, you really have to bet wisely on which railroads will profit the most and the game varies on the # of dividend payouts (rounds).

Wish I could play this more often. This is a fascinating incentive laden game where playing nasty and not allowing many bonuses makes the game even more interesting. Passing is often a viable option - select an action and do not perform the action.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable stock game that plays quickly but takes a fair bit of thought.  Its one of those games you kinda have to play once to get a feel for how it works before really figuring out a plan or how things interact to some degree.  The game can end in a hurry so watch your stock purchases late in the game.  This game can look very different each game depending on how defensive you play.  The Erie expansion creates an interesting threat to gameplay that can change how people think from the base game as well!  This game is all about developing partnerships with people in which the other person does most of the work for you!

RATING: 7
When I first played 18xx, I wished someone would design a railroad game that included the ability to manage track laying with buying share in the various companies without the very long play time.  Chicago Express is the answer to that dilemma in some respects but the nature of the share always being subject to auction (rather than purchase) detracts somewhat from this game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tough, quick-playing, strategically opaque.  I've played six plays now and have had both crushing victories and last-place performances alike.  There's a lot going on under the hood of this little racecar.  Have shown it to hardcore 18xx-ers and casual gamers, with positive reactions from both camps. 

Playing with the Erie expansion adds another dimension of difficulty.  Recommended for 4 player games once your group has dusted 5 games.

I do wish the map was a little more interesting and provided more variability -- as Chicago is the only "hot point" on the map it draws the companies there magnetically.  Having another one or two of those on the board would ensure more variety game-to-game.

[b]Before playing it[/b]: at the moment I just can't stop staring at its components. Heck, what a beautiful train game. I know I'd be against the trend in the economic train game crowd, but I'd love to see more games like this.

[b]Update[/b]: I have just played it. Holy cow, I'm so glad I bought this. A quick but extremely clever train game.

[b]9/2016[/b]: Updated to a nine. This game is amazing. At the moment I still prefer Steam Barons in the "short economic train game" category, but this one plays in only one hour!

[b]2017[/b]: Ok, let's just stop being so picky and finally giving the rating this game deserves. Congratulations, Chicago Express, you just joined Tigris&Euphrates and Imperial in my Perfect 10 list.

Flows smoothly, thanks to quick turns.

Simple, easy-to-grasp rules: I launched the game without explaining the rules to Evan and Jane, and everything went very well.  Details were introduced when needed.

Requires some simple math, and some evaluations of the potential of companies.

I like the simple and effective market model: money goes to the company, which spends it itself in order to expand; revenues are shared among share holders,…

The game situation evolves mostly in a quantitative way: the income of the companies grow and grow.  In my first game, I did not see much blocking (in the mountains/forests) or many share exchanges.  This is very different from games like Agricola, Race for the Galaxy or 7 Wonders (more and more things become doable), or Space Hulk (the tactical situation evolves qualitatively with time).

Despite this, I like Chicago Express, for its streamlined rules, its smooth game flow, and its simple yet interesting market mechanics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Even though it may not, strictly speaking, be a eurogame, I think Chicago Express is exhibit A for the case that euro-style design is not yet exhausted, it merely needs to refocus a little. CE is a remarkably straightforward game (with the possible exception of the development tracks for the cities), yet there is a great depth of tactics and enough strategic variety to spawn a myriad of articles on BGG.

Aside from the pure aesthetics of its design, I believe that the use of geometry and the decision to allow players to act in the name of any company they hold stock in, not limiting them to companies they are majority shareholder in, elevate CE above many other euro stock games. The former (largely shared by any train game, admittedly) lets tactical and strategic elements reside in the geometry, which requires little or no explanation, rather than in rules. Game after game show how this is a great way to make a game very deep for its rules weight. The stock-action relationship, meanwhile, avoids the sort of downtime that can be annoying in games like Imperial, as well as the distasteful (albeit realistic) phenomenon of winning the game while doing almost nothing except choosing stocks wisely. In addition, it mitigates the ability of a majority shareholder in a strong company to run away with the game, making (possibly) implicit allegiances a necessity.

The final piece of the puzzle, though, is that Chicago Express packs all of this tension and rich decisions into a 60 minute game. Only Homesteaders, and possibly some of CE’s cousins, manage to match this feat, and it elevates Chicago Express into the top tier of modern strategy games. If it didn’t take so long to set up and tear down, Chicago Express would threaten to make some older strategic euros obsolete.

There are potential problems lurking in the weeds, though, depending on your taste in games. I’ve mentioned the set up and tear down time, the price that must be paid for ample amounts of nice bits. While the tension of having to see if play rolls out in the way you intend can be delicious, it can be frustrating to see players “screw” you by making plays that seem to throw the game to a third party. Likewise, the high degree of player interaction makes kingmaking a possibility. Chicago Express does not give up all of its secrets easily, either, and suffers from related problems. It can be tempting for new players, or as a result of situations that arise when playing with new players, to rush to a conclusion in order to cement a large opening lead. This cuts off the full narrative of the game (especially the founding of the titular Wabash rail company) and may leave a little bit of a bad taste.

Nevertheless, I do not hesitate to call Chicago Express one of the best new games of the last three years, and although there has been a lot of dross released in that time, there have also been a large number of very good and innovative games, so this is no mean feat.

RATING: 9
This game packs a lot of depth in a short game length and rather simple ruleset.  On his turn a player can pick one of only three actions, but more than most other games, it is very challenging to evaluate which of the three actions is the best play on any given turn.  For such a streamlined game, at times the play can feel chaotic, but that "chaos" is a result of the difficulty in determining the decisions of other players.  As a player, I often feel like things are spinning out of my control, but that is because I have misplayed the other players.

The genius of this game is that it presents players with many layers of analysis which make seemingly simple decisions - which action of the three do I take this turn - very complex.  The player who can best navigate through all of those layers will position himself in the most profitable railroads at the right times, and win.

Another train game that fails to differentiate itself from the hundreds of other 18xx ripoffs.  Not only is it the same game as most others the quality of the game is atrocious.  I think I would rather play 18FL or Railroad Tycoon as it has a bit better presentation. Yes components mean something to me.  (Based off of Windsome Version of Wabash Cannonball)

RATING: 7
I really like train games including the heavy 18XX games.  This is a light to medium train game with a stock component but it does not play like any other train game.  You are invented to gather shares and grow your company but if you are growing quickly, often another player will buy a share and "operate" it so that it does not make more money.  Many traditional 18XX and Steam players don't like this.  

I like the game, it is challenging and fun.  But you do have to know when to sabotage another player's railroad.

Rating based on one play with 3 players.  Brain burny and early mistakes are very costly, leaving you in a losing position with seemingly no way to catch up.  At least it is short enough to play, that I'd try it again and see if my opinion changes--especially with more players.

Playing this was fun, but I don't see this one having very long legs. The only real variance is how badly your opponent wants to run your rails off in odd directions.

Both plays of [i]Chicago Express[/i] were with five other players making the game too chaotic.  Would probably enjoy it more with fewer around the table.  That said, unless I want to play a quick "train" game, I'd rather play an 18xx game or even [i]Steam[/i].

A harsh and short economy game. Impressive design. One needs to be aware that the game moves on quite fast, which can be deceiving if you buy into the "18xx likeness".

are very much more enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game.  No luck, strategic game, highly interactive, cutthroat.  The first time you play it there is so much happening that it doesn't all sink in.  Basically a mathematics/economics game with a spatial component, an emotional element (auctions and fragile alliances), and simple rules.  It feels like a game that has a lot of depth.  Runaway leader problem, and difference of skill/experience problem.  Recommend doing a trial run first, stopping after two dividends, so that everyone gets a better sense of the mechanisms before it's too late -- one false start will cost the match given the no luck and runaway leader problem.  Game can be longer than advertised, easily 2 hours.  Only play with friends who will forgive you for playing competitively, the game does encourage many moves that will destroy another player's chances to win.

It is an auction game with some nice ideas (e.g. the three kinds of actions triggering the dividends), no luck involved (it feels very dry and mathematic) and a thankfully short playing time (that makes its repetitiveness and no-way-to-recover more acceptable).
The Development action seems seriously weaker than the others (which simplyfies the choices and thus removes some interest from the selection of the actions).
The whole game is in the auctions; the rest seems quite scripted and obvious.
In some configurations (e.g. 2 players) the game just does not work well.

Interesting tension between the different decisions available.  You have to watch your profit margins carefully.  Much like Modern Art, you don't need to buy a lot if everyone else is paying too much for what they get.  This is a very stripped down game without a lot of frills (in the production or the mechanics), but it challenging.

In my second game (5 players) I won the game after having only bought 2 shares, both in the first round (not the initial auction). 

You have to be very, very careful about how much you spend on shares.  Margins can be very, very tight.

Underagressive bidding can kill you.

Amazingly quick but deep railway investment game. There are initially 4 companies you can invest in. You can then build track and depots to increase their dividends paid.

Very interesting game, especially for 3-4 players when you can really plan what to buy and how much you should pay for the share.
When playing with more players game become quite chaotic. It's really hard to predict how will change the income of the companies.
I really like the speculative element of the game.

RATING: 6.5
Played once - Aug 3, 2009 with 5

Hmmm...something seemed off. Group think drove most companies in a mad dash to Chicago allowing red the most direct route and green picking up the rear. Most players were not diversified.  Felt like there was little desire to buy shares in the last third of the game which greatly limits what people can do on the dials.

Wabash came out so late in the game it felt silly to even pay attention to it.

Needs more plays but I've taken it off my wishlist.

RATING: 8
Plays 2-6. Train game. Auction. 

Very compelling play. My first play was a disaster, but fun - a bit dampened by constant rules look-ups and scattered explanations. 

That being said, the game is a gem. I really look forward to playing this many more times with 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 8
FUN: Very tense and exciting game with a streamlined ruleset.

UNIQUE: a train game that actually looks quite good.

NEGATIVES: The game is much more vicious than you would think and it’s very unforgiving for newcomers.

RATING: 7
Honestly not sure how the rate this one. I very much enjoyed the first two plays, but they both developed along the same lines. It's possible we were just suffering from groupthink since player decisions can really impact the length of the game. I'd like to see more interaction between the railroads, but in our two games they pretty much just all shot out in straight lines in a race for Chicago.

I'm usually not impressed with many train games. I think this is the 1st one that really interests me. However, I don't think it works with 6. It finally clicked for me and I can see how it is a completely different game than Steel Driver. Different problem to solve.

RATING: 1
Rated 1, because this is the original print of Chicago express. While a great game, this was unnecessarily split at the database, and the components are extremely bad when compared to Queen's Chicago Express components. I would not recommend getting this version, and simply getting the better produced Chicago Express.

RATING: 7
Easy to learn rules, but a surprising amount of depth in the game.  A late game share buy may be a good idea if it still has time to make a run to Detroit or especially Chicago.  The bonus dividend payoff when it hits the latter city can give you a substantial boost.  I made lots of mistakes in my first game and can't wait to see if I can fix them next time...

What a wonderful little game with a lot of depth and cruel economy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Fun game with the monopoly-feeling of moving money around. The tactics are mostly in rightly valuating the stocks on offer. The value is highly dependent on the players estimate of the further duration of the game. With four different ending conditions this creates a good tension.

Tight economic game at it's greatest.  The mechanism is like no other game.  I like the simplicity yet the complexity of this game.  And the time it takes to play....a wonder for such a tight game.  It has been detroned with American Rails for my prefered tight, short economic game though.

RATING: 8
I'm a big fan of Queen's production, and in this case I love the game too. 

It has a lot of meat for such a quick game, with lots to think about including tactical and strategic use of the dials to deny your opponent another move before dividend, keeping a balance between what you pay for a share and what the company funds will allow you to build, trying to minimise the benefits to other players of your actions. Oh, I love this one. I played it once at our game group and had to buy it. A few more plays before rating though.

RATING: 7
The ruthlessness of the game belies the "Train" theme, I was ready to dismiss this one as another pointless Train Euro, but as each player get to be real bastards to each other, it's got a lot going for it.

It's like a mini-stockmarket "share purchasing" game really. Companies issue shares to raise capital which in turn is used to build the railway. Getting shares cheap saves you money, but little capital is raised, so the company won't be able to expand, but neither do you want to pay too much (most money wins the game), but also, neither do you want to allow the stock to become too diluted.

Rating based on one play with 3 which I barely lost.  Very nice game.  The few actions available makes it very approachable and enjoyable for me.  I would be glad to play it more.  And it looks great, as I expect from Queen games.

RATING: 7
I really like this game, I'd love to play it more often.

Easy rules, fast gameplay, 'deep' game. That's the best way for getting gamer games like this actually on the table. The only reason I don't play this more often is because I own sibling American Rails which is even superior.

In a way this game in the same vein as Steel Driver. Despite having similar principles (players are shareholders, companies can extend thanks to the money the shareholders paid for their shares) it's quite different in gameplay.

RATING: 8
Auctions - you quickly realise that the rest of the games actions (of which there are two) are of vastly less importance than the three (or less) auctions that occur each round (of a maximum of eight).

This was the first game of its type (luckless game of incentives, player alliances and stock (or bonds)) that I got to play, and I found it to my liking. Maybe it is more interesting than it is "fun", but damn, it's very interesting and a real challenge.

You have to position yourself carefully - and force the other players to drag you along with them, ensuring that they have to "waste" their action on a non-auction because of the way the capital is distributed. Or you have to come swooping in at an opportune moment to trash that run to Chicago they were so close to completing. It is mean, nasty, full of Zugzwang (to use a chess term) that you can be locked into or use to your advantage, and all in all a great game (though as I said maybe not always a very fun game, the thin veneer of theme doesn't hide the math all that much but that's fine by me)!

My verdict: Slightly difficult to get to the table due to the demands on the players. A great "thinky" game that requires that people invest themselves lest they throw it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Only one game and I can tell it's one I will like. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the end. Hopefully others in my game group will be just as excited to play. 

Pros: Interesting game of emerging alliances, beautiful board and bits, relatively short play time, intense, asymmetric and varied games.

Cons: Can get mathy, can have a king-maker element to it, somebody won't like it in the group.

Three plays: 1 4-player, 1 3-player and 1 2-player. 4 and 3 player are definitely better, but the 2-player, in retrospect, was pretty good. It's a different game where it's not as easy to manipulate your opponents. The emerging, temporary alliance aspect of the game is much more difficult to gauge and companies with equal shares among players tend sit around and not move. 

Update after 18 plays (14 of which are 3-player with the same group): A sick, nasty game that is close to my heart. A hard fought victory in CE is better, IMO, than any out there ... it has that little something that a lot of games lack (reminiscent of Dune ... the victories are sweeter and the defeats pure hell).

Pretty decent game.  We had an extremely close score, with the winner winning by 1 dollar over second and third place.  A number of decisions, bidding interesting.  My one concern is how replayable it is: it seems there is a natural course for the four train lines, and I'm not sure how much variety there would be.  Still, enjoyed my play and would play again, but doesn't really thrill me.  I like American Rails much more.

Chicago Express is a real treat. The game has a lot more depth to it than you would think from the short play time and simple rules.

RATING: 8
Distills game trains to their bare essentials; a real, complete 'euro-ization' of all that's come before it. Great effort, very ambitious, and definitely succeeds. So why am I not giving this a 10? Basically, I'm not very much into the history of train games, and would have rather have a polymorphic board to increase replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fast-moving train game with a simple stock system but a lot of meaningful decisions.  Basically on your turn you can do one of a few things.  Put a stock up for auction (money goes to the company), add track for a company you own at least one stock in, develop land or a city.

Players working together should excel over others.  There is a lot of room for screwage: blocking competing lines, running a line you have a small investment in out to the pasture, etc.  It's quite tactical and requires some good simple math skills to compete.  It wouldn't be extremely exciting except that you can play it within 30-45 minutes and it has a ton of interaction.

Playing with 4 (UPDATE: without the expansion) is tough and someone could get the squeeze.  Playing with 5 or 6 would be ridiculous.

RATING: 9
Wow. What a game. Some thoughts, after 1 play:

My group tends to take longer than what's written on the box. From opening this game to teaching it to 4 others to packing everything away: 2 hours. This was unprecedented  in a meaty game.

Everyone liked it a lot. Sucked a new person into the group too, a videogamer who'll now give boardgames a chance!

If we'd had another 90 minutes, would have easily played again.

Game is not as good as Wealth of Nations. However, it's quick to setup and play, with little AP. WoN has a longgg setup and a longggg trade phase. With unlimited time: WoN. When in a crunch (like today), so far this game. Still have a few other economic games to try out, as well as possibly replay Age of Industry, which most of us really liked. But now that this game has been unleashed, the odds of getting AoI to the table have gotten even slimmer :(

Still, this game lives up to the hype. Excellent deep economic gameplay in at most 90 minutes.

Not a true stockholding game. Net worth not counted towards win (just money), buying (no selling) of stocks does not affect a company's value, and no majority shareholder. Taking these into account and thinking of it similar to Power Grid, it's an excellent game.

Initial rating of 8. I actually feel after one play that it's closer to a 9, but we'll see how its longevity holds out, so a more conservative rating.

*Feb 2013* Bumped up to a 9. This game is perfectly balanced and an excellent system. I really like it with 6p!

only one play.  initial impressions.  rating likely to creep into the high 8s, maybe 9, but will probably settle in the low 8s.

very elegant and compact design that packs a decent amount of meat on the bone.  it is good enough to deserve a 9 or 9.5 on this alone.  however, i am not sure how many 'plays' this actually has in it.  game works best when players are at least in the same ballpark of skill/experience as there can be some indirect kingmaking (not as big of an issue as with something like puerto rico).  i am docking my rating a little bit for that.  also docking the rating some for 'fun factor'.  while i can see the genius of the design, i felt the game was a bit lacking in overall 'fun'.  i find that i enjoy the 'deeper' games when i can savor the meal a bit longer.  while the 45min playtime certainly has its benefits, i guess i inevitably compare it to similar meaty economic games and my initial play felt a bit less fun.  i could be haircutting it a bit too much right now on this front and it definitely warrants at least 2 or 3 more plays.

RATING: 6.5
Jouable jusqu'à 6 (pas à 2, c'est pas top) où on ne contrôle pas une compagnie ferroviaire en particulier (un peu comme dans imperial où on ne contrôle pas un pays).

RATING: 7.5
we played with 6 players.  would like to try it with less players as I think with 6 the dividens get too watered down.  A player can only buy 2 shares at the start of the game and then just collect on those and win.  Also Wabash seemed to be kind of pointless.  Not sure if that was purely due to so many players.  In the two games we played it was simply a race to Chicago.  Very few stations got built.

after more plays my only real knock on this game is that it isn't a game that you can play over and over.  it seems like the same opening moves happen in almost every game, so from that stand point it tends to get predictable.  Still a fun game, but you need to leave lots of time between plays.

This game probably got a shorter shrift than any other in my rapidly growing list of previously owned titles, but it was simply a victim of the "too many games, too little time" syndrome of my collection.

Acquired from Barry at BestDangGames in exchange for submitting some reviews and photos. Good stuff.

Rated 8 after 1 play. We get the mechanics. The strategies and tactics look like they'll take many more plays to grasp.

I ordered the Erie Railroad expansion; also bought some little black trains I plan on painting brown. BROWN!

I don't get to play this as much as I'd like. I've found that I admire the game but I'm not very good at it.

Oh, it is good. It's short and sweet, and full of interesting decisions to make. It's complicated to understand, but that makes it just even more interesting. The graphics are bad, but if you use poker chips and print out the nicer stock certificates, it's not that bad. Sure, the board could be better, but you'll get used to it in about one game. Well worth experiencing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first play of this was tight and intense, and I am not even sure I understand quite yet the vast web of implications behind my actions and choices. Almost intoxicating brain burn as I tried to parse out that web, specifically in how the economic layer of the game, and the meta layer of the game (with the forming and disbanding of alliances) interacts. I thought there would be no negotiation, but in fact there was - and yet, not the kind I am normally used to. Normally negotiation is used to manipulate another player ultimately in a direction of harm, but because of the strange alliance structures that form, much of the negotiation that occurred in our game was cooperative negotiation - pointing out the possible consequences of mutually beneficial choices, or colluding to slow down or stop another player.

I will definitely need to play this a few more times before I really begin to grok it, but I think this may quickly become my favorite game.

-------------------------------------------------

After more plays it's official: This game nears only Diplomacy for me in terms of pleasure of play. It's strategically compelling, the conflict is a totally vicious knife fight, especially in the end game, it's got alliances and a strange strain of negotiation (though I suppose it could just as easily be played in total silence like a game of Pinochle, with players having to predict each others' moves and tactics), it keeps me guessing, it keeps me thinking, it is utterly unforgiving of mistakes, but an intelligent and careful player can even come back from behind. This game is a masterpiece. Simple rules, vastly complex strategy, somehow simultaneously intuitive and counter-intuitive tactics. Almost every single choice a player makes is concurrently helpful and harmful, both to himself and his opponents. This is the ultimate game for me - the game I've been looking for all these years - especially in that it is incredibly tight, plays quickly, and forces me to stop relying on my instincts and make carefully measured choices.

Bumped to 9.9 where I suspect it will stay.

-----------------

Update:

Ok, after several more games, I still really like this, but I am at a point where it's almost frustrating to play rather than enjoyable. There is a skill imbalance in my local playgroup - partly because some of us have played this more than others, and often it feels like if an experienced player ends up allied with one of those less skilled players, there is an insurmountable drag effect. I know that some of the gurus on here would argue that this is also poor play on my part - and perhaps so - with under 20 plays under my belt I am sure I still don't quite grasp some of the more nuanced strategic implications enough to "torque the incentive grid" continually to my advantage.

So what does all this mean? It means the game gets played less and the ratings suffer.

This hits the sweet spot for three people, and it has to be the right 3 (Capizzi and Josh in my case.) Otherwise, it's just not as fun.

A quick playing, share splitting, train game.  Brilliant fun.

This game is seeing lots of table time and is becoming a super investment itself.

Have played this numerous times now, mostly with newbies and most of them were not what we'd call gamers.  All players of this game have enjoyed the experience and many have requested immediate repeat plays; perhaps a symptom of the 60min game length.

I will play this game with (almost) anyone, anytime.

Great game we play it for the first time , 2 time in a row but only with 3 player , i really enjoyed i think it's lighter version of Poseidon, the game is aggressive, quick and euro game so i really like this one and of course there aare some train and rail roads on the boards, i also really like the biding system , classic but cool.
I can't wait to play more but at this time with more persons.

It's good that it goes quick, because it's pretty brutal if you get behind. Being the first game I've played with investments in companies that the companies then spend, I find the mechanic to be pretty interesting. It's simple to understand but can get complicated pretty quickly.

Bought because I accidentally bought the itty bitty cute expansion box first, thinking it was the full game.  I heard it was great, but my Monday night gaming group played Wabash Cannonball extensively right before I joined them so they are not interested in more of that at this time.   First time with my friends was a lopsided blowout with the red company dominating and the other companies left bloated with unspent investment money.  I suspect as we get more used to predicting when the game is going to end, this will even out.

This game is amazingly replayable.

Here's a very clever train game that offers a strategic challenge in just an hour. Although you build track and buy stock there is really little similarity to 18xx games. Subtle differences in early decisions become greatly magnified as the game progresses.  For example, getting a share one dollar cheaper than your opponent can quickly become a huge difference. Building partnerships and creating opposition through selecting the right shares to capitalize is at the heart of this game.

RATING: 6.5
Players are rail barons, seeking to invest in promising rail lines and expanding them. The map board shows four starting lines on the east coast: 1) New York Central (green), with 24 available trains and shares, 2) Pennsylvania Railroad Company (red) with 20 trains and 3 shares, 3) Baltimore and Ohio (blue) with 22 trains and 4 shares, 4) Chesapeake and Ohio (yellow) with 26 trains and 6 shares. Players start with $30, and a share in each company is auctioned off. Players then take turns with one of three choices: 1) expand a rail line by up to three trains, 2) develop a rail line to increase income and 3) put a share up for auction. 

When a railroad share is put up for auction, the minimum bid is the income of the railroad divided by the number of owned shares. E.g, at the start of the game, PRC has an income of 7, so the minimum bid on the first share is $7. Money from the auction is put into the railroads money supply, which is used to fund expansions. Expansions cost money per hex, generally $1 per open hex, $4 through mountains and $2 through forests. Expansions into certain hexes, like cities, boost the income of a railroad by one or two. There are some big cities on the map: Wheeling, Pittsburgh and Detriot. A rail line making it into one of these cities has a lucrative boost in income, depending on how developed the city is. For instance, Pittisburgh is worth four extra income, if someone develops Pittsburgh, the income is now worth 6, and a final development gives a total of 8 income. Finally, if rail line makes it into Chicago, the rail line income is boosted by 7, and there is a special dividend pay out.

Dividends occur during the game when two of the three action spaces are full. Each round there can only be a maximum of 5 expansions, 4 developments or 3 auctions. Once two of three possible actions are full, marked by steam gauges, a dividend occurs. Note that a player can choose an action that is available and choose not to execute that action. A railroad pays out the income divided by the number of shares, rounded up. After a dividend, all steam gauges are reset to zero and the development marker for Detriot is moved up by one.

Note when any rail line expands into Chicago, a dividend payout also occurs, but the steam gauges are not reset. After the first rail line makes it into Chicago, a new rail line becomes available: the Wabash line (black), with 2 shares and 11 trains.

The game ends when 1) shares of at least three railroads are all gone, 2) the development marker for Detriot reaches eight, 3) trains from three railroads are all gone, or 4) all development markers are gone.

This rail road stock market game is okay, and has simple mechanics. I dislike the fact where players can maniuplate the ending of the game by buying up shares, or taking an auction action and not do anything to deny someone. But I suppose if you get in the spirit of the game, it will be okay. I'm still trying to learn the nuances of this game, I have a big problem in overpaying for shares. On the plus side, it does play quickly. It is a decent game, but not quite my type of game. Sometimes perception plays a role, and players can deny the leader, putting someone else in the winner's seat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really interesting share-acquisition and railway game: lighter than the 18XXs and more focused on emergent player partnerships.

I'd love to play this a bit more and get to learn it better, there's a lot of depth for simple mechanics. An underrated game for sure.

A wonderful, quick, and focussed game.  The entire game is played at arms' length, with companies doing the legwork - necessary and yet ultimately irrelevant to your own score.  The trick appears to lie in tempting other players into weakening their own long-term positions, or else nudging them forward while making sure you see some sort of advantage each time.  I'm unreliably woeful at it, but after only a few plays I'm happy to accept I haven't worked it out yet.

An excellent economic game - meshes together the good feelings I get from playing Container and Imperial: hard economic decisions where the effects of your actions are at first hard to predict, it displays well the investor dilemma (as opposed to owner: your gain is not necessarily a loss for your opponents), you bankroll expansions by infusing capital through share emissions, you build alliances and you switch them when you think it'll maximize your gain. In so far this year (2009), the best game I have played.

Route-building/stock market games are a favorite of mine, and this is one that many people seem to think of first.  I don't think it works as well as some of the others because of the relatively small number of companies (four at first, and a small fifth one later on).  This makes it safe and logical to diversify your holdings as much as you want instead of dealing with the angst of more selective buying and focusing, especially since you only need one share of a company to build track with it.  For a very similar but better game, try American Rails by Tim Harrison.  That's the one to beat, and it deserves a wider audience.

Does this count as a train game? Chicago Express feels more like Ticket To Ride with a stockholding aspect. Its use of stocks is more like how they act in real life, dividing their value over the total number of shares in play.

I really enjoy this train game.  It is pretty simple in that you only have three choices of actions every round, but that somehow really opens up big possibilities in this stock-train game.  

I also love how drastically different it can change from game to game.  One game you might not reach the wabash, one game the person you got the wabash will win.

Interesting train game as it is simplish rules but played differently eat time played so replay should be good. Played with 4 and 5. Not owning a train but shares means you have to help or hope they help you both score points. It does not feel too train game but has all the elements.

Having never played 18xx but having read descriptions of the genre, I think this falls into a similar category. My personal preference is not toward path-building, so I have a natural bias against railroad games, and this is very much a member of that. My second complaint with it is that it seems like whoever is helped by 2 opponents will beat whomever is helped by only 1 opponent. Perhaps there is a level of engagement I've overlooked, where an opponent may be helped by one, sabotaged by another, but it does seem like whoever is happy to come in 2nd place will give the 1st place finisher a present. (Similar to the 100K strategy on Survivor that the jury goats employ) This is probably a valid dynamic, but it's not my type of thing. Imperial has a similar thing going, but its rule that only the controlling interest owner may act on the company's (in Imperial's case, country's) behalf makes it much more interesting and thematically consistent than Chicago Express's rule that any shareholder may do the same.

Quick playing route building auction stock game. I get the impression that there may be some optimal builds in there, and that there is an optimal auction price, but I'm sure with different groups this will change. It seems like it's best to get in on stock early. We played a heavy auction game, but I can imagine that players may want to push rounds to an end without putting out much stock. The games I played ended with stock being the deciding factor, I wonder how a game would be if this were different.

Easy to teach and learn, simple rules and the gameplay is also very accesible, a gateway game.

The game is quite fluid, but it might drag depending on the players (and the last turns, people can do some maths to maximize money). 

The design is very nice, and the components cool, except for the paper notes.

Much more tactic that strategic. But you don't have much control, especially with 5-6 players.

Overall, is a nice game, but as long as people play fast. Anyways, it's nothing special.

RATING: 8
A heck of a lot of fun and thinky-ness jammed into a short playtime. Like Container, it can be an interesting exercise in group psychology, unlike Container, it's possible to go back and 'fix' most things if you break them. My only beef with it is that it's almost too short-- early decisions can haunt you throughout the game, and there may not be time to recover.

This is a clever strategy game that plays quickly. The game is full of difficult decisions and the trick is to make others do to work for you while you collect the profits. In other words Wabash is a good and original train game. Furthermore, rules are simple and the game is easy to explain. The components are functional, not attractive. I really wish there was a bigger and better looking map available. Well, what do you know, now there is. Uppgraded to Chicago Express.

Ottimo gioco, siamo di fronte ad un ferroviario con fase azionaria interessante che riesce però al contempo ad essere semplice e veloce. Il gioco mi ricorda molto American Rail e ha appunto il vantaggio di essere immediato sia nella comprensione che nella possibilità di giocarlo. La fase azionaria ha un ruolo chiave per il successo finale ma anche lo sviluppo ferroviario richiede attenzione e una buona pianificazione. Poterlo giocare senza problemi in meno di due ore è un altro grande vantaggio.

This is NOT a copy of Ticket To Ride.
I was attracted to the concept that THERE IS NO LUCK in this game.  It is richly constructed with beautiful parts.
The game play is straightforward.
Although the rules seem to be simple and direct (ignoring a few typos) we needed to reference them frequently during the first few games.
Not as much fun with Two players. Quite competitive with more.
I *really* like the aspect of NO LUCK.  You control your destiny and must be strategic against your opponents.

One play, six player. I was not convinced by this, it seemed like there were a few decisions that really decided the game for everyone. It seemed to sit a bit uneasily, not simple enough to be a quick game, but not enough meaningful decisions to be a deep game.

A 3-player and a 4-player play so far.  I love the mind games as you try and gain an advantage despite being forced to share profits with other players.  A 5 or 6-player game should be fun too.  I have come in last both times so far--I think I have been over-bidding in attempts to keep monopolies on stocks.  It appears to be less important than I thought.  We're calling it Modern Art/Railroad Tycoon/Acquire.  Great game!

RATING: 10
Wonderful game. Simple, deep, fast, intense. Wow.

Chicago Express is a share holding train themed game. It's 90% auction, 10% route building - the game is won or lost in the auction phase. The goal is to have the most money [i]when the game ends[/i]. 

Problem is, game length depends heavily on the rate at which company shares are sold, and this is under complete control of the (collective) players. Each player has a 'posture' that favours either long game or a short game (based on current cash and rate of change of cash) - with more rounds come more dividends, so a low cash, high income player will have time to overtake a high cash, low income player, and vice versa.

Another key aspect is manipulating other players incentives. Each player can only help one company at a time, so if you can get the shares to fall out of the auction just right, the other players will be forced to help you as a side effect of helping themselves.

Nice components, zero luck, the depth of a 2hr + game packed into 1 hr. There's plenty of interaction, sabotage and blocking.

This is my favourite game since late 2009.

The thing that bugs me about this game is I can't work out the good plays. It seems that who wins the next auction tends to have an overwhelming effect on how the next part of the game develops (if it's a, the game goes this way, if it's b a completely different way) and it feels as if you're mostly just taken along for the ride. Put another way, a share that you buy is worth more if people don't buy any more of it, and less if more of it is put up for sale. But you don't know what people will do, so any valuation you make is a complete guess as to intentions. And that's not a process or a result that I enjoyed.

It took awhile for me to get into this initially, but the more I play it, the more I love it.

2/22/09 - 2nd play of the day with Claudio and Chris ended in a 3 way tie at 116.  Seriously good game. Bumping to an 8.

I normally do fairly decent in this game, but even when I play badly, I still really enjoy it. 

Good with gamers, and also as a gateway just beyond TTR. New people pick it up pretty quickly.

Overrated in BGG. Totally chaotic unless you have a group of experienced players. The game offers way too many options for the players to hand out the victory to one of the other players through a suboptimal play sequence (and other players have little control on what this opponent would do). I also dislike the initial auction, which feels almost scripted (pay what you need to pay or you lose the game instantly before it even started). No desire to play this game again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very original mechanic that results in you wanting to possibly bid more in order to get money into the company you will own, so that it can bring you more return later on in the form of dividends. You may have to work with others and not simply against them. The only problem is that once in a while a player gets ahead of the others and then it is very hard to catch them.

Combines the stock holding and expansionist drive of Imperial with the route planning and blocking of Through the Desert. It plays quickly. The pace is exciting as the railroads race toward Chicago. 

Often, players can't decide whether to collude, sabotage each other, or a little of both.  If the Wabash opens up, it throws a wrench into the endgame gearbox. No two games are much alike.  As players become experienced with its subtleties, play becomes more nasty.

Wabash Cannonball is supposed to be an open information game, but my girlfriend and some of my gamer friends strongly prefer hidden money.  I often play with hidden money to accommodate them and I don't think it breaks the game.  It is very good with three or four players.  The addition of the Erie makes it just as good with five.

I have a home made copy with my own made-from-scratch (photoshop) board:

RATING: 7
In this stock-based train game, you can either put shares of rail companies up for auction, or you can develop any company's rail system (not just ones where you are the majority owner).  The amount of available shares for each company was very limited, so players would take permanent majorities in companies very early.  The game seemed to be a pretty good system for what it wanted to do, but it was a little hard for new players to get a grasp on what stuff was worth.

Not sure why there are 2 separate entries for this & Chicago Express.  An absolutely brilliant, auction based stock game that plays quickly.  The core of most of Winsome's recent hits.  The components are spartan, which is why this one gets dinged to a 9, instead of the 10 its twin gets.

A simple, yet challenging game. Stock is limited and must be carefully auctioned off. Too little and the company has no money to do anything, too much and you have money wasted in the company. You have many ways to end the game and the game only plays in about an hour or less.

So far my only complaint about the game is that it's very unfriendly towards new people. Now this isn't really a complaint so much as a grievance I have with these games. I'd love to get this to the table more, but things tend to be a one and and type of thing. This game is not a welcome environment for that.

Wow, this is a nasty game! 

Players will help each other at times, only to try to stab each other in the back later. It's about setting yourself up in a way that will make others help you when they help themselves. It's also about not putting yourself in such a position that allows others to screw you without screwing themselves in the process. The rules are quite simple, but It's not a game for beginners at all!

One of the best in 2007. Rating can definitely go up.

This is my favorite perfect information, zero luck euro game. I am fascinated as we keep playing and try to learn the correct valuation ideology.

My son gets very frustrated once he realizes he can't win. I am continually striving to play a bad hand well - what is the most important thing I can do now. I once won a game holding nothing but 2 shares of red. I pumped that value with development in the mountains and preserved my capital.

This game is simply fascinating, and every game I have played clocked in under 70 minutes. Really well done.

I rate this game this high because I had so much prejudices after 18XX-games. This was actually fun to play and the lenght was good too.

I just have to repeat how positively surprised I was. After all, glad I tried.

If you saw the game for sale at the Dollar Store you might think it was overpriced by 50 cents.  Cheap plastic shellcase, xeroxed money with just a number on it -- no attempt at looking like money, dozens of little colored cubes, and a laminated paper board that's just 11" x 16".  I just tried playing my first game, solo, nd there may actually be some substance to the rules.  There'd better be for a game this cheaply made that cost $40 ($30 plus $10 shipping).

A quick and easy to teach stock-route building game that seems to get mixed reception when I teach it. 

I've also played the iphone version quite a bit and the static map/starting positions seem to reduce replayability. Some random setup elements beyond the initial stock auction would go a long way to fixing this. May be fixed by the expansion but I don't know. I feel the expansion costs too much for what you get in the box and the game doesn't get played anywhere near enough for me to justify its purchase.

Paris Connection, while not as deep plays much, much quicker and is far easier to teach so gets a lot more play.

RATING: 7
A very solid, somewhat derivative effort of a perfect information train game.  The chess-like appeal of it is affected a bit by timing of round-endings and player order, but those are mostly incidental to knowing how to play.  As such, it reminds me a lot of Puerto Rico: it feels like there are programmed plays for a lot of the game, especially since everyone knows how much money everyone has.  This is how perfect info games work, though - experience correlates strongly with victory.  Once I'm grounded a bit more in the system (as I am with PR), I'll probably be more interested in playing, but for now I'm only lukewarm on it and expect a few beatings from those who have the app on their iPhone.

very cool perfect information game which depends overwhelmingly on your success at auctions.  what's this? trains, auctions, stocks -- and all quite playable in an hour or so?  maybe a good intro to 18xx, but for me very promising on its own.

RATING: 7
This game is exactly what I had hoped it to be. It's quick while offering a depth of play that I really appreciate. The key to this game is really making or breaking alliances through share auctions while not getting hosed on the share prices. After a few games now I'm learning to manipulate game length which is opening up whole new levels of play.
[Update] Given the learning curve, it's hard to introduce people to this game. It usually takes a couple games to learn to avoid the basic blunders and that makes this one hard to get to the table.

Low re-playability 

Probably one of the best entry level train games, where players are managing buying/selling stocks. Nice enough components. My main worry is the replayability -- everything seems quite static from one game to the next, so I worry it'd just get very samey, especially with the same group of players. But still, if you like the idea of train games, with stock trading, this is probably a good place to start

This must be the game with the highest depth/rules I've ever played, if that makes any sense. Tiny actions with enormous consequences. An auction game where the questions of 'what to offer' and 'what would happen if I win the auction' are far more important than 'what's a good price'. Starting off easily, but soon sending your head spinning, Chicago Express is one of the very few games that actually gets harder, the more you play it and learn about it.

RATING: 5
I really don't have any knowledge of how the financial world works, but I like how the share system is implemented in this game: money from the shares auctioned goes into a fund which helps finance the building of the same coloured rail network. Building the network into cities and adding 'city developments' increases the value of the shares, which at various times in the game reward the shareholders some more income. I like the way this interesting environment has been implemented very smoothly and simply. Yet really the networks all start in one corner with the focus of heading for Chicago in the opposite corner, so no physical variety. The only changes are mentally mathematical whereas I rate high replayability on refreshing physical setups (Settlers, Africa) or changes in hand contents.

Here players invest in company's stocks, and then make decisions as to where a company you have invested in puts down train pieces. Each hex has a modifier and a cost, which comes out of the company money, and then the income level of that company rises. On a player's turn they can either put a stock up for bid, which they won't necessarily win for, or they can lay down trains, or they can build houses on the board improving the value of rail lines touching the house. The number of times per phase that each action can be taken is measured with a dial, and once two dials have hit the red, the companies pay out dividends to the stock holders, and then all actions are available again. The game ends when one of several conditions occur. It actually does take about an hour.

For a short game with simple rules, there's an awful lot to think about. Despite (very pleasant) appearances, it's not really a train game at all. It feels more like playing something like Modern Art - it's all about manipulating other players' incentives to your benefit. I think it will require experienced players to really work though, so I hope I can get my group to play it a few times.

UPDATE: after 10 games I'm still enjoying it but I'm just SO BAD at it. Amazingly brutal: you can be completely out of contention after one round, but it's quick enough for that to be OK.

UPDATE: traded away 2/11 because it just wasn't getting played. I still think it's a great game that would be really special if I could play it regularly with the same people, but it doesn't work with mixed levels of experience.

This was originally an 8 for me, however, we have been playing other games more.  The auctions, while interesting, aren't fun for the others in the family because they have a hard time valuing certain options and I fear it is a little too abstract for them to piece together a value.

Still, a gorgeous game.

I do feel like this is another game that could have really benefited from a player aid or summary card though as it was just a little difficult during the first round or so to remember what actions I could take and what they did. Still if you're looking for a quick but heavy economic train game this is a great choice. 

Update: After continued plays I'm moving this up to an 8. It's a weird game in that it's not that easy to analyze after playing to figure out what moves happened to lead to someone else winning. It seems relatively easy to make mistakes and hand victory to someone else, as all the decisions are difficult to see past. Figuring out what the other players are going to do and how that impacts the game has this wonderful butterfly like effect where every small move has huge ripple effects upon future turns and actions. A fascinating game to explore and figure out.

One I bring to every game night and would play once a week if it were ever possible. 

Share dilution is a wonky thing to try and wrap your brain around, but it means that the game is not simply another in the long (very long) line of "auction games that are about True Price Discovery and straight ROI." Rules-wise, the game is quite simple: auction and add the winning bid to the company treasury, build track and pay for it out of a company treasury, develop a hex, or claim an action and do not take it, thus denying it to others. But this game dispenses entirely with downtime. Because you know what happens when it's not your turn? Your allies change, and you need to make sure you always know who your friends are, and exactly when they are no longer your friend, and why. 

That it all plays out in around an hour is awesome. Eleven plays in and I feel like I've just started to scratch the surface of this one.

This game is a brilliant. It's to train games what Memoir '44 is to war games.

Players take turns putting train company stocks up for auction, building train tracks and developing the spaces on the board.  As the game progress the value of each train company increases.  The value of a stock is the value of the train company divided by the number of its stock currently in play.

Because of the shared ownership of the train companies every action a player takes will help and hurt all the other players.  Players have to exploit this web of interdependence in order to make more money than their opponents.  That such complex interaction can arise from so simple a rule set makes for an amazingly fun game.

This game gives the feel of an 18xx game with only the fraction of the time!

The implicit negotiation and cooperation in this game is hilarious. 

In my only play of this game of three players, we played rather quickly, so we didn't bother over-analyzing the game, until near the end of the game. I'm worried that this game will devolve into AP stasis as I think the value of a stock can be calculated.

The fun part about the auctions, though, is not only the pressure you need to put money into a treasury of a corporation, but also trying win stocks to dilute ownership of profitable corporations.

Rating based on 1 play so far so buyer beware! But the first impression was very favorable. My wife and I enjoyed a game of Chicago Express and she wanted to play again which is a good sign. Not a very complicated game as far as rules go, but it is a very deep game in game play. Recommended! 

Raised rating to 9 after play with three. This is a game of marginal returns--the importance of recognizing them! I lost my second game because I paid ONE dollar too little for the Wabash.

Not the type of game I'm particularly good at. I like more intuitive big picture games with more luck, but the game is well-designed, challenging, and a "brain-burner." I'm going to try and get better at it.

It's fast (30 minutes), full of complexities, has an amazing player range (3-6), is easy to learn and has an elegant art style and game design.

But all this masks... TREACHERY and SABOTAGE! Alliances are made, then SHATTERED.

After playing it more and more, I think I still really appreciate this game. Again, what needs to be emphasized is that it plays fast, it has relatively simple rules and the gameplay is really a mind-game at heart as it really is about manipulating opponents over any individual good play. This is due to the game state being extremely sensitive as one bad play by any player can has disastrous effects for the rest of the game.

I really respect this game and feel that not many games are like it. HOWEVER, it's a huge newbie trap. If you have 3 good gamers and 1 novice, that novice is going to determine the game. He might make one silly move such as allowing a share to go cheap to one player and that will often determine the game results right then and there.

The other aspects to look at is that the game usually ends on rounds 3 or 4. People usually just auction or build, so theoretically in a 4 round, 4 player game, you might only have 8 actions to do in a whole. If you mess up on one of your turns, you've screwed about 12.5% of your game, a huge amount.

So with that said, with the right players, this game CAN be a very good one. It can be very tense, neck-to-neck and more interesting than your stone-cold Euro. However, most of the time, at least for myself, I find the game to flop hard because I usually play with gamers that are not used to Chicago Express. They do silly things such as help a company as a minority and give someone else the win without seeing in the first place. The game can also be pretty mathy sometimes.

So the potential for being an excellent game is there, but most of the time, the game bombs because of the nature of the people you run into. Not recommended for very casual groups.

I wasn't impressed with Chicago Express as I thought I would be.  For one thing, I expected it to be more like Imperial than it was.  It's quite similar to Imperial in how it plays, but it's got a much shorter play time, so it's much harder to manipulate things so that one or two players don't have a clear advantage.  This gives Chicago Express a totally different feel, and one that I don't enjoy very much.  I can see that Chicago Express is a great game.  But I think it's too brutal for me to have very much fun playing it.

I would certainly play it again though because I didn't like Imperial very much on my first play and now it's one of my favorites.

What a game!  I suck at this game, but still have fun:).   Decisions are pretty quick (only three things to do per turn).  I have a lot of learning to do to figure out how to win this game!

UPDATE:  After a few more plays I am beginning to see how this one works.  Too often players become emotionally attached to their company, but the game is not about ownership or running a company.  Every action that a player can take is a tool to leverage their score.  It is a very finely tuned game and I highly recommend it. The only reason why it is not a perfect 10 is that playing with the wrong players can break the game.

This is an okay train/stock game.  Bohrer's magic touch made Age of Steam an awesome game.  Maybe Wallace needs to be consulted to enhance Wabash Cannonball.  With 4, there's not enough to keep this game consistently interesting and it plays out very similarly each time.  This game has potential, but it needs a lot more polish.  If you ever get the urge to play this and have Stephenson's Rocket available, play Stephenson's Rocket every time.

RATING: 5.5
A shorter version of Prarie or Pampas Railroads. Unfortunately I think it loses some of the key 'logic' of its ancestors, but is certainly made a bit more elegant by dumping the crayons. There are several issues: the biggest is that shares at the game start at undervalued - they sell for perhaps 20% of their worth. They can't sell for more because no-one has enough money, and if you pay too much, the other players can then buy more shares even cheaper. By game end the value is much lower and calculable, and shares should go for very close to 100% of their value. In the mid-game, share prices are highest (though the value is lower than at start) and the limited stock offerings only let them gradually approach the true value. This makes the game very sensitive to the starting conditions: spending one dollar too much may let someone else buy an extra share handing them the game. If you are left as the sole single share-holder in a company for a turn or two you'll make out like a bandit, but it is not something that you can force to happen. Minor blemishes are that the 'develop' action is under-powered except for use as a timing mechanism, and the building costs in mountains and forests could easily have been made fixed rather than randomly varying by a dollar.

I think players have too little starting money as the usual starting bids don't go high enough, since you can't bid a lot more (1 max in my opinion) than your starting money/2. It sucks.

I'm a sucker for railway games (don't ask me why) and this is one of my favourites.  Simple rules make for a fast, exciting game that is always closely contested ... at least in my gaming group.  Though similar in concept and design to Age of Steam, Chicago Express is, to me anyway, a lighter, friendlier game.  Highly recommended.

Excellent game with short playing time. The big downsides are:

-Not exactly beginner friendly(and it has auctions which makes 2x NOT beginner friendly)

-4-player game. You makes it less likely to hit the table.

-Train theme isn't the most interesting for everyone

-Huge advantage being the most experienced player.

-Constantly trying to guide the new players.

All and all the game fits only for a certain type of group.

RATING: 9.5
Wabash Cannonball / Chicago Express is a quick-playing, auction game of railroad expansion and shareholding. 

There is no luck and the game is about acting/reacting to what others are doing. Through clever manipulation of available actions and auctioning of shares, you can influence other players into working together to a common end, if only temporarily. While a major feature of the game is the auction, there are also many other things you can do to mess with other players' plans (try taking the B&O or even the PRR southwest to block the C&O - when done properly, it's a thing of beauty!). 

The game comes down to influencing when the game will end (if I can end it next turn, I will win, but one turn too early or too late and I don't have a chance). Sometimes the game will end after 4 dividends, sometimes more, and rarely the full 8. Sometimes railroads will make it to Chicago and Detroit; often no one does. If you believe the game always plays out the same and get stale, you don't understand the game and haven't played it enough.

The rules are simple and the depth is subtle at first. Give it a few plays - this is an amazing game!

Two immediate thoughts after playing for the first time:
1) What just happened?
2) May I have some more?

The dynamic of buying and selling shares is so, so interesting. Purchasing more shares of a company which you are already vested in is all well and good, but if someone buys into shares of a company you, too, own, it reduces your dividends. The truth is, this game is so fluid and player-driven that such situations are merely inevitable. Only the timing is unpredictable. As the game progresses, people have more money but less opportunities to buy more shares, and so it becomes a game of valuation and judging the worth of allying with others or tanking a company and jumping ship (train?). And so, it becomes a game of playing the players. It becomes a game JUST for me. I am a little abashed that I waited so long to play this game, as it has skyrockted to be an easy favorite. All this offered in the span of an hour or so, even at maximum players? Splendid!

(+) Very straightforward rules yet rife with subtleties in practice. Opaque as all get-out, and that's a good thing in my book.
(+) Heavy player interaction, formation and breaking of alliances, and shared incentives.
(+) Great component quality (not a primary selling point for me).

(-) Vicious gameplay - not for wimps. There are many opportunities to cut the knees of your once allied player. This is not a game for those who do not like their plans being spoiled.
(-) A 'gamers' game - thus not accessible, despite its quick gameplay. You need strong game sense to correctly assess the situation.
(-) The game's theme itself comes across as dry and "math-y", which can be off-putting to certain demographics, but muscling players around is the lifeblood of the game.

I cannot stop thinking about this game. It's invading my consciousness.

This is like Modern Art, Hardcore Thrash Death Metal edition. The complexity-to-rule-load ratio is really, really impressive. And the possibility space for interaction is pleasingly huge. It's a Lot of Stock Game in a pretty short space of time.

It's a bit clunky, and there are chunks of time where nothing's going on for you - it doesn't have, say, the Knizia ultra-smoothness and perpetual engagement - but the *depth* kind of hits me upside the head with pleasure...

Only rated this high because it played so quickly.  Perhaps a bit too pared-down for my tastes, but still decent.  Components are predictably bad Winsome fare, with no concession to either aesthetics or usability.  I was pleased that more than one strategy seemed viable in our 3-player game (I won by dominating the coalfields), but none of us could figure out any point at all to the Wabash.  Decisions at the end of the game were totally obvious, since it was trivial to calculate the value of the last couple of auctions.  Heh...I think I just talked myself into dropping my rating a half-point.

--Jul2008-- Hadn't intended to buy a copy, but a first play was quite compelling.  The game is short and delightfully subtle; I'll be very happy if I could play it regularly.

Over in the _Paris Connection_ page, I wrote "Wabash/CE is about making more money than the opponents. That's it. One can get there by constructive actions (making one's investments pay out more than those of one's colleagues) or by deconstructive actions (making one's opponents investments pay out less than one's own.) Either way works; either way is viable; either way is the way the game is 'supposed' to go."  I've not done better since.

RATING: 6
A train game with minimal stocks and a descent playing time.  The mechanics and flow of the game were quite fun, but I found the stock options to be a little ridiculous.  There are way to few and I found myself unable to get into any other companys as the game went on, so I became the game timer essentially.  My only goal was to reach Chicago first.  I also did not like that with so few stocks opening the Wabash line by reaching Chicago first will usually result in an end game as the Wabash shares disapear in 2 turns (so if two other stocks are gone..  which is likely)  the game ends with a stupid bid for the last Wabash stock.   With a couple more stocks (at least one) in each line, I think this game might not always turn into a race.

As for the look of the game...  it sucks.  Maybe more than any game I've played this year.  John Bohrer maintains he doesn't like to publish games, only develope them...  well...  he's not any good at developing art.  For a minimal amount he could have really added some usefullness to his game...  I mean this one is uglier than a crayon rail game.

The game is simple to teach, perfect information and very deep, which is right up my alley.

However, one play is not enough to determine my true rating of this. The strategy is more opaque than I thought it would be and it would take a number of plays to figure out how it all hums. I can sense this amazing game under the surface though if I decided to put the work into it.

I originally thought that with the simple ruleset, this could be a good "next step" game, but I'm not so sure now. This is the kind of game that gives only what you put into it. I could see this being a dull game for people not willing to put the effort into it.

Charles had played before and managed to buy the 2nd and 3rd red on the fisrt turn and ran away with the game. It was interesting game but seems hard to catch a good lead.

It is more of a stock game than a train game witch is very good.

I have play a bootleg Wabash Cannonball version.

Ho hum game. I'm never sure who we're supposed to be in these train games, influential investors I guess, as we can own stocks in various companies and convince them and ones we own no stock in to build track, open up other shares, and make improvements. Still, if I have to play a train game...

It does seem to capture the essence of many of these 18xx and Steam games with little effort and investment.

RATING: 7
Similar to Stephenson's Rocket, but a bit deeper. It's not really a stock game since share prices never go down, and you can't sell your shares. Feels very pre-programmed at times, as the constrained game space makes each turn calculable. I enjoyed playing, but I think it might be one of those games like Modern Art, where winning or losing is determined by whether the other players can count or not. The Queen production is very nice, as you would expect.

If Bohrer is indeed the designer, I must admit he's come up with a decent game here. He's not getting my money, tho'...

Haven't played it enough to get a feel for it.  We got half way through the first game and my wife quit.  She didn't see a strategy, got behind a little bit, and then felt she couldn't possible catch up.  She isn't normally a quitter so this says something.

I would still like to play it some more but will likely have to try to trade it away since my main game partner refuses to even try a second game.

RATING: 5
Decent light game with some easy decisions to be made. Calculations are basic and shouldn't slow down the play near the end of the game. Games should be close between players. Everything ties in quite nicely, but not sure how much replay ability I'll find in this.

I find that (a bit like in Modern Art), a player who plays in a strange way can really mess up logical moves and suck the enjoyment right out of this. You can be left in a position where you're just kingmaking as a passenger along for the ride. Be someone's bitch and help them win, or try and help no one by making sub optimal moves while trying to extract yourself away from a fellow shareholder. I don't like to be in this position, or to see another player in this position. It seems to be the nature of the mechanic where share owners can build as they please or put shares up for auction to directly mess with a specific player. It's actually very aggressive - far more than some games with direct military confrontation, even if it's masked fairly innocuously as a simple train building and share buying game.

Some games are quite good, while others are very bad. This inconsistency leads me to my rating. On any given playing my rating could go up or down a notch.

One final thought: I'm left wondering whether the game would play better if each player received $1,000 starting money. The low starting capital seems to me to spoil the game somewhat. Early in the game you're buying the shares cheap because there's just not much money there. Near the end the game degenerates into a lame mathematical exercise of share worth that can be reasonably accurately calculated. Basic arithmetic cannot really be considered as fun.

Train game in which players invest in some rail companies heading to Chicago and then develop them in order to achieve the most money.  My low rating at the moment is more about me than about the game quality, cause I feel a little lost in order to define a strategy or a way to approach the game properly.  Nevertheless, this may be solved after several plays and the rating may go up then.

Like a good story a good game generally has a narrative arc with tension slowly building towards an end-game climax/resolution. Chicago Express does this backwards. For me it felt like the game mostly got played over the first two to four turns when the decision space was still large enough to be interesting, but after that the outcome seemed pretty much predetermined and the whole thing played out on autopilot (for what felt like an agonizingly long time). 

The game is especially punishing for first-time players, since there is zero context for accurately valuing the early, and absolutely critical, auctions.

Ezzel a játékkal többet kell játszani. Érdekes a rendszere. Ha egy játékosnak többsége van egy részvényből és annak elég jó is az árfolyama, akkor érdeked egy új részvényt (már ha még van) piacra dobni, hogy a meglévők értéke csökkenjen, hiszen a részvények összértéke nem változik, csak több felé oszlik szét. Érdekek alakulnak és bomlanak szét ahogy a részvények szép lassan gazdára találnak. Talán az egyetlen negatívuma a játéknak a hirtelen vége ami most is volt, ezért kapta ezt a pontszámot, eredetileg magasabbra gondoltam.
Update1: Második játék után, növekedett a pontszáma. Nagyon izgalmas tud lenni.

Se explica en 5 minutos y se juega en 50. Tiene un motor económico muy conseguido y buenos componentes.

Your opponents' bids often reflect how many times they think it will pay out, and give you clues on what they plan to do with future actions.

I love the Queen production ethic.  I knew I would eventually pick this up despite owning the Winsome edition.  I like this game a lot.  I like the interplay that occurs when different people own the companies.  The fact that any owner can operate a company and not just the majority holder adds a level of competing interests that is not present in many train games.  The game playing in a short amount of time adds to its appeal.  [03/13/2011]

Wow. Played it five times (3 and 4 player). The amount of speculation and second-thought plus trying to work with groupthink really gives a special and completely captivating experience. It's been a while since I've played a game that is some much dependent on players, which is a blessing. It as much adrenaline and tension you can put in one hour game. Gnah! 
The game is easy to teach and good even for people who haven't played a lot of boardgames. Oh and the person who is most knowledgeable in economics or economic games tends to win.

Played the limited edition, Wabash Canonball.

The board is bad and small, so we played on a hand made larger version. It's all math, and I mathematically calculated that once behind, you're staying behind which made me rather grumpy. Others I played with weren't as convinced about this. Be careful.

[2 plays] Off the wishlist, although I won't mind playing it again. It is relatively fast, interesting in some off its mechanisms, and nicely produced. Another play might reveal to me if the weaknesses I perceive are really there - in terms of the relative values of stock, and the necessity that some players will get shut out of the action with no realistic chance to recover. I'll be revising this rating up or down, I'm sure, if I get the chance to play again.

Purchased Wabash Cannonball version on 01/04/08. Thanks JC!

No-luck shares game. Players bid for shares to different railroad companies to start the game. During the game, each turn consists of an action choice: expand a railroad, develop a hex or auction a share.

When two of three choices are maxed out, a dividend  on all companies is paid out. Rinse and repeat.

In order to do well at this game, you need to be able to crunch numbers and bid correctly for shares. Overpay and you will lose. The trick is to control the value of a railroad with someone else BUT have just that one share more than them.

Chicago express has nice bits but a dividends table would be useful.

This is less a "train game" with auctions than an "auction game" that happens to feature trains, but that's ok by me because I happen to love both types of games. As in all auction games, you need to be able to accurately appraise the value of stocks as they come up at auction. But there is a lot of uncertainty with multiple players, so this is easier said than done. With multiple stock owners, the game also develops into a sort of partnership game. Overall, very interesting and fast playing.

This is the best economic game that I own.  It's an awesome mechanic that the money from auctions finances the railroads, so there is no great benefit to winning an auction for the minimum bid.  Of course, having trains and the novelty of the Wabash Railroad starting in Fort Wayne sure don't hurt...

This is a wonderful 4 player train game. 4 players is the sweet spot and it is a tense game of stock purchasing and player manipulation. Easily a 9 in my book. I don't see this game getting old. 

With 6 players Chicago Express loses its charm. The game ends much too quickly and with some many players the auctions are much too chaotic. Additionally, it is impossible to play the game in a strategic manner simply due to so many players making moves in the game. Definitely not a good game with 6. 

I have not played with 5 yet.  

I like it with three as well and I need to go back and try again with 6. Hopefully with only one or two new players this time around. 

This game is a ten. The interaction, the tight play, and the great mechanics make this game my number 2 favorite.

This is a charming little stock game that benefits from being short.  I love the track building and appreciate the way the turns play out.  What I'm not a fan of though is the results of the extreme nature of the sparse stocks.  While it certainly isn't going to happen in every game, players can get closed out of worthwhile stock and have nothing to do put become a kingmaker until the end of the game as there is no way to actually improve your position.  With more players the higher the likelihood of this happening.  This is of course why the length works to its benefit.  If it were longer it would be unbearable.  

After a number of plays this is best (for my taste) with three.

UPDATE: If you play with four, force the game into a speed version.  It makes for more entertaining results as often a winner is already determined halfway through the game if you have the time to figure it out.

Perhaps Congo Line does the minimal stock game better...

I'm looking forward to to the expansion as it so perfectly fixes my issues with the 4 player game.  If a player is getting closed out they take Erie and play their own game.

Chicago Express is a great example of a great game where complexity comes from the deep gameplay and not from overly complex rules. The ruleset is very small, but the gameplay surely packs a punch; and on top of that it plays in about an hour! It's an auction game with a shareholders mechanic and a route building aspect as well.
Production values are great and the gameplay is a lot of fun, too.

[-]This game suffers from disappointing production values, even for a small-scale publisher.  However,[/-] The game itself is really interesting, as it has some fascinating economic elements in that auctioning off shares can dilute the value of the shares already owned by other players.  It also plays in a short length of time, so it offers excellent bang for the buck.

UPDATE: With the Queen printing of this game, the gorgeous components move this game up to a solid 9, as now it has the combination of great gameplay and sweet eye candy.

A great train game. CE does a very good job at packing the 18xx experience (Build track, buy shares, manage turn order, etc.) into a 2h game! Of course, some aspects are lost but if we only want to play for one afternoon, 18xx games are simply too long. Great production value as well!

RATING: 8
Maybe I entered the game in the wrong mood, maybe I simply played in a skewed game but it seemed obvious to me that my fate and those of my competitors was sealed in round 1. I disliked the open information, no bidding game should have such pure information available, knowing the value of every share and knowing the effect of all speculation seemed to remove much of the mystery. Unlike 18xx where speculation is just that, pure speculation, it didnt seem possible to recover from a bad start. Unlike Steel Driver it was almost impossible to improve your own position exclusively and thus if you were short of cash you would struggle to do anything but jostle for 3rd or 4th.
The static starting positions and need to progress west seemed to remove much of the variety that the aforementioned games provide. The inability to profit directly from your own builds made it impossible to catch up cash wise.
All in all it felt like a heavily watered down version of 18xx with all the excitement removed.

Chicago Express is a no-luck incentive manipulation game with difficult-to-predict butterfly effects. It's all about free riding on the efforts of others, setting up incentives to your advantage, and riding through the groupthink. But that's hard to do because the effects of actions are neither obvious nor immediate. There are strategic considerations but it is not easy to see them.  Victory (or defeat) results not from the singular but rather the composite results of every player's actions. Yet a loss can often be traced back, retrospectively, to a few key decisions.

All of this means that the game benefits from an experienced group. It's in the same genre as Imperial. What I like about Imperial I like about Chicago Express. Lower overhead and shorter playing time mean that I think I prefer Chicago Express. It's easily among the deepest, most strategic games you can play with a group in under an hour.

RATING: 7.5
Chicago Express/Wabash Cannonball was my gateway to the world of train games that don't begin with the word, "Ticket." It usually delivers a tight, tense game with experienced players, but it's relatively easy to teach new players too. Not hard to pick up, but a challenge to win. Zero randomness in this game, other than player seating order.

I really, really wish more information was on the board.  How many times did I have to answer the questions about the farm vs. mine vs. lumber mill, how many stocks were out there for each type, etc (which could have easily been on easy certificate).  This would have been a much smoother game without so many needed repeats of portions of the rules.  On the second play, I enjoyed the game much more as I was able to think more about the game and less about puzzling out what the board did.

RATING: 6.5
Cool game with horrible board! The game plays very quickly but with lots of decisions: which action to choose, which rail line to expand, how much to spend on auctions. For true fans of 18xx, this is NOT an 18xx game. But for me, it feels kind of like one to me: trains, companies, shares, your money vs. company money. There is, however, no moving of goods. Also, game play is very streamlined: the game plays quickly.

Good game! It depends heavily on correctly valuing the shares in the auctions, I think -- I wonder if it will hold up to repeated play (as people in a group come to some sort of consensus as to the value of the different companies)?

--- Summary ---
There are 5 companies, plus Wabash Cannonball. Each has a starting value shown on the board. One share of each company is auctioned off, then the game begins. In all auctions, the minimum bid equals the dividend value if dividends were to be issued after the share up for bid were sold, which is (company value) / (total outstanding shares), rounded up to the next integer. 

On your turn, you select and resolve an action. There are 3 types, which may be chosen x, y and z times per round (marker on board records choices as they are taken); the round ends when any 2 of these action types have been chosen the maximum number of times. The actions are: 
- capitalize (put a share up for auction, if one is available; $ comes from your personal money)
- build track (all start on east coast in start cities; pay applicable terrain cost; limits on # companies with track in certain hexes; $ comes from company money; as you build into cities and other hexes, company income improves -- move marker immediately)
- develop (put development marker on some hexes [e.g., build mines, develop one of the 3 industrial cities, etc.]; increases value of hex to companies with track there -- their income marker moves immediately). When a company connects to Chicago, dividends are paid immediately; also, Wabash Cannonball becomes available. 

When the round ends, all companies pay dividends. Reset action markers. Detroit's value increases by 1. The game ends if Detroit is at value 8, 3  companies have built all their track, 3  companies have sold all shares, or if all cash in game is used (I think). If not ended, repeat above.

The board is prettier than Winsome's version, but I find it a bit on the busy side! But it's almost exactly the same game.

RATING: N/A
This is a very good game. I have to play it more and more to see if I'll rate it higher, although I'm almost sure I will.

The components are lousy which is a shame! There's no good possible explanation to this amateur production!

Also I have to say that this is the last time I'm buying something from Winsome and that's because I prefer to wait a bit and actualy buy a decent production of the same game like in Queen's Chicago Express.

Wabash is a great game but I would rather want Chicago Express!

Played it again with 4 players. I can't play this game. I don't know how to. I suck at it. It's a shame because it's a good game. The thing I've realised now is taht it's a non tense game. Meaning that everyone knows what should happen in the end with no surprise at all. I like some surprising aspects on a game and I have to penalise this one because it has a dull ending.

RATING: N/A
I haven't rated this game for a long time mainly because even if I think it's a good game and with a very nice new mechanism, the production value is so low that I kept thinking in Wabash as a prototype. Only after Queen games grab the game and produced it properly that I was encouraged to rate it and finally give it the rate it seems to worth. 

Despite all of the good things this game brought - action selection mechanism, simplicity in railroad construction - it is too much programed with a too much cold ending, which I don't like. It should be played only by players with the same experience level, because one experienced player can ruin the whole experience.

This rate is for the game itself because the production value worths a 1!

CE is one of those weird concepts where you don't play your own train company but buy stock of several companies and then try to help those to score better. This concept is not without appeal to me but always fiddly to wrap my head around how to build a good strategy. But of course I like the trains and routes, those games always appeal to me. A good game to play with a higher number (we played with 5 players).

Great game. Simple rules, short play time but with good depth. Almost gateway like with its attractive components and limited action set. However, game play is rather opaque and thus may be tough for new players to figure out how to do well in the game. Furthermore, the fixed starting points of each company seems somewhat rigid and the whole new company starting out once Chicago is reached is rather fiddly and cumbersome.

Lost for words...my fave train themed game ,fast, lots to think about, brutal, unforgiving, nice to look at, multi-layered. 

Every game  i have  played has evolved differently. It's not a  building game which throws some new players, more about equity and valuing shares,diluting income and getting others to work for you by building income. 

Fantastic depth and interaction in such a short game.

The more train games I play, the more I like them.  This one is a blast as it plays quick but is quite fulfilling.  This is not a game for the light-hearted. Just when you think you have figured the game out, you lose.  After this, you will think you aren't doing well and win.  The game is odd when playing with first-timers as they often don't see the value of what a share is worth, nor the collaboration/backstabbing that is inherent in the game.  Edit 10/27:  Played with the Erie expansion for the first time.  I tried taking it to Chicago but it was a 5 player game and didn't get enough actions to get it there before I got blocked out.  I see all kinds of potential for the Erie though, and think it is a great addition to an outstanding game.

Chicago Express is an easy to pick up train game with stocks.   You start with a stock auction and each of four companies auction off one stock.  Then players take turns in clockwise order executing actions that range from building track(to extend the rail line) to developing (increasing the stock value of the railroad company), to auctioning off more stock.  

The game seemed rather tenuous.  You have to be on constant watch for how much money you have vs. how much money others have.  This is deathly important in order to stay on top of possible auctions that would dilute your stock or cause you to lose the majority.  I liked the tension but overall the game seemed rather light and short.

I kept the original Winsome game and sold the (I feel) overproduced Queen Games version.  Don't need the fanciness that takes up so much more shelf space!

Extremely tight economic game which plays fantastically amongst ultra-competitive gamers who understand the "player outside the game" mechanic--in other words the player is not part of the game, but rather outside it and manipulating everything without undue ties to any particular company.

Really the only thing keeping it from a 10 rating is the length.  I tend to favor 10s for games that I love but which neither overstay, nor, as in this case, understay their welcome.  An odd complaint perhaps but I'd like to see a slightly slower build to crescendo across a more sweeping playtime.  Which is why I'm looking forward to this years Essen package, as this system is being transplanted into more of a "gamers' game!" 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really fun and tense game that can be engaging if all players are of the same skill and understand the metagame. Just one bad move by an inexperience player can swing the game.

The barrier of entrance for this game (you need a learning game to understand how it plays) and the depth (which is pretty shallow) makes for a weird combination.

A game to bring out in your regular group once or twice a year.

RATING: 8.5
Brilliant game of incentive management, tacit cooperation, leeching and vicious sabotage. Working out the income is somewhat fiddly and the consistent board has the potential to feel stale, but anyone who plays once and declares there is a dominant strategy doesn't know what they're talking about -- there's a lot of depth here and room for subtle play.

Light economic train game based on stocks and companies.

+ Light - Even a family can play. Straightforward rules, simple actions.
+ Fast - Plays in less than an hour.
+ Interesting - Although simple it is nicely designed to make timing and decisions matter. Speculation of different aspects (cost/effectiveness of a share, time remaining before game end).
+ Interactive - Shifting alliances, action "burning", hate-bidding, path blocking etc. create a very interactive environment.

- Not good with 3 - Needs 4-5 players to show its potential.

Very nice train game for friends and family. I like it, although it have some built-in flaws: Game system forces you to follow paths from one edge of the board to the other and to reach Chicago as quickly as possible to raise value of your railroad company. Also, the red company is prone to overweight in final score, although that may not be the rule. Anyway, not so bad, plays quickly and I like the tension it builds over the game. I won't regret the time spend on.

This is a train game with very simple rules but a lot of complexity. I have a hard time finding games with enough depth to keep me interested that don't also take 3+ hours to play. :)

One note, I'm not sure if players' individual money supplies are open knowledge or not. Discuss it with your group before playing, because it can dramatically change the game (open money piles make the game easier to analyze, while hidden money means someone can quietly win the game in a landslide).

I think I really, really like this game.  If it had great components, it would be a 10 I feel.  As it is.  The components don't matter that much, because it's still an awesome game.  One I ordered as soon as I got home from playing it.This one might have some re-playability problems if you play with the same group all the time.  I don't know.  I've only played two games, Both with the same players, and they were totally different.  But as we start to figure out the different strategies, I wonder what would happen.I might take a queue from others, and build a more intuitive board.  That would make it easier to teach.

------------
Above were my original comments for Wabash Cannonball, which at one time was the same entry in the database as Chicago Express.  Because most of my initial plays were when they were the same game, the comments flowed into the Chicago Express entry.  Now, I've finally upgraded and got the Chicago Express game, it's a very very good game.  And the Queen components are top notch.

03 DEC 2010 - First time play (1-1/2 years ago) was quite challenging for me as I hadn't played a 'train game' yet. Loved it! Unfortunately haven't played since and really need to revisit this one. I suspect this is one of those games you need to play with the same people over and over again to really get something amazing out of it.

RATING: 8
This game is becoming one of my favorite games. I really enjoy how none of the plays have been all that similar. There is a huge amount of subtlety to this game and it really shines when everyone knows what is going on. It is fast and furious and terribly unforgiving. I often feel I've lost by the time the initial auctions is over - which hasn't always been true, but in this short game, I love how every decision feels game breaking.

RATING: 10
Self made.

Initially 8. After 2 plays with a friend 9. And now, after another play with 3 players, it's a 10.

This is incredible, how much emotions it gives in a first few minutes of play. My players were bored listening to the rules, but after several turns, their eyes magically gets sparkling wanting the revenge when they see the depth in these simple mechanics. 

It's simply just enough weight in thinking to get everyone excited.

Edit:
That's crazy. 2 more plays in a single session with 2 new players. Getting better every time.

My initial rating is an 8. I really enjoy the length to depth ratio of this game. The number of vectors you can use to manipulate both players and stock values is surprisingly high. I want to play more.

UPDATE: I just raised my rating to a 9. This will make my revised top ten list when I have the time to do a full re-assessment. In short, every game is a new experience where I learn something about both long and short term strategy. The short play time is packed with decisions and means that the game never overstays its welcome. Lovely.

Update II: I played last night with six players. Wow. That was different. You have less turns per round, which means less control. Add the fact that three players were brand new Chicago Express players, and the game was all over the place. I was dead last because my typical strategies simply didn't work. I'd like to try six again with experienced players.

Opinion after 1st play of the 3 player game.

On 1st glance it feels like it'd be a very dry game, but coming away from our 1st game we felt quite the opposite.
The pace of the game, fluidity of the auctions, and strategy of action choices, helped keep it interest throughout.

The complete absence of any luck is very interesting; it's solely the actions, and reactions, of players that determines their strategies.
So not unlike Chess, it's a puzzle game of near-impossible complexity; similarly it can be appreciated at the novice level just as easily as at higher levels.

Component quality seems good, though I wish the money was larger.
Bought for £21 on Amazon.co.uk; an absolute bargain I think.

Guess I was a tad disappointed in this, not so much because there's anything wrong with the game but because I had heard a lot of hype ahead of my first play. It's an OK game, but certainly not good enough to live up to the build-up following the many accolades it had received. Reminds me quite a bit of Union Pacific, which also is well liked and leaves me kinda flat. It's also pretty easy for one or more players to fall hopelessly out of the running. Ultimately, I wouldn't refuse to play this now and again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to do so.

2 excellent 4 player games.

Got Iphone app  - called Wabash Cannonball but it is this game exactly. 

Played a dozen times and loved it. Learned lots of strategies and seen the game get even better. 

Looking forward to playing again, win or lose.

With experienced players prob under an hour.

After 3 plays, this has the same feel to me as an 18XX or Imperial, neither of which I particularly care for.  It has the same disconnect between "what I'm doing now" and winning that those games have for me.

My rating reflects my lack of desire to play it, not the game's lack of quality.

Played once with 5 players. Not sure how much of a game there is here as strategy is very opaque. Trying to figure out what will help you the most is extremely difficult and, to be honest, not that interesting. Will try it once or twice more to see what it is that I'm not seeing.

RATING: 9
Chicago Express combines a stock market mechanic with family-friendly core rules to create an impressive rail jaunt. It also has the ability to be really, really nasty.  If the 18xx series is too complex for you, Chicago Express is a fantastic and potentially more fulfilling alternative that plays in one-third the time.

This game has stocks, which I really like, and I feel like it's a mechanic I haven't explored enough. It does a nice job of condensing more complicated train games. My only real complaint with this game is that I wish it had more...a couple more options and possibly few more turns.

RATING: 8
I just love this design. I love the way what you pay for the stock becomes the railroad's bank, the way that system forces you to issue stock much as a real company does, and the way you can buy into a company just to sabotage it. There's a lot of elegance here.

Downside: There's absolutely no catchup mechanic, and as with many auction-based game, it's really possible to screw yourself early.

Ranking of 8 for now, but might go up once I get my head around it a bit more.  I really, really like the depth-to-playtime ratio of this game.  Even if I'm out of the running, the game is over before I'm done thinking about how I got into that situation in the first place.

Edit:  I've since decided that while I still like CE, I prefer other similar games to this one, most notably Preussische Ostbahn.  My problem with CE is its fragility -- one less experienced player or one foolish play (either of which are as likely to be/come from me as anyone else) can somewhat derail the whole game for everyone.

RATING: 8
I was really impressed with this game one play through.  It really has things I really dig.  My favorite part is its possible to make a bad investment, so many games will let you buy in for the minimum and you can always expect growth, but that is clearly not the case in this game.  I also think the differences in the railroad companies based on their locales is really neat.  No simple fiddly rules to make the investments into the five companies interesting, have value, and worth.  The board is gorgeous in the Queen Edition, and the train meeples toot my horn.  Very interested in getting this to the table and soon.  This has top 10 potential for me. 

I have played with 3,4 and 5.  5 seems like it would be the "friendliest" playscale. 3 seems the most vicious, and 4 seems to play in between.  With new players, 4 players has the obvious trap in games like this which have new players investing and overinvesting in companies they hold stock in thinking it is "theirs."  It should only be a problem for a game or two, but I think if I need to introduce this in the future 5 would be the best introductory level(due to my tastes and my experiences)

I really enjoy the first round implications of the unbalanced availability of stocks, so 3 and 5 are my preferred player counts.

This game has generated a post-game strategy session talk after the game every single time I have played.  Those games are the keepers.

Three plays in, but the majority of my decisions are based around manipulating the other players into using actions to make me profit on their turn, while discouraging actions that do not make me a profit on their turn.  Trying to manipulate the table with game decisions, to increase the value of the equation stocksheld*trainactions + stocksheld*developactions - stocksheld*auctionactions = higher is better.

I am curious if predictable groupthink may lower my rating over time or if unpredictable groupthink will raise my rating over time.  Its pretty sweet 3 plays in, I know that much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kind of interesting, light and maybe a little lacking on the tension aspect but a solid little game none the less. I'm feeling like there wouldn't be a lot of replayability here. 

UPDATE on further thought of this game I find myself thinking that I don't want to play it again...ever. Even if the game works and is a viable game if there is no desire to play it on my part then the rating has to come down.

RATING: 8
Chicago Express (originally known as Wabash Cannonball when it was released by Winsome Games in 2007) is a game that I’ve been wanting to try for a while. It’s commonly referred to as providing the flavor of an 18xx train game in a short package. Games that are actually part of the 18xx series can take many, many hours to play, but I’ve been intrigued by those train games for some time now. Having the chance to get the flavor of one of those epic games without devoting the long time to learning the rules and playing the game sounded perfect to me. Thus, my expectations for Chicago Express were fairly high, especially since I’d been wanting to play it for over a year. Unlike many game, this one actually lived up perfectly to my expectations. It was short and sweet (roughly 60 minutes even for first-timers) and packed quite a punch! For such a quick game, it was remarkably dense, packing in more decisions per minute than just about any other game I’ve played. I wish the game was packed even half as densely into its game box since the box for Chicago Express is at least twice as big as it needs to be, and fitting it on the shelves of my tiny New York City apartment is going to be a challenge, but it’s a testament to how enjoyable the game was that I’m willing to try to make it fit. Simply deciding on each turn whether to develop a hex, expand a rail line, or auction a share in a train company, is a wonderfully tense decision, let alone deciding which hex to develop, or where to expand the rail line (and which rail line to expand), or how much to bid for a share (and which train company’s share to put up for auction). It’s definitely one of those clichéd rule sets that is easy to learn and hard to master.

Wabash Cannonball Winsome edition. I also own Chicago Express.  

This game is everything I want in a game and then some.  Every decision seems to matter subtly changing incentives. As my wife said, you don't play your game, you play others.

I am only a beginner with this game, but I am starting to see an even better game as we get more of a grasp. 

Played a 3 player game recently (7/09) in which I had to thread a needle as one opponent wanted a short game, another a long game, and I (as the game developed) needed to squeeze right between them.  Got them to play against each other and just like Goldilocks and the porridge: it was just right.

RATING: 6
Chicago Express is an older game. It's a train/route/stock market game. That already tells you most of what the game is about. There are a few twists that make this different from other games of the type. First there's three types of actions (start and auction, build track, and upgrade a hex) you can take on your turn and each action can only be taken so many times in a round (represented by moving the dial up on that gauge). When two gauges max out, a dividend round is triggered. One of the profitable moves in the game is getting a train company to Chicago. There's also an extra company that is brought into the game when someone reaches Chicago and that company doesn't have to start on the east coast, and thus can reach Chicago fairly easily.

These differences are interesting, but it doesn't really stand out much from the genre. I'd be as happy to play this as I would most games of this ilk.

About [thing=31730][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=31730][/thing] is an economic and strategic game with auctions and route building. But this really doens't say what [thing=31730][/thing] is. Consider this: 18xx was feeling a bit down - everything in its life was taking too long, and while he had some good and faithful friends, there are some places it simply couldn't go - and it wanted to connect to everything and everyone. Therefore, it, understandably, was devaluating itself in the local pub. 18xx met another game there that night and, in a vulnerable and needy mood, they had a torrid night of love.

Nine months later [thing=31730][/thing] was born. The game 18xx met that night? [thing=9209][/thing].

[thing=31730][/thing] took all the strategic value, the no luck factor in gameplay, and shares of companies and auctions, of the 18xx series. And got the broad appeal, the easiness to play and teach, with a fast playing time, of [thing=9209][/thing]. [thing=31730][/thing] is almost the perfect middle ground between these two games.

[thing=31730][/thing] is rich in options and allows for constant interaction between players, not only with the action themselves, but also by simply picking one, as they are limited in a given round. Timming and a good route are key to make a company prosper - good to attract more investment to keep growing, but also brings the interest of other tycoons.

Overall, [thing=31730][/thing] is a really simple game, with a very good depth coming of such a simple set of rules. I was taken aback seeing how clean the design is, how clear the options are, how few things can be done and so few in a round, and yet, all comes together nicely to produce a great experience, with several ways to proceed to victory.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
A play lasts a maximum of 8 rounds. In each round, the players take turns choosing one of three available actions:
- auctioning a share of one of the railroad companies (paying with personal money);
- expanding the rail system of one of the railroad companies (paying with the company's money);
- develop one of the boards hexes.

Of each of those actions only a limited number is available in each round. Expanding the rails and developing rise the value of the companies.

When two of the available actions reach their limits, a dividend phase is executed, where all players gain income from the railroad companies they have shares of. After this dividend phase, the number of actions is reset and a new round begins.

The game ends after 8 rounds or if one of the following conditions is met:
- 3 or more companies have no more locomotives;
- 3 or more companies have no more shares;
- The general supply contains only 3 houses or fewer.

The player with the most money will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main is: which of the three action to do? Picking from 3 isn't all that hard, right? Except that they are limited, and you might not be able to do even do more than two actions in a round. There is a constant need to prioritize.

All three actions have branching decisions. Start an auction? Of which share? Shares are limited and different companies have different amounts of them. The more they have, bigger will be the cake to share (they also have more trains to put on the board), but also the more eaters. Auctioning one share can be made to cut down the dividends of a company, as the total value of a company is divided by the numbers of shares, to see how much each will pay. Finally, how much to pay in a auction is also present, considering the possibilites of future dividends (for you or someone else) and also the amount of money the company needs/have to continue building their route.

Expand a route can only be done to companies the player have shares. And the place to put the trains, of course, matters a lot. They are the main way to rise the value of companies. It is hard (but possible) to block other companies from reaching certain spots. This isn't a blocking game. The goal is do the best possible, going to the best places first - as putting trains become increasingly costier as more companies already are present in a given spot. This tends to be the action used more often and can make or break your game.

Developing is the easier action to do. It direct as the other: simply advance the track of one of the main cities, or put a house on the board - both of these rise the value of a company passing by that place. It is an easier decision because there is usually no doubt the places you receive the most and given nothing to others.

Of course, the shares division between players and the state of the board (routes and developments) give different importance and timming issues for all these decisions during play.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very smart desing: clean, easy and to the point, while also providing depth and paths to victory;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- No luck;
- The art and graphic design are well done;
- Short playing time and providing constant and important decisions throughout;
- Language independant;
- Offers a good amount of player interaction, but isn't too much cutthroat;
- Can accommodate up to 6 players - best played with 4, but works well with 3 and 5 also.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Though the learning curve isn't steep, the absence of luck in the game do makes experienced players tougher to beat, and this can turn some new players down;
- It can be seen as too simplistic and be overlooked;
- Ends fast, maybe too fast to the taste of some players, that prefer a longer game to develop a strategy.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like tycooning is the easiest job around, the problem is the others that want a slice of your sweet pie - there is no problem in you wanting a piece of theirs, it is just fair. You just need to find the best way to make the money flowing in your way and cut others dry. But their money could be useful to keep a company afloat, still able to compete with the others, stretching to higher costs places and more valuable ones. There is a fine balance in all of this. [thing=31730][/thing] is like a walk through a maze: walking, running and jumping are pretty straightforward actions that you can do easily on their own. But, in spite the maze only requiring these three things for you to reach the center, getting there can be a big challenge. Specially with minotycoons going after you.

[thing=31730][/thing] was a big surprise, being so quick, clean and easy, but with a nice depth and lots of points of interaction. These is what designs once were and are harder to find nowadays, with so many mix-and-match in order to create something new, exciting, that calls for attention, even if only for a brief moment.

In the end, [thing=31730][/thing] is a very good step up from [thing=9209][/thing], entering into the path of shares, routes and economy in the train world. Very recommended.

I found this less opaque than German Railways (and probably Texas & Pacific also). While I thought having all the railroads start on the east side needing to head west was a dull idea, it does provide direction on what to do and how "well" each railroad is doing.

There's a lot of estimation and calculation necessary regarding how much longer the game will last, and what you're gaining or losing vs. another player depending on whether you win a share or they do. (Similar to German Railways.) I don't find that part of it very fun. But I do feel like I have a reasonable understanding of what a player should be trying to do, and it's rewarding to see whether I was right.

we've been enjoying this game a lot! it hits a sweet spot; simple and quick enough to play when we have an hour together; tied to the theme and flavorful, but not overwhelmingly detailed; Calculation helps, along with strategy and intrigue/collaboration -- but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be competitive. And it's always fun!

Decent game, but I suck at math games. Unlikely to play again. 

Anyone who can do the share arithmetic math hates playing with me because my presence "breaks" the game. 

This comment is not meant to imply its a bad game, which its not. The gameplay is tight and the game is well produced. My rating simply indicates the likelyhood of me suggesting this game.

n the game the B&O, C&O, Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads drive from the East Coast across the growing eastern US to Chicago. Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America's extensive railroads. The sharpest railroad executives vie for the maximum return on their investment in this business game lasting about one hour. This game can be played by 2-6 players, but it is best with 3 or 4 players. Ages 14 and up

Raised this from a 9 to a 10 today (2/20/14).  Five years after first playing it, the game remains one that I would play anytime with any number.  It is not a 10 with five or six, mind you, but with three or four, it has become my favorite game.  The vicious interaction between player, forced cooperation, and cold-hearted manipulation of the game mechanics make it a winner.

Wonderful train game.  So much has been said already.  I was giddy reading the rules for the first time.  So simple, so fast.  So much game in 90 minutes.  This is what all train games should strive to be.  All the tension of stocks and shared incentives boiled down to their essences. 

Chefs should cook with essences.  Find the flavors that are best and isolate them.  That is what this game does.

This got me into train games.  Now I must hunt for all the titles.  Trains trains trains. 

I've played this about 12 times now.  It's remarkable.  With only 3 actions to choose from.  Might be my favorite at the moment.

The perfect game for 3-4 players-- short, easy-to-teach, meaty. I am completely terrible at it and I love it. In my household, it's the default: can't agree on something to play, I'm grabbing Chicago Express.  Only time I won't default to CE is when we're playing with someone who doesn't like it-- it seems to attract people passionately or repulse them with equal fervor, for reasons I can't quite understand.

Good game that is suspenseful from the start, since the different end game conditions can make for a significant difference in the number of rounds that are played each game. And that makes it hard to determine how much you should pay for a share, how much you should invest in upgrading mountain areas or towns, how often you should extend a certain railroad, etc. And then there is the question whether you should get a share just to upset the majority owner and waste his trains on tiles that have no effect on the stock price. Because of all this, it is hard to determine a winning strategy, which makes the game incredibly replayable. Also love the relatively short playing time (especially for a train game), which makes it easy to play twice in a row.

Good investing game.  I completely screwed up the bidding in first go around in this game and ended up with majority ownership in a bankrupt railroad. :)

RATING: 7
First impression: 
Given the short playing time (only 90 minutes!) and simple actions available each turn (only 3!), Chicago Express still comes out as a highly interactive and challenging design that is optimum for 4 players. The theme is quite strong as players build a network of tracks from the Eastern sea board to Chicago. The game is one of few where players delicately balance cooperative game play while pushing individual interests as there is only one victor. To win, one must get other players to align their interests with your own and hope they can propel you to victory. Not many games I can think incorporate these features well.

The design for Chicago Express is well thought out and also exquisite in the sense that the spatial elements in the map feels balanced and  well tested. The forests and mountain range in the middle slows down track progression, forces players to compete for resources and also potentially blocks progression of specific tracks. The cities are well spread out with important industrial cities scattered in the right areas. For example, the rush to Detroit while not easy and away in one corner, is well worth the effort. The asymmetric map is clearly well-developed. The appearance of Wabash late in the game seems low impact seeing that it is not clear how could generate wealth in such a short period of time. Still, no one decided to jump on board the black line. 

If there is one area that deserves some criticism is that Queen Games, like all their other games, decide to package CE in such a horrendously large box. Given how limited space can get,  this is particularly galling as most of the game components can fit in a box half the size. The components while serviceable, are nothing to toot about. Paper money is ok even though most folks would balk at it. Because the game requires constant checks to find out how much money companies own, this game certainly would have benefited from poker chips.. I would imagine the wear and tear to be quite rapid.

Overall, the design is superb. The game play is stellar and the production values are below average.

RATING: 10
Fan-freakin'-tastic! Just the right mix of easy to learn, difficult to master, my prime example of just how good Winsome games can be. If I have one complaint, it's that my group's love of this game has made it harder to try other Winsome designs that I'm keen on exploring, but when the go-to game is this good, I'm not super sad about it!

If there's one complaint, it's that the game still remains largely opaque even this many plays in. While this is a feature rather than a bug (most of the game is figuring out how to play against the other players), it does mean that it takes a play or two for new players to wrap their heads around it.

Wow, game is so damn ugly and good. Its dynamic is interesting and hard to see in first game, how to play. Nine is bit too much after first game and rating depends heavily, how much variety it offers in long run. 
Edit: I guess eight is right rating. Game is good and there is much of variability, but it is too countable. Fast playing time is good.

EDIT: I have trained this for Europemasters. This is stupid game, because most of game is resolved in setup and first round, if everyone knows what to do. If don't then you just can look horrible faults everyone does and just win. I don't like this anymore. Rating 8-->6.

Stock speculation on train companies. As with Acquire, nobody owns the companies per se, they only control them through the shares they purchase. The game has a fairly simple set of rules - you basically have 3 options plus the possibility to null your action each turn and all of the information is open and there is no luck mechanism. Nevertheless, there is a rich array of tactical possibilities each turn - it's one of those games where repeated play will reveal the potential strategies. The stock dilution aspect creates temporary and ever-changing alliances resulting in players sharing the task of growing their favorite companies at the expense of others. The wooden components and game art are beautifully produced. The little dials to record the actions never fail to impress new players. Plays well at 3-4 players although I did attempt at 2 players a few times and it was nevertheless enjoyable. Seems like the Erie & Narrow Gauge expansion can help make both 2 and 5 player games a little more balanced.

My one play of this was extremely unpleasant.  Another player (who would quickly take the lead) capitalized the company I had stock in, which was already the weakest company.  The dividend then came out, and I fell behind in cash early.  By turn two of about 20, my choices became 1) auction another stock off, which I couldn't afford because the other players could outbid me, 2) expand my  company, which would help the leader exactly as much as it helped me, or 3) develop the cities on my company, which would again help the leader exactly as much as it helped me, and maybe help the others as well.  I was effectively shut out of the game before the second full round of play.  A really terrible experience.  I really hope that this is because there were five players, and that somebody has to get screwed with that number, because getting screwed out of the game through no fault of my own is a horrible design flaw.

Really fun game to play with the most amount of people possible (4-6). I don't think it would be too much fun with 3 or 2 people. You're basically buying stocks in companies and telling them where to build railroads. The person with the most money at the end of the game wins. Most people can pick up on the jist of the game pretty early on, so you'll get a lot of satisfaction out of just one playthrough.

Seems like a solid stock game. Relatively "pure" stock interaction/negotiation with a few different goals possible for the companies/railroads. 

The highlight for me was the limited action pool and the dynamic that created with having to predict upcoming player's turns to see what's most beneficial for you. 

Downsides for me were the amount of math required to figure out incomes. It's a double-edged sword since that obfuscates winners and losers. It could be fairly AP prone because of this though. (Plus I'm just bad at math... yes even simple halving and addition)

Since stock games aren't my particular cup of tea, I don't think I'll ever love the game, but it's solid enough that I'd play it as a "token" stocks game occasionally.

Intriguing game- one of those games that squeezes such amazing depth out of relatively simple mechanics.

Wow.  Just ... WOW.  What a tight economical game.  There is a lot to weigh and manage during the game, and given the perfect information of it all, there's a good chance that it will take you a game to understand the ways that everything relates.  But since the game only lasts about an hour, so what?  Play it once to get a feel for it, and then play it again immediately afterward.  About halfway through our first game, I saw what I SHOULD have been doing, and saw how we couldn't catch up to the person in the lead.  By the second game, I thought I was out of the running when someone pointed out that I could dilute someone else's stock, and then I realized that I had a different option that took me to the win.  That third game was an out-and-out beat down, though....  So far, it's a unique experience.

That's my rating for Wabash Cannonball, the exact same game as this one.  I knocked this printing down a point because the artwork is far busier than it needs to be, and it makes it much harder for me to be able to read the board.

With 5 (and, I assume, 6), the stock distribution on the first turn, as well as the smaller distribution of money among the players, turns the game into something different, and less interesting.

Harry Wu's Chicago Express is an innovative new boardgame with no luck factor. Chicago Express was originally released in a limited format by Winsome Games as Wabash Cannonball and it was the first game in Winsome's Historic Railroads System.
\13\\13\
In the game the B&O, C&O, Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads drive from the East Coast across the growing eastern US to Chicago. Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America's extensive railroads. The sharpest railroad executives vie for the maximum return on their investment in this business game lasting about one hour. This game can be played by 2-6 players, but it is best with 3 or 4 players. Ages 14 and up

Fast-paced stock market game.  Very pure,  lots of subtlety.  The Queen version has nice production,  but still is far from perfect - I think I prefer the tiles in Princes of Machu Pichu to the share certifications (makes the # of shares bought/left more obvious).  Iconography on the hexes is a little meh.

I think I'd prefer more viability in some of the options - the $2 tree cutting feels very weak as is development,  playing a distinct second fiddle to capitilise and track building.

Had downgraded interest due to price-point - initially looked like a medium small purchase,  but became a big purchase.

The queen edition looks pretty,  and a 1 hour killer gamer's train game?  Sounds tasty...caveat - another auction game - I thought I was going to cut down...Then again,  I must remember that I've never really hit it off with a shareholding game.

Shifting alliances aspect sounds neat.

Many notes here that this is really a 3-4 player game,  rather than 2-6 (at least without Erie)

I like the game pieces and I especially like the action options, the mechanics of the game are good, I just don't get the strategy. I'm not particularly successful with economic games, nor do I excel at stock or auction games so really, there is nothing in this game that overtly attracts me or appeals to me but that being said, I just don't like this sort of game, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.

Solid game.  I think I would enjoy a train game that was a little longer, or one where I could somehow get back into it if I were behind.  It is not long enough to maneuver your way back into it if you make an early mistake.  I don't think there is a mechanic that helps you out this way either.  If all were skilled and had played the game a lot, I think this would be a very enjoyable game.

Has beautifully obscure strategy. It gives me a similar feeling to go in this way: There are no secrets or luck, but yet it is very hard in your early games to identify which were your good and bad moves. Your moves do influence the game a lot, and drive you into one or another strategy, but sometimes you end up ahead or behind and just scratch your head, wondering how that happened. I love games like this, where figuring out how to play well is doable but difficult.

First 3p game was so good I bought it immediately.  
Very excited to play 4/5p.

Simple mechanics leads to immense depth.  If replay holds up (which I expect it will), could easily be a top 10 game for me.

Standing by for more plays until rating is set.

Better than I expected. I have played the Wabash Cannonball app so I was somewhat familiar but expected it to be fiddly due to the different costs/dividends/math. It played pretty well but there are a few things you need to learn to be observant of. Room to grow but didn't really wow me.

Got to play this for the first time yesterday and liked it a lot! A railway development stock game which you can play in about an hour? Sign me up!! I am forming the opinion that depth is far more important than breadth when it comes to games and their rules

Having played several more times - I like this even more now. Still enjoying exploring the depth here with different player counts also plays quite differently. And the short play time - given the depth - is a real achievement

I have a poor memory of this stock game. I remember both enjoying it but not being impressed by it. I'd like to play again.

This is a no-luck perfect information commodity speculation game. It's just the kind of game i like. I'm still not impressed, but am very interested in playing more, as I don't seem to have any idea how to play it well.

This game feels so different, in essence is simple to play and teach, but has some hidden depth once you play it more.

Excellent game, its a stock manipulation game with a train  theme, I recommend to play 2 sessions in a row better with 4 or 5 players.

Need to play it more to see if there is a dominant strategy, last 2 plays were totally different outcomes.

Others on the waitlist similar to this one: American Rails and German Railways.

8 after 1 play

The auctioning of shares and payment of dividends mechanics work well together to create an intriguing game. Thematically, however, the payment of dividends from the bank does not make sense, but is required for the game mechanic to work. Player interaction is high, driven by the auction and competition for spaces on the board to build train routes. 

Artwork and game components are poor. The choice of colour and hue for the train companies make it a little difficult to tell them apart. The use of paper money also affects the game experience, especially the repeated checking of how much money each train company still has for laying tracks.

Raiting after one play with two players. It will probably go up as soon as I'll play with more than two players. Many micro-decisions to make during game as well lots of counting as it is easy to overbid.

With such a reputation, I didn’t expect this game to be so bad. Everyone owns the same stocks and the winner is decided by who sacrify himself on who. Then again, maybe we played wrong and it gets better after 5 or 6 plays...

A surprisingly deep and opaque economic game you can play in about an hour... I have no idea how this flew under my radar so long.  Buy stocks in companies and use that investment to grow the companies and increase their dividends.  Finding the most competitive companies and getting the best shares in them seems to be key... but there is a lot going on that make the game space very intriguing to explore.  I'm looking forward to more plays soon.

Ok, the game is truly ugly, literally.  This is my first exposure to a Winsome product (besides AoS, if that counts), so it may not be a surprise to others, but I was a bit taken back by the quality of the components.  It won't win any presentation awards that is for sure.

So how does it play?  All of those high ratings certainly raised my expectation by quite a lot.  True to John's words Wabash Cannonball is completely devoid of luck, there isn't a single random factor to be found, except for the actions your opponents will take.  Even though I'm not a big fan of luck based mechanics, but I do have to admit their inclusion, whether through card or cube drawing, does make each play somewhat different from each other, thereby contributing to the replayability of a game, as well as the need to modify your strategy.  So I'm not entirely sure how Wabash Cannonball will stand up to repeated plays.  The four competing corporations that you begin with in the game start their operation at the same end of the board (the eastern coast), pretty much right next to each other, and I imagine every time it is a race to see who can build out to the west faster.  Although I'd be interested in seeing if anyone will ever take a different approach by extending the tracks in a north-south direction, but somehow I am dubious that it will happen very often since it doesn't seem very profitable.

There were also a couple of gameplay issues that we encountered.  First, when the Wabash Cannonball Corporation finally operated the game was dangerously close to ending (2 of the existing companies already sold out of their stocks), so we did not really understand why would anyone want to invest in it if there's a high possibility that Wabash may not pay off (in our case we decided not to be mean to the person that bought the first share by ending the game right afterwards, so he did actually profited from the purchase eventually).  Also, I myself felt like I was behind the entire game.  I started out with less shares than everyone else, owning no majority in any one corporation, so I have to devise ways to make them spend their money (which would have the effect of giving them more certificates and thus more income) in order to have a chance to outbid them later, but even that was difficult because my earning power is so much less.  Surprisingly I came in second in the end, but I don't know if that was purely coincidental, or to attribute it to the brilliance of the game design, which may have avoided the pitfall of the rich getting richer.

With that said.  I enjoyed the game and would definitely want to play again soon.  I'm just not quite certain if Wabash Cannonball is the real deal like others claimed it to be, or it is merely a fluke.  Only time will tell.

Update #1: An adjustment of 0.5 rating downward after playing Pampas.  While Wabash is definitely harder and has more meat to it, I found myself having more fun with the former.

The only thing I'm concerned about right now is replayability.  Otherwise, I think Wabash Cannonball is an excellent system, rife with strategy and "butterfly effects".  Hopefully Winsome will capitalize on the system and ask the designer to make more (and nicer!) maps for us to play with.  Update: I like this even better upon second playing.  I want to play it again, and soon!

After 3 plays this game seems fine. It's all about auction, and with the right group it shines (but which game isn't?:).
The game is fairly straight forward, which makes it easy to every player to calculate the value of a share, and base her/his bid on these figures.

Got it quite cheap (-70%, 2000 HUF). I did not thought much of this game, but after reading some reviews and the rule book, it seems interesting. I'm looking forward to play it.

Upgraded to a 10. This game is awesome. This just ain't my type of game, and I still like it a lot because what's happening in the game is so intriguing.

Players buy shares in railroad companies as they stretch out from the east coast to the west coast, and it's all a question of self-balancing prices, calculating your stake and see to that you get a little of everything. You need others' help to get the company to grow, yet you still want the majority of the shares, right?

После первой игры.

Косвенное влияние на игровых оппонентов, когда ты не напрямую управляешь игровым конкурентом, а через купленные акции этого персонажа (в нашем случае - компании) - тренд 2006-2007 годов, когда вышел Imperial. Игра приятная, но ничего особенного. Поезда тут довольно абстрактны, это могли бы быть электростанции, водонапорные башни или компьютерная сеть распространения вирусов.

This is similar to steel driver , but I prefer Steel Driver to this. This game can swing a lot depending on how much you pay in the very first round, and if you just keep putting shares up for sale and buying as many as you can - you can win without building much track.

Checking out the BGG entry makes me think it's complete, but there's no way to verify it.

RATING: 3
Fun for a couple of games but very repetitive
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very unique mechanism even after more than 20 years. All you need to play are two small books. Requires skill and good spacial thinking abilities. Very portable, you can play it in a car on a road trip or standing in line for the movies. However this particular version does require a table if you want to go all out since you need the plane cards and markers to keep track of everything. The standard Aces of Aces version just come with two books.

Much preferred the original. I'm not sure why. For some reason, I found the original black and white line drawings much more appealing than the black and white photos in the deluxe.

RATING: N/A
I had this game for a while but never played it.  I liked the concept of the books and such, but the game just never clicked for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game that preceded the "single shooter" PC games.  Only problem is that although the procedure for finding the next page was supposed to obscure which page where the manoeuvre you had chosen would take you, there is actually a way to cheat; which I will not reveal as it ruins the fun for those yet to discover it!

The improvement in this release is that the ability of the plane and pilot preclude you from being a "superpilot" in a "superplane" that can choose to do any manoeuvre; instead you have a limited number of options.

RATING: 4
Comment: Very old, original game, nice concept, but I don't like it!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This was an interesting concept when it first came out, a book each to represent your aircraft. The only problem was the one on one restriction (although you could play multi with more books) and the process of choosing maneuvers becomes a bit tiresome after a while. Good game for a car journey.

Used to own this game. I always liked plane games in the arcade and this was the "bookgame" equivalent. I remember really liking this one, and wish that I had held onto it when I went away to college.

Somehow I can never seem to get much fun out of this.  I guess the strategies just seem predictable.  Dozens of plays over the years, and all but one before I started logging on BGG.

My copy is complete, and the books and airplane stats cards are in near-mint condition.  The box corners show some wear from years on the shelf, and there is minor bowing of the box lid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just played recently.  It's still a cool game.  We played only the basic, no altitude version.  Before BGG, we played with altitude, specific planes, and a campaign game.  Played a ton.  The closest we got to an Ace was three kills.

Have the Rotary, Flying Machines, Balloon Buster, and Powerhouse books. This game was a great boon to me in my Sophmore year of high school in Study Hall and other boring classes. Enjoyed the intermediate level - the Advanced would be better handled by a computer game. Was a good accompaniement on international flights. Great bring-along game.

Combate aéreo na primeira guerra mundial. Usa um sistema de combate/movimento por livros, sem tabuleiro. Aviões com motores rotativos. Muito bom.

RATING: 8
A much maligned classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This Deluxe boxed edition of the original planes set included some additional rules and possibilities. Still the same brilliant core game mechanic, but there were better options then if you wanted something with more depth, and there are definitely many more better options now. Stick to the basic game though, and Ace of Aces is still a fun filler!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The ultimate evolutionary step of the Ace of Aces WWI air combat game.  Fixes some of the historical errors of the original Handy Rotary Series, adds two new German planes in order to give the early war Allied rotary planes something to fight and cleans up the game mechanics of the intermediate and advanced games while adding some more "chrome" in order to further differentiate the abilities of the various planes represented in the game.

However, the some of the rearward looking photographs in the German book are incorrectly set up and some of the atmosphere created by the hand-drawn illustrations of the first Handy Rotary set is lost when translated to photos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This small gem is hard to find but it's such an addicting game!  Two books - each other calling out page numbers - what could be easier?  A lot of fun!

RATING: 7.8
This is my favorite version of all of the Aces of Aces games that I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Simple and fast.  Great filler game.  A simple multiplayer would make it more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very cool system of picking an option based on the picture you see in your book.  Almost like a competitive choose-your-own adventure where your results are dictated by your vs. your opponent's choices.

So, you see a plane just to your front right in your book, flying along side of you.  The other player in this instance doesn't see anything on his page since you're to his rear left.  You both make decisions accordingly, and flip to pages of your books based on your decisions.  Cool stuff!

Overall, it's a novel idea that's fun to mess around with when you don't feel like setting up a game and want to waste a little time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent quick to play with no dice using the basic rules or a bit more realism and book keeping with the advanced rules.  The choice is yours
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good fun on just the basic game.  Sure, there's not much to it, but what a nifty idea.  It's fun to turn the page and see if you've got a hail of gunfire.  Want to try standard.  So portable, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I remember liking this game a lot.  The mechanics were pretty clever, choosing your maneuver and turning to the page to see your next point of view.  I would pick this up instantly if I saw it for sale at a reasonable price.

Believe it or not, I don't think this is as good as the non-deluxe edition. This game adds unnecessary complexity that the original neither had nor needed. The photographs don't seem to work as nicely as the drawings of the original game either.

I have always been in awe of those who design this type of games. Realistic? Hmmm, who cares.  Great fun.

Very innovative design in it's time, still the best of the "flipping book" games. In some versions this game actually gets quite involved, but if players want to play a longish campaign while playing basically the same air battle again and again remains to be seen...

A true classic. If you are into WWI Dogfight games you owe it to yourself to have played this. Needs to be reprinted, maybe with computer-generated artwork?

Paper flip book flight sim before there were computer flight sims!  Really cool except that I don't like to fiddle with the altitude rules which get boring and mathy.  Otherwise a blast from the past and very fun.  Visual snapshots of the action and everything else is filled in by your imagination.

RATING: 7.75
The world war 1 Aces of Aces was an excellent game. It may be the best WWI combat game before the advent of Wings of War and its more complicated miniature brethren. The best feature of the game was the cockpit view. The weakest feature was the inability of the game to reasonably handle a large number of opponents. This weakness is what kept it from being a ten. However, everything this game does is now done far better by a computer flight simulator. The other games, with their outside perspective provide a different insight and have no good computer equivalent that I know of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a classic game of trying to outmanuver the opponent.  The setting is WWI air combat, and the system is brilliant even now.

Σπανια συλλεκτικη deluxe εκδοση,ενα απο τα πιο "παραξενα" wargames μιας και οι παικτες παιζουν μεσα απο τις σελιδες των βιβλιων τους,εχει χωρο για παρα πολλους optional rules που του δινουν μεγαλο βαθος.
Δεν βγαινουν πλεον τετοια παιχνιδια.

Τιμη συζητησημη γιατι πραγματικα δεν ξερω αν θελω να το αποχωριστω.

Quick play and easy to learn! What more needs be said. This is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone even non-gamers. I bought this at GenCon the year it first came out and still own and play it. At college we used this out while lounging and drinking and used to get into some great dogfights using the optional multi player rules. My teenage daughters even discovered the game and enjoy it as well.

Very innovative and clever game. Great beer and pretzels game, could even be played while standing in line.  Limited to one on one play generally, although with more books others could join in.  PLayed it for fun in college for a while but preferred more traditional table top boardgames. This had more action it seemed than others in the series.

Fun & quick game of air combat done booklet-style. Really liked the period illustrations, and the game was tense. Didn't quite get the hang of how to manoeuver efficiently, but I suppose I'm just an rookie kill to the aces.

Basic game only so far. Clever idea that plays fast with some possibility progressive memorization of the page connections. This could lead lead to stalemates. Still has enough replay value as, with so many other games around,competition will prevent this game from being played too often.

Each player has a book.  Each page shows a view from their airplane with a list of maneuvers along the bottom.  Pick a maneuver and tell your opponent what page they go to and they do the same.  The epitome of the first person shooter before the world ever heard the word 'Wofenstein 3-D'

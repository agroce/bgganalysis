A great game unfortunately hidden behind a licensing deal.  This one is easy to learn and fun to play, even for non-gamers.  The key element is that, because anyone can move any car, you remain intent on the game even when it&#039;s not your turn.  A real gem.  Don&#039;t let the merchandising throw you-- this one is worth picking up (and can often be found cheap on eBay.)

The game I bought to play when Turfmaster didn’t have enough players (you really need 6) who’d enjoy listening to the rules for 15 minutes and play a 3 hour game. This in my case was most of the time.  

Daytona 500 is lighter on rules, has auctions which break up the racing, is quicker but has considerable dose of luck. I do prefer Turfmaster as it has less luck but for my usual game group Daytona 500 beats Turfmaster to the table 9 times out of 10.

I understand people who complain about the auctions not being intense. During my games sometimes you do bid the minimum for a car and then get it. Sometimes no one is willing to risk getting a car they just aren’t interested in. In most auctions I’ve found so far, at least one car is contested to the point a bidding war will break out. Granted this isn’t for every car but at least the auctions aren’t as dull as I feared.  There are at least a few small things to consider.

* Do I buy one car or two?  
* What position on the grid are the cars going to be?
* Am I willing to bluff my opponent and bid up a car I think he wants?

For a card game I’ve also found there are quite a few significant choices to make during a race. 

* When do I use my 9 card? 
* Do I hold back to try and make other players more likely to move my car?
* Do hold back around this bend? 
* Do I want to be first into this bend to try avoid the congestion?
* Do I waste moves to overtake on this bend? 
* Which cards are going to allow me to get into a slip stream position?
* Which cards are going to allow me to block my opponents?
* Which player should I be looking at to hamper the most in this race?

As you can see, there are some decent decisions to be made and you aren’t totally left to the fate of what you’ve been dealt.

I also have a full set of Nascar miniatures which ramp up the atmosphere of the game.

Oh last thing... If you aren't making these kinds of noises http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB3S8FEZ7gM while you're getting the box from the shelf, setting up the game, explaining the rules, playing the game and then putting it away, you're not playing it right.

I think, mechanics-wise, this is the best implementation of Kramer&#039;s race system.  The victory money, however, is a bit off... though it&#039;s never bothered us enough to &quot;fix&quot; it or use, say, the pay-off numbers from Top Race.

My favorite of this style game (Detroit/Cleveland, Top Race, etc).  I have dropped my rating to an 8 from a 10 because I think it is a more realistic rating, not because my opinion of the game has changed - I mean, would I really rather play D500 than, say, T&E?    Sometimes perhaps, but not always...

Same game, for the most part, as Detroit-Clev, but I like this one more.  I like the NASCAR theme better (gotta track down the little cars) and I like the drafting rules.

Can't make my mind up about this. Like the way it is more of a simulation than Detroit/Cleveland (drafting on the bends etc), but ovals are a bit boring, so circuits on D/C are better ...

What a wonderful game.  Not many rules, plays quickly and always a different game - nearly always a real battle to cross the line first though.  While Knizia deploys his zen mastery in producing very different games from sometimes similar starting points (cards numbered 0-9 anyone?) Kramer rarely repeats himself (even the Tikal/Java/Mexica trilogy are all very different).  No one else i can think of is capable of producing games as good but as varied as this, Expedition, 6 Nimmt!, Gulo Gulo and Tikal - to name just a few.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun mix of bidding and racing mechanics!  There is a lot of nastiness in the card play that I really enjoy, as you're trying to help out the other cars the least possible!

There are several games in this series, and the track here works the best out of any in the series, IMO.

This game appeals more to me every time.  Very minimal straightforward production here, but that's fine.

Maybe a little long for what it is about - but its kind of fun to try and block other cars and get free moves by drafting.  I'd like it more if the rules allowed you to screw other cars by taking the long the way through the bends on purpose.

Man, this is fun. Watching the race play out is fun, the hand management, race elements, and auction features all work smoothly and briskly together.  The pure fun value is up with the very top tier of games that I own.  Like it best with 4, to create the strategic conundrum of whether to own 1 or 2 cars (even with 3 players we allow people to own more than 2 cars, to preserve that element.)

RATING: 6
The semi-classic Kramer racing game. Unlike most racing games out there, this uses a card system to control the cars and makes players move not only their own cars, but those of the opposition. The game seems fairly straight-forward, but there is a considerable amount of room for nuanced, game length strategy as there are 3 races, and the overall object isn't to make your car win, it is to make the most money by investing in the right carrs (for your hand) at the right price and then using your resources to make as much cash as possible. On the track itself there are a lot of options for getting ahead without spending cards, particularly via drafting and being careful going into the corners. Very nice game, and definitely one of the few things with the NASCAR logo on it that I would be willing to let into my house, let alone spend time with.

I personally prefer the bottlenecks featured by the other games in this series to the dull oval track presented here, but the overall card play and jostling for position are still exciting in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally got around to this one. Although I should say its only been on the shelf for a few years not 15. Seems to be a solid racing game. Minimal luck which is excellent. A bidding aspect which is also great. Fun fast engaging not too deep but respectable.

RATING: 7.5

This is a very fun game with agonizing choices brought about by the card system.  My wife actually played it too, but nobody wants to play it lately. (update) played a single race recently, still great fun.  Wish there were more opportunities for blocking.

Update: My kids ask for this all the time now, and it consistently delivers.  I'd like to make a portable cloth track for it so we could more easily bring it on trips.

If you can find a copy of this game, grab it. Plays equally well with 2 or 3 players. (Not sure it works with four. It's better when everyone owns two cars.) The bidding alone is gut-wrenching. And then comes the hard part--trying to win the race! What is particularly agonizing is the decision whether to sprint one of your cars ahead while your other car lags behind. The results are usually unpredictable, with third- and fourth-place cars coming from behind to win with some regularity. The card system is perfect: easy to understand, hard (strategically) to master.

Kramer did a great job with this game. Three simple mechanics - bidding, hand management, and simple racing come together to form your classic sum greater than the parts board game. 

Truth be told, Daytona 500 really isn't a racing game. It's more of a card game with a management/bidding/spacial relations aspect. That said, that is exactly why I like Daytona 500. Racing games offer something a lot of Euros do not: transparent win conditions. Cross the line first. That's it, it's something we've all understood since early childhood. Personally, I feel racing games are best when done very lightly. That way the game moves quickly, like a real race. Daytona 500 fits that mold perfectly, and that's why I'm a fan.

The card mechanism is very smart and terrific.  A much better alternative to using dice.  Some cards can push you toward the finish line while stagnating your opponents.  The game is designed such that it usually requires help from your opponents in order to finish the race.

The only downside is that it seems the prize money is not as balanced like the rest of the game.  Otherwise, this should prove to be a timeless classic.  Grade: B-

Racing game in the family of card-driven race games by Wolfgang Kramer. Players bid on cars to "own" them, and then race using cards that move one or more cars along the track. Pretty simple as card-driven race games go. Not a bad way to begin or end a day of gaming.

Great game. Very interesting mechanic.  All kinds of collusion and back stabbing occurs amoung the players. The designer has a similar but different game, Detroit Cleveland Grand Prix.  Both are worth having.   He has a third race game, Top Race, that I have not played yet. Cards have movement instructions for one or more cars. (I'll help you if you help me !!) On your turn you play one of your cards.  Each card is played once.  Each game consists of six races and each race is one lap.  Negatives are: The board is beautiful but not durable.  I glued felt pads to the bottom of my cars because they were scratching the gameboard.  The cars are detailed with stickers that keep coming off so I painted the cars.

I'm going to buck the trend and admit I like this one better than Formula De. I think it's the betting/purchasing of cars aspect that puts a little more tension in the game. Much more of an ability to 'screw your neighbor' in Daytona 500 also (which is a good thing).

RATING: 6.3
Variants to the rules we use:

-Allow a movement of 5 spaces only for the #9 cards.

-There are three one-lap races in game. Players do not get start up money for the second and third races. They must use what they have left over + the amount won from the previous race(s) and proceeding to the finish. The player with the most money at the end of three races is the winner of the game.
-If running less than one race than each player receives $100,000 at the beginning of the game for each race to be run.

-If everyone passes on a car it goes back into the rotation to be auctioned off again later.
--Last car auctioned is not giving to a player for $10,000.  Instead it is auctioned (or giving to a player without a car) at $10,000 less than the lowest auction.  If a player with no cars yet in the race cannot afford that cost for the last car, then the car is given to them for all of the money they have left to offer.  
 
-2 player games use one car as The Ghost Car(variant)

RATING: 8
A terrific game for families or gamers, and my favorite lighter-style racing game.  Better and more strategic than it appears.  I particularly like the fact that Daytona 500 is designed for two, three, or four players - situations in which many other racing games fall flat.  Herr Kramer's idea of forcing the players to move other players' cars in addition to their own was nothing short of genius!  Daytona 500 is a clear choice as the best game in the development arc that includes Niki Lauda's Formel 1, Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix, and Top Race.  My one criticism of the game is that the bidding for control of the cars doesn't work as well as it should.  I've tried some tweaks in that area, but haven't come up with anything that's completely satisfactory.

Only played once (four player), but the impression was strong: the individual turns were sometimes interesting, but on a whole I felt there was "less than meets the eye." How exciting can the bidding be if, when your hand is strong in a color, the other players' hands are necessarily weak in that color? The final nail in the coffin was that the game moved way too slowly for what it was. For lighthearted racing fun, Royal Turf wins by a length.

Lighter and enjoyable racing and wagering game.  It's much more about the money than racing tactics, but still kind of scratches both itches.  This is one of the rare mass market games that's actually worth seeking out.  Hope to find a copy some day.  Unfortunately, the "Nascar" license will probably keep this specific game from being published again.

For such a simple game, it offers good choices every turn. It plays a little long for what it is (with my group anyway), but it is definitely interesting the whole time. It probably plays best with 4 so that there is more competition for cars, and less cards in hand.

This game is fun and very challenging. I've heard the other versions ruin the track and from the descriptions I believe it. There is a lot of luck in card draws but you can optimize what you have based on what others play. The auction for the cars adds a lot for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Action Points = A.P. -- It's the rule of Kramer/Kiesling, right? But here Kramer has created an entertaining little basic game, with very basic action points (moves), that flows quickly and easily, but doesn't insult the intelligence of those playing and offers a fun challenge for those not wanting a deep game, filling time, or playing 'just one more' at the end of a session.

Daytona 500 is a terrific little race game, not especially challenging, with some luck (of the deal) but a decent opportunity for skill and selection with a way method to moderate the luck via bidding on the cars, knowing your hand ahead of time.  Of course, money also = V.P.... how badly do you want THAT car?

I would not have thought a Kramer game could be such light fun and still retain some tactics and planning, but it IS.

Glad I finally picked up a copy of this- 7 on a 1st solo 4-player game.

RATING: N/A
Thrift find. $2.99. Looks un-played, but some insect or other (silverfish?) ate some of the outside of the box, plus two fixed splits.

For play with 6-8 year olds use the following (Eric Brosius, MSBorba & sedjtroll) rule modifications:

1. Play this game without bidding. Ignore the auction portion of the game. Either randomly assign car(s) to each player and randomly choose the starting grid or just take turns choosing cars (switching the drafting order from race to race.) 

2.  Reduce the 1st place bonus to $250K to offset the possible windfall of drafting the perfect car without having to pay.

3. To ease with hand management, deal out only 5 cards per player, replenishing the hand to 5 after each round of play.

4. Each player moves their own car, irrespective of who's turn it is. It makes the game more thematic, exciting, strategic, and it also keeps people involved when it's not their turn.

Use Sharp Shooters or Last Chance chips to replace/upgrade the money.


Best with 3, 4 players

Fun game.  The financial aspect of the game is unique and very NASCAR flavored in that you don't have to win every race to be the series champion you just have to be consistently decent.  Having to move your opponents' cars when you play a card makes for intriguing strategy.  I only wish it was better for two players.

In my opinion, this is the best of the three games using this card based movement mechanism (the others being Top Race and Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix).  The board provides interesting decision points without resorting to single lane chicanes and the such.  It's a pity this one is out of print.

Jul08: A really fun auction and race game!  The decisions are really meaty and yet the game play is a lot of fun.  It's so tough to get your cars moved ahead without helping out your opponents too much.

If you get the chance, I recommend trying out any of the games in this series.

Also, as for variants, I just toss out the rule about all players must get a car.  If you think all the bids are too high, then you just run the race without a car.  You can still easily win the game if everyone else over pays by a ton.

I'm not sure where all the fun was here but we missed what I was expecting in 2 playings.  Really didn't seem very strategic to me either, a little planning yes but far too little for a gamer and most choices seemed obvious I think. This could use some variants maybe to help spice it up. Will update again after a few more playings hopefully with better news. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] Without adding things to the game like "flat tires" or something it just really seems too simple and elegant if you will. Umreifenbreite is about the best race game of these types I've found as it had more to offer in general than the others including this one

In the same line as the other Kramer racing games (Top Race, Detroit Cleveland Grand Prix), and while I enjoy it, it's not my favorite. I'd rank them Det/Clev, then Daytona, then Top Race.

I like to have the option of two different tracks on Det/Clev (Daytona only has one), and while I really like that Daytona doesn't have the switch-colors cards that Det/Clev has, the Daytona track doesn't give me enough interesting points to win out.

I played Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix before this, but I ended up liking this more.  For me, when playing with a lot of players, DCGP had too many choke points, there were many instances when I couldn't move at all.  I like that Daytona 500 is more open.  The restricted passing lane is enough of a choke point for me.  I still think that it's an absolute necessity to play quickly, as too much thinking about card play can kill the fun of the game.  It's a very light and fun racing game, and I suppose that you can analyze it to get optimal results with your given cards, but why?

[2007.Nov.29] A solid, light racing game. The game lacks the fun-factor to be on the table for more than one or two laps of racing. More than that in my opinion becomes too repetitive, because it's simply "more of the same". Certainly not a bad game, but by no means is it a 'must play'.

Nifty racing/betting game where each of the six cars are auctioned off and they each earn money according to how they place (if they don't finish the race, they don't make any money!).  Each player has a hand of cards which show how many spaces 1 to 6 cars may go if not blocked...if a car is behind another car making a movement, then it gets to draft forward one space).  Most money wins!

This game pre-dates downforce.  Very fun game where you auction off cars  at the beginning of the game.  You have a hand of cards that have different numbers on them.  Sometime they have one color car and one number.  Others have wild cars and other have all the cars with differing numbers.  On your turn you play a card and try to move the cars.  It is really a fun game.  I am sure I would like DownForce as a result of this.  

Very solid older design.

I have a homemade version constructed Feb 2006. 

Not bad. After one 3 player game of 3 races I don't have the strategy yet. I think that Detroit Cleveland Grand Prix with the variants for the swap card effects might be useful to screw with the race leaders. I think I would like it better with 4 players.

Revisited this in Feb 2016, made a new copy. It is quite good. Good enough to make me hunt down a copy of Top Race. Sold my copy of Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix and now I regret it.

First you bid on your cars, and try to get the ones that best match your cards' strengths (but at what cost)?  Secondly you race by playing cards, but most cards you play also move cards your opponents are racing.  Additionally there's some movement strategy: you can draft your cars and try to block your opponents or make them spend more movement points on the turns.  Played with 3 (where each person gets 2 cars) but I think 4 people would totally change the game since during the auction you may get 0-2 cars to race.

I like the moving mechanic used in this game. It's not easy to have your car get blocked on your turn, but others can burn cards so your car moves less. The auction aspect is decent, since you bid depending on how good your cards are for each car. In the four player game we played, it seems that you really need to get two cars at least twice to have a chance.

Brilliant auction / card play hybrid that reminds me of Bridge in a weird way. Hand evaluation is essential, and multiple strategies can be pursued right from the start (1 car or multiple cars? Go for first or try to show?). Lots of depth here.

Daytona 500 is an auto-racing game in which you're dealt a hand of cards, most of which will move multiple cars each a different number of spaces.  Based on the cards you get, you auction off the six cars; if you own a car you earn money depending on the car's placement.  The trick is to maneuver the opponent's cars to make it illegal for them to advance further, wasting their movement on your cards.  This is a very basic game with little intrigue.  Despite its simplicity, it still gives you things to think about, but there's not that much going on here.

An incredibly fun racing and auction game.  The auction, which results in a tough decision of bidding high and needing to win vs. bidding low and nursing your car across the finish line, sets this apart from other racing-only games.  And, an extra note: although the rules call for 2-4 players, we've played twice with 5 players and have had no problems at all.  Update:  Unfortunately, the family doesn't share my opinion, and this one never makes it to the table: it's time to get rid of it.

One play: Not a big racing fan, but this game was fun.  Amazingly simple.  Deal cards, buy cars, take turns playing cards until every car finishes the race.  The cool part is that most cards move multiple cars so you need to determine when is the best time to play each card.

RATING: 7
An amazingly good 'mainstream' racing game.  Actual strategy from the intial bidding to running the race with resource management too. Owning the colored '5' card (the '9' is automatic on the winning bid) and one or more '5 wild' cards are probably sufficient to have a chance at winning as most of the cards will be played during the course of the game, helping you along. Don't get ahead early and save the above mentioned cards for that last burst over the finish line.

Where purchased: Ebay

After picking up some card protectors and Racing legends cars for tokens, this game always gets a look. The cards are very cheaply made and the cars that come with the set have stickers that peel rather easily.

It's a fun game.

RATING: 8
The best of the Wolfgang Kramer racing series... it's fast and can easily fill 45 minutes between longer games... components are a little dated, but it's easy enough to introduce non-gamers... like Detroit-Cleveland and Top Race, cards move one to six vehicles a number of spaces on the track... the catch is that the active player moves all the cars, not just his own, and can therefore stick it to his opponents... the drafting rule adds a lot to the game... recommend using the move all or nothing rule from Detroit-Cleveland... my wife made a 7'x3' oval track suitable for 1/64th scale cars... will play anytime...

First play was a win, but was just okay.  I think the game almost is a gem but has a few short comings.  It is easy to get in a rut and never get out and be out of the running to win.  A lot depends on how much other players will help you in the game, which can be good and bad.

RATING: 5
What's the fuss?  Yes it's fun to put the cars into a neat position, thereby screwing the next person to move, or allowing the next person to screw another opponent; however, actually making this great move happen involves looking at each card individually and saying "if I use this card, blue moves 1.2.3.4.5.6..., yellow moves 1.2.3.4.5..., green moves...."  This is a slow tedious process that involves no creativity whatsoever.  Nor does it involve any kind of wrenching decision-making--either you luck into a great position or you don't.  If you don't, just choose the card that is the most effectively used. (i.e., the card where you get the most free moves, or the card where you block more opponents' moves.  can be determined using simple addition.)

OK, if it's not the race part that's great, maybe it's the auction part?  If so, I have yet to figure it out.  If you have all the good red cards, nobody will challenge you for the red car.  So you get the car cheaply *and* you win the race!  So what's the fun?  Alternatively, if you have all the wild cards, you bid for everything cheaply and get pretty decent standing.  So the auction seems to have no point.  Someone please explain what I'm missing.

Jesus. Rates high for its sheer elegance - the level of joyous, race-feeling, jockying-for-position, delirious joy that this game pumps out of basically three thoughts (1. cards move multiple cars; 2. constricted areas where it costs a lot to pass; 3. air vacuum suckage of cars behind) astounds me. 

UPDATE

Played again, now much later-in-phase into my german gaming disease. It's still an astounding design. I don't quite get how it's this fun. It's always fun. It's always bucketloads of fun. I shake the rules sometimes looking for the cool mechanism to fall out. Where is it? I don't see it? But there is magic here.

I am running out of synonyms for clever.  Streamlined and quicker than most racing games.  Makes good use of hand management.  The auction to control cars at the start of each race is slightly reminiscent of the bidding for trump in many card games.  All in all, highly recommended for an hour's fun (if played without delays).  There must be some way for me to combine this with Pitstop!

RATING: 5
Played at KublaCon 2007. I usually shy away from racing games, even thought I really don't know how they'll play. I played this one, and the mechanics were pretty cool. However the auction for cars was dull, probably because we didn't know how to bid or what to consider a "good" hand.

I'd like to trey this game where each player moves their own car, irrespective of who's turn it is. I think it would make the game more thematic, exciting, strategic, and it would also keep people involved when it's not their turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a much better execution of the card based movement that is found in a couple of other Kramer games.  To me, it just fits with the NASCAR theme a whole lot better than it does with the Formula theme.  That is just my opinion, though, but I actually enjoy playing this one.

RATING: 7
Daytona 500 -- Played once; four-player.  Nice balance of random card hands, balanced distribution of card elements, and the necessity  of tactically timed card play.  The requirement that passing in corners returns your car to the one driving lane is what makes the game work.

Disclaimer, I am not racing fan at all so I bought this game strictly on BGG reviews, and this is one time I am glad that I did. The programming of movement based on cards (vs. dice) inserts strategy into an otherwise luck based racing game. The cards also dovetail nicely into the other main mechanic of car auctioning. Again, sounds like a yawner but this phase can often be the difference between victory or defeat. Sure, bad card draws can heavily influence the game conditions, but most of the cards will be played by your opponents so you still might have a fighting chance even with less than ideal cards. I pimped my game with the NASCAR Racing Champions 1:144 diecast cars- lots of eye-candy but for me it makes for a more immersive play than the included plastic cars.

I'm not afraid to love Milton Bradley games, but sometimes there are a few releases that they put out that pleasantly surprise.  This is a fantastic hand management racing game.  There are some significant choices here, yet it still remains light and fun.  

The drafting is great.  I much prefer this to Top Race as there are no screwy switch places cards and awkward betting.  

One gripe though, I'm curious as to why MB thought it would be a good idea to score the board.  I don't see how a criss cross pattern cut into the board helps the game at all.

Out of all of the racing games, this one is definitely okay. I'd rather be racing with Formula D or Snow Tails or Ave Caesar or Camel Up and probably others that I'm forgetting. I'd trade it but it would be crazy expensive to ship.

I really enjoy the movement mechanic on this one, with each card moving some or all of the vehicles; it keeps people invested in the action even when it's someone else's turn, and moving all the cars at once feels quite race-like.  The game moves quickly, and takes some skillful play to win.  I like and play it at least as much as I do Formule De, which is sad considering how much I've shelled out for all those expansion tracks for the latter.  I should bust out Formule De more often, really, if only to try to get my money's worth out of it.  But this is all really beside the point, which was that Daytona 500 is a lovely game.

RATING: 7.5
A very fun simple racing game, combining card-driven movement and bidding for the cars when you've received your hand.  Not too long in duration, and always something going on as cards move other players' cars as well as your own.  Great for kids, kids with adults, or just adults.  Even experienced gamers enjoy this - while it is a light diversion, there are still strategies to apply and it can be both involving and competitive.  Well done Milton Bradley!

An OK racing game, but I prefer Formula De Mini and Um Reifenbreite. Here, I tend to get annoyed/frustrated by my hand of cards, and being screwed (blocked) by the previous player's card play.

Somehow MB developed a great game.  Luckily, it has nothing to do with NASCAR in particular so my friends can really enjoy it as much as I do.  Great resource management game with a neat bidding mechanism to choose cars.  Plays great with 2 or 3 people so everyone gets an equal number of cars.  A game of 4 players must last three races in order to even out the car distribution.

This is a real gem of a game.  It seems overly simple at first, but once you play it a couple times you realize there is some definite strategy hiding in this game.  Of course there is some luck with the cards you get, but I really like how the game is about maximizing your chances with the cards you are dealt.  Overall a really fun and easy game that has a "toy" factor with the little cars racing around the track.  Also very non-gamer friendly.

But I enjoyed the play, my 7 year old seemed to pick up on the game and the strategy right away.  The rules were easy to learn.  I just enjoy race games, this one played fast was easy to learn, and had some level of strategy to it.  Overall I liked it and want to play it more.

RATING: 7
[Milton Bradley 90 edition] {Car racing, economic; auction, hand management; optimal 3p}  Daytona 500 is a classic race game from Wolfgang Kramer.  I haven't tried the sequels and variants (Top Race, Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix, etc.) but I was told by my friends that this is the best.

This is an interesting racing game, in which players bid for cars to get dividends (similar to Win, Place and Show).  The design of the cards is clever - it provides different tactics and avoid run-away leader problem.  The rule is good, too - blocking and drafting are nice addition to increase interaction and excitement.  White car may be a little bit over-powerful; players have to be alert.  It is easier to control a single car than 2 cards but controlling 2 cards give more tactical options.

I have a handful of racing games.  I think a good racing games should be :-
* fast-paced (short turns)
* last within 45-60 minutes
* interactive (players can strategically position their pawns or block other players)
* thematic (mechanic must match the theme)
* exciting
* no runaway leader problem

This is a good racing game according to my criteria. Thumb-up.  The only minus is that it only supports up to 4 players and supports no team/partnership.

[House rule] I am thinking to design more race courses for the game.

Daytona 500 has that excellent quality of being easy to learn, but tough to figure out the optimal play.  There is a fine balance between jumping out to a quick lead so you don't get clogged up in the turns, or hanging back a bit so other players aren't offended by helping you.  The luck of the draw does get evened out both by the auction and the three races per game rule.  Fun game.

Very good, clean game.  It's light and yet subtle.  The hand managment is interesting.  The biggest problem is that the game seems a bit long and yet I think it probably really does need to be played in 3 rounds, so it can't easily be shortened (other than getting players to play quicker).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun game.  It is easy enough for anyone to play, but interesting enough for gamers to enjoy.  Scales well from 2-4.


Top Race (Pegasus Spiele edition) is better. This is just a notch below. The mechanic of moving all cars on any particular card creates a fun tension in what to play, but even more importantly, it keeps the race moving a long at a good clip. This is where most race games fall down. Nothing that is fun about racing is sacrificed with this either. 

No wonder there are three games in the series.

Update: Went from 7.5 to a 10 after at least 30 plays.  This is my favorite race game and has found universal appeal.  In fact, I previously wrote that if I could keep only one game it would be Carcassone because I enjoyed it and it was universally loved.  I think this game is probably the one I'd keep as it scales better and I think I enjoy it more.

The 1/144 scale Racing Champions cars are a must.

Update: Falls from 10 to a 9.  Fifteen more plays in a short time and the sheen is wearing off just a little.  Nearly everything I wrote above is true except that I am pretty sure Carcassone would be the keeper.  This is still a great game.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

RATING: 7.1
Quite a few things to like about this game:
- the auction to buy cars and the tough decision to buy cars based on pole position, your cards or how many cars you want to try to run,
- the drafting mechanic and the maneuvering it brings out,
- and the card play that requires moving other people's cars (and having to do so in a certain order).
The impact of the luck of the deal was tough to overcome though. So far, that makes this a good game for me, but not a great one.

So much of this game depends on working with other players. If it's straight up head to head play it just doesn't play out like the same game what so ever. This game needs to be a 4 player minimum game and 6 player optimum game. Same goes for the other games in this series.

A good racing game. Fast, intuitive and not overly complex. Given that this is a Kramer design, I am not surprised at the mechanics of the game, especially the balance of keeping the game real tight and avoiding runaway victories. In one particular round, we had an incredible luck of the draw for our car. I thought it would have been a clear cut run away victory. Yet, victory was not evident until the very last round. Amazing balance (perhaps too balanced?). There needs to be an auctioneer for the game, someone to push the game along during the bidding phase, which can get tedious. Three rounds seems to drag a little toward the end. Playing two rounds feels a little short in terms of scoring. Paper money is not great, but will suffice. The cars are solid plastic models, albeit rather unassuming and bland. The game works if you can find a copy of this out of print game.

Got really lucky and picked up a copy of this from my nearby thrift store.  Was only familiar with it by reputation, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw it was a Kramer.  As for the gameplay itself, I hesitantly like it.  Its a little too chaotic to really do much to control the outcome.  At the end of the race, you have to hope that the other players put you in postition to take the checkered flag.  Sometimes, if your car gets deep in the back of the pack, you may be out of the race entirely.  Those things aside, you're making decisions all the time, and you do have control, even if it's not complete.  The drafting mechanic is stupid simple, but works very well.  This is generally really engaging, and makes a great gateway game.

Reason for WL:  Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix left a good impression.

A racing game where the card play was an intriguing part of movement.  Wish it got to the table more.

Good racing game but its sucessors, most notably Top Race (Pegasus edition), is significantly better with better components, more and more interesting tracks, and optional pit stop and betting and shares mechanisms.

However, the Daytona 500 drafting mechanism which has disappeared from its successors should be reintroduced/adapted as it adds additional interesting, positioning decisions to the gameplay.

I like the way everything comes together in this game, from the bidding for the cars (even if you don't want a particular color, you should make who does pay for it), to the different colors on the cards (you have to look deeper than the first color when picking cars), to the curve rules (block!).  This is definitely deeper than the MB logo would suggest, but it probably plays better with more than 2.  I'd be interested in trying some of the other games in this series, or at least make my own boards to keep the game interesting.

I like this game with 2 players more than with 4. With 4 players there is lot of potential for Kingmaking, where a player not in contention for the win hands the game to another player of their choosing. With 2 players I would rate it a 7.

Fun race game; nice auction at the beginning, tense racing at the end.

I was shocked at the tactical level of this game. Much deeper than I thought it would be.

I can see the appeal over DCGP, but I like both about equally. The choke points appeal to me, but the switcher cards are not missed here. All versions, though, suffer from a strange auction. There is a perfect iteration yet to be designed....

This game really surprised me by how good it was.  Well worth picking up.

Neat card mechanics, but I like the maps better for Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix

A great game. The best car-racing game. One of the best American boardgames. The best use of this mechanic.

Fun racing/auction game.  Good for 4 - less good for 6, as much of the tension comes from bidding on cars.  If everyone is forced to get one car, it is less interesting.

I'm not sure what people see in this over Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix. I prefer Detroit-Cleveland.

I never saw this game when it was in production. Oval track and drafting makes this a very good race game.

Remarkably fun game, despite the NASCAR theme.  Haven't played it in ages, so I'll have to try getting it back to the table sometime soon...

A subtle racing and bidding game.  You want to bid enough to get the car that matches your cards, but you don't want to bid so much that you end up losing money on the race.  I haven't figured it out yet, but I keep wanting to come back to it.

I enjoy this. My non-gamer son and friends really enjoy the close races. My wife puts up with it so, I rarely see this one.

I made my own modular tracks which make the game more fun, if I'd only get to play more.

I didn't think anything branded with NASCAR would be this fun. A big surprise, since I'm not much of a race gamer. Played a 2-player variant using 2 cars each with a ghost car.

Wolfgang Kramer is a genius.  He actually made a Milton Bradley game worth owning.  This is a ton of fun and can be taught in 5 minutes.  Grab it off of EBay for $10.

Great race game whose luck is mitigated by the multiple rounds.  I'd love to find this in a thrift store somewhere.

Fun, fun, fun.  Good decisions to make while staying a light game.  Interesting to compare to Royal Turf.

I acknowledge the elegance of this design, however this game falls short of delivering the fast-paced, gut wrenching feeling of a close fought race.  So what's the point of playing a race game that doesn't seem like a race?

I admit I am not the target audience: I do not paint minis and I do not play Warhammer.  So when I say I wish the minis were painted, I speak for the minority.  I'm also not a fan of the detachable arms.  I know that allows some measure of customization, but it also makes them fragile.  The board is also a bit a bit of a pain to set up: not as bad as [thing=73171][/thing], but it is a bit annoying.  Those are the negatives of this game.

Now for the positives: one serving of this game will provide all of your daily USDA-recommended nutrients of Ameritrash goodness.  The system flows smoothly and is asymmetrical and balanced.  The fact that the space marines have an hourglass timer to limit the amount of thought they get to put in their strategy is the perfect way to capture the speed advantage of the genestealers.  The theme in this game is a breath of fresh of air and it just drips with awesome, far outweighing the minor negatives I mention.

Love the 4th edition update. I own the 1st, 2nd and 4th editions, and while I still immensely enjoy 2nd edition, 4th has even better quality components and is closer to 1st edition rules-wise, which is a good thing.

I've played the digital version on Steam with a friend now for almost a year and I feel I have a good grip on the gameplay and design, none the less, when I heard it was back in print I knew I had to get a copy for myself. I honestly don't know if I will ever find the time to paint and assemble the figures to physically play the game but I hope to, one day. 

Update: So my friend has assembled the minis for me and is volunteering to paint it. The game has won me over. its a lot of fun in a very dated kinda way. The missions are sometimes very unbalanced but serve to re-enforce theme, the mechanics are good but clunky. Not very exceptional but still very enjoyable.

A spur of the moment purchase at my LGS (they had a ding and dent box for $70, thought it was a good deal). This is rather enjoyable but much lighter than I thought going into it. I put the minis together myself (having had no previous experience doing so) and they came out ok. The game itself is a 2 player dice combat fest with 2 very asymmetrical sides going at it. I like how the humans, being slower than the aliens, have a sand timer mechanic that can rush their planning. The scenarios are also interesting, with some good variety. Keeper.

Mi primer (y tal vez único) acercamiento a lo que es Warhammer, las miniaturas son las mejores que he visto. El juego es simple pero bastante entretenido. Se siente un poco roto si juegas con los space marines, pero le pusimos unas reglas de casa donde al lanzar los dados, si el resultado es 5 o 6, cuenta como hit (en el reglamento dice que solo cuenta el 6). Aunque esto es mínimo le da un poco más de balance al juego y la campaña se vuelve sumamente entretenida.

The newest (limited) release of the classic Space Hulk game.  A fairly straightforward game of 'kill the aliens'.  Simple mechanics, not a load of rules, and a customizable game board.  If Omega Protocol has 'too much to it' but you like the idea/theme, then Space Hulk is a great option - if you can get your hands on a copy.

I stumbled across Space Hulk 4th edition at my FLGS. Having given up on owning this as it sold out immediately, it was surprising to see it sitting on the shelf. I didn't buy it immediately, however. After mulling it over and convincing my girlfriend we should own it, a few days later I walked away with the game store's last copy. (Red Cap's Corner is a great FLGS in Philadelphia's University City area.)

Once we got it home, it took a couple of hours to clip the miniatures (36 in total) from the sprue and glue them together. Good practice for Shadows of Brimstone, I thought, which would be arriving shortly after.

My lady friend I played 2 games of this the next day, back to back, and really enjoyed it. The quality of the components are, as expected, phenomenal: thick, glossy cardboard tiles with great art; wonderfully realized space marines and genestealer minis. The rules are straight-forward and easy to pick up. Well written manual. The back story is engaging and very thematic, even for non-Warhammer 40k fans. Fans of the sci-fi/horror genre will love this. The game plays quickly. We especially liked the innovative timer mechanic for the Space Marine player. 

Not a game for everyone, to be sure, but for fans of tactical miniature style games, this is a no-brainer. If you don't mind spending $125 or more for a single board game that is...

Update 06.2017

Upping this to a 9, this has become a favorite of mine. Tense, lop-sided, and full of simple but impactful decisions. One must think on one's feet all the time. Tactically sound, and strategically interesting, without any complexity overhead. A true classic.

---
Does what it is supposed to do almost perfectly, excepting a few rule inaccuracies and open points that need to be addressed in the FAQ. This is a par excellence space crawler without needless complexity in the form of special abilities thrown in, as is en vogue these days. Great, fast and tense gameplay, lovely components, easy to teach and extremely fun to play. Rolling dice has never been more fun. Keeper.

[u]Tense[/u] asymetrical tactical miniature game with modular board tiles. Amazing components!  Huge background material and stories for each mission. Easy rules, streamlined, a lot of fun! Many positions are like solving a puzzle, so good positional playing is the key to win. The game punish bad tactical decisions but some luck one the dice can help as well. A lot of scenarios to choose from, each scenario fells like watching the [i]Aliens[/i] movies.
The miniatures can be used for playing W40 scenarios too (I painted most of them).
Very high [color=red]solitaire[/color] suitability using the Space Marines.

RATING: 8
One of my earliest board game purchases and it took ages for me to finally play a full game of it. I'm glad that I did, because I found this a lot better than expected. Tense for the Space Marine player, who needs to position his units properly while fighting off a massive swarm of Genestealers from the opposing player and simultaneously trying to progress through the mission. Somehow one of the Space Marines has one of its arms snapped off, I need to glue the minis anyway as parts have a tendency to fall off, especially with the Genestealers. Beautifully produced, but a massive table hog. I want to play through the rest of the missions now.

Acquired October 2014. Some more bits, a few more scenarios, a possible investment, and potentially a chance to do a really, really NICE paint job on this one, versus the serviceable but rough paint job I did on my 3rd Edition copy.

RATING: 7
Pros: Awesome miniatures, great asymmetrical game play, thickest tiles and detailed art, great tension in the dice roll combat. Normally I dislike sand timers but this game makes it work.

Cons: Requires hobby clippers and glue to put together. Scenarios have some setup time due to tiles not being labeled. Wish it came with a small draw bag for the initiative tokens. Decent amount of replayability but there are a finite amount of scenarios in the box.

Simple yet thematic game that recreates [i]Aliens[/i], I mean, uh, pits space marines (TM) vs genestealers (also TM). If you've played the computer game (old or new) you'll fee right at home here.

The components are great, the mechanics fairly straightforward and the playing time short. About my only criticism, beyond the fact that GW can eat a bag of dicks for their "space marine" trademark and general IP nonsense, is that it's possible to play the genestealers much more tactically than they move in the computer game, but that's minor and necessary to make it interesting I think.

Here's what I wrote for Third Ed:
Space Hulk is one of my favorite games, just solid all around with a brilliant mix of streamlined action point rules with tense, tight and exciting. It has rules that evoke the theme of the game and a setting that feels like a movie unfolding in front of you. The way the game creates a narrative is tough to match and really no other game I feel creates such a compelling story. The one downside in this production is the models, they look amazing but their practical use is low. Top tier game.

Here's what I add for Fourth Ed: 
The extra missions and tiles were to sell units. I hate the downloadable files since I don't have a pad. Though I do like the idea of them as well as the squad creation rules and the scenario creation rules.

One of my holy grail games, I finally got the fourth edition, and it is everything I remember the game being.  GW's finest achievement.  Best components in a boardgame ever, huge nostalgia kick, but the rules do show their age a little.  For those who grew up with the new kids like Descent, skip it.  For those who grew up with the godfathers of the dungeon crawl like Space Hulk and Heroquest, get it.

Popular sci-fi skirmisher with miniatures set in the Warhammer 40k universe.  Modular board similar to Descent.  Components are absolutely top notch, though you will need some time to clip and glue the figures together.  Very nicely laid out instruction book.  Background material is immense for a board game, and storyline makes every mission purposeful.  No character development in this 16 mission campaign, but this fast sci-fi skirmisher fits a special niche in my collection.

Really fun and exciting game.

The mechanics are simple but yet with enough substance to create really tough decisions during gameplay.

This is a game that I've wanted for years, so when the 4th edition was announced I jumped all over it.  I love the 40k lore and universe and can appreciate taking command of a terminator squad for the emperor.

This may be a good way for me to keep in contact with the 40k lore and gameplay without spending the big bucks for an army.  

Regarding 40k, I can't believe that units are so expensive!  I know that the models are nice, but $40 for a squad of guardsmen seems excessive...

Anyway, I rated this one a 10 since it's a game that I've wanted for more than a decade.  The gameplay is great.  I'm sure there are better games out there, so let me know if there are!

Nearly 25 years of playing this (across all 4 editions, natch) and I still enjoy it immensely. Everyone I play it with has their own way of approaching missions and that keeps it fresh. 

In terms of production, it's possibly the finest looking game I've ever seen. Bit of a ballache to assemble and prepare the miniatures, but once it's done you're good to go.

I've always been impressed by how tense Space Hulk is, it seems to nail something missing from most games in that regard, and this 4th edition is the best yet.

The twenty-fifth anniversary set (no doubt there'll be a thirtieth anniversary set in 2019) which essentially is a re-release of the 'never to be repeated' 3rd edition with thicker tiles and some extra missions. The missions are welcome as GW has always been especially parsimonious with playable material. The emphasis is still on modelling though. Why can't the miniatures have square bases to make the facing obvious? GW won't ever recover from being the company we all love to hate, a shame as games like this are pretty good.

Mechanically, a beautiful game. This edition is a great showpiece, and the miniatures would look wonderful painted and lined up in a display case. As a physical game to be played, or just stored, it's an overproduced mess that was depressing to own. I'll stick with the Steam version.

On the upside, I got back what I paid for it on eBay.

RATING: 8
Once you get past the lengthy setup time and the first couple of missions that are rather bland or boring you get to the good stuff.

The timer keeps the space marine player on edge and jamming during overwatch brings that tension as the tyranids edge ever closer.

Models are great, the pieces used to build the map are really good quality, and overall it looks great on the table.

The main downside is the table space that the game takes up.

This 4th edition is the 3rd edition plus some more.  Wow, what a killer edition this is!  I always loved Space Hulk.  It is the best thing GW has put out, if you ask me.  You may not have the best relations with fans, GW, but you definitely hit it out of the park with how amazing this version of the game is.

I bought this after over a year considering it. I was put off by the fact that it’s a two player game. However, when it finally arrived I knew it was a good choice. The board pieces and miniatures are the best I have seen in any game and the theming is consistently fantastic throughout.

The game itself is intense and very tactical with Gene Stealers punishing ever mistake. To begin with your space marines will probably get annihilated rather quickly and you may convince yourself that it is impossible.  However, it won’t take more than a few games to get the hang of it and you will soon be smashing chunks out of the gene stealer horde. The mechanics are simple, yet offer sufficient depth to keep it interesting and the game can be genuinely tense.

The game comes with a mission book including 16 missions (4th edition), each with their own map and victory condition and they are quite varied with a well-balanced difficulty curve. Again the theme here is excellent with each mission feeling meaningful and not bolted on as an afterthought.

Don’t be afraid of this if you want to play with more than two, squad Lorenzo and squad Gideon can be played separately and I find Calistarius and Claudio make a good pairing playable by a separate player. (Although you may want to swap someone with a storm bolter for Claudio) Eventually I will paint the squads so they can be identified as distinct units for the purposes of multiplayer play, I will also do two paint jobs on the gene stealers so they can be split if we want to extend to 5 players. So for I have played mission 4 with three players, one for each squad and one playing gene stealers, which worked very well. Using the game system and tiles its actually incredibly easy to make your own scenarios and story arc, I have just written my own mission (locked in) which will serve as our first 4 player game this weekend.

Space hulk is among the best games I have ever played, if not the best! It isn’t over complicated yet it has more than enough depth to keep you coming back for more. Dare you face the gene stealers?

Got this game for my teenage son. We both love it as it has simple rules but has tons of theme. Setup isn't too bad if you have taken the time organize the pieces by size. The models are very detailed and although "snap-on" for the most part really need to be glued to keep them together. I am not really a miniatures painter and definitely not a Warhammer fan but this game is fun and satisfies that daily Ameritrash recommended daily allowance needed for any board gamer.

Among all the great games that have released in the past 5 years, and all those in my personal collection of over 430 games, Space Hulk remains in my #1 spot. It has remained above the others not just because it is such a great tactical dungeon-crawl, but because there is so much replayability. I never get sick of playing this game, as either faction, and every time I do, I just want to play it again! 

I'm not sure how long it can stay in my #1 spot with all the competition from 2014 and 2015. There have been some great games working their way up my Top 10 List. But for now, it still holds!

Romper desde lejos una puerta con un bólter o rifle de asalto para que luego el marine con lanzallamas pueda lanzar un proyectil sobre el interior de una habitación y matar a varios genestealers/blips de golpe es una muy buena idea.
Aunque no se disponga del marine con lanzallamas la idea sigue siendo buena pues los marines al menos tienen línea de visión sobre algunas casillas de la habitación, y si se pone en fuego de alerta es muy probable que algún genestealer caiga muerto al pasar por delante de las casillas sobre las que el marine tiene línea de visión.

Esto es importante y tener en cuenta para cuando a L le toque ser marine en la misión 1.

El sargento gideon es una máquina de guerra cuerpo a cuerpo luego puede ser la cabecilla en algún grupo de incursión. Lo mismo puede aplicarse al marine que porta el rifle de asalto. El marine con lanzallamas debe ir acompañado de un soldado que le rompa las puertas para que él posteriormente pueda rociar de fuego y arrasar una habitación.

Only have Steam version.  Really enjoy the gameplay, which often boils down to a logic puzzle with dice rolling and anticipating enemy moves.  Steam version is in dire need of patch as the game slows to a crawl if too many bodies are on the screen.  Thus, many of the more complicated missions are off limits, so bummer.

The old classic with better components, 16 missions, and the 4th edition is the best version yet.  The game is hard to beat for a series of tactically challenging and interesting scenarios for sic-fi gamers.  Although not cheap by any standards, the components and replay value are well worth the price.

Found it in pristine shape for fifty Euros.  Man, a lot of plastic in the box!  Th production is ridiculous, but the  floor tiles are pretty cool with all the indentations and artwork.  The models are a pain to work with... Much more basic than Doom but plays pretty fast and furious.  Our first game Feb 11, 2017 saw us battle to a draw: I was the Marines and Oskar the genestealers.  He caught on pretty fast.  Takes a while to set up, so I did a better box organization which should speed it up.  Looks like the first owner probably only gave it one game, at most.  He did, however, keep the dice!

+1 very thematic/immersive

+2 several of the mechanics (slow marines, fast/hidden aliens, marine sight-lines etc) combine beautifully to make this game tense - the game is almost 'jumpy' which fits in well with the theme, and i haven't felt elsewhere. 

+1 lots of replayablity as the layout and scenarios can change

+.5 cool miniatures! 

-1 although there's replayability, there seems to be more variety playing the marines than the aliens, and even then, the same mechanics on a different layout only change the strategy slightly. 

-1 not too complex to teach, but bulky with a long-ish setup and long play time for what in retrospect seems like a brief encounter. 

Sadly my copy has been held hostage by a friend for several years. 

An awesome, immersive game which has such awesome buildup of tension that it almost feels like jumpscares. 

actually originally bought it as a DnD alternative if I didn't get enough players showing up, which says a lot about how immersive and emotive it can be

Basically a re-release of the 3rd edition. Which is just fine with me.

SH is the grand-daddy of the turn-based tactical sci-fi dungeoncrawler games, and its amazing to see how it's still to this day a superb gameplay experience.

The contrasting playing styles of the Marines & Genestealers are elegantly translated with a minimum of chunky rules, and it's all trimmed and slimmed down so that it's all really about the movement and careful positioning. Playing as a ´Stealer plays like a high-stakes chess game where you are constantly probing and trying to force a weakness in the enemy player, while playing as the Marines is a tense and exhilarating battle for survival.

Let me re-emphasize the tension element. You will scream over exhilarating dice-rolls, you will scream in terror when the ´Stealers get past your defenses, you will scream in agony when the timer is going down and you can´t secure your position. You will, above all, scream in terror and have your heart racing when your overwatching marine jamms his bolter as a 'stealer advances on you down a corridor. 

And it´s all glorious.

SH is the prime example of the drama and excitement proper ´trasher games can give, and it's the best game GW has ever released.

The only downsides to the game is that even for an "anniversary edition" the 3rd/4th edition is still missing some of the cool stuff from some 1st ed. expansions, such as the 0-blips, double corridors, etc. Still, for the quality of the components you are getting, I don't see how anyone can complain. You get some of the best miniatures ever released (and yes, they have to be assembled. Stop crying, this is how real minis work), glossy embossed cardstock that is double the thickness of your regular FFG stock and a finally decent (in the 4th ed. at least) scenario count.

That and of course, that it's produced by one of the most undeniably evil board gaming companies in the world.

I had played 2E before and really enjoyed it, but first plays can be a fluke sometimes. I got 4E and hoo boy it's just as good, with everything turned up to eleven. Great models and the thickest tiles and tokens you'll ever see.

Oh did I mention there's a fantastic 1 vs. 1 dungeon crawl in here as well? A little bit of Descent-esque move optimization but not too much, and arranging your dudes in the tight corridors is great. Lots of fun ideas here and one of the best games ever made.

Really, Space Hulk has by far the best optics and haptics I have seen in a board game so far. Also, as a hard core Ameritrasher with a faible for dark SF themes and the epic 40k setting in particular, and as a fan of the dungeon crawl genre, this was an instant auto buy for me.

I feel the timer is a bit too hard. As the Marine player, there is not time really to evaluate the tactical situation.

You have to take something in mind: The game is not balanced for both players, the genestealer player will have lot more chances to win in general, so if you want some kind of balance on it I recoment to play i twice, changing roles.

If you are ok with this you will have a great fun playing this game, many cinematic and tens moments with rules that are easier to learn that they seem and a very pretty components game.

Alright, where to begin. First off, I have no nostalgia going into this game, so I won't have any rose colored glasses for this. Second, the miniatures are amazing. Highly detailed, but require clippers and a file to make them playable. They don't require glue, but I recommend it anyways. The tiles and chits are crazy thick and there is a lot of them. Honestly, they feel like the mountain tiles in Survive.

While I've only played the first scenario, I'd like to explore this further. It's incredibly light (as in run and gun), but each component has rules to it. So a Marine carrying a sword and a shield has additional rules for that, or a Marine with a flame thrower has rules for that, etc. It's not a TON to keep track of, but it's more than I was expecting after the initial rules read through. I also worry that the genestealers may be a touch boring as they don't have nearly as much cool shit to do as the human player. It almost feels like they rely on flanking and catching the marines off guard, but don't really have any personality outside of slowing them down.

I'd like to try other scenarios and re-read the rules, but I worry this might be a bit mindless in nature. Not that that's a bad thing, but it might not be quite what I was expecting out of it.

I had to get this since everybody went ape shit over how awesome it was (big mistake). 
Space Hulk is way overrated in my opinion. It's expensive, it takes a couple of days to assemble and paint, it takes awhile to set up, and it's quite random. On the plus side it has great components and a cool, tense theme. It's just not very high on the list of games I want to play. In fact, it's not on the list at all. I much prefer playing games like this on the computer - fraction of the cost, no need to paint or set up, and doesn't take up a giant space in my games shelves.

OWN: 1ST EDITION + EXPANSIONS [SOME MISSING COMPONENTS!]
OWN: 3RD EDITION (20th Anniversary, 2009)
OWN: 4TH EDITION (Sep 2014) [SAME AS 3RD ED. + MINOR RULES/MISSION CHANGES + 4 NEW MISSIONS (=16 TOTAL) + SOME NEW CARDBOARD TOKENS]

Original comments for 3rd Edition...

Still the classic game I remember it to be, long overdue for a re-release. Great 2 player tactical battles, plays really quickly, easy to swap sides and compete for best outcome.

Rules are pretty much taken from 1st Edition but with a large number of small tweaks and simplifications. Also includes many selected parts of the 1st Edition expansions.

Components are great. Good decision to colour the models red/blue for marines and genestealers as this allows play straight from the box without painting. Cardboard components are unbelievably thick, although the plastic coating top-layer can peel back taking the surface image with it on some of the pointy edges (notably the entry arrows).

The streamlined rules combined with the improved components definitely put this a touch above the original.

RATING: 7
the only thing I don't like about the game are the miniatures. They feel very fragile, and they don't stand up well. For certain minis, it's hard to tell their facing precisely. Beyond that, this game does some interesting things. I like how the marine's movement is kind of clunky. I like how they can setup a defensive mode, so their positioning and facing is very very important. It was hard to get used to this movement system because I'm used to games like Descent 2nd edition, where you are zipping around the board. Here, especially because the aliens player gets no ranged attacks, every square of distance counts. Was it worth the high price tag? I'm not sure. The tiles are thick, and really high quality. The minis are really interesting looking. The game mechanics that are unique to this game are interesting, if not enough to thrill me. I'd say a reluctant yes if I had been able to get more plays out of it. When it came time to reduce, I needed fewer 2 player games and fewer dungeon crawls, so this game pretty much had to be sold or traded. Gun to my head I think I'd pick Claustrophobia over this every time.

Space Hulk is a great, great miniatures game. With very good production value in everything, pieces, miniatures, rulebooks and is very much worth your 120 bucks.. Some people may find this a little steep but this is my personal grail game.

To game play, it's a blast to play as the Blood Angels because of the tension of getting to the objective and staying alive. It might be a little boring to play as the genestealers but it's your job to put up the pressure on the marines. It's a lot of fun seeing the marines sweat buckets trying to stay alive.

Juego muy visual, las miniaturas son muy bonitas y la producción es de 10.
Como juego es un juego táctico donde el marine espacial sufre mas tensión que el genestealer (la sensación de agobio la transmite bien), ya que a pesar de que sus unidades son mas potentes, también son muy limitadas y tiene que posicionarlas y valorarlas adecuadamente si no quiere perder. Por otro lado el genestealer con mas unidades, se debe preocupar mas por valorar donde sacar/mover/atacar con sus unidades para desbordar a los marines, y ganar la partida.
La sensación general es buena, pero me da la sensación de que no tiene profundidad (quizá por el tipo de juego que es), se queda solo en lo que ves, todas las decisiones son: que camino coges, donde posicionar a las unidades, con que encaramiento y si disparas/atacas o no, le falta algo para que sea un juego de 10.

Voy jugando diferentes misiones y le veo temática al juego, son partidas con su historia, siguen un hilo argumental, no son misiones sueltas e inconexas. Subo 1/2 punto la nota por este motivo.

Mision I ---> 1 vez
Mision II ---> 2 veces
Mision IV ---> 1 vez

22-04-2014. Rated after 2 plays. I like Spacehulk a lot. Mini's are awesome and scenario's are interesting. Game seems to favor the gene-stealers quite severely.

Game is very simple, mechanically, but the scenario's and spawns make it challenging.

Did I say it looked nice? Only downside is that I cannot paint and I am bad in gluing the mini's even. Should buy this one pre-painted or give it to someone I trust to paint..

This game is really great. If you can get past the awfully-constructed rulebook and actually play it, it's a really great experience.

Truth is that its a pain to set up and tear down, but its a fantastic game that deserves your attention.

Went ahead and got a full, boxed release. Not the first copy of Space Hulk I've owned, but the first copy I've ever owned that was complete, in a box, and new to me. I'm happy with it :)

This game lives on nostalgia and fans of the theme. There are just so many better games out there today IMHO.

Beastly!  Game play is an 8, but production values drive it up another point.

If 2nd Ed was GW jumping the shark then 3rd/4th Ed marked a growing of the beard. Expansive, expensive and luxurious, and worth every penny of it's asking price. A physical tour de force from Games Workshop.

The game looks gorgeous, especially all laid out on the table. Good for a thematic game, but fairly simple overall. It's a beast to set up and tear down, unfortunately.

It lacks tray/foam inside, but you can buy it separately. That's the only flaw that game has for me. Would buy again!

All assembled and punched. Played it once so far. One Terminator and one Genestealer have been painted. I know, finish the damn thing already...

I rate this no less than what I've rated the previous versions. I still maintain that this is one of the best asymmetrical ability, 2-player games out there. Play it, swap sides, enjoy, repeat.

Reedición de un clásico de 1989. Uno de los "ameritrash" por excelencia, dónde un jugador lleva a una escuadra de marines espaciales y otro a unos alienígenas. Las batallas entre ambos grupos se llevan en diferentes mapas y en cada uno de ellos el objetivo cambia. Gran rejugabilidad pues el mapa es modular y a parte de tener un montón de misiones, puedes crearlas tú mismo.

Very, very nice models and cardboard tiles with great art, thick and glossy.
The game is a shooter game (dicefest) with some tactics by the men but non or less tactics by the alliens, the can only fight by close assault. Nothing for me :(

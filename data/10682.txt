{1 play} What an wonderful and odd experience playing this game was.  Because as we started out, we were all, "Huh?  Hmm...  this game's a 4."  But then things clicked into place and we were like, "Ooo... cool!  This game's an 8!"  And then it felt hopeless, like it was just all luck and I was all, "I can't win, this is dumb," and then one turn later, Winton goes, "Crap, I lose... why can't I draw the right cards!"  And by the end we were satisfied.  The reason my rating's not higher is a) little too much chaos for my liking, but that may be because b) it was a *major* learning game, our first game.  So I suspect my rating will go up, but not too up due to the chaos factor.

I love the idea of having to commit to several turns at once, without knowing what your opponent will do.  However, it does make the gameplay pretty chaotic.  There is also alot of luck of the draw in this game.  It would be nice if the island tiles were bigger; you sometimes have to cover some tokens up to fit others on.  A bigger problem is that all the background tiles are blue, and one of the player's pieces are also blue and do not stand out at all.

Components: Wonderful island tiles, nice warrior tiles, and good illustrations on the cards.

Experience: I'm not sure where Atlas or Zeus come into this, but Poseidon sure has a lot of action, swallowing up one island per turn. This game features some interesting hop-scotching from island to island, either to attack other warriors or to flee tidal disaster. There is an interesting mix of cards in the deck that can change the power dynamics drastically from turn to turn. I like that the number of islands reduces, but I did find I had fewer decisions as my forces dwindled.

I love the two player games, and this one is a quick learn with a bucket of strategy and luck. Oddly enough, when my better half and I play this, we have a 50-50 win split, which is rare. There are no real loopholes to take advantage of, the game is very stable, but still unpredictable.

2 plays:  umm, not too impressed so far.  Per the rules I didn't understand combat or the value of Prayer, Crabs, and Weakness cards (I do after reading here).  The round tokens never came into play either time as well.  In both games, we eliminated each other much faster than tiles being removed by Poseiden.  After the games concluded, wasn't left with any strong or negative impressions, just rather ho-hum.  Hence the 5 rating

Beautiful presentation and one of the most thematic Euro games I own.  The rules are fairly simple and quick to teach, even with the variety of action cards.  Note that this is [b]not[/b] Atlas [b]VERSUS[/b] Zeus.  The two players control identical groups of Atlanteans.  There are some neat and clever mechanics, but the overall game is fairly chaotic.  But then again, we [i]are[/i] talking about a tempermental deity sinking islands, after all.

RATING: 7
I am surprised more people haven't tried this game.  This is a fun game about scrambling from island to island as Atlantis sinks into the sea.  Players play action cards for moving their players, hindering other players, or changing which island sinks.  What's interesting is deciding the order of the actions as well as which ones to take.  At the end of each round, one island sinks along with everybody on it, and the board gets smaller. The artwork and quality of the components is really nice.  The box cover art is a little ugly, but don't let that dissuade you.

A couple more plays have me really enjoying this. It plays fast and allows for some clever play.  Some bluff, some tactical decisions, a lot of fun for a small light game.  The mechanism where one player plays their cards in the spots first is really interesting.  If you want to go twice in a row you must let your opponent go first - If you want to go twice in a row and not allow them to do the same, you must let them go first and last!  Very cool.

I traded for a copy of this game and it took about 18 months before it made it to my gaming table.  a reading of the rules left me unconvinced, but when we played I found that the game is actually a good bit deeper than it first appears.  Quick playing with the opportunity for feints and threats.

RATING: 5
Atlas & Zeus is a brutal game. By this I mean that things can turn very bad, very quickly for one of the players. Which happens quite often since it's fairly hard to accurately predict what the other player will do: luck plays too big of a role. We've had games that were pretty much over after only 2 or 3 rounds. 

Note to newbies on their first play: avoid grouping your men together on an island early in the game.

Untested. Per houjix's "Couples Games" list: "I really think this game has potential. There's a lot of neat stuff in it that you don't normally see in a two-player.

Simple, clever, quick, fun--for 2 players. Purchased in April of 2008. My 10-year-old son (2009) immediately "got" the humor and liked the game a lot. Among the easiest games I've ever taught, as most of the necessary info is right on the cards (plus one page of the rule book has fuller descriptions). Set it up and start flipping the cards. A mixture of luck-of-the-draw and strategy in movement as one by one, each of 16 islands sinks with whomever is on them Ultimately, it's the last man standing, with death looming by such varied means as crabs, harpoons, volcanic eruptions, and tidal waves, among others. What's not to like? My 10-year-old son (April 2009) Trevor rates this an 8.5.

RATING: 7
A nice 30 minute game of trying to save your pieces whilst doing off with your opponents, whilst the circle of tiles they reside on disappear one by one each turn, bringing the end ever closer. Last one with pieces surviving wins. The play is all in the cards which variously allow you to move your pieces around, attack, protect, draw more cards, manipulate which tile disappears, etc. You choose 3 cards to play this turn from a hand of 6, and place them in action order, one in either slot 1 or 2, the next in slot 3 or 4, and the last in slot 5 or 6. The opponent places in the remainder, and then they're revealed and actioned 1 by 1. There are hard decisions here ... go first, go last, play 2 cards together, can I get a useful move/attack combination going, should I play a cancel to remove an opponent's card? Which makes the game interesting each turn, but still relatively fast to play. Enjoyable.

My brother and I really liked this game after one playing.  It has a fair amount of chaos (ok alot), but that is what makes it fun.  You know there are only so many of each card so planning based on what "could" happen is what makes this game fun.  We really enjoyed it and he stated that he wants to play it again.  Watch the net!

RATING: 7
Fun and fast. It's almost a Wargame but in an Euro format. Cleverly reducing playing area, initiative mat options, and some rock-paper-scissors card relationships yield opportunities for strategy and 3-card tactics. Luck is significant but that helps replayability and maintains the pace of the game. Any intial confusion is dispelled before the first run through is completed. Then it's just plain light fun.

Boy, was I surprised when I played this the first time. It looks ugly as a troll baby but the game hidden in this gem is delightful, very simple but lots of tactical subtleties and also backstabbing, a bit of randomness and reading your opponent like a book, that is, you should at least try. The artwork on the tiles is much better than the artwork on the box which is horrid, I do not know what went wrong there. The cards are a bit smallish and not nice to handle but it is a transportable 2-player game after all, so I can see why they went for that. A great 2-player game with a nice pace and which also becomes increasingly more complex as you play, due to the scarcity of survivors and the resulting vulnerability of each player.

A very good 2-player game !

Good, unusual two player game in which you try to have the rising sea level swallow islands with rival citizens on them, rather than your own. The way actions are played adds a bit more strategy - there are six action slots, and each player can only play one action to each *pair* of slots, meaning that if you want to take two consecutive actions you have to sacrifice first priority in the sequence. 

Also, has people turning into crabs and turtles. How can you go wrong?

Normally I don't play many two player Euros; Most of them seem rather tit for tat or mathy, but this game isn't just a back and forth but rather some cool out-thinking, planning and positioning.  Neat theme driven game, that puts it easily at the top of the Descartes two player line.

Its a real shame that the title and the cover do nothing to sell this game.  The art is beautiful inside, yet they make the cover so cartoony.  I don't get it...

Picked up for £2 with Tony & Tino.

I really like the idea of this game - the islands gradually get wiped out, and you're fighting it out for survival and supremacy of the remaining islands, by moving your troops, using cards to influence actions - strengthen your side, destroy the other side etc. - I thought it played OK, and had a bit of balance between strategy and luck - but it didn't really grab me. I reckon I could be convinced to play again, but...

Wife, however, HATED it - from the theme, to the cards (which didn't run in her favour!), to the "stupid little pictures", to the types of cards ("What the hell is that turtle supposed to be?") etc. etc... - not a happy pixie! (cf Toni & Tino)

Thinking we might not be playing this again in a hurry!

A tense little 2 player game that is nicely vindictive and plays in very little time.

Update: Played again after a gap of about 16 months. What a good game this is. Yes, it's a little dependant on the draw of cards, but it's so fast and so much fun, I don't care. The tiles and characters themselves are also really nicely drawn; the box art (which bizarely convinced a friend to buy it) is totally misleading as to the type of game it is and puts most people off.

Decent game that features an interesting allocation of cards to determine their played order.  Everything is small here - the components, the integration of theme and the desire to play it again.

Reasonable two player game if you can accept the fact that there is a lot of luck involved. But then, luck is just as big a factor in "Kahuna" and even more so in "Lost Cities".

RATING: 6
At heart a eurogame of managing resources and pushing cubes around but the theme is so wonderfully integrated that it feels an injustice to describe it as such. The only thing stopping me rating it higher is that it may be a little too chaotic for my liking as the cards can change around very quickly by the time it gets to your turn thereby making forward planning very difficult

After Pablo gets full marks for presenting us small gamers with a subject which is raw and realistic: drug trafficking. As heads of Colombian drugs cartels who sprung up after the death of the éminence grise of drugs, Pablo Escobar, you try to make as much money from the stuff as possible. Assassination, buying votes, bribing the DEA: it's all there. This is not a game you play with Son or Daughter the Younger. 

The few times I found myself sitting behind the indy board and cards, I was not sure what to make of it. What I didn't like about it all was the large influence of randomness on the entire proceedings. Smuggling drugs into the US relies on a fair bit of luck: if you have said luck you make an extremely unheard-of amount of money with which you dominate the rest of the game for at least a while. If you don't have luck, then you are forced to... well, stay small and grab a few crumbs of coke which fell off the truckloads sent by the rich players. Also, there is a fair bit of rules to go through for such a simple idea, so I'm under the impression that After Pablo is not really a [i]game[/i] but more a [i]simulation[/i] (or something in between). Perhaps there is some metagaming involved, I haven't figured that one out yet.

[b]Update[/b] After finally completing a game with the full rules, hopefully not making too many mistakes, I came to the conclusion that the game itself is indeed more simulation than game. It is curious to see that becoming leader in Colombia and Mexico might have a bigger impact on your final score than drug trafficking; at the same time you need those drug sales to have some cash to actually do something. The annoying uncertainty in smuggling and selling can be mitigated to some extent by DEA actions (which really boil down to lowering the payout of some of your drugs deals, so you don't usually want to have more than a few cubes there to begin with), but it all feels so... constructed. Cards feel hopelessly overburdened in their abilities, and due to their rotation speed it becomes nearly impossible to seriously plan for anything save war and cocaine purchases. The entire game is one of just throwing money or cards at the DEA, hope that you have some nice other abilities on your cards, and hope for the best, really. It is nice to have finally completed a game, but After Pablo is not something I need to play again anytime soon.

Very good game by a small publisher. 
Basically a euro with lots of familiar mechanisms thrown in. But it all works very well. The cards are the heart of this game and used in - for me - novel way. What's also great: theme and mechanisms fit very well.  
Production values are pretty good for à small publisher. My only complaint is about the boards, that don't unfold well. 

A labour of love, that turns out to be a very good game. higly recommended.

I don't understand the hating on this game based on the theme. BGG has a "Mafia" category of no less than 220 games as of the time of this writing, several of which are ranked higher than After Pablo and most with many more owners. 

Two plays with 3 players. Great game, with such a unique theme. Definitely mature content, but the game is too complex for youngsters anyway. There's a lot going on here for the first play, but it all combines very well to make for a very interesting (and fun!) game. 

I play with this rule change from the designer himself:
"Definitely try stuff out if you like. I kind of like the way those sit. One thing that did bother me score-wise was giving 5 points [b]for a Perfect 5 Crossing[/b]. The entire playtesting time [b]a player would only earn 4 points[/b]. I changed it in the end to 5 because I was afraid 4 points would confuse all the new players (That a Perfect 5 Crossing gives you 4 Command Points seemed counter-intuitive) 5 crossing giving 5 rhymed more BUT I think it's slightly too powerful, and I believe it takes a player's eyes off of Mexico's strategic strength." --Nate Hayden (designer)

If I reprint the game I will do 4 Command for crossing instead of 5 now that people are familiar with the game."
--------------------

Will definitely be on the lookout for future games by this designer. 

Also, I just added the film "Bring Me The Head of Afredo Garcia" to my Neftlix queue. :)

Rated after 1 play @ 4 players.

Sits somewhere between an influence control game and a pick up and deliver for me. The whole premise is moving cocaine into the US to sell and the player with the highest influence wins. Players can also choose to spend their influence to control Mexico or Columbia, which will cause other players to pay them for coke or protection. The back of the henchmen cards are randomly seeded with success or failure so you won't know until you try to recruit whether or not you'll get busted.

The mechanisms of the game were very interesting to me. I did enjoy how the designer chose to implement RNG on the bust/no bust action (backs of the henchmen cards). The theme was a big turn off for me. Moving drugs and the violence associated with it isn't something I'd like to participate in. Glad I played it but don't need to play it again.


[1 Nov 2017] - 7 (2 plays)
Despite saying I didn't like the theme, I did have a desire to play this again and suggested it for a local weekend meetup. There is a lot of things going on in the game to keep track of. Figuring out the best way to make an engine to generate money is complex but with money you have the ability to defend yourself as president of Mexico and earn points.

In the second game, I was seeded as the third player. The first player jumped into Columbia to make money off the cocaine being bought and the second player decided to buy cards into their hand. Seeing two good options gone, I loaded up on gangs in Colombia and Mexico to wage war for the presidency of each. In the second round, I waged a blood battle for both but ended up so weak I was toppled by the fourth player. This set me back on cash and options for a good chunk of the game. About mid game I had to take a number of loans only to concede and buy cocaine from other players instead of getting a free supply. I ended up losing the game bad.

As much as attacking other players seems encouraged, I now suspect the threat of war could be more powerful to keep someone confined to an area of the board. It's also a game of forced cooperation among the players despite competing but this is not necessarily advertised. Not a game that I want to play soon but one I'd be willing to try out again.

@Sara

Theme is very well integrated. Acquiring cards, kartel-members (partly by buying partly through auctioning is giving a lot of interested choices and requires handmanagement). To choose from the actions available to players each round was tough. Expanding the kartel or getting influence in the government of Mexico and/or Colombia and/or hire assassins (1)...buying cocaine (2) or initiate a kartel-war (3)...or is this the ideal moment to start smuggling your stash of cocaine across the border into the USA (4) and finally sell it through (un)reliable dealers for cash. Oh and don't forget about your friends of the D.E.A. Ah well sometimes you just kind of bribe them :)
Game design looks nice. Quality of first production leaves a lot of room for improvement.
Nevertheless I think this is a very nice game with a lot of decisions and interaction!

February 22nd 2011:
After 5 plays I'm still very much impressed with this game. There is more than one strategy that can lead to victory. This time I didn't smuggle at all. Because of  the snitch that forced me to smuggle the perfect 6 instead of 5 I shift my focus towards influence and wars. Worked quite well. Not enough but I explored a new dimension in the game. Next time I will do even better again! 
In short: Nice interaction and the theme triggers a lot of funny jokes during play.
I've upgrade my score to 9.

May 1st 2012. Another epic game. I missed out on a few opportunities to capitalise on others. Also at the end I forgot that I did not have the extra action to collect more points...next time!

May 10 2016. Another play (13 already).
Such a disaster for all of us. Wars everywhere and my final score was low because of too many men of my cartel in prison. Robert and I only had 2 weakness chips. Anton and game winner Maurits had 3 each. Maurits won on the tiebreaker because he had no cartel guys in jail.

After Pablo doesn't have the "fun factor" of San Quentin but the evolution from Nate Hayden's first design is nothing less than amazing.  

After Pablo has a lot of moving parts but all come together to make a very thematic, and coherent game.  I would liken this design to early Martin Wallace (my favorite Wallace period) where the narrative is the drive of the design.  However unlike Wallace I find Hayden has not gotten overwrought with tick-tacky minutia.  Hayden's design, although seemingly designing for the theme, keeps the play clean and moving at good pace.

So is Pablo fun?  Absolutely.  It doesn't possess the out-and-out laughs of San Quentin, but it still gets people into character and provides plenty of great tension.  

After Pablo is a brilliant game design that provides plenty of strategic and tactical play with the right amount of chaos, and push your luck to keep each game fresh.

This game is great and brutal. 

After playing this game with the same opponents a few times, our games have gotten much meaner. I won the last game making only one shipment. Just great stuff. Everything in this game feels vicious and you're forced to play your timing right. In fact I would say that its entirely a game of timing your moves relative to the other players, and thats why I love it.

Rating based on 4 players.

This game is a bit packed with different mechanisms: push-your-luck, set-collection, area-control, etc., but the rules do make thematic sense. At the beginning I was a bit wary as this was a rather rules-heavy game for my usual tastes... but as I got to grips with all what was possible, it got fun! This is not a game to take too seriously--in fact, if one took it too seriously the drug-cartel theme might not work too well! Luck of the draw does play a large factor, and you will never have complete control of your own destiny. However, you must also create your own luck: planning ahead is crucial, you must have the resources ready to pounce on opportunities whenever they arise, and have no mercy taking out the competition (stay away, carebears!).

A lot of mechanisms put together that work pretty well.  Nice independent effort, even if the theme a bit distasteful.  Quite a cynical look at the whole drug trade.

Already a big fan of SQK, and this looked similar on first look; very euroish in mechanics but with a criminal theme. But while SQK involved all players all the time, this game is more about YOU getting YOUR stuff across the border, and the other players are more annoyances rather than being constant enemies, and I liked that. Well, they will be a constant enemy if you attempt to control Colombia (to have them pay you for their cocaine) or Mexico (VP and initiative), and you want that of course. The game is large in that it lets you develop various strategies, and it's really a game that takes more than one time to fully grasp. I'm longing for the next time I get to play it.

RATING: 7
A euro style game set around narcotics importation to the United States. How's that for a theme? Beats the pants of yet another game set around trade in the renaissance.

The game is quite interesting and offers a variety of challenges for the players but the rules were a bit unclear on some key points (i.e. can one declare a 'war' against a person when they do not have a presence in an area?) and some of the mechanics did not quite fit with the theme such as killed henchmen are returned to a players pool of cubes while imprisoned one languish their way through the justice system. Wouldn't a cartel just replace them the same way they'd replace their fallen colleagues?

That aside, it's a fun and very different game - the art really works for the game too.

Another one I'd probably not buy, but would have little hesitation in playing again

Fantastic theme. Although I am sure when this is getting republished (if !) then the theme will probably be changed into something more family friendly. There are many paths to victory and the game is very intuitively designed despite its complexity which is a sign of a great game design.

EDIT: Played it twice now and I do have a sneak suspicion that there might be a bit of a runaway leader problem here. Maybe it were only my plays that turned out that way but I will have to look out for that.

This is one rock solid game with a theme that brings some cocaine into the medieval addicted board game community.
F**k it, me and my Bronco gonna hit the scene in Las Vegas with some fine Colombian snow. But be aware of those nasty snitches, they come cheap but can do quite a damage if you don't have some hitmen in your ranks.

Nate is done a great job designing a game that has everything from area control, card management, action points, screwing opponets and those little reckless gambling opportunities you need to do to feel the heat of the border crossing!

The theme happens to be fun and that's all. Making a serious game around such a theme as being the best drug dealer in town it's not recomendable as it may fall in the forced laugh field. I'm not against making games based on these kinds of themes but I don't really find any special pleasure playing them.

Area majority cards and auction.

The game has a lot of things I dislike: playing negative; using cards to destroy the rules; too much chaos.

RATING: 7.5
An odd duck of a eurogame themed on the struggle for control of the Colombian drug trade in the wake of the death of Pablo Escobar and the collapse of the Medellin Cartel. Players each control a cartel and earn points by transporting cocaine into the United States, exerting influence over Colombia and Mexico and, Greed Inc.-style, purchasing luxuries with the proceeds.

It's hard to describe, but if pressed I suppose I would call it an area majority/economic game with elements of hand management and set collection. The trick is that everything costs money, but making money requires smuggling drugs across the border and selling them; as in real life, this is fraught with risk. If you don't match a transport symbol for each brick of cocaine, it might be confiscated and your mule arrested. If you don't sell each safely-smuggled brick through a trusted distributor, it might be confiscated and your man arrested. Where this gets interesting is the risk mitigation (for example: expending influence with the DEA can avoid arrests in some case) and the obverse, deliberate interference with other players. If a player is set up to safely sell their cocaine at enormous profit, removing their trusted distributors can turn a windfall profit into a stack of arrests.

All this, of course, is against the backdrop of possible gang warfare (money can build influence but guns can take it away) and ongoing government interference: it's nice to control the trade in Mexico or Colombia, but each leader becomes a target of the DEA and their agents may be arrested.

After Pablo is highly interactive for a euro, with unusual but themtically-justified mechanisms creating interesting texture. Players get very few turns and scoring opportunities are sparse, so the incentive to take risks, rather than spend more time on mitigation, is high. The smuggling/selling of drugs, which provides far more money and points than any other action, takes a full two turns (one to smuggle, one to sell), during which that player can do very little to act elsewhere and is open to interference from others. The key to effective play is probably to use the opportunities for extra actions, allowing (for example) purchasing the transport capacity necessary to smuggle and then immediately exploiting it with a bonus turn.

In practice, the luck of the draw can be frustrating, especially when it works in someone else's favour. Risk mitigation is expensive and a lucky player might do better than one who plays it safe. The least satisfying aspect is actually the "War" action, which is effectively an open, all-pay once-around auction, starting with the attacker. At the extremes, this creates odd situations where an attacker will commit heavily and the defender... will do nothing. They would lose everything anyway, so it's better to not defend and keep the army around for another day -- quite likely in a turn or two, the attacker having just wasted their troops for no reason and now open for reprisals. The result is more a deterrent than anything else: you need to be strong enough that an attacker will fear reprisals and not crush you for points, cheap influence and simple amusement. Conflict fans may be disappointed: at heart, the war serves the same sort of function as in Through the Ages -- a threat to balance against economic efficiency.

I adore highly interactive games that are sensitive to player actions (e.g. economic games like Container and The Great Zimbabwe), but I am not entirely convinced by this one. The luck factor is significant enough to either distort the outcome or reduce play to plodding buildup of DEA influence. It seems likely that good play requires "self-balancing" approaches (i.e. pick on the leader) that will make it very fragile. I am interested in varying the war rules, e.g. to a blind bid.

If I'm not entirely convinced, at least I can say that I am more excited and interested than about any game in some time.

This is a really simple game to actually learn/play in part because it is really well written and the board is well designed (if fugly).

Lots of options, that are all difficult to choose between, but a great little game. Well worth tracking down if you can!

To me, it plays better with 3 than with 4.

Finally got this to the table.  If you like the card idea in Glory to Rome, you may like this as well.  Seems like you are always two steps behind with lots of ways to win and some randomness that can cause your whole plan to be busted.  Also balancing out your resources and working to make money to get control and then get points.  The reason for the 8 is because the art is a bit busy for me and the boards could have been made a bit better but gameplay is solid IMO.

RATING: 2.5
First Impression:
A highly thematic euro with a mature theme.

The game seems solid and there is tons of interaction. The theme is the game, but doesn't detract from the gameplay. After Pablo is also tight, in the way I usually like, forcing players to make tough decisions.

On the downside, it outstays its welcome by an hour or more (for me) plus it doesn't flow well. You practically cycle through  a "build"/produce/export/sell process, but although it works, it takes too looong to pull it. You play 15 rounds and the sense of accomplishment is like you only played two. There is also a bash the leader possibility but that is really minor. 

Now, I'd probably rate this game with an initial 5,5 but for its theme. I admit I enjoy games where players are not exactly playing angels (spies in resistance, commanders in a war etc) but somehow selling drugs hits a very bad nerve. And this game implements it so well that playing it feels awful indeed.

Final Note: Even though I dislike playing this game due to its (for me) awful theme, it still stands as a testament that our hobby is still mostly free of political correctness and that makes me happy.

RATING: 9
Very nice little game that plays fast and clean. Interesting choices, nothing really hard in those decisions but fun anyway. I like the pressure of the game as it comes to an end much faster than you expect.

UPDATE: Played a few more times and suspect that the rating may climb...especially now that we've got some rule clarifications from the designer. 

UPDATE: One more play and yeah it's a solid 9 now. 

As a 2 player game this one falls short. You need multiple players to generate the real feel for the game and ideally 4. With 3 there sometimes ends up being the war of the 2 that allows the 3rd non-participant player to run away with the game. Not saying this always happens it just depends on the dynamics of the 2 involved. If one feels the need for vengeance over victory it can get that way.

A rock solid game.  The components are a bit subpar, which prevents a slightly higher ranking.

There is some luck in card draws and chaos in a handful of snitch cards and DEA manuevers, but it fits the theme, tension, and weight of the game.  This is ok with me, but might turn off some of those that can't stand this in a game.

The game deserves the reviews it is getting.

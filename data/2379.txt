[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Guesstures is a fun little party game that's nothing more than acting out for people to guess. It's a fine party game, but it's a party game and I'd rather play a light filler 9 out of 10 days of the week. 

Other games that scratch the same itch more successfully are [thing=191894][/thing] (use transparent plastic cards to act out, instead of yourself) and [thing=84609][/thing] (reverse Guesstures, many people act for one person to guess).

good game to play with in larger groups (i would say a minium of 6 players). if you are into partaking in adult beverages can be even more fun, as long as responsible drinking practices are practiced ;) this is a game i can play once or twice a month but that is about my limit. if you are a wallflower then this prob isn't for you.

PARTY

A thrift store find.

In storage. We have an electronic version of this, so no need to have this one take up valuable shelf space for more games!

Recommended with 5-12 players (best 6, 8, 10, or 12 players). 10 mins.

got this as a 2-pack with scattergories.  i enjoyed playing it the first time out, but i could see it getting old pretty quick.  the game is fairly static.  maybe it just feels that way because we were only playing with 4, but even with big groups i can't see wanting to pull this one out very often.  the big problem i have is with the cards: many are misscored or impossible, and there just aren't very many of them in the box.

RATING: 6
We played this with 12 players at a party and it was a pretty huge hit.  You certainly need to play this with a group who doesn't mind acting out and being a bit extroverted.  The extremely short time limit and mostly one word answers makes things quite intriguing, and there is a fair bit of strategy involved as in placement of the cards, how many points to shoot for, when to give up, etc.  The only issue we hit was a player not being quick enough to take the cards out after we guessed the answers.  Still, definitely a fun party game, but I wouldn't play it with any less than 8 people.

Excellent game. Used it for dates and it turns any boring date into a fun one. Replayability dwindles down after a while because you start to remember previous gestures of played games in the past. But still, a great ice-breaker for dates, a lot of fun to play with strangers and love the look on the faces of girls when I tell we're going to play a game called 'Show It'.

It's "Pictionary Charades." Like Pictionary, it seems to pick one particular skill which varies in ability in different people and tries to craft a whole game around only the exercise of that skill. It might be fun as a party game for a group at about the same level of skill in thinking on your feet with regard to vocabulary. I'm guessing it's not as much fun for those individuals with less of that skill and potentially a little awkward for groups mixed in that skill (as most are).

Components: Functional cards, and a unique card-holding mechanism. My box is oversized, but it looks like they've corrected that in recent editions.

Experience: This game requires a lot of energy to play, but speed charades is fun to watch, even for the non-active team, and the active player's ability to choose and order their words adds nice flexibility and risk. Like many party games, though (and unlike Time's Up), there is no continuity to the game; we merely play for a predetermined number of turns, and the turns really have nothing to do with each other.

I enjoy party games too. This one can be a real hit with a party game crowd. Even had tons of fun playing with non-native English speakers - that's saying a lot.

I prefer it to having to think up our own words in charades and there's a nice little aspect of choosing the words you need to act out and trying to deciding whether you're going to risk doing a hard one for more points or an easy one for less.

A failure on many levels--mostly due to the unadjustable timer.  Either ours was on speed, or the game is ridiculously difficult for the family/party game it's supposed to be.

RATING: 5
This is a light "party" game.  It is always fun to see the other players try to act out their cards, but it may be difficult to do so yourself!  Each turn, a player draws 4 cards, decides which portion of the card (top or bottom) he/she would like to do (each section is worth different points, usually 1 for the top and 3 for the bottom (blue cards), or 2 for the top and 4 for the bottom (red cards).  The player then places the cards in the order he/she wishes, on top of the director's board, then starts the timer.  If your team is not fast enough to call out the proper word, the card drops into the device and you can't score points for it.  On the other hand, if the word is guessed, then the player needs to remove the card ASAP, before it drops, else no points are scored.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun party game that's basically charades.  The game timer ensures that the acting doesn't last too long and players can decide to act out easier items for fewer points or risk a big score with harder items.  Some of the "hard" items seem a bit too easy.  If you have a hard time of letting go and making a fool out of yourself, this game will not be your cup of tea.

Game is in very good condition. Box has very little shelf rubbing. Did not have the crayon with it, but that was easily fixed. Tried counting the cards, but got distracted. No. I was bored. They fill the box up with about a quarter inch space left. I'll get a kid to do it for punishment someday.

RATING: 8
The ideal "adult genre" party game. Not exactly a "board game", but it definitely delivers the fun in truckloads if there are a large group of non-gamers. I used to host party game nights, and this was a staple, alongside Taboo, Pictionary, and Channel Surfing. Some of the charade moves we made were memorable. For example, how would you describe "triplets"? 1) Make a motion with your hand to indicate a bulging tummy to indicate that you're pregnant. 2) Make a single downward slashing motion with both hands to simulate childbirth. 3) Hold up three fingers.

The timer mechanism that eats up the word cards is brilliant and hysterical to watch as each player frantically acts out words on their four cards. They must arrange the cards in order of difficulty before starting, since the timer will "eat" the card if you don't get the word and pull it on time.

I owned both the 1st and 2nd editions. The 2nd edition is more challenging (read: harder) but also more versatile in scoring. I considered the the best party game in my college years, which is largely a reflection on my gaming groups at the time.

This variant of charades uses a convoluted timing device that, while brand new (and is meant to hide clues as time elapses), was barely functional; it functions in fits and starts. Thus, the game is transformed into an exercise of: "Is the timer working, now? It is? Hurry up before we run out of--[i]bzzz[/i]--time. Oh, never mind." Unfortunately, this game would be better (if you like charades, that is) without the poorly manufactured timer, which only made the playing of this more of an exercise in frustration than a fun game.

I like Charades, and this is to Charades as Wits & Wagers is to Trivial Pursuit--streamlined and elegant.  The only reason I still rate Charades higher is that we play team Charades where each team creates the other teams targets, which makes for a lot of fun.  But this is great when you don't have time for all that prep work and don't want to add up minutes and seconds accumulated for each team.  Superb game.

It is just charades with pre-made cards, but the unique mechanism of having the 4 words you are trying to pantomime drop out of view one-at-a-time surely bumpb this one up a notch or two. I wouldn't ever get rid of the game since there is no need to really explain the rules to anyone and it is more fun (and faster) than regular charades.

Charades with somewhat of a twist, as you have the ability to guess four different things before the timer expires, with more points for increasing difficulty.  There are far better party games out there.  Some of my family members really enjoy this one and it is lively.  Charades just isn't my thing.  Cool timer though.

For those who don't have the patience to sit through a slow-moving game of charades, here is the perfect solution.  Fast, furious, funny, frustrating, and other "f" adjectives could be used to describe this game.  It's not the first party game I would pull out at a group gathering, but when it does make at appearance, it provides a pretty good excuse to act a little bit crazy (for those who actually need an excuse).

Guesstures is better than charades.  Of course, that is like saying tearing your MCL is better than tearing your ACL.  In reality, you would hope never to have to make the choice.  I will concede that in the right group, Guesstures can be a little bit of fun.  The card-eating timer adds quite a bit of tension, and having your choice of words to put in difficulty order lets you tweak the game to your strengths.  Not one I would choose to play, but I wouldn't turn it down, either.

With simpler words and rules than traditional charades, this is a fast-paced game that is fun for the whole family.

That is my only disappointment, the amount of cards included and the subjects they contain keep this game entertaining round after round.

Es el típico juego de "las películas". Con gestos tienes que lograr que tu equipo sepa qué defines (muchos sustantivos y verbos), dividido en fácil y difícil. 

El puntillo del juego está en la claqueta. Tienes 45 segundos para hacer 4 tarjetas. La claqueta, pasados x segundos se van tragando las tarjetas si no las has retirado antes y eso lo hace más divertido. La mayoría de las tarjetas son muy fáciles: en la primera partida, la mayoría de las veces acertábamos 3 o las 4 tarjetas.

Está bien para echarle unos meneos después de una cena con amigos no jugones a los que no les importe hacer el tonto.

Crazy game that will get everyone's limbs flapping about wildly. With a fun, energetic crowd, this game is fun.

The time the game gives the performer per card is way too little.

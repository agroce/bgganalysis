Chaotic game that is a hit with 4-7 year old kids.

Nothing special, but it often gives a chuckle, and that's enough for such a short game.

Same as rumble in the house but has the added mechanic of the treasure that could be taken out to score max points.  But other than that it doesn't add anything to the game so I will just hold on to my copy of Rumble in the House

A bluffing game with the fun twist that you can pretend to be anyone and move any character.  Try to escape with the treasure or just kill off everybody else!  Trying to achieve victory for your character means keeping everyone guessing as to your identity.  Every dungeon can be a little different thanks to making your own layout, but I think the layouts could use maybe just a LITTLE more variance.

RATING: 6
It's good for what it is, a very light bluffing & deduction game that can be played by virtually everyone. Sweet spot probably with 4 players, as it's nice to have a few neutrals around and not having too many players go before it's your turn again. Will never be the highlight of a gaming night, but can be a nice bridge between two major ones.

Components: ok for the game

Length: 20 to 30 mins
Opinion: a kind of Viva el Rey but with a dungeon theme, you have 2 secret characters and have to earn points for the best one, and the best one is the one surviving in the dungeon or going out with the treasure. For getting that you just move one character or kill one. It is fun with the correct group and really quick to play (less than 30 mins and you have to play 3 rounds)

Small, quick and enjoyable starter game in which you eliminate other pieces through contact, hoping to have the score marker for the one left standing -- basically it's the same as Rumble In The House, but with the added option of a treasure that can make someone the automatic first place if they get it to the exit in time. Cute collection of bizarre figures. VERY easy to pick up. Fun for all ages!

BIG PLUS: speed to teach and play, level of fun for a starter game
MINUS: sometimes plays too quickly, added mechanic doesn't impact the game all that much

Rumble in the Dungeon is so light it could nearly fly off the table.  However, if players are prepared for the lightness of the game, they're more than likely going to have a fun time.  We sure did.

There doesn't really seem to be a lot of a game at least with six players, but at least it plays quickly. With lesser amount of players bluffing and outguessing might play a role and make it more interesting as every kill doesn't necessarily mean that somebody loses in comparison to everybody else.

I recognize the scores on this aren't so great, but I have had so much fun playing this and I have probably played it 15 times with multiple sets of friends.

Don't look at this game like it some sort of ground breaking uber game of strategy.  Thing of it as a fun social game that you can play with your friends.  There is nothing better than hearing people say "God save LemonJello" or "Legolas must die"  I only say that because that is how people get during this.  You have two guys you really want to win.  Your only actions in the game are move(Possibly with the treasure) or attack.  My friends tend to find favorites and want them to win even if they aren't one of their characters.  Son is it a brain burner NO, is it casual fun DEFINITELY.

Man, I really don't want to play this stupid 'game' again.
Actually, I don't see it as a game, but as an activity.

Just like 'the original' Rumble in the house it's basically 90% luck and 10% bluff.

The only positive thing is the cartoony artwork.

To be honest, I don’t think that Rumble in the Dungeon will appeal to everyone. I would say that there is a particular audience that will love this game and that is families. It is simple to play, the are is fun, there is loads of hidden action. You get to be sneaky and underhand. You get to give other players the smack down. There is an element of deduction as you try and figure out who has which characters. There lots of opportunity for families to have a good laugh together.

There is no deep strategy here but enough strategy in terms of trying to deduce which characters are worth going to prevent the other players from scoring or at least knocking them down the pecking order. Gamers can have a good laugh with the right crowd and if they have banter and trash talk. this is not a game for those who have to focus on winning as the main reason to play. This is a game that is all about the social interaction, silliness of the setting and art and should be fun at that level.

As I said, though. I think that the best audience will be families with youngsters. Fun, fast playing, simple, almost no down time. A good laugh. A fun game for Family Night!

This and Rumble in the House both see the table a lot with my after school board gamers. The dungeon is certainly the preferred location and I think the kids like the artwork on the tiles better. Best played with the teacher... because they can throw me out.

Petit jeu sympathique, pas vraiment de stratégie, il faut sauver son monstre et créer des bagarres entre les autres. Drôle à plusieurs ou pour jouer en camping, mais les parties ne s'enchainent pas malgré la durée du jeu

Just enough bluffing and subtle things you can do to make this a functioning game. 

Turns out, it's great fun, with wonderful artwork, and is a perfect end of night game. The treasure adds a tiny little wrinkle of extra strategy.

Update: The game works better with 3 or 4 than the full 6 as it's less chaotic and so you have more chance to position your pieces where you want them. It's still good with the full compliment, just better with fewer.

RATING: 6.5
Even with the addition of the treasure, you can explain the rules for this game in under 1 minute and play in about 15min once everyone has played a handful of times. Makes an excellent intro game. My group has nicknamed all the characters and can't not make ridiculous stories every game, good for comic violence laughs.

Very light, quick playing game that can actually be quite a bit of fun.  There's not much to it ... move a monster to another tile or kill a monster from a tile containing two or more monsters. The last monster standing or the first out the door with the treasure is the winner. You're hoping / trying to make sure the winner is one of the two monster tokens you've secretly been dealt.  Very easy filler.

Rumble in the Dungeon looks great. The dungeon tiles and card board stand-ups are both attractive, and funny. While I am much happier having the Dungeon version of the game than the Rumble in the House version, I may end up with both, allowing for large combined games.

I love bluffing, and hidden identity games, and this one delivers! There are very few games that packs so much into such a tiny package, and delivers interesting, but quick gameplay. This is a huge favorite filler of mine. It goes over well both with gamers, and muggles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a quick, silly game that is surprisingly fun for all the chaos wrapped up in it.  On your turn you can move any piece on the board or remove any piece that shares a space with another piece.  Only two belong to you and you want them to either escape the dungeon with the treasure or not be removed as long as possible to score more points.  There could be some deduction and clever moves happening but its so quick and brutal that there isn't a lot of time for that sort of thing.  Riding the chaos is an enjoyable time but this is at best a sometimes filler for me.

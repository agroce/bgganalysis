A good, fun, filler trivia game. Hurdles effortlessly over most of the usual problems with trivia games by not asking you to name specific years from memory, but rather intuit which of an increasingly-narrowing set of date ranges particular events fall into.

Fails miserably at useful-packaging-design, however, with a tin which is not only far too large for the contents but also has an embossed lid and therefore cannot be easily stacked!

My friends (aged 30s to 40s) and I are always glad to play this.  Very portable.  It has zero setup time.  Explaining the rules is super quick.  Surprisingly little analysis paralysis (I have an unfortunate tendency towards AP in some boardgames).  Although the game doesn't officially have player interaction, there has been plenty of chatting and liveliness during our plays because of the game itself.

So, you didn’t take your history classes seriously, didn’t you? Now I see...

Timeline is a fast and moderately fun way to show your friends your ignorance on several subjects: I’m unsure whether it still can be considered a game or an idle pastime, anyhow it’s fun to see your friends struggle with even the most basic historical events or dates and miserably fail.

That is one of the rare moments in today’s barbaric age when you can openly take pride in your (usually scorned) humanistic background and crush your opponents, see them driven before you and listen to their womanly lamentations.

Take that, engineers! Where is your probability calculus now?

Covers -4,550,000,000 to 1999.  Deck midpoint is 1766.  24% of deck is prehistoric or ancient world, and 11% covers events after 1960.  65% of deck lies between 750 and 1950 AD.

I like Timeline for what it is. As a "fan of history" (... this really is a lame thing to write imo!), I like this edition better than some of the others. But with the new "Timeline Challenge", it's usually more fun to just play with all cards combined, and I rarely play regular Timeline after I got that edition. Still, if I'm having 5-10 minutes with my friends between other games, this edition is a great one to grab while waiting.

A perfect and well liked filler in my group.  We started with the historical events, and then the demand to order the other two (now 3)sets was strong.  So I did.

My only complaint about his is there are too many "give me" events.  Formation of the sun?  Formation of Earth?  Formation of the Moon?  Appearance of dinosaurs?  And Death of Dinos?  Duh.

But after playing discoveries, I understand why.

Very simple gameplay that is easily taught. The concept is that you have a few cards that have an event or invention or something like that on both sides but only one side has the date on it (year). A card is flipped over to show the year in front of everyone, say 1914 for the start of World War I, and then you have to place one of your cards either before or after that date depending on when you think your event occurred. If you get it correct, the turn passes to the next person. If you are incorrect, you draw a replacement card. As people get correct answers, the timeline grows and the gaps get smaller and smaller as events are placed closer to each other (maybe someone else plays a card for 1910 and you know your card is around that same period - it can definitely mess you up). First person to place all their cards wins. The game is the same with each Timeline set, they just have different themes. You can also mix them together which is a nice plus. This game could definitely be used in an educational setting, but I still find it enjoyable to play just for fun.

Good game to play sporadically with my non-gaming family members and friends.  Proved to be a hit for Christmas 2015 and 2016.  

We play with 6 sets mixed in together (Discoveries, Diversity/General Interest, Historical Events, Inventions, Music & Cinema and British History) and even then you start getting the same cards again fairly quickly.  However, none of us have particularly good memories so it doesn't matter too much!  If you're playing with people who have good memories then I'd recommend mixing at least 2-3 sets together.

RATING: 8
Players take turns to add one of their invention cards to the timeline - a row of inventions, along with their associated date, in the centre of the board. The played card is then flipped to reveal its date, and if correct its added to the timeline.  If incorrect, it's discarded from the game and replaced with another card from the deck. Object is the first to play all their cards correctly into the timeline.  Brilliantly executed, yet very simple game. Quite subtle too, as you try to get the coarse guesses out there early, while the timeline is more forgiving.  As it lengthens, the gaps get narrower and the game becomes much more difficult.  Designed with expansions in mind, which are a must, but they buck the trend of most expansions and will only improve the game by diluting the card mix to prevent memorization.  

This is my third set, after "Inventions" and "Discoveries" and found this one way too easy.  But that's just me, a bit of a history nut.  I've played it with very intelligent friends who really struggled with it.  This will get mixed into the other sets to make a mega-deck, and the game will be better for it.

The Timeline system is a simplified version of the game Anno Domini that is well-known in the German-speaking world. Compared to that, it has the big advantage of ending in a finite (and easily manageable amount of) time but the disadvantage of dropping the bluffing bit that makes Anno Domini appeal even to those who don't have their history lessons always at the ready.

The game itself is entertaining and easy enough to guess a general range or use context clues from the illustrations for younger players or non-history buffs to stay competitive.

With a little over 100 cards, there's not much replayability but it can be combined with other sets to keep things fresh and prevent everyone from memorizing a small set of dates.

Joc de cartes molt sencill, on només es tracta d'ordenar cronològicament una serie de succesos i/o invents. Es juga molt ràpid i, a vegades, depén massa de la sort que tinguis en les cartes que et toquen.
S'ha de jugar amb la baralla de cartes tapada, de forma que no es pugui veure la primera carta, per evitar que els jugadors sapiguen quina sería la carta que els hi tocaría si fallen.
Es crema molt ràpid, ja que si t'aprens o recordes les dates, ja ho tens fet...

Timeline is a clever little party game that works well with almost any group. Be sure to reduce the number of cards each player starts with the more players you have involved though so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

One of the things that Wits and Wagers did so well was having trivia where you didn't need to know the exact answer, just be closest without going over. Similarly, the Timeline games simply ask you know if something occurred within a range of times. This is the way that trivia really needs to work to be fun. Simply "do you know it or not" is too binary to work well with various knowledge levels. There are minor replayability issues as players learn all the cards, but there are many versions of Timeline to keep this from becoming a real problem. 

Definitely worth playing and owning a version or two.

Prefer this version of Timeline because people tend to know historical dates more than inventions.

Game play recording note: I am now playing locally with a combined set, so all future plays will be recorded here.

Same game system as Timeline: Inventions, this gets the same rating. History and trivia fans will eat it up. I think the idea is really clever, but this needs to be a big box game with 500+ cards. As it is, each 100 card game would wear out mighty quickly.

Very simple game where you order events in a time line sequence.  With a bit of planning, this is a very easy game to defeat simply by taking risks early with unknown cards while keeping absolute known cards to last.  Quickie light weight filler with enough cheap expansions to make this more challenging.  Good travel game.

Have played more extensively now and love it.  Expansions are must haves.  As some expansion decks focus on the 19th & 20th centuries, it's vital to try to play these cards first.  Plays up to 8.

Timeline is a solid filler game that's quick to learn and fun to play. There are some balance issues (some cards are harder to place than others). There is also some danger in limiting replay value by memorizing the dates of events, using multiple Timeline sets helps alleviate this... and besides, learning the dates is a good thing... it's educational!

The Historical Events set is a good starting point for the series as it is probably the closest to a non-themed, general knowledge set in the series.

One of the simplest games I own this is one of the best I've played in terms of trivia/knowledge based games. That having been said once you've learnt the cards I can see the replayability being an issue. It is educational however, and I feel with one or two other timeline sets there will be enough here to keep this fresh for a long time.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (August 2012)

As I like so much the original Timeline, this expansion (and Discoveries) is a must for me. This game is great, perhaps my only gripe about it, is that it comes with some EXTREMELY easy cards (Earth´s creation, the dinosaur extinction, etc.) I think I will remove those cards from my set but I have not done so yet.

A great game, you should buy it and play it. You can explain it under a minute and the gameplay takes no longer than 15 minutes.

A must buy for me.

RATING: 7.5
Put the cards depicting historical events you have into the right spots on the developing time line based on when they occurred: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but most of these dates are well known. This was the easiest of the bunch until the movies and cinema, and DEFINITELY the best for younger kids; older kids and adults would do better buying this set, playing it once or twice, and then merging it with the others. It's still fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The only downside is that you'll eventually know the cards and have to mix in other sets.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with strong involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards, easy challenge

I wonder if the author of Timeline has played Hostettler’s Anno Domini. Gameplay is almost similar with the exception that an entry to a timeline is immediately checked while in Anno Domini the correctness of the whole timeline is only checked when the following player believes that it’s faulty. Consequently, in Anno Domini a new timeline has to be started afterwards while in Timeline, the one timeline is kept until the end. A set of Timeline has far less cards and in contrast to Anno Domini the cards have mostly popular events on them making knowledge much more important while Anno Domini focuses on obscure events making bluffing skills more relevant. Thus, replayability at Anno Domini is much higher. Timeline’s replayability depends on the acquisition of additional other sets.

Timeline: Events is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.

Simple game with an event on one side an a date on the other.  You are dealt five cards and players take turns trying to put them in the correct location in the timeline.  It gets harder later in the game as you add to the timeline.  If you make a mistake you take another card.  

Fast, simple filler game that teaches you some dates in history.

Algo que no me gusta es que las cartas sean pequeñas, pues dificulta el barajeo, pero entiendo que es para que la línea del tiempo tenga un tamaño manejable.

RATING: 8
This is such a simple game, I can't believe no one's thought of it yet. In fact, it's so simple, it almost borders on not being a game IMO. It's literally just a deck full of cards with the dates on one side, and you're supposed to create a "timeline" of the dates. Pretty simple. Takes about 10 (ok, maybe 20) seconds to teach. Great for literally anyone to play. The reason this doesn't get a higher rating is the fact that some of these dates are wrong. In a game that's literally a deck of cards with dates on them, getting the dates right seems to be about the only job you had in creating the game. This game gets much better the more expansions you add in too.

This is a very light game of trying to place key dates within the chronology of an ever growing timeline. 

It is a game but is heavily knowledge based and over-familiarity can reduce the fun to be had and competitive nature of the game.

Production wise the games in the series are just gorgeous to look at and many a collector will buy them for that reason alone. 

This is something very differnet for a person's collection and is also perfect for families and school's as an educational resource.

The series is also great for dinner parties as conversation starters.

Timeline is a game I held off on purchasing for quite awhile simply because upon reading the box cover there really is not much of a description of game play. It wasn't until a game day at our local game store, that we were given a chance to try the game. We then discovered it is a lot of fun. 

A card is placed in the center of the table revealing it's date in history. You place a card in the correct timeline in regards to any previously placed cards on the table. The first player to get rid of all cards in hand wins. The pictures on the cards are all tiny scenes from history with a title. On the back of the card is the date in history as well.

RATING: 8
Perfectly pleasant but not much game to it. I would not recommend with 2 players; it tends to be a bit too easy. 

Revision:

Upgraded from 6 to 8. I would say you can pack in as many players as you want. I have played this with 7. We played a few rounds keeping the extant timeline in place so by round 4 things are starting to get very hard. It evolves into a bit if a co-op experience with everyone discussing every card placement and cheering when it's correct. We also play that you keep going until the last person has placed their last card. It is a fun party/gateway game and I now understand why it uses hobbit cards: on our last game there were 4 parallel lines and even then it only just squeezed onto the table.

2 thumbs up.

Very basic game of trying to guess where chronologically in the current string of played events does one of you events fit.

An educational game that is actually fun to play. It's very simple to play and has a good mix of guessing and knowledge, where you don't have to know the exact dates of all the events but it does help.

I like that when you don't know for sure when an event happened, it forces you to think through the context of the event compared to the events already on the table to figure out when it likely happened. If you play a lot, you will start to learn the dates for the events, but I think that is a good thing. There are lots of different Timeline sets, so if one starts getting old you can play a different one, or mix several together. Mixing seems like it would be very interesting, trying to figure out the relationship between totally different types of things (historical events, music, scientific discoveries, etc.)

In my opinion, this game is a great way to learn a little of History, especially to remember those YEARS which are very difficult to memorize. I confess I was a little disappointed when I saw its cards size (VERY small), since it´s difficult to appreciate the quality of its illustrations. However, once you start playing, you realize that they´ve the appropriate size, avoiding to ocupy too much space on the table. It´s a portable game, and very easy to take anywhere. Its rules are veeery easy and plays are fun, quick, and short. My main concern is about its replay value, because once you learn the YEARS you´ll win almost all the play but... What the hell!! You learn history!! That´s great!!!!

Got these timeline games at like 5 bucks each on clearance, and they have been a good alternative to the regular circuit for the family/holiday circuit, plus can be done quickly so you dont become too bored with your family, just a few quick rounds and move on. Great filler. Rating reflects which ones work best with the fam. History for sure. lol

Considering how quick the games go, it doesn't take many games until people memorize everything.  There are a ton of cards, but knowing just a few of them from previous knowledge, and then a few more from playing the game, it can really put players at a big advantage if they've played while others haven't.  It is a simple and fun game though, and is perfect for teaching kids (and adults lol) when historical events happened.

Basically the same as Anno Domini, with the same limited topic in a set. This one has only one third of the cards though, albeit prettier cards. To make a decent game of it you need to mix the other topics of Timeline into the one game - which makes it a pricey game - or buy the 220 card mixed version.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Certainly the topic specific deck drags the rating down on this one as a stand alone game.

A nice game for history buffs and for teaching history to kids. The pictures make it a little more fun to play than Chronology. Unfortunately, there are fewer events in this game, so they start to repeat a lot sooner. Getting to know your history is good compensation though.

I like a good trivia game, but the fun of trivia for me is when questions highlight little ironies, coincidences, etc.  Dates have to be the least interesting pieces of trivia to me.  Plus, there is very little player interaction and there are some weird errors and ambiguities (eg, "Start of WWII is listed as 1940 even though the card depicts Germany invading Poland (1939).)

I like the simplicity in the game. It's easy to bring to a bar and the rules are even easier to explain.
That said; I am quite disappointed that there are errors in the game (fx Charlemagne was crowned western emperor in 1939), it makes all the players question the game.

Good and fun idea, but what is with all that packaging for such small cards.. Understand the tin, does it need to be placed in plastic holders which are placed in a carton box, which is again wrapped in plastic. Feels soo wasteful. Don't forget the two sets of cards are wrapped in plastic too. The game itself is easy to learn, you can adapt the rules easily, make some new ones, and even play on your own.

[Asmodee 16 edition] {Education; shedding; optimal 3-4p} This is a fun game for children to learn about history events.  Good to play with a computer ready to explain the terms to children.  Replayability can be limited though.

The cards can be larger for the children to see, especially, the children need not take cards into their hands.

Less successful than others in the series - a couple of "too French" cards ('The Appeal of 18th June'), at least one basic factual error ('1st crossing of the Atlantic in an airplane' was Alcock & Brown, not Lindburgh, who achieved the first [i]solo[/i] flight)

All of the Timeline series have the same premise:
Play the cards to the table so that the card you're playing fits in chronological order. If you can do that then the card remains in play. If not then it's discarded and you draw a new card.
The game makes an excellent learning tool for children.

Juego sencillo que consiste en colocar cronológicamente 4 cartas en la mesa cada jugador. Cuantas mas cartas haya en la mesa, mas difícil será acertar con el año del invento que aun te quede por colocar. No necesita explicación, tan solo empezar a jugar una partida tras otra. Esta es la segunda caja de este juego. Se puede jugar con ella sola o combinándola con la anterior "Inventos".

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: Timeline is awesome, regardless of the topical focus of a given set. It encourages historical trivia without directly punishing you for a less-than-eidetic memory. Players have a hand of cards listing a significant event. They cannot see the date of that event, which is printed on the reverse. A timeline forms on the table, in which players must insert a card from their hand into the appropriate place on the timeline. It begins very easy, but the guesswork becomes more and more difficult as the dates fill in and players have smaller windows to target. It is a lot of fun. It does, however, play a bit unfairly between people with extensive historical trivia and those who do not, particularly in the later game (knowing the exact year of an event means you should hold those cards for when precision becomes necessary). In the end, we really enjoy it, but rarely find a place for it in our rotation, so we decided to find it a better home.

6/09/2014 first game played real quick with the husband and I.  My initial impression is this is a really enjoyable, filler game.  I feel like I'm in real need for a history refresher.  I saw cards that made me want to pick up a history book and learn about the event.  Simple, easy to learn, easy to teach, easy to play.  Looking forward to introducing this one to the younger sisters (ages 10 & 13)

The first of these was straightforward enough - four cards to each player - and after a 'timeline' card is drawn, each person tries to place one of their cards either before or after the date of the one initially drawn. As each player takes additional turns to place cards they hold, they must try to intersperse those they still have with all of the correctly placed cards that are on the table.
Each card is dealt with a description of an event that they must place before checking the date on the reverse to ensure they have 'timelined' it correctly. If they fail to do so, they draw another card, and repeat the process on their next turn, as each player attempts to place one card at a time. If they are successful, they reduce their hand by one, and whomsoever places all four cards correctly first, wins the game.
The initial allocation of cards is random so it is possible to get some very easy or very difficult dates to rationalise as there were several occasions where the guesses were one or two years out! Who would have thought the Hundred Years War actually lasted one hundred and sixteen years? Go figure.....A nice simple and enjoyable game that tests one's own recollection of events. One I would certainly play again.

There's nothing here that's going to set the game apart from its predecessors, but that's perfectly fine with me.  It's such a pleasant little game with its own set of challenges, and even if it's more a trivia game than a strategy game, you still need to know how to manage your cards to do well at it.  Here are my comments for the first game in the series:

"Play one of your invention cards into what you think is its proper place in a growing timeline and then flip it over to see if you were right.  Were you?  Then leave it there.  If you weren't, you discard it and draw another card.  Play until at least one player runs out of cards.  It doesn't sound like much, and folks with a good history background have an advantage, while its replayability will be affected by how good your memory is over time, but it's actually a neat little game with a nice narrative and some tactics to use over the course of the game.  You might even learn something as you play!  I do recommend drawing off of the bottom of the stack, though, so you don't get to see what your next card is going to be."

RATING: 10
Extremely easy to teach and play.  Those with a love for history will have a slightly unfair advantage ;)  in this game but that is ok since the youngest player gets to go first and will have a slight advantage over older and wiser players.  And with over 100 different events, the odds that older players will run into events that they don't know the date for will increase exponentially.  The more players and the more cards you deal out at the setup will increase the difficulty of the game.  Excellent card designs and absolutely fun to play (and...shock...learn).

I play with the variant from https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1382597/timeline-variant-know-your-enemy


Timeline variant: Know Your Enemy

I had some issues with the original rules of Timeline so I decided to make a simple variant.

This variant should add a bit more strategy since knowing your opponents will become much more important.

SETUP
1. Shuffle the cards.
2. Draw the top card of the deck and place it as the first card of the timeline.
3. Draw 3 cards from the deck and place them next to the deck. This is the Card Pool.
4. Set aside 11 tokens/coins/chips/cubes.

GAMEPLAY
On their turn, players either

A) Take a card from the Card Pool and immediately draw a replacement. NOTE: be careful what cards you leave to your opponents.

or

B) Play a card using regular rules. If you succeed, take a victory point token. If you fail, just discard the card and end your turn.

GAME END
Game ends when there are 12 cards in the timeline and you've run out of VP tokens. Winner is the player with the most VP tokens.

In a case of a tie, tied players continue play. The first player to score, wins.

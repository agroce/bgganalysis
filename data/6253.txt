This game reminds me of me my childhood, when I would chase my little brother through the house to remedy some outrage he'd inflicted on me. As I chased after him, he would knock over chairs and throw stuff in my way to slow me down and tire me out, keeping my crazed fingers from around his throat just long enough for Dad to arrive on the scene and "settle" things. If you think of "Dad" as George Patton, well, you get the idea.

I have had these game for simply ages. Don't remember where I got it from? Steve Chopper Axon?
I dug it out and enthusiastially started to sort out the plastic baggies of counters. Grrr it seems that many are missing!

You need time and space for this baby, but it proves to be a playable, enjoyable, monster if you have both.  The rules are not overly complex.  It is arguably the best SPI monster game this missed and much lamented company ever made.

The classic SPI recreation of the Battle of the Bulge. Best if played by several players assuming the various command roles. One drawback is the virtual invincibility of the German army during the opening turns of the game.

Flatpack. SPI monsters have a lot in common. This is playable but you do have to invest the time and recruit the team to do it. My club gets 4-8 people and 2 week ends (a lucky couple to host and set up!). Came flat pack or boxed (this is flat pack: The platic trays are perishingly brittle now, even kept in a cupboard). Nice to see this one resurrected

Playable "Monster" game of the Bulge.  Lots of counters lots of space, lots of traffic jams and bridge blowin/building.  Managed to play the Campaign game a couple of times, the scenarios are good as well.  Well worth a go if you can find the space and time.

A game from my past. I liked the pretty simple rules especially for a Monster game with beaucoup pieces but it was alway tough to find players to play. In college we tried but inevitably not enough people showed up to complete the game properly. The 5 rating reflects my inability to complete a game the way I had hoped ...... with players (Generals?) trying to work out their game plan for success.

Based on one playing of the first four turns, where the (albeit somewhat more skilful) German players annihilated the Americans sufficient to prompt a resignation, numerous problems became readily apparent.  Moreover, other than green troops' first exposure to combat, the Germans only lost two steps (to the Americans' fifty-odd battalion equivalents), and might easily have lost none had they not wished to push quite so hard!

The set-up and most of the first day (excluding the night bonus) took four of us a day and a half of real time and intensive effort.  In any practical assessment this is not a game that can be played out, both in terms of the time required or its ability to recreate effectively what went down in 1944.  I doubt it was play-tested in its final form more than a couple of times, and then only for the first few turns, so matters of attrition rates and its simulation of the mid-term grind won't be an accurate picture.  

All that said, a wonderful relic of the old school monster mania, and possibly worth at least one go for those that can spare a long weekend to enjoy the spectacle before putting it away for good.  In this, it offers a far more terrifying picture of the weight of men and materiel thrown at the Americans than any of the smaller representations.

As a game and a simulation, at least when played for blood, it does not work.   A solitaire player with no agenda to achieve a 'win' and time on his hands might find it solves that problem.

My first serious game about the Bulge.
Very good rules.
This game was the inspiration of all the more recent games over the same subject. The feeling is the same,the possible strategies are the same ,the decisions you have to make are the same.
I am glad (and proud) to have achieved 4 complete plays of this game.

What I like: Simple basic system (based on West Wall with more chrome) allows you to have a hope of playing the big battle. Battalion level. Detailed look at the battlefield. Some command and control (via regimental integrity)

What I don't like: Cookie cutter approach to the units. Poor representation of artillery (more men in a hex are harder to kill!). The campaign game is unbalanced, the Germans don't have a chance because once those American artillery line up, the Germans are vaporized by rain of shell...

Inherited this from a friend who has since passed on. Played the small scenarios a lot back then when he was still around. The full game takes too much space and time. How long does it take to set up?
In any case, I quite like the game play. XTR did a smaller version entitled Wave Of Terror.

A monster wargame based on the old SPI classic Victory in the West system that gets to be reprinted with an updated version with improved graphics and production from Decision Games.  The game has been talked about hotly in the history of wargame.  Tactical level Bulge game.....could have avoided the lukewarm feel at operational level like other Bulge games.  Bought the DG's edition, waiting to be played.

Pretty good game. Takes a while to master all the different rules and the effect they have on the game, but once you have done that...believe me, it takes a while...you will find this to be a great game. My only complaint is the number of informational counters that have to be used. Lots of clutter, but you learn to live with it.

As teenagers, we played to near-completion over a four week period.  I was too inexperienced to tackle this at the time, confounded by supply rules that I felt were unnecessarily restrictive.  I just wanted to fight, man!

I bought a second hand copy of this: it looked as if it had been stored in a barn and crapped on by chickens for ten years.

This has clouded my judgement, somewhat.

There is a decent game in there apparently.

A sentimental favorite; one of the classic monster games from SPI. Battalion level, 4 map, 1600 counter treatment of the Battle of the Bulge. Map and components look a little dated but they were state of the art back in the day, and SPI was at the top of their game. Surprisingly easy system, that is only made difficult by the sheer size of the game and a slew of special rules. I've only ever played some of the scenarios, but they were good fun and I still get playing pangs when I think about it.

For me, the perfect game. Simple mechanics with tons of counters. The Bulge. Race against time and arriving reinforcements. All great stuff.

Looking for boxed version.

Played the campaign scenario a number of times with 3 players per side.  The German players found a bit of a loophole in the rules though by surrounding American reinforcement entry hexes with occupying the actual entry hexes.  A good house rule would have been to allow the Americans to bring on their reinforcements further west with a one turn delay.  I still have the co-ordinates of a uncompleted game from 30 years ago!

I have the big box game. It's like new, and too old to punch the counters. I never punch a game over 20 years old. That's a lot of counters to make! it does have some shelf wear,but the box is intact, no tape EVER! No blown corners. This game is new inside, and very beautiful.

Exceptional game.  One of the best operational game systems in a great situation and can be considered a study of the battle.  Detailed treatment of combined arms, unit integrity, formation mode and artillery make this a gem to play.  You can see the big picture, but execution at the tactical level requires careful understanding of terrain, force capabilities and logistics. The game itself is intense and provides lots of opportunities for both side. SPI edition is better than the later DG edition.

I love "Bulge" games and have several of them.  But this may be the first game I purchased for collector purposes.  Even though it will be re-released by Decision, I couldn't resist a complete, mint, unpunched SPI flatpack version for under $60.  I've rated this one based only on a read of the rules.  It's very similar to many SPI wargames in terms of mechanics; fairly simple but with lots of depth in how to maneuver your troops.  Tons of counters representing conceivably everything in that battle.

This is THE company/battalion level game on the Bulge prior to Joe Youst's redesign. It's still fun in the original form, which is much simpler than the update. It plays pretty cleanly, but the germans seem to have a romp more often than not.

NOt exactly a strong simulation of the battle even if it is fun.

Ah, an auction game where you want everything but have so little cash to buy it with. In terms of the buildings, it's really hard for one player to run away, so it never feels like you're out of the game and you never feel like you have enough. Beautiful, one of my favorite games, and clocks in at a relatively short 90 minutes. I always pair this one with Power Grid (because of the theme basically), but it hits the table much more given its shorter length and fewer players.

Verdict: Odwalla (Orange flavor)

A neat little auction game.  A little lopsided in some respects, and not perfect, but decent enough.  I like the balance between auctioning things for money and wanting to take them yourself.  I'd play it again, maybe with a house rule or two (though I've since forgot what we were thinking).

Ugh. I can give you a series of mini-reasons why this game leaves me totally cold, but as a whole, I found the game very chromed, with a questionable auction mechanic, a pasted-on theme, and unengaging gameplay. Just me, no worries, I'll run it for others...

I love the theme to this game. Consider yourself an 1800s robber baron. You need to control commodities which the other robber barons must buy from you. You also need to attempt to own a variety of industries and technologies to increase your power and influence. There is a lot to think about in this game. It needs a few more plays (and maybe approaches to the game as well) to see if the 4th player is really at a disadvantage. My thoughts now are that this isn't the case but the 4th player (and maybe the 3rd as well) needs to play a very different game than the 1st or 2nd players. The English paste up of this game was a pain to do but it really helped me to get into the theme. Still, in the end there is just something odd about this game. While it's a game that I want to like it just never seems to be entirely satisfying for some reason.

{1 play • 4 players} I already like bidding games, but I think the others were wary when we started out.  By the end, I think they liked the game more than I did - and I like it.  There's just enough other stuff going on that it doesn't feel like *just* a bidding game.  Yeah, it could happen that someone doesn't make the "right" move to balance things out... and my "won't get played much by next year" sensor is definitely tingling a bit... but, for now, I'm impressed.  In fact, I suspect my rating will go up after I play this again.

Good game for now. Has some good mechanisms, but I find it difficult to fully grasp what strategies are effective, so some of the vigor in figuring out what you are doing is lost. Very colorful and original.

Looks interesting after one play. I like the "money flow" aspect of the auctions, but after all is said and done there may be too many auctions for my taste. Graphics make it hard to decipher what's worth what, especially with regard to the buildings.

RATING: 5
i had the original german version, but it sounds like the english reprint is pretty light on english.  that's a shame, perhaps i would have given it another shot.  it's completely playable as-is, but for some reason the german resource names bothered me.  at any rate, i thought the game was just okay.  i liked the tightness of the auctions, but the board seems to inhibit replay.  i think it's too linear and static, even with whatever changes might come about as the result of an auction win or loss.  i'd play it again, but i'm not terribly interested in doing so.

RATING: 7.5
A classic Schacht design that likely gets less attention than it should.  It is not a casual game and you'll likely find it to feel much more like a gamer's game.  Game play progresses across 5 phases that must be planned for several turns in advance.  Decisions made in the 1st phase will impact you in the third.  For this reason, it may take a few plays to understand the connections between the various elements.  For a meatier game, the shorter game length is a nice surprise.  While not a mainliner, the game is definitely more than a meaty filler.  If you find a copy, do yourself a favor and give it a try.

Played a 3-player game that just didn't seem to work. Cash was always short and the auctioneer would very often be forced to take tiles as there was no cash to offer. The game LOOKS cool but it really left me with a bad impression. Perhaps you need the full complement of players to make things worthwhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
a good idea, but it depends very much on the sitting order the chances for the fourth player are very bad...in the first turn, when you have only a little money, he comes last, and there is no chance to acquire anything for a reasonable price... in the last epoch he doesn't has an own turn... :(

1st Play: This game has been in my collection for many years but remained unplayed owing to the tiles and boards being in German and the text being confusing. However JimF at Epsom GC suggested we play it to round the evening off. Four of us got stuck in.

My overall impression is that there are significant balance problems. 

1/ With 4 players there are 3 auctions per epoch and with 5 epochs the player in last position will miss out on starting to chair an auction and so miss out on the chance to gather as much cash as everyone else.

2/ The start player seems to be advantaged as they can gather more cash early on and stake a claim on the key industries and technologies. Meanwhile players further down the playing order must pay more for a tile if they want it.

3/ The Tiles can come out in a generous order for one auction to gain the first player a heap of money, the next to chair an auction might have very weak tiles that are refused so they get no money at all.

After that the game is extremely repetitive with no real interaction beyond the auctions. All in this game is really showing its age and immediately goes on my trade/ sell pile. I can't see me playing this again.

This one's very dry, but I enjoy it, though I have trouble getting it to the table. I like the bidding mechanism, in which the auctioneer can keep the item for free instead of taking someone else's bid, but by doing so they pass the auctioneering duties to the person on their left and forfeit further income. It's important to do some long-term planning and to stick to it.

Fun auction game whereby players use their wins to develop industries and technologies and scoring bonus points for having related holdings.

May go higher with repeat plays...

Liked the game I played, maybe it takes a little too long for what it is but the rounds are played fast and there is only a little of AP involved.

After the end of the game, it grows on me a strange sensation. I don't know if there are more strategy than luck. More play is needed to know.

Another play and still with the strange feeling at the end of the game, I still don't know if it's a great game or an average and tasteless game, but somehow I like Industria.

A game of economics, auctions and set collection with a fairly steep learning curve.  The auction mechanic of this game is very strange and some consider it annoying or even broken.  I feel that it's just different... something to get used to and exploit when you can.  The luck of the tile draws can hamper your plans, but overall it's an enjoyable (albeit odd) auction game.  

OTHERS SAY: lots going on, auction is too dependent on luck of draw, one poor bid by player A can decide the game for B & C.

It's been a while since I played this one. On paper I should like this game, but somehow all my plays were 'meh'. Playing times were always way longer than advertised, which isn't a problem per se when you're having fun. It always felt too tedious for the amount of control I had. With all the other euros on offer with similar mechanics I'll probably won't be playing this one any more.

Comprado en la bsk a inigoMontoya en Julio 2010
Tardé en estrenarlo. Las reglas parecen un poco confusas al principio, pero una vez asimiladas, se descubre un juego bastante entretenido. Es un juego de subastas (con una mecánica bastante original, pues solo se permite una oferta). La idea es subastar por distintas fábricas, tecnologías, bonos y recursos. Las fabricas asimismo generan otros recursos.. que te servirán para construir otras fábricas o tecnologías, u obtener dinero por vender recursos a otros jugadores que los necesiten. Las fábricas y las tecnologías están relacionadas unas con otras. Al final del juego también se obtienen puntos por esas relaciones, por el uso de bonos y por el dinero obtenido. Sirve para pasar un buen rato. 
La copia que tengo es en alemán, y es necesario tirar de alguna traducción. Es un juego medianamente dependiente del idioma.

Vendido a Chesirecat en las CLBSK2012(mayo) por 10€. Me dio pena, pero no veía mesa.

A very dry game. Boring and just plain old "not fun".   The auctions were either for $1 or $2 as bidding any more is unfeasible when money is so ridiculously limited. This makes for a boring game. One's income was easily railed by poor random draws of tiles that no one is willing to bid for. This game will not be played again.

Unfortunately, this is my third bad experience by this author. China and Hansa were also games that I really disliked. I don't know if I can stomach trying any more of this author's games.

RATING: 8
A very decent game with a tight auction system nicely meshed with building on-board connections between production buildings and technologies and collecting buildings which share common features (dependence on water, rail etc).

I'm surprised that this has never been picked up for publication in English as it's a lot better than many which have.  The good news is that all you really need to play the German edition is the English rules translation.  The only German is the names of the buildings/technologies and the materials which you need to build them.  The former are almost irrelevant (as the graphics on the tiles are a precise match for those on the board) while the latter fall squarely into 'gamer German' territory (and it is simply a case of matching the buildings which produce 'holz' or 'stein' with those which need them to be built).

RATING: 7
Good for a Schacht, but I felt like this was just a middling auction game. Not bad, but the auction game is a category in which Knizia has produced so many amazing games, I'm not sure why you would want to play this one. More thematic than his usual stuff, but that's not saying a lot, and it's still ultimately pretty dry. Not bad, I wouldn't mind playing again sometime, but for me not worth the space on the shelf.

RATING: 4
Rather vicious and fast paced auction game where money is incredibly tight the entire way. Many ways to score, and like Java the end game scoring is where 50%  of the points come from so building carefully (through links and bonus tiles) is absolutely crucial to be in it. 

My big knock on this title was the lucky tile draw factor, but I now think that that issue can be completely alleviated by skillful play. Being the first person to go last in the 4 player game can be a rather large disadvantage though, because of the money tightness issue (as the last player won't get the money boost of running an auction for the longest, and will have already gone an entire epoch with little cash flow...this is far from a huge issue, but worth noting IMO).  Surprisingly decent with both 3 and 4 players, the 3 scale usually being hard on auction games, at this point I actually prefer the 3 player game by a substantial margin because of the reduced luck factor (our group plays out all 5 epochs in 3 man games...) This is quite samey from game to game though, and there is not a lot of room to manoeuvre once you've committed to one of the two mainline strategies. 

My biggest complaint is the fact that, unlike most auction games, there isn't a way to actually force someone to sell an item to you. Early in the game you can generally do that just by making a tempting bid, but by the late game you are often suffering at the whimsy of the auctioneer, and, in short, even if you are doing something like a Technology heavy strategy you STILL need to have some bonus tiles so that you can make points when building buildings as well, &c. I think but for that factor the game actually works pretty decently, but I think the wheels just come off the coach in the last frame, where the tiles are most important and can give you the biggest bonuses, which is a big detriment.

I really liked this game when  first played it because I had not played very many pure auction games, and my review from that period gushes all over this game.

I'm starting to strongly dislike Michael Schacht's games despite the fact that they are very well-designed...that's the problem, Industria (like Hansa) is over-designed.  They feel as if you'll win if you just follow the rules, much like how I won my first game of Industria.  It's a great looking game that initially seems very interesting but Schacht's almost totalitarian control over game play and strategic options forecloses on any creativity or ingenuity in planning.  Everything in the game is tight, tight, tight and there's virtually no room for error in _anything_, which means that if you don't stick to a set policy you're screwed.  I wanted to like Industria, but it's just too rigid, controlled, and ultimately uninteresting to me.  Nonetheless, it's worth checking out at least once.

Industria: A contrived technology tree game based on tight auctions. Cards with either factories, technologies, resources, or bonus icons on them are auctioned off one at a time in batches of 4 (or 3, depending on player number), and afterwards they are 'built' provided the required resources for their construction are available to the player. Points are only handed out if the objects on auction are 'built' in the epoch they appear in; there are 5 such epochs in the full game. This puts some stress on the players to get a move on. Finally, you get bonus points for building stuff in a certain 'logical order'—some objects are 'connected' through the epochs. Driving the game is a set of auctions which are designed to keep things simple and fast. With 4 players there'll be 15 sets of auctions, meaning you'll be busy for a while!

The first impression I got from Industria was from the 2-player variant which is linked to somewhere on the Geek. I'd advise you to stay clear from that ruleset, as it doesn't work. Cards are removed at random before being sold off, throwing a wrench in the exceedingly finely balanced gears of getting points in the correct epoch and creating connected 'streets', and availability of resource and bonus tiles. It becomes a silly point-hoarding excercise which might or might not work. Industria is not conceived for 2 players.

After may eons of gathering dust in my closet, I got this out at some point, and played it with 3 other people. Of course the game worked much better in that there was significant competition for resources, factories and more. Unfortunately, the auction phase didn't move fast enough the keep the game lively—with money being as scarce as it was, you want to make an auction count, and a lot can depend on subtle player sequence tactics. The tightness of money also means that a lot of cash is pumped round and round, leading to a lot of simple but disruptive micromanagement which hardly seemed to matter over the course of 15 auction rounds. I also found the board to be very unclear for practical use: it's not immediately obvious which factories are put on sale as most of them look very similar. Therefore the game was much more intense than it needed to be, which in my opinion hammered a stake through about three-quarters of its heart. 

I found it simply not [i]fun[/i] to be playing auctions like this; I think I'd prefer a game of Ra instead. There auctions are simple, straightforward, but still agonising, and the adding-to of the bidding row doesn't feel so elaborate. In other words, I didn't think this title would leave its box in the future, and sold it off.

Acquired Math trade July 2008.

Applied English paste-up stickers on board and tiles.  Looks very nice.  

July 2009. Played one three player game.  Very enjoyable game that I will be looking to play more of.  Like the inner dependencies between the resource, roads, and final scoring chips.  Like how tight money is in this game too.

Really enjoyed my first playing, so I'll start my rating out at 8.

March 2012 - Played second time now after playing Industry.  Think I enjoy the additional scoring/layering of the connections of Industry better.

Michael Schacht designs delight me. This is no exception. It plays really quickly, requires good planning and, like all Schacht designs, you can never do everything you want to in a single turn. You have to make tough decisions all the time.

Although all components are written in German it is very easy to play, even if you have no understanding of the German language. If anything, it makes it rather fun to learn a bit of German in the process of the game.

I'm not sure about the auction mechanic, as it is possible to collude & force an auctioneer to take a tile he/she puts up first and then pass control of the auction to the left. I'll try again, as some of the problems we had were from inexperience, but not sure this will be still played in our group 3 months down the line.

RATING: 8
Original auction system, the first player change each round and he start as "the Auctioneer", as the Auctioneer you start with has many tiles to auction as there are players in the game, whenever you sell a tile you get the value from the buyer, but you always has the option to take the tile for yourself, HOWEVER as soon as you do so the Auctioneer  role pass to the next player.

As money is really tight in this game you must balance how to make the most money when you are the Auctioneer, but you also want to get the tiles that suit your strategy, or deny the opponent preferred tiles.

The final scoring take into account connections between you factories, which add an extra layer of strategy.

Considering this is a pure Euro game with minimalist rules and simple components it does a pretty good job of conveying the theme of industry magnates ruthless competition.

Works well with 3 players.

Industria is a pure auction game, employing the straightforward "bid once" mechanic.

To spice up things, resources are really tight, and a twist on the role of the Auctioneer is added.

The result is interesting. The only problem I can see is the fact that values of each tile is easily determined (with a very low uncertainty). As a consequence, luck in the draw of the lot to be auctioned may greatly influence the outcome of the game.

RATING: 7.5
Rating is based on a single game with 4 players.  I really enjoyed this game. It is pretty tense because you never seem to have enough money to do what you want to do.  The bonus scores at the end of the game appear to be very important.  The mechanism that allows the current auctioneer to take the highest bid or the item offered for free is nifty.  I think our game took a little over 1.5 hours with rule explanation. It's no Talisman, but I'll definitely play this again. ;-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game with multiple paths to victory. Bidding mechanism works well; If you are the auctioneer, you can opt to steal the tile, regardless of the other bids, but you lose auctioneer privileges to the player on your left. It's really easy to bite off more than you can chew, by buying too many factories or technologies and being unable to play them by the end of the era or even by the end of the game. Make sure you understand that linked properties must be directly connected to score additional points in the final scoring. Recommened.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good bidding game with a twist (the ability for the auctioneer to take the item at the cost of no longer being auctioneer). Cash is very tight since you still need to pay to build your purchase and items need to be built very quickly for maximum gain. There are a lot of intriguing connections between the sale items represented by the board (requirements/production of resources, road/techlinks, eras). The value of an item takes some thought. OTOH, the pay off for links is HUGE compared to the tiny cash flow from factories. Beginners tend to overvalue the money earners compared to VP earners.

Rather deep 90 minute auction game.  Players purchase factory, bonus or technology tiles at auction.  The auctioneer takes the payment until they choose to take a tile for free.  Once purchased, the tiles then have to be constructed, often requiring money and resources.  Points are awarded for constructions, as well as several bonuses at the end of the game.  Money is very tight, timing is crucial in both buys and builds, and the relative worth of a purchase is not easy to gauge.  Very intriguing game.

This game was AWESOME on my first play. I was completely blown away by it.
We played with 3 players and it was excellent, I'm sure 4 would be just as good if not better (I did want the game to continue into the last round, which you omit with only 3 players).

Somehow, it fills the same hole that Caylus does, in half the time, and it is much more fun. Maybe that's just me though.

My only complaint is that the "roads" connecting the factories are very difficult to see. They sacrificed a little too much function for the great artwork. It is, in the end, forgivable.

UPDATE: To fine-tune my earlier comments, I feel that Ra and Industria fill pretty much the same niche in a game library, and I'm way too happy with Ra to get very excited about Industria -- not that it's a really bad game, just that I'd pick Ra over it any day of the week so why have both?

An interesting auction/set collecting game but not a top-tier one. The "Auction/set collecting" premise invites comparison to games like Ra, and Industria comes up short in that regard. There are just so many interesting auction games out there to worry about an average one. Nice art, though. Traded away. 

See my review for more details.

Mildly interesting auction game with a few strategy decisions.  Easy to learn and teach.  A very tight money game; players must watch their own finances and those of their opponents, spending wisely in every auction.  For me, fails to evoke its theme, though it's great to build a robotic factory or genetic engineering lab.

RATING: 7
Auction-fest that doesn't feel primarily like an auction game.  While the rules were fairly uncomplicated, the game felt medium-heavish in the strategy department epecially when you're the auctioneer.  One needs to generate money while auctioning tiles so it's imperative to sell items that others need.  If you offer a tile that everyone passes on, you lose the ability to generate money because the auction role changes players, creating nice tension.

It's an auction game with a closed money supply and the auctioneer has the upper-hand. Nice ideas, a little too- complex mechanics for a little too-simplistic view of progress. A broader view and maybe more rounds per epoch would have been better. A good game but I suck at auctions.

RATING: 2
Played 1 time. An auction game with all kind of things going on with the tiles obtained. Tile have several values to a player: some tile produce goods needed to build other tiles; tiles that are connected by road score VPs; some tiles have VPs on them; some tiles have bonus VPs on them that score if a commodity is secured; commodities that secure the bonus. On the whole I really like how the tiles score and interconnect, but honestly my first playing took far too long, and since their is so much to consider with any given tile (who will it benefit and how much) that I see this as being a very long game even when players get the hang of it. The other problem is that the whole game is a series of auctions. The same auction over and over and over and over. The game has such a good basic idea that I did enjoy my playing, but the length and monotony may keep it from ever being a game I play often. Gamers only.

RATING: 6
I don't think this can be played without major tweaking.  We played with some house rules to compensate with the 4th player disadvantage and our changes worked perfectly: instead of drawing the number of tiles according to the number of players, in a 4 player game we draw three and pass the first player auctionner over to the next player.  This guarantees that each player gets to be the auctionner at least once.  Trying to connect pairs along the way seems to be an important step towards victory.  Once fixed this game worked for us.

RATING: 6
In Industria players auction off industries and technologies. Industries are then built on the map, and technologies are invented in a way that resembles a typical tech tree.

Points are primarily scored for industries built and technologies developed but there are many bonus points for efficient production lines or connected developments (ie. industries or technologies adjacent to each other on their respective trees) and it's possible to earn bonus markers for certain industry types as well. All tiles are auctioned off by the players themselves, and those auctions are the primary source of income in the game.

The entire tech tree business should not disguise the fact that Industria is purely an auction game. The only decisions to make are about what industries you want and how much you are willing to pay for them. Since the locations for the tiles on the trees are (quite naturally) fixed what happens outside of the auctions is mostly automatic and/or bookkeeping. As far as auction games go, Industria is a solid entry that can get pretty cutthroat at times. It is, however, probably even more opaque than most auction games. Since scoring is pretty chunky having at least a rough idea about what certain tiles are worth is a definite advantage.

Langlebigkeit ist in der kurzfristigen Brettspielwelt, in der sich die Neuheiten und Hypes gegenseitig jagen, eine missachtete Tugend. Dabei ist ein Aspekt der Qualität eines Spiels auch die Zeitlosigkeit, die sich eben in der Dauer und an seiner Art zu altern zeigt. Aber in den narzisstischen Gesellschaften des Westens, die den Jugendwahnboogie um das goldene Kalb tanzt, zählen Beständigkeit und Kontinuität nicht sonderlich viel. Die Spiele INDUSTRIA und INDUSTRY haben etliche Jahre auf dem Buckel und gehören in der Kategorie Versteigerungsspiel zu den gut gealterten wie unterschätzten Vertretern, die im Schatten der heißen Scheinwerfer von Essen längst vergessen worden sind. INDUSTRIA/INDUSTRY ist hierfür geradezu ein Paradebeispiel. Es hält in seiner geradlinigen, klaren Idee jedem aufgepumpten Komplex locker stand: wir spielen das Zeitalter der Industrialisierung nach, indem wir Fabriken der einzelnen Epochen zur Versteigerung anbieten, die man im Grunde selbst alle bräuchte, aber die man an seine Gegenspieler verkaufen muss, um die Kohle zu kriegen, um sie sich eben jene Fabriken kaufen zu können. Diese Dilemma reicht, um so viel Spannung und knifflige Entscheidungssituationen zu schaffen, dass es auch anno 2018 noch großen Spaß macht. INDUSTRIA/INDUSTRY hat keinerlei Staub oder Patina angesetzt. Einzige Sache: tatsächlich entfaltet INDUSTRIA/INDUSTRY seinen vollen Reiz nur in Vollbesetzung mit vier Spielen. Als Neuheit würde man INDUSTRIA/INDUSTRY vermutlich als "okay, nichts besonderes" bezeichnen, was aber mehr über die gute Durchschnittsqualität heutiger Brettspiele aussagt als über INDUSTRIA/INDUSTRY. Ja, und Queen Games hat früher mal richtig gute Spiele gemacht. Im Gegensatz zum Original von Queen Games ist es der Wiederausgabe von Ystari gelungen, ein Spiel im Spiel zu integrieren: die ultimative Bewältigung von Unübersichtlichkeit mit Hilfe zweier über das Brett flirrender Augen. Hier war der Art Director sehr selbstverliebt in der Welt von Industrieromantik unterwegs. Schön aussehen tut's trotzdem. Unabhängig von dieser Stilblüte darf man sich eines der beiden Exemplare anschaffen. Die Queen Games Version leistet sich sogar noch Holzscheiben als Geld, sozusagen als Gegenbeweis zur rationalisierenden Industrie, die immer billiger produzieren will.

Rating after one play with other newbs to this title. It's going to take us a few plays to work out the relative worths of things. Minor gripe: although my recently bought copy has English rules, the components are in German. While this is good for one's language skills (I never knew Kraftwerk was power station!), the game might flow a bit smoother or at least feel more thematic to us Anglophones if the factories, technologies, and resources were in English.

This game can be ruined by people who like to calculate the value of everything out loud (you know who you are!).

Yes, this is an auction game, but money is tight, and there are many options.  The artwork is nice, but it is not the easiest to follow.

This is the type of auction game I like, so rating could go higher.  Games such as this and Pizarro & Co keep my interest longer than other pure auction games.  Ignore the tech tree at your peril!

Well the mechanics in this game work fine but it is somewhat static for my taste. I think the theme does not realy apeal that much to me. Played it twice, will definately stay in my collection but I think I will not play this game that often.
If you like bidding as a game element you might be interested in this one.
Positive is the era's that you play but as I wrote, not realy my taste.

RATING: 8
The first round I wonder if this really is anything good, the second - it felt fairly ok, during the third (when it was too late) I got a really WOW feeling and realised that I really want this game and I hope to get the chance to play it soon again. The auctions, which is the base of the game made the beginning rough, but became more interesting, when I realised how to handle the twist that the auctioneer could choose to take the tile for free instead of selling it to someone else, although this means that he has to leave the auctioneer role to the next player. You also need to buy workshops for different materials to keep the income flowing, although you get less points from them. Also you need to try to get bonus points too.
Compared to 'Modern Art' (which I never will play again), the auctions actually work, even for beginners.
Summary: An interesting game with mostly a lot of challenging choices.

RATING: 6.5
Somewhat Ra-like, in that you're bidding for victory points. But it's much more aggressive, due to the single tiles having very different values for each player, the clever auction mechanic, and the ability to pick up at no cost a tile that someone else is desperate for. 
I think it would be really good with experienced players.

Two plays. Money is painfully tight, making the auctions very tense, though I felt like that also undercut the strategy and made the game feel catch-as-catch-can. There are any number of paths that would get you a lot of points, but could anyone ever actually afford to pursue them?

Very tight auction game! Money is soooo scarce! You have to really think about which factories, technologies and bonuses you want to auction off and which ones you want to keep.

Now, if you auction something, you have to give it some thought, what's it going to be worth to others. Why? Because you want others to pay high money for it. Without the money, you can't later build factories or technologies. And you need to do that to score points. And building only makes sense in the particular epoch, because otherwise those industries/technologies are useless, just like in history.

Very well fine tuned game. And it kinda makes you feel like you're going through the epochs timeline when the industries first started and as they developed, other industries/technologies got phased out. So the theme works. Very recommendable game.

Very simple auction game, but with a lot of tactics. There is some luck of the draw, and you can also be harmed if you outguess your opponents wrong and auction an item nobody wants. But that's one of the interesting decisions you must make. A good thing is that the game is very dynamic and plays fast. The really bad one is that the "English" edition comes in German.

auction-o-rama!  have the german version without paste-ups and don't need them.  most of the words are decipherable without needing to know any german. (zement=cement).  game involves auction factories, technologies, resources, and some special bonus cards.  many of these items combine with others in a myriad of ways to provide extra points.  Interest for me lies in 1)auctioning in the right order to make some money and get what you want and 2) the tactics of opportunistically collecting sets to get yer extra points

Money is very scarce in this bidding game and I mean it. You really can't do much due to it and may have to skip one or another turn, just because you can't afford anything.

While the money dictates the game, the problem comes from the starting player. If you are last, you have to wait quite a bit to have the opportunity to make some money again and that can kick you out of the game for a whole turn, which just isn't fun.

This problem may only happen in a 4 player game (had only those lately), so it may work better with 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Played 4 player once.  Excellent game, bidding was good, but almost didn't feel like an auction, with the ability of the auctioneer to take the item instead of the money offered.  The end was very tight, Winner and 2nd ended on the same VPs, with the tie-breaker being number of tiles owned, which was tied as well at 13 each, broken by money left which was 10 to 8. (I won this one, just).  Want to play it a second time, then I will buy it if it holds up (and will definately buy if it comes out in English.)

Played it once so far.  Money (grey discs) are critical in this game.  I don't like the bidding rules -- they are hard to adjust to after playing games like Goa and Modern Art, where the player who wins the bid always pays the most.  In this game, the start player can always get one item for nothing.  And unlike Power Grid, one player with a lot of money can buy several items.

It's important to build buildings in the same age that they were bought else they aren't worth any victory points (other than connection points at end of game).  It's also important to build buildings that produce goods that people will pay to use later on.

RATING: 5
The special tiles and the links are a bit much.  The randomness of the draw can and will affect the outcome.  Got the impression that once behind I could not catch up to the leader as generating income is very difficult.  Played with two other players.  Would probably be better with 4.  Willing to give it another try.

RATING: 7.5
This is a neat game, lots of Schacht elements wired together very successfully. Elements of Web of Power plus an auction, and really attractive design. Do not be intimidated by the german text on components, I played a pasted up version (which was done very nicely) but it is not critical to play the game. Yes you will have to carefully read what a factory produces and what is required to build an item but it is all labelled so with a little bit of effort you can get it. Plus you might learn what computer, and other commodities are in German. Highly recommended.

I can respect this game a bit, but I just wish that the value of stuff was more easily discernable.  I feel when I play they game that there is some items (wood, brick, etc) that are much more often used than others (stone, ceramic).  Perhaps it's just a feeling I get.  I know there are differences in the tech trees, which aren't easily identified (at least to me).  I find it hard to enjoy the game sometimes because of the separate valuations on the various things up for bid.

A very abstract auction game that's notionally about the industrial revolution, but could have been themed around more or less anything. The key is selecting the best order to auction the tiles when your turn comes, as that's the only major source of income. Those who like their games to be somehow rooted in reality won't find much interest here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In some ways, it's reminiscent of both Goa and Brass, but it is MUCH MUCH MUCH lighter than either of those games. This game has several elements I've seen before, but I like them--a multi-step building process, close competition for the right to do so, a production process by which resources become available to all players--for a price.  In any case, I don't think I've seen them implemented in such a streamlined way before. We didn't finish our game, but I am really curious to see if my strategy--building all the production buildings and making everyone pay me both for resources and in the auction--was a good one.  I suspect so.  (1 play)

I have the German version of the game and I would rate this at least an 8.5 if I had the English version. Without knowing German it's hard to tell what you're buying/bidding. It's not a game breaker but people like to know what they're bidding on without checking a reference sheet. But otherwise, an excellent game. The budget is VERY tight and getting the right connections are the key to winning.

Played with 3 players, I want to see if it will work with 4 since I was warned it had  problems with 4 players. Played again with 3 players. It seems to suffer from bad tile picks. If you get a tile draw with two resources, the bids will be low and you won't have much money for the next 3-4 turns.

Played this again teaching it to two new people. One of the new players on the very first turn had a draw with no factories or technology. I suggested to the other player we let him redraw, since that is a harsh blow on the first turn (any turn really).

I started in 4th position, so I got off to a slow start.  Plus we got a rule wrong at first, and the table decided to "fix" it in mid-game.  I think I was most negatively affected by the change in the rule, because I was counting on the rule as we originally played it.

Auction game taking place in the industrial period (starting at the dawn of industrialization and ending at the present). Players bid for a variety of industries and technologies. I have played Industria with 3 players, and my opinion on it is a little mixed: On one hand it's an interesting auction game, with a structure very much like Amun-Re, which allows players to choose different paths to victory. On the other hand, the auction mechanic itself doesn't quite seem to work. The fact that the current auctioneer can take the current tile being auctioned off for free tends to skew the auctions. Most times, there will be one particular tile which is just too valuable for the auctioneer for him *not* to just take it (since if he doesn't he will have no guaranty that the player who *does* auction it off will be willing to sell it), which can lead to the game being more of a "take turns picking tiles" game, and less of an auction game. In these cases, no amount of money the other players can offer will make sense for the auctioneer to accept. On the positive side, the various sources of victory points seem very well balanced, with both on-tile points, connections and bonus points being significant. All in all, I would like to play Industria again, if only to see if further play could improve my opinion of it.

Nothing offensive about Industria, but it seems to suffer from having too many options of about the same value.  The auctions are done better in Goa.  It is neat to follow 600 years of technology, but the theme breaks down a little bit - what are the players, some sort of dynastic families?

Initial rating, but definately want to play again to see what strategies develop.  Money is tight.  Rating down slightly after couple more plays.  The way the auctions work when you are auctioneer you are at the mercy of the other players and what tiles you turn over to be auctioned.  If you miss out on a reasonable amount of money when you are auctioneer you may be in a hole you can't recover from.

A compelling game of auctions and resource management with the subtle turn angst element of having a limited cash flow to work with.

RATING: 7
An unusual game for Michael Schacht in being aimed at strategy gamers rather than occasional gamers. The mechanism of the auctioneer is brillant. What tiles might other players want? Which tiles can I live with if nobody else buys them? Various ways to score points lend room for mid-term strategy but tactical optimization is still the core of the game. Players early in the turn order suffer a slight advantage and the tile draws can give a noticeable advantage to some auctioneers. But for the length and ease of the game it's fine with me. Could be the second-best Schacht game trailing only Web of Power.

This is a weird auction game in which the values of tiles is not obvious. Money is tight, so a bad choice or two might really do you in. I think there is a fiddlyness to the game that will deter casual gamers; it is too much work to consider how the tile up for auction right now might be important in a later epoch. In that respect this is more of a gamer's type of game, and because of that it is somewhat satisfying to me. A big part of playing well is figuring out how to auction off items that you don't want for your opponents' money.

Initially very awkward - I had very little idea what I was doing.  But as the game progressed the lights came on.  The auctions are very tight and you really have to be judicious with your bids.  Greater familiarity with the goods produced and where they are needed would definitely help in planning as well.  In a way, the game seems to share some superficial features with Taj Mahal, regarding the connectivity of your factories/technologies, planning and budgeting bidding resources for the right moment, etc.  I really need to play this again to accurately rate it - I feel it could go up with further play.

The auction mechanic where you get the money from items you sell to other players but can always keep the item you are selling is the heart of this game. Board position ensures that players typically have different valuations for the same item. It is up to the auctioneer to evaluate everyone's interest and decide whatto put up and when to pull out.

Not a very clean game at all. Felt convoluted and awkward. An example of this is the materials cards - why would anyone actually bid on them. They are just a dollar each at the end of the day. Another is the auction method; Money is way too tight to offer more than $1 (on rare occassion $2 MAX) - which in turn kills the auction fun, not to mention if a player pulls a bad auction set they are screwed for the next 4 turns for cash! I won't be playing this one again. Surprising the same guy who made China and Hansa! (Also my other 2 and 3)

The Good: Fun game. One of those games that I find myself thinking about what-if's the next day (a good sign). Interesting strategic bidding game. Unique bidding mechanic. Multiple paths towards victory.

The Bad: My version is in German, and paste-ups would take a lot of time to do. However, thanks to a friend, I found out that the game is playable in it's raw German state, if you can put up with some German nouns (fortunately several of them read similar to the English word!). Also a little bit of a learning curve for the mechanics, as the unique bidding mechanic and the paths to victory take some getting used to. However, in my opinion, this game is worth the time.

Michael Schacht does it again with this one! The design is so sexy that I simply had to have it, and FairPlayGames had it on sale for $10.85, so the price was right, too. The game is an auction/building game, with the unmistakably Schachtian linking element added in for some clever strategic play. Paste-Ups are totally not necessary for the game, but I imagine they might add to others' enjoyment. I rather find the German to be charming... Upgraded from 8 to 9 -- one of my favorites!

Only downside, no one else seems to like it. Why?!

A quite fun auction-game. Suffers some playable issues: 1) connections between buildings and technologies after some of them have been built; 2) who is the "king" of different kind of resources. But, when you find it from München with the price of 5e, it wasn't a big problem to make a decision should I buy or not...

I think the auction mechanic in Industria is probably the best I've played with.  I really enjoy that to get any real money you need to auction some items but if you really need one of the tiles that is in the auction set you have the ability to trump it.  
We actually play with a few modified rules:  You can't buy from the bank even for items from past eras, If someone fails to build something from a past era you can purchase the option to build from them for the cost of building the item (i.e. if an item cost 3 to build you would pay 3 to Joe who has the card and then 3 to the bank plus any raw materials required to build it and it would be yours), we also have added several additional connections and series of connections are worth additional points.  We really enjoy the changes and find provides a lot more oportunity for strategy.

RATING: 6
Tight auction game which is very unforgiving.  Pick a strategy and seek to keep to it for earning points whether it be focusing on technology, factories, or bonus tiles and certain factories and keep connections in mind for all options.  Figuring out the true value of each tile is difficult out of the gate and will likely require several plays.  Not necessarily hard to pick up, but this is definitely not a game for someone who's looking to play a light game without much thought.

RATING: 7.5
Rather interesting Euro, a notch above typical. Money is tight. Lots of choices. Whether to auction a tile or take a tile and pass the auction becomes a fine bluffing mechanism. Very competitive, with a dash of luck. Best with 4. Is going last a disadvantage?

The complex relationships between the technologies, the production buildings and the resources make this game fairly heavy as each decision during the auctions and building phases must be carefully planned. It works well with 3 and 4.

At university I had a friend called Matt who when meeting people always made a terrible first impression but if you stuck around would quickly realise that he was a great guy.  Industria is Matt in game form - key auctions, elusive victory points, resources, a multitude of symbols and any early mistake punished all contrive to hurt your head and feel bewildered (not a game for a group of newbies) but stick with it because after the first few turns the game reveals itself to be a well balanced structured game with a certain gaming logic and apparently several routes to victory (as always this may transpire to be several routes to come second but what the heck).  Your first game will always be one of exploring the mechanics and systems but you will eagerly look forward to the next game when you can put your ideas in practice.  After my first game I think this is the start of a long friendship.

An almost pure auction game with several scoring mechanisms and a little peripheral resource management. money management is nasty in this game, despite the influx of money every round.

Still, the small pools of auction goods, and their limited impact on your options (they do shape what you want to buy later a bit, but don't fundamentally change how you play the game), while thematic, feel a bit too tight, and I fear the game is liable to show most of what it has in a couple of plays.

Next to classic auction games like Ra and Modern Art, Industria is just a bit too clunky, and there's not enough meat on the bones to measure up to something like Princes of Florence or Amun-Re. It's just betwixt and between. Not bad, but nothing special, either.

The auctions can turn into "which tile do I want"....then again if you want money you have to auction something other people want. More play will prove better or worse here. UPDATE: now a 7.5 from 6....much better with sucessive plays...best with 4 IMHO.

Played it at the Spiel03 and bought it immediately, so obviously I was impressed. Although it plays wildly different from Amun-Re, there are some strong similarities in its dynamics: the development of both games is tightly scripted (2x3 rounds with the flood inbetween in Amun-Re, 5 epochs in Industria), but the order in which the commodities (or provinces for Amun-Re) are drawn makes for interesting and varied choices. Maybe I'll even win some time ...

Primer juego el 31 de diciembre de 2004. Me impresionó incluso más que PoF: tiene más de subasta (con un entretenido sistema para molestar al subastador), es más sencillo y con varias vías para el triunfo.
El tablero es muy tractivo, aunque esté en alemán.
Preferí traducir en una hoja los términos alemanes; probablemente tras algunos juegos, nos familiarizaremos y aprenderemos algunas palabras de ese idioma, como agregado :-)
UPDATE: bajo ranking de 9 a 8, porque es bueno, pero los remates hacen difícil la planificación, tornándolo demasiado impredecible.

Pretty looking game with a loose, abstract feel.  I think the four player game can be flawed if players don't pass.  There is probably a satisfactory solution though.  

After thinking about this here is my suggestion.  A player puts a tile up for auction.  If the auctioneer doesn't take this first item he can put a second item up for sale.  After this item is auctioned (regardless of who wins) the auctioneer passes to the left.  I don't have the time anymore to playtest this though...

This game is definitely not as elegant as Web of Power or Hansa.  But I definitely like how all of the items mesh for VP's.

Plays very similarly to Goa, but not as elegant. I don't like the fact that the person controlling the auction can purchase the tile for free; the decision to take the tile or the money is usually not as anguishing as Goa. Tile values are appropriately hard to figure out, which is mostly good, but there may be a little too much unknown (ie uncontrollable randomness) in the order of the auction for the weight of the game. I liked my experience, but Goa remains king.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'm really not sure what I think about this one.  It's an auction game but the auctioneer can decide to take the tile being auctioned for free (well, at the expense of not getting paid).  There's a lot of different ways to score points, some tough economic decisions and route-planning but you also have to deal with some luck in the tile-draw and the whims of your opponents.  I'd certainly play it again.

Being in an industrial band, I just couldn't pass up a game called Industria... ;-)  That aside, I generally like auction games.  This one is pretty fun, and with a surprisingly high screwage factor.  You need a bit of luck to win, because if you get stuck with only crappy tiles to auction off, you're gonna lose.  I think it's comparable to Goa as far as gameplay is concerned, but a bit faster, and because you can really screw each other, I'd say the interaction is felt more.  Fun game, a shame it's a game for 3-4 players, a hard to get prerequisite in our group as we're either 5 or 2...

Probably one of Michael Schacht's heaviest games. The novel mechanic in this game is that the start player is the auctioneer. He continues to auction off tiles  (taking the profits) until all tiles are gone, all players pass, or the auctioneer takes a tile for themselves. The next player then auctions off what is left. Players then build the tiles (factories, tehcnology, or bonus tiles). Factories produce goods that build other factories/technologies. Some factories and technologies are linked on the gameboard, and a player owning both links gain 3 VPs. Technology VPs range from 2 to 5 VPs, factory VPs range from 1 to 4 VPs. The crucial decisions in the game are as auctioneer do you try to play it fine and make as much money as possible with a risk of losing it all if you don't keep the tile you really need. As other players do you collude to pass and shaft the auctioneer? Do you play defence and take a tile that an opponent really needs. Can be very cutthroat amongst defensive gamers. The randomizer is that the order of the tiles comes out different, so you could be put at a disadvantage if what you need comes out at the wrong time; also in a 4 player game, the last player will miss out on 1 start player turn (so they will be an auctioneer one less time compared to their opponents), this may turn out not to be a disadvantage at all. Seems to play best with 4 players; in 3 players, there is less money, thus your turn as auctioneer usually involves keeping a tile, and leaves it more vulnerable to luck of the draw, but easier to analyze.

RATING: 4
Unique bidding/ income system is the fatal flaw here. If you have a full selection to put up for auction on your turn you earn a lot. However if there's just one thing or rubbish on your turn, you get nothing and then auctioneer immediately moves on. Can be devastating, very unfair and hard to manage. Apart from this the game is quite good! Game has been revised but I feel this problem remains:

I'm sufficiently impressed after my first play to say that this will see a fair amount of table time in the coming months. Is there enough here to last longer? Only time will tell, but it seems like the limited variety of items and scoring paths may limit its shelf life. Until that time, though, I'll enjoy the ride. 2nd play with 3 instead of 4 was still enjoyable but I would rather stick with this as a 4-player-only game. With 3, the auctions are too unbalanced, the money clogs up too easily, and it just feels too limited. Though I liked it less this time, I think my rating of it as a 4-player may eventually climb to 9, assuming it can handle another 3-5 plays without getting stale. ***UPDATE 7/31/04*** Well, the rating actually dropped to a 7 after we realize dhow much of a disadvantage the 4th player is put in. It's a shame that this isn't addressed at all with some kind of fix.

Despite limited experience with the game, I think it is very well designed and should have lots of replay value.  I like the layout of the board and the auctions were fairly intense.  One player was out of the running early on and had no hope of catching up - maybe there is little you can do to compensate for early mistakes?

Bidding, bidding, bidding, man everything is bidding. They're also tight little auctions, with some people not interested, but if you are, being bid up by just 1 dollar more than you want to pay can be really painful and upset your strategy enough to force you down a new path. This kind of tight chaos can be attractive to some, but just too frustrating for me, especially as bidding ennui overflows halfway through the game.

What I like:
- Once-around auction format
- No attacks, screwage, etc (outside of the auctions)
- Kind of a fun theme
- Meaty game in 90 minutes (first-ever 3p game was 80)

What I don't like:
- Theme doesn't match mechanics all that well
- 60 auctions is a lot in one game
- The game can be pretty fragile with first-timers
- Can lead to some AP at times, especially in the end-game (?)
- The last couple rounds have few roads, and the point values don't increase, so it's a bit anti-climatic.
- Skipping the 5th epoch with 3p messes up the game, so I would play with the variant to go all 5 epochs.
- No hidden scoring, so could encourage leader-bashing

I played with the original Industria rules 6 times. I want to mix in some rules from the re-implementation (Industry) to see if they improve the game or not. Based on one game with the Industry auctioneer rule (must pay to take tiles), the consensus at the table was that the new rules are better, spreading the money around, and creating slightly more interesting decisions.

Like many auction games, this one would shine with a group who played it together enough to know not only the tiles and their values, but also to see patterns in each other's preferences. When experienced players and first-timers are in the same game, some newbs are going to have a hard time staying competitive, and can severely tilt the game in favor of one player. On the other hand, one first-timer (who doesn't like auction games) beat 3 of us who had played before.

Two people have said that it doesn't feel like an auction game (I disagree). Both have said that you are standing in line to get stuff, but you can pay to jump to the front of the line if you want.

The 2.7 weight seems about right. It is a thinky game with lots of double-guessing in the auctions. Definitely requires a lot of long-term strategy as well as mid-term and short-term tactics.

This is a very light game about industrial progress. It seemed a good idea since it took one of the many elements from "Civilization the boardgame" amd made a light playable game out of it. But it was a bit too light to my mind. I like some more difficult challanges when it comes to development/progress themed games. It's a nice family game I guess, where players of different age groups may have a fairly even go on being the winner.

Based on one play: Each turn one player starts as the auctioneer and with each other making one bid they get to choose whether they want to keep the tile for auction to themselves and give the next player a chance to be the auctioneer or take the highest bid and continue auctioning the next tile. You gain tiles on the board that give you points and help you produce items. You also get bonus points for having several linked building and if you won a bonus tile, having buildings with the matching symbol. If you are not going to be the auctioneer for a while, you must really manage your money as there is not that much going around and you also need it to build. Nothing really stands out, a basic mechanic with a lot of money management and watching what others will likely bid on.

This game is, at its heart, a once-around auction game like Goa or Medici.  You essentially only make money by people paying you as the auctioneer, which can take a while to come back around to you in a 4-player game.  So, money is very tight, and even if you have a stack of it, it's certainly worth holding onto some from turn to turn.  It's a challenge to figure out how much things are worth in the game, especially since you often have to spend more money to actually play the item.  I really do like the multiple ways to score, though--in addition to the items' intrinsic VP value, you also get points for related items (denoted by connections on the game board), and similar icons.  I really do like the theme and art as well.  This is a good, if sometimes difficult, game.

Industria is a good game; as with all auction games I need more experience to see what the various items are worth, but I enjoyed my first play anyway. But I don't know if I'd choose to play Industria often when I can also play Ra, an even better auction game.

Not bad, nothing great. Must be replayed. Auction based game without many other elements: there are obvious very convenient cards and if you're the auctioneer you can take them for free. The game is well balanced, but if you're lucky enough being the auctioneer there's no tactics that can avoid you to win. Technology are not related to industries (?), bonus cards are IMHO some what not very clear. Anyway, would be a 7 if the theme was not so bad: how can you play with oil, cement, computers, and such sad things? The development theme could be used with much better elements.

A rather simple economy/auction game with a thousand ways of dragging in AP. I've never been much into economic optimization and this makes no exception. Board is clear and functional, gaming pieces informative enough even with foreign language text.

If the gaming time were actually an hour, I might be able to try this again but in this situation.. nope.

This is Brass' special needs little brother. I have played this game 3 times now, and I still don't know if any dominant strategy has surfaced. I don't know if  that's because all strategy is lost in the gameplay, or if I just don't know how to play it at all. I wouldn't be surprised either way. However, I think that actually adds to the fun, as no one has dominated a game yet. Everything being in German adds to the silliness, as no one in our group knows the language.

Absolutely fantastic!  It's a very tight, well balanced, and exciting game that reminds me A LOT of 'Taj Mahal'.  But, it takes away all the things I don't like about 'Taj Mahal' (like bluffing) which is great.  Theme works great too!  A bit of a learning curve, need one full game to grasp it.  Plays great with 3, but I question the replay value of it, and I wonder if there is too much luck in the drawing of the auction cards. Definitely my favorite game from Essen '03 however.  Replayability is low, rating has dropped.

RATING: 1
Did I miss something here?  Perhaps the translation is incorrect.  One dollar per turn?  How are we supposed to buy technologies and resources and bid for turn order when you only get 9 dollars during the whole game?  The lack of cash leads to paralysis. The game ends up being about what you can't afford to do.  Really, this 'unofficial' translation I have must be messed up.

Second playing which I felt played better with 4. I think there is far too many elements such as bonuses and who produces what to consider, that I couldn't sense the state of competition, hence I didn't get excited. Maybe with more plays my calculating will get easier, but the gameplay isn't fun enough. The auctions are interesting, deducing which order to do them to maximise cashflow and which and when to take the freebie. I also like the overview of the industrial history that the game portrays.

The game actually plays out a lot better than a reading of the rules made it seem like it would. Good player interaction, tough choices, and an auction system that eliminates the 'guaranteed win' of outbidding everyone else. Got it in a trade without knowing for sure what I'd get, and glad I took the chance. However, I traded it for another game I like even better.

RATING: 6
Not one of the designer's brighter games, it still offers some interesting decisions through the auction mechanic where you lose the role of the auctioneer if you "buy" your own auction. Bit too straightforward - you know what tiles you have to collect - but it is breezy, and well balanced.

An interesting auction and set-collection game. Players take turns auctioning items with different characteristics; the auctioneer can accept the highest bid, or keep the item for himself.

At first glance it may look like an overly long auction game. It is not; auctioning is refreshingly simple and quick, and your take on it will always be based on your tabletop strategy for racking up victory points. Since there are a good number of avenues for winning, the game is fast-moving and holds interest to the end. I would advise newcomers to play a couple epochs purely for "learning" the game, before attempting to really dig it. Some experience with the very detailed board is a must for truly inspired play.

Schacht auction / planning game with tight money. If you like planning and auction games (the PoF / Amun Re / Goa family) you'll really enjoy this, as it's faster, less random, and more interactive than the above. It feels much lighter because it's quick and clean, but there's a fair bit of depth.

The German edition is playable for English speakers as is, with no pasteups or player aids needed. All you need is the English rulebook download and you're good to go.

But! It is really only a four player game.

Update: Hey, it's okay with 3. Reaffirming its eightness.

Update: I wish it had more money... making change all the time is tiresome. Back down to 7 for the moment.

Two or three games will enlighten you with a whole other level of understanding with this game. But will you get that far? Money is extremely tight, and I know that's often said, but here it can lead to some very strange auction values, which is probably my main issue with the game.

This is the finest auction game IMHO, however it has been a long time since I have played Ra.

Not a bad game.  I kinda think you really need to have your strategy planned at the outset, or you get left behind building things in epochs which have already been scored.  This makes it not as good for first-time players.  Id' definitely give it another shot, though.

An interesting auction game with a pseudo-production element. I found it innovative and exciting throughout, though I have some questions about how disadvantaged player #4 is & some about how hosed an auctioneer can get if he turns up bad tiles.

The downsides are that there is a LOT going on and the auction system introduces fairly significant luck of the draw (you really want good tiles when it's your turn to be the auctioneer).  The upsides are that it fits together *very* well and the auction system is quite fresh and causes quite a bit of tension.  I love how the money is so tight.

Cool Beans!  I'd had this game on my shelf for ages and it was bugging the heck out of me that I hadn't played it.

Well, for good reason.  This is a really tight system that adds a nice twist as it adds an overide to the auctioneer, but you have to balance just taking a tile with getting money that you so desperately need.

The game has some minor problems in that crap tiles will put you farther behind through no fault of your own, and the first two players have a distinct advantage in getting more turns, thus more income and more control.  That said, these don't throw the game all that much.  These problems aren't overwhelming in a three player game, but do make this a game that I wouldn't ever play with four.

Interesting auction mechanic...you get to be the auctioneer until you decide to take something or you put something up for auction that no one bids on.  In both cases, you get the item for free, and the next person becomes the auctioneer.  Money for all sales goes to the auctioneer.

There are three to four items put up at a time, and there is a building phase after all have been sold or picked up.  Then more items are placed up for bid.  Every three to four rounds, the game enters a new era of technology, so factories that are purchased early in the game can become obselete.  

I enjoyed my one play, but it did feel rather dry and forced in places.  It's not really an economic engine game so much as a resource management game, although control of certain key factories can make life easier, resource-wise.  I would certainly play again, but I don't know what kind of longer term replay this game will have for me.

Very intense the entire way through.  The money is tight, the decisions are tough, and the competition is fierce.  You need to have an overall plan, yet be flexible enough to adapt depending upon when the tiles appear.  The first game is more to make yourself aware of the different approaches to the game.  This well-designed game could probably be used in a business school course, since it reasonably simulates running a business better than most games.  Definitely a thinking person's game.

Many in my game group complain that they "don't get it."  Not that they don't understand the game at all, just that the whole part of the game where you must build stuff in an epoch, but the factories to make resources to build that stuff must be built in that era also.  I have played 9 times and thoroughly enjoyed it.  However I fear that long-term it has some issues which will lower replayability.  For one thing, there is a lot of luck in what tiles you draw when you are auctioning.  Second, it seems *almost* random what income you get from your auctions.  In one game, I was out of it from the beginning because I tried to auction what i considered a very good tile (Segewerks) first, and got zero bids on it, in a game where passing out auctions was otherwise rare.  The second problem, in the same vein, is that LeaderHosen (aka Bash the Leader) can be easy at times, by players colluding to never bid on one person's auctions.  Third, at least in our group we have yet to discover enough different strategies to make it interesting long term.  This could change over time as people begin to finally "get" the game, if ever.

Tense. Need to get cash. Need to get tiles. Need to get required resources. Need to think hard about what you put up for auction. Need to time placement as many tiles can only be built after other tiles. The Germanness of it all freaks some people out.

While [gameid=66076] improves a few rules, the component cost-cutting (combined with an hilariously inflated price) means that I prefer Industria by far. The rule changes can generally be incorporated into Industria anyway.

You bid for buildings, action tiles and technologies. Every round there is a starting player. The starting player chose 1 from 3 tiles for bidding. When someone will buy the tile, you can take the money and give the tile, or you take the tile and the next player chose the next tile for bidding. 

Selling the tiles is the main way to get money. You need money to play buildings. Buildings give you points, sometimes less points but resources. You need resources to play some buildings and technologies (technologies need never money, but resources and bringing more points than buildings). When you don1t have a resource, you can buy it from a other player, when the building is build.

You can bid also for tiles that gives bonus points for some buildings. You become also bonus points for roads between buildings. So some buildings are more important for some players (maybe not so many standard points, but bonus points for roads/tiles).

A clever bidding game, but with 3 players some buildings are to expensive (you need them in the last round, that you play only with 4 players). It seems with 4 players you will have not so much control of the game like in the 3 player game.

I think it's a good game. I like the auctioning mechanism and the many ways to victory. 

The game is language independent unless you really want to know what you're buying instead of just "a factory that produces stahl". It would be nice if there was a quick way to distinguish between the resources with some symbols or colored text no matter what language it's in.

This game feels like an uphill battle against overly tight resources for the entire duration of the game.  I don't mind games with tight resources, such as Age of Steam, but in this case it seems way too tight.  There is never a point where you can get rolling, since new raw materials are introduced each era.  The real killer though, is that bad tile draws on the auctioneer's part can completely doom him to the poor house through no fault of his own.

A very good and solid game but it's just a little too "samey" to rise to the hights of true giants like Power Grid. Still, I'll be play this anytime. Edit 09/01/07: Recent play showed that this game is made up by "too many auctions" which makes it feel quite repeative. Ok game but I think I'm growing out of it.

A clever auction game where managing a very limited cash flow and carefully selecting items to be put up for bid or purchased is the critical element. Not for everyone, as there is little margin for error - a poor choice can easily put you out of the running ...

I'll stand by my original statement - this game is a little on the dry side, and the fixed ending doesn't do much for me. But the limited resources, limited build and sell/keep auction mechanic is sweet. Hence, I've bumped up my rating a bit.

Played once and won!  Money seems very tight unless you just accept every offer when you are the auctioneer.  I was able to win by getting the anchor and railroad track bonus tiles and then buying those buildings which seem to not have connections so most of the other players didn't bid on them.

After sitting on my shelf for two years, I finally got the chance to play this with three players. And...I absolutely liked it! After reading the manual I was sceptical, but I am really glad that I gave it a go regardless. We played for about two hours, and everybody would have loved to play a second game. Just point out that there is a very limited amount of money in the game, so people give more thought to their bids. The auctioning mechanic is brilliant and can make each auction quite suspenseful. We had someone draw bad tiles a couple of times, but she had no problems recovering from this during the game (she ended one point short of victory).
UPDATE: Played it a couple of times now, and still like it immensely. Therefore, upped my rating to an 8. However, please be aware that I only played 3-player games sofar. Rating might be lower with 4. One of Michael Schacht's best designs.

Would be even better if there was an English version- not that the theme is so rich as to make this unplayable (it isn't, and I still enjoy it), but it would at least give the paths something resembling "meaning".

Michael Schact makes interesting bidding games. I like building system and theme in this game. It is basically simple, but bonus conditions complicated situations - in a good way.

RATING: 4.5
Initial impression - limited plays 

Highly Frustrating Components-wise:  Board is in German; lack of use of icons for resources; worst part is rulebook, some rules - particularly scoring - somewhat vague, examples are the simplest and least helpful possible examples. 
Certain tiles may be guaranteed to be unplayable based on the order of the tile draw.

RATING: 7
Schacht has crafted a fascinating auction game which offers numerous point making combinations and exhibits solid player interaction. Industria seems to me to be the older brother to Mogul where the confusing, albeit enjoyable, stock rules are replaced by a Knizia-lite scoring system. There is a touch of RA in here in its timing issues, and the way that prior auctions build on each other. The chain creating nature of factories, technologies and resources is a unique elegant scoring mechanism that is patently Schacht, the creator of Kardinal & Konig and Paris Paris, both which feature a similiar scoring option. Queen Games does a very solid job in terms of production. The only downside is the lack of a english translated board. Knowing what the items are enhances the connections between auctioned items. But I will be willing to work through this game again. Update: Still like it but another auction game has really grabbed me. That darned Knizia!

Played once, four player.

Pros: Pretty. Fun German words. Lots of interactions to explore.

Cons: Yet another auction game. A tad dry. A bad tile draw can really hurt. Tech felt tacked on.

In the end, decent enough game. Just not, I think, my cup of tea.

This is a nice surprise of a game!  The bidding mechanics force players to make decisions on what to put up for bid using a kind of backwards logic, and estimating what's worth what to other people can make for a kind of tension that I like in my games.  It's easy to get hosed due to the tile draw, but I see that as a minor aspect to the game, since it's usually just one turn out of many.  Also, it seems that the game can take a weird turn where everyone is just putting up for bid the one tile he really wants, and then passing the rest to the next person.

This game did remind of Hansa, and so I really liked this. It's an auction game, so the Hansa reminding was on some strange level. It's the best auction game I have played, that I can say.

And It just raised its grade two points after some weeks of me owning it

June-2014: Might not be the best auction game ever but the rotation of money between players still makes it one of my favourite games of all time. And yes Industria is better then the never version called Industry. Yeah I know this is unlogical as they basiclly is the same game but the feeling in Industria is better.

I'm still not all that certain that the 4th player isn't too crippled, but there's a lot to like here.  The evaluation of tiles is very hard, and the auction/drafting creates some significant decision points every turn.  I strongly wish there were finer money gradations, a fault I find with several eurogames (Age of Steam, Traders of Genoa, Zoosim).

By far my favorite Schacht, and I guess by the rating that's saying something. He's very good at a sort of central idea that I just don't like: how much will you help the next player?

I'm not good at planning ahead in games, I'm not good at bidding, and I'm really not good at the whole industrial/economic theme. I'm sure this is a very good game and it's certainly easy to get the hang of, but I find it hard to do well in simply because it's not really my kind of game. I like the way the auctioning goes and I like the concept of moving through eras. Some other elements of this game I do quite like but overall it's not the best experience for me.

RATING: 7
Industria is a heavy auction game.  Players compete across 4 or 5 eras of time and acquire victory points by purchasing key tiles in auction.  The neat twist is that players earn money by taking turns being the auctioneer, and care must be taken since money is so tight!

(1 play - 4 players) I didn't have a clear cut strategy on how to win toward the very end of the game. I never had any time to play that strategy. I won anyway - I got very lucky - Me and #2 had to get down to the money to break the tie (I think that was tie breaker #3).

RATING: 8
Pleasantly surprised by this one.  Has grown on my groups of gaming friends as we've played it more.  A bidding game where turns revolve around buying industries and industrial advances and then applying them to one's own industrial dynasty.

Out of 5, I give it...
2 in complexity; although it looks (to some) like it's complicated, the rules are actually quite simple and make sense for the theme, which always helps.  Don't be fooled, though -- this lack of complexity doesn't make the game shallow!
3 in choice; bidding games are generally quite high on choices, although the random allocation of tiles to be auctioned makes life a little harder for those of us who are control freaks.
4 in conversation; again, bidding games will naturally score quite highly on this, and the fact that players need to check on who's got which resources keeps interaction going even into the building phases.

Beautiful game from Queen.  The box, artwork, tiles, board...all top notch.  Isn't as elegant as it probably should be, but it tries to do a lot and most of it succeeds.  The auction mechanic seems a bit off, but we've only played it once.

Wow.  I didn't figure out what I did wrong my first game until about the 3rd Epoch...but when it hit, it was like a freight train.  Simple rules...DEEP relationships between buildings/technologies.  Not to mention the stuff going on in the auctions themselves (we didn't use the "screw the auctioneer" choice *nearly* enough in our first game).  Can't wait to play this again.  Soon.

RATING: 8
I do find these sort of games quite fascinating and Bora Bora is no exception. All of Feld's games recently have similar principles although to be fair, mechanically they all offer something very different. However, I do wonder if I have too many of them because I never play any of them enough and my memories blend into each other.

usual Feld game. Lot of stuff going around, need to think about everything and doing a bit of everything if you want to be the winner. Nice art but not his best game IMHO

RATING: 8.5
Another point-grab fest, where players are "islanders" trying to score the most points over 6 rounds.  Once again, theme takes a backseat to mechanics, but the mechanics work very well, and the game scales well from 2-4 players.  Like Feld's Trajan, there is no real punitive element here, rather a feeling of wanting to do more than you can, and potentially missing scoring opportunities if you don't/can't play optimally.

A new central dice mechanic is introduced, which is innovative as an action selection mechanism, but as with all things dice, it can also lead to frustration due to the rolls; it's so well implemented that the rolls can *mostly* be overcome through smart play.  

Essentially on your turn you roll 3 dice, and then in turn order place a die on an action with the caveat that only lower die can be placed if other die are already there.  You then execute the action immediately, and they are: 1)place/expand your huts, which can score points immediately, and/or at the end of the game, and which gives you a resource (which is needed for building) and this also clears room on your board, which is helpful, 2) grab a man/woman tile, which is then placed on your board (this is why you want the room cleared on the board), and these tiles allow for "extra actions" during another phase of each round, 3) build a building, which scores points and allows for a bonus fire action (a small but useful action that gives god cards or god offerings, and turn order advancement or shell currency), 4) make an offering to the gods, which scores points each round (think of it as an investment), gives a fire action, and potentially gives a god tile (a wild card essentially), and 5) convert die pips into: points and/or resources, and/or god cards, and/or offerings.

The next phase after die action selection is man/woman action, where you can activate the ability of 1 man and 1 woman.  The last phase is where turn order is evaluated (it is generally good to go first) and you score points for being further along the turn order track, temple scoring evaluation, jewelry purchasing (use shells and score points for purchasing), and finally task tile completion, which are conditions you need to meet to score points.  At the end of the game, there is significant final scoring as well, as you score for completing several different conditions (such as task-tile completion, jewelry purchases, board-clearing etc.), and you also score your hut placements if they are still "safe".  At any time during gameplay you can also play a god card + offering to improve/facilitate/rulebend your action(s).

There are alot of bits, so setup is a bit of a pain, the components are generally high quality, the weight is about medium, the scalability is good, and the gameplay is generally enjoyable.  Overall another successful Feld design.

Almost offensive theme wise. Definition of point salad. Boring. Castles of Burgundy does everything better and more efficiently.

RATING: 8
OK.  The term point salad is used a lot for Feld games, but I think this one takes the cake.  It's almost like he had two ideas for games and smashed them both together in this one.  I like it, but it is a bear to teach and is one of the few games where I have actually had people laugh at me during the rules explanation.  It gets a bit silly.

Like other good euros though, once enough people learn it it will be fun to play when you don't have to put in the time to teach it.  There isn't anything too challenging here, but there is a lot of it.

RATING: 7
Fairly complex game with a fun tribal theme. Many possible actions per turn and beautiful board. However, it amounts to rolling dice, using dice in one of many  ways to get points, repeating. I normally love dice, but depending on how you roll, it can be very limiting. Then, the game ends in a huge scoring phase. Upon replay, I like this game a lot more. I would not suggest this game to people who don't have experience with medium-weight games but once everyone grasps the game, it gets very exciting. In my last game, the final round was a super-stressful experience as everyone was desperate to squeeze out a few more points while others blocked them. 

If you have a regular gaming group of the same people, then it's a solid addition to your collection. If you play with many different people the way I do, then the somewhat-confusing rules and complicated iconography can make it difficult to get it to the table.

RATING: 6
I've played and enjoyed many of Feld's titles. (I have a particular fondness for Luna). With this experience in mind, I found Bora Bora to be a surprisingly sprawling design. There is nothing streamlined here: just a huge, convoluted melting pot of different mechanics which don't really jar with each other, but don't sit entirely comfortably either. We have set-collection in a variety of forms, worker-placement, action-selection by dice placement, area-control, resource-management, turn-order manipulation. We've seen all of these elements before in tighter Feld games such as Castles of Burgundy, and In The Year of the Dragon: Bora Bora has nothing very innovative to offer. 

The game is an enjoyable, and difficult, puzzle to work on; primarily playing solitaire with occasional opportunities for blocking. Feld appears to be aiming to provide us with a game of great strategic depth, but the complexity here mainly comes from the dense opaqueness of the myriad mechanics. The gaudiness of the graphic design only makes it all harder to follow.

The evening I played Bora Bora, I also played Vikings and Keyflower. The streamlined, accessible rules, clever mechanics and depth of decision-making, in Vikings, showed Bora Bora up as the lumbering beast it is. Keyflower, with its twists and quirks on a tried-and-tested worker-placement formula, made the genre seem fresh, where Bora Bora feels a little old-hat.

This is definitely a game that a group could get their teeth stuck into, and enjoy exploring over a series of games, but it doesn't really offer anything that you couldn't find elsewhere in a more controlled package.

RATING: 8
Bora Bora is a colorful game & the combination of cute huts, variety of men & women who lives in the huts, various type of fish, jewelries, men getting tattoed & women collecting shells & sending priests to temple really felt island-ish & so Bora Bora! Some of the best elements are the Helper action, the God cards & fire bonus. The gameplay is actually very easy, with 3 players, you just need to choose between 6 actions available, but the hard part comes from choosing the right dice, at the right action spot & the right timing for everything. Easily one of the best Feld game.

The game is actually easy, put dice on any of the 5 action tiles & you're done but you really need to plan your strategy well & pick your path to success, and that also depends on the task tiles you got. Man & Woman action in Phase B is very helpful towards achieving your personal goal. Gods are always there to help you too, if you have the offering to sacrifice. As always, you will not be able to do everything & you need to specialize.

Compared to Trajan & Burgundy, Bora Bora gameplay & boards are a bit messy & busy, not as smooth as the other 2 games. In summary, 6 rounds with 3 phases each round - roll dice & choose between 5/6/7 actions depends on player count (lower dice placement rule/blocking mechanism) then man+woman action (bonus) then status(turn order)-temple-jewelry-task update. What I like about the game is the various ways to get points, it rewards specialization, 6 rounds a bit shorter to do everything you want to do. It's colorful & have cute hut meeples. It has men & women you can recruit to help you advance your tribe & maybe complete a task or two. You can buy jewelry using shells collected by women which feels the most island-ish thing to do in the game. I need to buy new accessory box for the components & tokens.

Everything works well mechanically (just forget the theme). The only problem is that Bora Bora suffers from the poor graphic design. Sure it's colourful and the art is ok but it is too hard to distinguish especially the worker/villager tiles from each other. I'm sure that once you get used to them you're good, but at least in the beginning the aforementioned issue makes the game a bit too labourious.

RATING: 8
Bora Bora is a solid Feld game, but hasn't passed Castles of Burgundy as my favorite.  It's an interesting Euro with lots of ways to score points and lots of options.  The use of the dice in the game is interesting and there are ways to mitigate the randomness, as is common in Feld games.  The main and player boards are a bit intimidating and busy, but once the game is learned, most everything you need to know to play can be found on them and they make sense.

So is this game different enough from Burgundy to warrant having both?  That depends on the person.  If you're a fan of Feld or Euros in general and have the money/shelf space to own lots of similar games, there are enough nuances between them to justify owning both.  If you want to keep your game collection trim and avoid having more than one game with similar mechanisms, you can get by having only one.  Bora Bora feels a bit more interactive than Burgundy, which is a little more on the multiplayer solitaire side.  There are more ways to directly interact with opponents in BB, though you can certainly still win without trying to screw your opponents.  I personally prefer Burgundy because of the tile-laying aspect of the player boards, but they're both very good games.

Not my favorite Stefan Feld but certainly no slouch. Bora Bora is a very big very pretty "too clever for its own good" game with a lot of mechanisms crammed into one box. I think that it has some interesting things going on like a die based action drafting mechanism where you place a die on one of several Gods to trigger an associated action. Then, only dice that have lower numbers can be played on those spaces which means you can block or not block other drafts of that action. It leads to a sort of push your luck situation during play because you can want to use a given action multiple times but if you leave the god open by playing higher numbered dice on it to use the God's action than other players can use it too and possibly block you etc. the two biggest obstacles to me being able to get this to the table more are that set up time is significant due to there being so many components, and some of my game group doesn't like how much information in the game is public knowledge. They think this makes the game too front loaded and predictable. Personally, I can't keep track of all the information as it is a more than typical Feld point salad but I can understand the criticism. My personal hang up with the game is more minor in that I like so many of Feld's other games more that they out compete bora bora when I am deciding what to bring to game night. Still, I will probably be trying to bring this themeless sea horse out again soon as even a bad Feld is a good game IMO.

Designed by Stefan Feld.... Very good unique game but a the same time weird and complex.  It uses some unusual  mechanics to take actions and score points, that give this game a very original feeling. Uses lots of way to score points and different path to victory to remark that there is no coincidence it is a S. Feld game. I enjoy playing this game, recognizing at the same time that is not better than, or even close to be the new Trayan.

What a deliciously intricate Feld-ian game.  Well, I have to admit, I think [b]Bora Bora[/b] reached the threshold of complexity I want in his games.  And maybe passed it a bit.  There are almost too many paths to victory here.  It's hard to get an idea if you are doing any better than your opponents.  It's brilliant, but a little tough.  It's coming up too close to the wrong side of the "work versus fun" scale.  Is this where Feld and I part ways?  That being said, the graphic design is a marvel.  So many details, so many pictograms, so many references...and all so clear!

+ The total action limit puts pressure on each decision; The balance of usefulness of high dice versus the blockading usage of low dice is well done.
- The handling and shuffling of the various tiles is quite a chore!


Why it's previously-owned:
This is a very solid game that I would never turn down playing.  However, it is very unlikely that it would be the game that I pick when looking through my whole collection for a gaming evening.  
This got traded in a big online trade.

Abstract:
Bora Bora is about cultivating a community in the South Pacific. It is a heavy worker placement game by Stefan Feld using dice as worker. The pips on the dice define what actions a player can do.

Core actions:
a) Gain a male/female tile (for engine-building, extra actions, or fulfilling certain tasks)
b) Expand: place a hut on an adjacent area on the central board to gain resources and possible victory points (fish tiles)
c) Build: discard prepared resources to place a building tile onto the player board to gain victory points and additional boni
d) Temple: send a priest to the temple track (for a possible god tile and victory points at the end of a round)
e) Helper: trade pips for resources, cards, and actions
f) Fishing: score 2 victory points

Pros:
+ Dice used as workers (my favorite mechanism): pips on dice determine what actions are available
+ Each player has changing public personal tasks (not a sandbox game)
+ Limited number of actions each round lead to tough decision-making (every action counts)
+ Dice rolls and tasks requirements can be mitigated via god cards or god tiles: add flexibility by temporarily breaking the rules, mitigate randomness, use blocked actions, or achieve tasks
+ Mini expansion "orange god tiles" adds more mitigation for dice rolls (similar to the worker tiles in Castles of Burgundy)
+ Additional actions gained by male/female tiles (engine building)
+ The male/female tiles may lead to combination moves at the end of a round (planing ahead smartly)
+ Competition for the temple track: limited spots and the player with the most (highest valued) priests gains a very strong god tile
+ Huts used for gaining resources and for area control: the last player who places a hut in an area gains victory points for the adjacent fish tile at the end of the game
+ Plays well with all player counts. Available actions tiles depend on the player count. However, a 2-player game plays even more competitive because both players can focus on blocking each other
+ Artwork is bright and colorful, components are solid

Neutrals:
# More thematic than most of the other games by Stefan Feld
# High randomness in regard to the order of revealed jewelry/male/female/task tiles
# Tiles come in different order but there are no different elements or abilities per game (some tasks may not be revealed in a game)
# Competitive player interaction: temple track (kicking out priests or compete for god tile), the tattoo track (first player), bumping huts of other players (fish tile end game scoring), or block core actions with low valued dice -> players may only perform an already taken action if their pips are lower than the existing
# Good mix between tactical (available tiles, dice) and strategical elements (tasks, male/female engine building)
# No hidden information
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Rules are okay, but could provide more examples and a better overview of the game in general. The game is not that hard to learn but the rules are not intuitive
- How to score fishing tiles at the end of the game should be read very carefully in the rules
- Hard to teach: a lot of mechanics and missing reference of cards and player aids (an overview of the round and possible actions would help a lot!!)
- Player boards look busy and overwhelming on first play (good iconography, but still I wish it would be separated to hide it when teaching the game)
- Fiddly: lots of tiles and pieces
- Rather long set-up time
- Playing time can be quite long if players are prone to paralysis analysis (no hidden information except for random male/female and tasks tiles each round)
- Low dice values are still useful, however, mostly used to block opponents for denial play (public personal tasks make it even more obvious what a player wants to achieve)

Thoughts:
A less intuitive but more thematic, complex, and competitive design from Stefan Feld. I think Bora Bora does not make a good job to introduce new players into the game, it is missing additional aids and overviews. What I like most is the dice mechanism similar to Castles of Burgundy. Bora Bora is a competitive game because players can block other players with low valued dice on purpose. It is not a mechanic that I usually enjoy, however, I still like the game because of the dice drafting in combination with the additional actions provided by the male/females tiles at the end of a round - players try to find the right combination of actions to achieve a task. The tasks are very cool and give players a goal to pursue.

* Trajan (complexity-wise, number of mechanisms and tiles)

Very not for me.  There is tons going on and it all sort of works together but not in a clear manner.  Your dice rolls control so much for all the lack of control you have over them.  And the objectives are sometimes very annoying.  I spent the first half of the game doing whatever I could and the second half trying to score points based on the first half.  Felt very haphazard.

Others like this one a lot.  Good for them.  If enough of them are around, then I don't have to play it.  So give it a shot and see where it falls for you.

This is not an easy eurogame. It is set on the island of Bora Bora, where a plethora of actions are available to gain victory points and ultimately win the game. The game somewhat catches up with the theme: you have to colonize the island, go fishing, build houses, have a family (with lots of members), go pearl fishing, etc. A nice touch to the game is the action selection, where dice will decide if you will be able or not to select the desired action. This brings a bit of randomness into this fairly calculable game. The artwork is nice, the game mechanics are good (one might say that it is a typical Stefan Feld game).

I learned this one from someone who owned it but hadn't gotten a chance to play it yet, so it was 4 new players in a single game.  I think this game was somewhat interesting, and I'm impressed at Feld's ability to come up with Dice Action games.

The downside to this game is that I mixed my path through 4 or 5 different paths, and they all scored points.  There's a tiny amount of engine building in terms of the men and women you hire, but for the most part, any action you take leads to victory points, and there doesn't seem to be a reason for why things do what they do.

The game was varied, but forgettable.

Another Feld game that although it shares many things with Trajan and CoB it manages to be a game of its own. Visually it's one of the most beautiful games but don't let the looks fool you! It can be very cut-throat when you select actions with your dice blocking others and expect that you'll get the same treatment as well! I personaly prefer Trajan and CoB to this one.

I give Feld a lot of rope with his designs, and this is an enjoyable game, but his games feel like they are becoming increasingly bloated with different actions and different ways to score. This one has a bit more interest or tension for me than Trajan, which feels much less interactive, and forces you to sort of consider the whole board.

Nevertheless, it's one of those games where you set up the board for each round and then 80% of your setup gets wiped because nobody chose those tiles, which seems like a lazy way to add tension, decision-making, complexity.

Another good eurogame from Mr Feld. He keeps making really good games but he still hasn't found a real masterpiece. In Bora-Bora there are 7 simple actions but players have to use their dice in order to choose them. The dice mechanic works really well. There are a lot of ways to gain Victory Points. As always you have a lot of things to do but you dont have enough time. Nice production values.

A typical (or more kindly, "classic") Feld with lots going on. A good action selection mechanism, lots of routes to VPs, although the theme gets a bit lost ("VP salad") it's a good example of this kind of game. Possible downside is that I find myself conscious of mistakes, being blocked, not getting the tiles you need, etc., rather than being pleased about what I am accomplishing.

This is the game, though, that made me tire of "pure" Euros. Really, what is the point of game after game of slightly different "points salad"? I'll play them occasionally, and enjoy them, but don't seek them out like I used to as I want more player interaction, and especially narrative.

Bora Bora is my favorite Feld title for several reasons. The luck of rolling the dice is compensated perfectly by the game mechanics, allowing a large variety of decision for every die roll. There are several paths to victory which can be combined into multiple viable strategies, making the game interesting even after several plays. The graphic art is amazing, colorful and appealing and it help blend the theme into the game play. Stripping the game down of all theme, it is still a good game for the 'thinkers' - those who take a lot of time to make the (almost) perfect decisions.

Wow. Fascinating! Really fun brain tickling design. The dice placement mechanic is very, very good. I feel there is plenty of tension and player interaction. It may become my favorite Feld game. Pretty hard to get stuff done, but still very fun. So many possibilities.

The graphic design on this is brilliant. Gorgeous to behold and crystal clear. Iconography and visual cues are some of the best I've ever seen. Everything you need is on the board and player mats.

I found Bora Bora annoying and unpleasant.  The theme felt mangled as the designer sliced and diced polynesian thematic elements, beyond common sense recognition, in order to fit them into his chosen mechanics, which were not particularly compelling for me to play with.  And I found the art to be childish, garish & (curiously) disrespectful.   

The overall effect for me was to transform what is widely considered an earthly paradise (Bora Bora) into something that felt like a long grinding series of cheap garish cartoon gaming problems.  Significantly, this cartoon depiction of Bora Bora was NOT a place I wanted to reside for a few hours, or for that matter, even a few minutes.

The overall interactivity of play felt low, and in our four player game, the downtime between player turns seemed like an interminable waste of time.  By and large, I cared very little what combinations the other players were accomplishing; yet, I had to sit through them and watch them in full boredom.  Essentially, I sat bored for five minutes between each turn. Rolling the dice each round was the very brief highlight of each round.

When a game mangles theme beyond common sense recognition, has low player interaction, features uninteresting mechanics, throws in seemingly arbitrary male/female roles, and presents uninteresting spatial challenges, for me, annoyance follows. Once was enough for this one.

Typical Feld. Lots of ways of scoring vp, lots of incremental moves. My only complaint is the priest track - position number six seems to be extremely powerful, especially if placed early on in the game.

Another Feld point salad with a tropical theme that works fairly well. All of the elements loosely interconnect with each other in some manner. Doesn't appear to have one winning strategy and seems to have several different ways to approach it.

RATING: 8
Certainly one of Feld's heavier games. In this one you once again use dice to carry out actions. But then the number on the dice make a difference for how well you can carry out those actions. And there are a lot of actions to take; Building huts, gathering resources, laying out shrines, appeasing the gods, hiring locals for work ,etc. There is a lot to do and you can even block other players out of actions by using the dice set at certain values. On top of that every round you will be trying to fulfill the demands of scoring tiles that become available each and every round. You may only have a certain number at the end of each round so you either score the tile or lose it. Then there is end of game scoring for set collection of different types of workers and jewelry that you buy over the course of the game using money collected each round. So do you stick with just scoring in the short term or sacrifice some of them to score in the long term. It's a thinky game but fun and looks extremely beautiful on the table even it does take up a lot of that table space.

It's a colorful, fun Euro, and a Feld so you've got a lot of options to develop your status and holdings in the island setting. The man/woman mechanics are interesting, the tattoos, the fishing, it's honestly more fun than I've had with several higher profile Euro titles. Castles of Burgundy edges this one out in overall quality, but it's well worth owing regardless.

RATING: 8.8
The initial feeling for this game is extremely positive. There's massive complexity, every choice is meaningful, artwork is gorgeous, and you can really develop strongly. The rules are the one negative aspect about the game, doing a subpar job explaining way too many moving parts, meaning that you'll spend a long time flailing about before the game starts to click.
The 4-player game feels a lot more cutthroat than the 3-player game (which I think I prefer), due to far more blocking.

Once you start to develop actual strategies for the game, you'll find yourself constantly and unintentionally blocked by other players. Being able to work around this is a key aspect of winning, but it can be pretty frustrating if you're not prepared for it, or if the randomness in the game just doesn't give you any break at all. The first round can sometimes be absolutely crucial for having a chance in the game (depending on available task and jewelry tiles), so that can really suck for inexperienced players who play together with more experienced ones.

RATING: 7
For those that enjoy point salads, Stephan Feld has managed to impress again; the game bombards you with useful information and has an abundance of interesting and rewarding tactical decisions. And like Castles of Burgundy, the game is a dice game that doesn't feel like a typical dice game; in other words, the dice mechanics seem to focus players more than limit/mitigate their decisions. That being said, there are two things that set this game apart from other Feldian point-salads. For one, the dice dictate the strength of actions but also limit players in an interesting worker-placement mechanic; thus, high-value dice yield higher results but are harder to play whereas low-value dice yield lower results but can block other players. And two, the game seems to have more player-interaction than other Feldian point-salads.

Overall, it is a very good design and I can see the rating of this game increasing with repeated plays.

Bora Bora.  Reading and absorbing rules took 90 minutes.  Lots of actions to choose from but these are quickly narrowed down as a result of die rolls as you can normally only chose an action by playing a lower numbered dice than those already played on the action.  A nice balancing effect between high and low rolled numbers.  But rolling 1,1 and 2 can still make progress difficult.  Trying to accomplish the target tile each season can be tricky.  Felt like having to feed the family in Agricola.

Stefan Brück usually includes a negative element in the Alea games, rats in Notre Dame for example.  But BB seemed pleasingly free of this type of negativity.  Fail to accomplish a task and it is no points, not minus points.

Also on the positive side, Alea at last seem to be reaching the production standards of the rest of the leading produces. Maybe Ravensburger have seen the light at last.  Card is now standard thickness.  Pieces are large enough - just.  But the game must include the most unnecessary box tray I have seen.  Pretty but pointless.  A case of trying a little too hard I think to catch up with the crowd.

BB is a bit of a slog.  Has some frustrations.  It is difficult to plan ahead for example when you are not sure which actions will be left to you.  But is engaging enough to deserve a few more outings which I look forward to.

First play was quite enjoyable.  I did everything right until the second to last turn where I did everything wrong.  aaargh!  Lots of interesting game-play opportunities with the dice selection.  

Difficult to explain.  Players are trying to do a million things with only three actions per turn, giving you the feeling of always being stretched too thin.  Players expand their network of huts, recruit specialists to live in those huts, collect shells, curry the favor of the gods, and generally get points for all of it.

Not the most intuitive game to play. The ideia of exploring the island and all that is not here, you're simply just putting huts on the diferent island spaces to either get resources or some tokens, and possibly score for fish tiles...

Szerintem magasan ez szerző legnehezebb játék eddig. Nekem a régebbi Feldek jobban tetszenek, mert valahogy egyedibbek. Az utóbbi időben inkább arról van szó, hogy minél több mechanimust egyre bonyolultabb masszává akar összegyúrni (ami egyébként alapvetően jól megy neki). Már a Trajan-nál is kicsit öncélúnak éreztem ezt, és itt is ez a helyzet. Pozitívum viszont, hogy a kockák miatt talán nincs nyerő (vagy túl erős) stratégia. Apropó kockák: a játék legnagyobb hibájának azt érzem, hogy közel 3 órás játékidő ellenére összesen 6x3 kockadobás alapozza meg a játékunkat. Ilyen kis dobásszámnál simán adódhat szélsőséges eredmény (pl. ha folyton 5-6-ost dobunk) és akkor hiába gyűjt az ember kismillió módosító istenséget. Épp ezért legalább annyira taktikai, mint stratégiai játék szerintem.
Egyébként szép, jól kidolgozott, ha nem tette volna magasra a mércét Feld, akkor lehet, hogy elájultam volna a játéktól. De játszani kellene még vele, akár mehet még feljebb is a pontszám.

Átpontoztam a Feldeket, csak 3 db 8 pontost hagytam: Burgund, Dragon, Notre Dame. A Burgundba nem nagyon tudok belekötni, de a másik kettő az, amivel legszívesebben játszom.

Good design, lots of choices for your dice that remind a bit Castles of Burgundy, a lot of interaction and screw-you due to the worker placement that needs good programming. Overall not bad BUT not that impressive after all, brings a few elements too many in the mix trying to be multifaceted that becomes too much of a AP-prone game, especially since the dice you roll might screw your plan and let you further behind in the most critical moment. I prefer other simpler games with less complexity that deliver more crisp results in shorter time, more beautiful and elegant..

Aki egy kicsit is jártas a játékok világában - és nem látná a dobozon az alkotó nevét - 10 percnyi játékot követően azonnal rávágná, hogy Stefan Feld jegyzi a tartalmat.

Szó szerint színpompás alkotás!
A lapkák, a kártyák, a játéktábla rajzolatai gyönyörűek, a színvilág meleg, a téma hangulatos (ki ne szeretné Bora Bora-t ?), a tartozékokat öröm kézbe venni.
Nem láttam még olyan játékot, ahol ennyi info lett volna feltüntetve a játékosok egyéni játéktábláján, mint itt...

Számomra ez a játék a "Trajan" kistestvére - okára nem tudnék magyarázatot adni, de a játék szerkezete, felépítése végig azt sugallta.
Talán azért, mert itt is sok-sok-sok lehetőség áll a rendelkezésünkre a pontszerzést illetően. 
Ötletes a dobókockák általi akcióválasztás mechanizmusa.

Hátránya, hogy a játékban rejlő lehetőségek leginkább 4 játékos esetén domborodhatnak ki igazán, két játékos esetén már nagyságrendeket veszíthet a játék az élvezeti értékéből. (ellentétben pl. a Burgunddal) Továbbá akad némi kiegyensúlyozatlanság néhány feladatkártya esetében - de ez a játék részét képez(het)i...

Nekem mindez "nyolc", annak ellenére, hogy biztosan lesz aki az első játékot követően biztosan rátalál majd a "nyerő stratégia"-ra ...

A játékidő hossza is teljesen elfogadható, továbbá a szabály sem annyira összetett, hogy csak gyakorlott játékosokkal lehessen játszani vele.

Ajánlott, de mindenképpen kipróbálandó, majd "élvezendő" kategória... 
... jaaaa, és a nagydobozos "alea" sorozat 15. tagja!

(Feld egyébként mesterien varázsolja bele a dobókockákat a játékaiba...!)

At last, after so many years, alea shows mercy to Feld fans and displays a great production value!
Bora bora has exactly the theme of Hawaii, another great euro released almost the same time. Regarding complexity it is between burgen von burgund and trajan.
Regarding the gameplay, it is a great euro game. There is the endeavor-style mechanic, in the aspect that you control which type of actions will be available for you each round.
There is also the burgen von burgund element in which you get rewards for completing a set of pre-determined goals. (there are also random goals in the game)
The game is very good, and I put it among Feld's finest games. 
However, I particularly dislike the fact that only the last builder in each teriitory scores the points. I aim for a variant that reduces this chaos. My rating if we disregard this rule is 9.4

Master Feld strikes back!

Bora Bora is a worker placement game, with dice used as workers. Higher numbers give access to more powerful options, but lower numbers are more easily playable (because every action space is not exclusive, and one can always place a dice where another was already put, as long as the new dice has a lower value).

As in many others games by the same author, there are many different sub-games (this time combined in a more coherent way than others) and there's a feeling of a "point salad", with every move resulting in some kind of point acquisition.

I'd say this is one of the better Feldian games. It is quite part of the canon, and Feld fans will love Bora Bora, while those who never got in touch with the clever teutonic dryness of the author's previous games won't change their mind...

A few words about scalability and components: the game plays wonderfully with four, very good with three, but with just two loses some tension.
The production value (graphic design, artwork, components) is way above the usual Alea average: Bora Bora is without doubt a gorgeous game, and the absolute best Alea title as far as the components are concerned.

The turn order 'reset' is atypical for a Feld game.  Good use of dice.  I'm, not a huge fan of randomness, but Feld somehow won me over again.   

Update: The Man/woman tiles with the Build & fire action are overpowered.  We now play with a variant that these tiles get to build, but without the fire action.  

2nd Update: New variant is when revealing the Man/woman tiles each round, we reorder them based on the player mat from bottom to top.  That way the more powerful tiles, such as land movement, build & fire, etc. cost a higher die roll.  It's not entirely perfect for the point tiles should be higher up, but it works pretty well.  Playing with this variant, we no longer consider the build & fire tile to be overpowered, so we keep the fire action with it.

Another example of Feld's "VP salad" line of games.

I wouldn't mind a tablet implementation of it, but as a physical boardgame you need someone who enjoys sorting and placing tiles.

Absolutely gorgeous production values, let down by a sprawling and jumbled mess of a game - at least for my tastes. This was the game that helped me realise that I'm more a light to mid-weight gamer than a heavyweight Eurogamer. I appreciate the art, the theme, the dice mechanics, and the fact that hardcore gamers have opportunities to really study and test out different strategies, but it's really not for me. I'm not sure I'll ever attempt another Stefan Feld "point salad" game after this - good for mathematically-minded folks, but not for gamers looking for a juicier, more aesthetic experience.

Another point salad game from Stefan Feld that I enjoy very much. There is a style of gameplay in Bora Bora that make's it similar to other Feld designs; albeit with some new mechanics and ways to score.

 In and of itself, the game is very simplistic in it's rules and gameplay; the depth coming from the many paths and choices taken to achieve victory. At first, you are overwhelmed by the amount of choices available, but once the game gets going or you acquire some experience it all falls into place and you start enjoying the exploration of the different paths available for points.

 There is also more player interaction and conflict than in other Feld games, but just enough to still be considered in the standard Euro category.

If you enjoy other Feld games like Castles of Burgundy or Trajan, then this one is highly recommended.

Looking for a good "Point Salat" game. Well, look no further. Stefan Feld is the master of the genre and this is probably my favourite Feld game. Also it has the advantage of being probably the best looking Feld game as well. Dare I say that it even feels somewhat thematic? Well, at least more so than Trajan and Castles Of Burgundy, which are also great games.

Highly recommended, but be aware that you probably need four players to get the optimal gaming experience out of it. I say probably, because I haven't actually played it with less than four players, but it definitely feels very right with that player count.

I am definitely starting to get the same feeling from Feld now.  I've been a supporter of Feld against a lot of those who say he's just putting together massive Euro-blender point games where it doesn't really matter what you do.  It does matter what you do, but there are too few differences between his games.  The use of dice in this game is magnificent.  Rolling high numbers is good (for the improved action) and bad (for the blocked actions, especially if you are later in turn order).  I enjoyed my one play of Bora Bora, but it didn't get me super excited to come back and play again.  Maybe after I'm away from it for a bit, I'll come back energized to try again.

It was better after the second play.  I'm still not amazed with this one, but it is definitely good.

at first I liked it a lot, but the enthusiasm has declined in the later games. certainly is the most interactive game Feld and has a mechanism of choice of actions with the die, very original. but it is the usual Feld: with so many ways to score points, just set, and after a while it gets repetitive and especially frustrating, because you can hardly follow a strategy, you will do actions at random and then tried to get more points. burgundy remains for me the Feld's best game

Ich hatte gestern einen sehr schönen Spieletag. Ich habe mich über die schönen Spielmechanismen in „Bora Bora“ gefreut. Dass ich nach nur einer Partie denke, dass das Spiel nicht richtig eingestellt ist, wird voraussichtlich an einem Denkfehler liegen, den mir gestern Abend aber fünf Leute nicht aufzeigen konnten. 
Ich hatte meine Partie gewonnen, indem ich nur auf den 3x4-Platz in der Mitte des Spielplans gegangen bin und die Priesterwertung dominiert habe. Das Ausbreiten auf der Insel und die Personen habe ich vernachlässigt. 
Aber wie komme ich dann an die vielen Rohstoffe für den 3x4-Platz (gewinnen kann ich nur, wenn ich frühzeitig (!) auf dem 3x4-Platz baue)? Antwort: Als 1:2-Tausch über die Aktionsmöglichkeit, die oben links auf dem Spielplan darstellt ist, oder über den Mann und die Frau, die jede Runde Rohstoffe bringen. (1 Mann und 1 Frau zu haben ist natürlich wichtig, sonst könnte man ja gar nicht von Phase B profitieren. Den Mann erhielt ich in Runde 2, die Frau in Runde 3.) Damit man den 3x4-Platz voll gebaut bekommt, braucht man einige weiße und blaue Karten (über Priester bekommen) oder lila Masken als Joker (über Priestermehrheit). Auf Tatoos verzichtet man ganz (man hat ja die Masken), nimmt sich, wenn man einen Priester platziert, also lieber Muscheln. 
Ich empfehle in der ersten Runde eine 6 in die Priesterleiste zu legen. Das schreckt die Gegner ab, und gegenüber unerfahrenen Spielern sollte man die Priestermehrheit unumkämpft behalten können. (In den Runden 5 und 6 legt man mit Priestern zu. Denn da gibt es 3 Punkte pro Priester.) 
Ich hatte in Runde 6 nur noch den 3x4-Platz voll zu bauen, mit den anderen beiden Arbeitern habe ich Würfelpunkte 1:1 in Siegpunkte eingetauscht. War primitiv, aber ich habe deutlich gewonnen. So wollte ich eigentlich nicht gewinnen. 
Die grünen Plättchen: Die dürfte ich nur in den Runden 4 bis 6 erfüllen können. Da aber relativ sicher. Wichtig ist, dass man langfristig plant, um am Ende viele von den bis zu drei Plättchen erfüllen zu können (mein Lieblingsmechnismus in dem Spiel). 
Ein Gegenspiel auf diese Strategie dürfte man nur mit vielen roten Karten bekommen, und die muss man erst einmal ziehen. Die Priesterwertung (für die lila Maske) will ICH ja auf jeden Fall gewinnen. 
Mein Fazit: Liebe Stefans, setzt, sollte ich Recht behalten (und das möchte ich gar nicht, weil ich das Spiel mag), zur zweiten Auflage die Punkte für die Fische herauf.

Too many rules in this game. It is fun, but not really sure if it is worth the effort. Just remembering all the rules is something of a pain if there is more than a few weeks between session. Unnecessarily convoluted, but fun is perhaps a good summary.

Another great game; Mr Feld can't do much wrong for me at the moment, although I have to say this did not feel quite as great as Trajan. Reasons why? the combination of so very few actions (18 in the whole game) and such a wide variety of options felt baggy, reducing the tension somewhat and rendering the decisions more moot and therefore less difficult.

On the other hand, the dice placement mechanic was a very nice idea (maybe not quite as good as Trajan's Mancala board) and could even have been developed a little more to my mind.

Bora Bora is an excellent Euro that plays well with any number of players. It ties with Goa: A New Expedition for the first place spot in collection, and ties with Luna for "best Feld" spot.  Bora Bora offers top notch components, visually stunning board, multiple paths to victory, and high replayability in a medium-heavy Euro that craftly combines worker placement, dice-based action selection, and task tiles to deliver a solid gaming experience. There is a quite bit of randomeness in the game, and not just from the dice rolling, but with so many options available the luck factor is not that big of deal in this game. If anything could be improved in Bora Bora it would be the player interaction. I own other Feld games but have only played Macao and Bora Bora thus far. Macao for me is a 6, Bora Bora is a solid 10.  It is not the easiest of games to learn but once you get past the complex rules the reward is nothing short of gaming greatness. Watch this excellent walk through video and you will be playing Bora Bora in no time http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/26681/bora-bora/bora-bora-walkthrough

Lots going on.  Lots of ways and paths to take to explore and earn points.  Because of that it has a slight feel of Trajan, but I like it better than that one and for me it feels more like Castles of Burgandy.  First game, straight from rules reading took a bit, but it will easily be a fairly quick game on the second and subsequent plays.  I do see this moving up to an 8.  I will have fun exploring.  I don't think it's as elegant as Macao.

Impression after 2 plays: 8.5, awesome interaction of mechanisms, this Feld design could possibly reach CoB heights after more plays!

Rating up to a 9, but only played 2 players so far...

Finally got in a 4p game and it was just as good, the status track became a bit more important

Fading for me probably due to lack of recent plays...8.75

// This is a really colorful game as far as the art and
design is concerned. It feels a little more vibrant than
similar dice rolling games, but at the same time, I'd
probably rather play Castles of Burgundy than this--even
with that game being so much more dull. This has a bit more
going on, but that's maybe not a good thing since more for
the sake of more isn't necessarily better than something 
great distilled down to its core essence.

I have so much fun at any time I play this game. I am becoming Feld's fan :) I have to say - Bora Bora is complex, it is difficult and challenging and it has many rules. There is only 6 rounds divided for 3 stages: A (dice rolling & actions allowed by dices), B (bonus actions: men + women), C (Tatoo, Temple, Shells and Tasks).
I think the game is very pretty - it is a huge plus. It is not another dry, theme-less euro. I disagree this is an abstraction theme.
In this game it doesn't matter do You have small or big numbers when You roll dices, so if You roll small it is not end of the world (You have to plan longer and maybe use them to block an action or You can use one of 5 cool gods). 
Player board is wonderful - it has everything You need: space for all stuff You collect in the game & huge player aid on the left (contains rules shortcut so when You know You can do something but You don't remember how You don't have to search for the answer in the rulebook, just look at Your player board!) :) I love it!
The game is hard to find now and it is not cheap but it is worth every penny You spend. Solid stuff, wood (huts, monks etc), great main board and player boards, cardboard tokens like shells, gods offerings and much more. OMG!
Right now this game is one of my favorite complex eurogames.

Interaction in the game can be VERY mean and is very challenging & brain burning! The most difficult Feld's game I've played so far :) 

2 players - 80-90 minutes
3 players - ~120 minutes
4 players - >120 minutes

Easier Feld's game in similar theme -> "La Isla" :)

Orange God tiles recommended ;)

Expected to loathe it, was very pleasantly surprised. Yes it's a euro, and point salad, but the dice mechanic is brilliant, most of the time you hate your die rolls, high or low :) and it is definitely not a heads down multiplayer solo, where you put your dice, what choices you make impact others. And the theme works for me (except maybe the plot tiles ... They're a bit of a stretch to justify theme wise).

Shouldn't work, as it feels like a bunch of mini games stapled together, but it does - you never have enough actions to optimise, but there is a mix of tactically maximising your turn and following a strategy. Like it, a lot.

Stefan Feld games first develop mechanics and then gets theme enacted (Greets to Dr.Knizia). However this game holds so many actions as big as pacific ocean is. Ok, we had an experienced 4 player game, so i will have to taste it with 1 or 2 less players in future. The rules need good 30 minutes to explain and you must fight against the snooze to the end of explanation. There is a small risk, when you rolled 3 bad dice rolls in a row (1, 2 or 3´s), so you can´t really change that effective without help of the purple Joker-God or with help of sacrifice needing white guardian-angel. So these -bad- dice needs other gaming solutions. Perhaps temple occupation or island hopping?

An overly layered VP point grabbing, themeless euro. It is not complex, though it has tons of rules. Elements of Feld's other efforts. The VP total is so big that I didn't find my actions that meaningful. Just grab the best that you can. Our first game's scores were in the high 150's to low 160's. I just don't find a 5 VP difference all that meaningful when scores are in the 160's. That just tells me everybody was grabbing about the same VPs on every move over 18 actions per person.

Feld does find interesting things to do with dice. That's about the one positive thing with this new offering.

Overall tired of VP salad mixes.

Not my favorite Feld. The design, as always, is clever, and the game is very challenging. I like that high rolls benefit you more, but can cripple you if someone takes a spot before you. Although this makes this game more interactive than his other games (which is a good thing), it also makes it more frustrating to play. 

The problem is that rolling all low numbers is still far worse than rolling all high numbers, and being able to block someone out of a spot is poor compensation for an entire turn where you can basically accomplish nothing. I think this is why I am not as crazy about this game compared to, say, the Castles of Burgundy, in which you usually have some useful thing to do with your dice. In Bora Bora, you find yourself continually screwed, seemingly on every other turn. There are plenty of other games which have a similar limiting/frustrating feel (Agricola comes to mind), but because in Bora Bora the pips on the dice are often the cause of your screwage, it can seem arbitrary and ultimately less satisfying.

I really like this - there's a lot going on, with lots of difficult choices to be made at every turn and scope for clever combinations.  There's also a ton of bits in the box, supporting the variety of game elements - the end result is a rather heavier game than the bright and very attractive artwork suggests.  Nice to have a heavier gamers' game that isn't all sombre tones for a change.

A little bit shocked to actually have enjoyed this! I've been more or less done with Feld for a couple years; Trajan was the back-breaker I think, his games are just so dry and mechanical and I don't enjoy the multivariate scoring problems the games present (Macao and Castles of Burgundy weren't good either). But the Bora Bora point salad is pretty fairly coherent, and the aesthetics of the games are easy to grok. It's also not totally abstract; the villagers with abilities and colonization options make some sense. It's a lot about choosing what you're *not* going to do, but the cool thing is that all the various avenues of action overlap in interesting ways. The die-roll action allocation system is also *much* better than any of his previous dice-rolling games (Burgundy, Macao) in terms of generating interesting decisions.

It's also fairly attractive, and being an alea game it seems very well-balanced.

There is still plenty not to like if you're not into Feld's highly structured, abstract, limited-player-interaction style, and the luck:AP potential ratio is not great, but nonetheless I enjoyed it.

Interesting workers/dice placement mechanics. All the rest is classical, efficient but could have been simplified. The theme is absent and there are too many manipulations. Very good game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you've played other Feld games like Castles of Burgundy or Trajan, you know what you're getting into with this sort of game.  Oodles of ways to score points with no way to score them all, so you have to figure out the most efficient way to score those points, with many strategies being valid.

The unique mechanism here is that players each roll 3 dice, which they can apply to various actions.  The higher the die you place on an action, the more effective the action will be.  However, players place dice in turn order, and if other dice are already on an action, you can only take it by placing a lower valued die there.  So, rolling all 6's seems great until you get shut out of actions!  Of course, as is typical for Feld, he gives you some ways to manipulate things to still make it work if you prepared well enough, so you're not totally screwed unless you didn't plan ahead well enough.

Other than that main interesting mechanism, there is just a huge mish mash of ways to score points, which all somehow remain fairly intuitive and easy to remember despite their abundance and diversity.

I personally like this sort of thing, and I imagine if you've been playing games for a while you also know whether you'd like this or not before you even play it.

So . . . [thing=127060][/thing].

Bora Bora is a dice-placement semi-restrictive worker placement game; players can use spaces previously used, but only by placing lower-numbered dice.  Since the strength of each action is directly related to the number on the die placed, the game does a reasonable job of balancing the benefits of rolling high numbers (stronger actions) against the benefits of rolling low (broader choices of actions).  The game also provides "God" cards that allow players to break the dice-placement rules, but since you must spend actions obtaining those cards, you need to use them judiciously.

As it typical of Feld's designs, the game is overloaded with systems and subsystems, awash in options, and (potentially problematically) hyper-balanced.  There are a million things you can potentially do and everything is beneficial.  For example, there are six or so worker-placement spots where you can place a die.  A few of them allow you to select from a pool of tiles.  A few more allow you to spread your influence on a map in one of several directions.  One space allows you to spend your dice pips on the purchase of something like nine different items, while another space earns you one bonus from column A plus one bonus from column B, etc.  

As is also typical of Feld's designs, the thematic integration is blatantly terrible.  It's as if the man goes out of his way to mock the very concept of theme.  (As an example, the game comes with "fish" tiles and a "fishing" action space; but one has nothing to do with the other.  As another example, when players collect resources, they must place them in specific spots on a ceremonial grid and can only build buildings when two resources are orthogonally adjacent on the grid.)

The heart of the game, such as it is, is the management of one's huts (which occupy a shared, central board) and the accumulation of men and women (which provide certain resources and actions).  You need to place huts on the board to make space for the men and women you acquire.  You need to acquire men and women early to maximize your benefit from their free actions.  But you'd like to be the last person to place a hut in each region in order to score points.  So, like with everything in the game, you need to juggle cross-cutting incentives in order to score a few more points than you might have otherwise.  As you can tell from my description, it is not exactly a novel idea, but it done "well enough" here to give the game some legs. 

An additional interesting aspect of the game is the use of short-horizon objectives.  Each player begins the game with three random objectives.  At the end of each round, players can fulfill one objective for 6 points (or else discard an objective), and then players draft one new objective from a randomly stocked pool.  Thus, players are incentivized to work toward some particular goal every round, even when those goals are at odds with the player's broader strategy.  This mechanic reminded me a bit of Ora et Labora: mandatory use-it-or-lose-it point opportunities at designated intervals that may be unconnected to your larger path toward points. 

Speaking of "paths," players in our game were undecided whether the Bora Bora incentivizes specialization or diversity.  We all did a little of everything, because each action is beneficial in its own right and the actions themselves are sufficiently intertwined that it felt natural to combine them.  However, the end game scoring rewards certain heroic feats (like building 12 huts in a mere 18 actions) and I suspect that the skill on repeat plays will prove to be in focusing relentlessly on accomplishing one or two of those tasks without forsaking too many other tactical scoring opportunities.  

Okay, so let's cut to the chase: where's the vitriol?  Where is the foaming at the mouth, angry, rampaging, clobberin' time rant we've all come to know and love?  Sadly, not here.  Bora Bora is classic Feld, and in that regard I have little respect for the design.  This is not what an excellent board game looks like.  But that doesn't stop it from being fun.  I watch (and enjoy) terrible movies (I've seen Bring It On more times than I've every Best-Picture-Award-winner combined).  I watch (and enjoy) trash TV.  And while I typically try to listen to good music or read good books, I can't deny the catchy vapidity of the latest Taylor Swift ditty (spoiler alert: it's about a boy).  

Between the randomness of the dice rolling, the inadvertent (and advertent) screwage in the dice placement, and the ludicrously bad attempt to slap a theme on a bunch of abstract mechanics ("I'm going to spend two pips to tattoo my man for four Status points because I want to be first player when we buy jewelry") it's hard not to just sit back and enjoy the game for what it is.  It's not high art. It's a checkout-line romance novel and I have no doubt that it will sell more copies and entertain more people than whatever the board game equivalent of a Charles Bukowski anthology is.  

In terms of enjoyment, I put it in roughly the same category as Keyflower.  It is a poorly themed hodgepodge of familiar tropes: efficiency, synergy, interaction.  I would never play it with fewer than four for the same reason Tom Rosen likely thinks it is best with just two.  But it's good at what it does and what it does can be enjoyable if you stop taking yourself too seriously for a hot minute.  And, at least in that minute, it's worth keeping around.

Another really good Feld point salad game. Very attractive, colorful game although the player board is a little overwhelming at first. I really enjoyed the variable objectives which gives the game a lot of replayability.

Pattern pretty clear at this point. Feld+Alea is good. Other Feld's not so good. Enjoy In the Year of the Dragon, Macao, Burgundy, now this. I have had a terrible reaction to everything else of his I've played. Hated Trajan, Aquasphere, Luna, Bruges, Rialto. 

Definitely the typical Feld with tons of ways to score, with potential actions controlled through dice. But it works very smoothly, there is significantly more interaction than something like trajan or burgundy through turn order and the dice placement mechanism.

This game plays out differently each time because of the task tiles you draw in the beginning and each round which, at least in my games, have shaped the strategy of the players. Sure, you can ignore them, but if you totally ignore them, you won’t win (at least that’s my experience as you can get 60 VPs for completing them). I think that the variety in the different tiles sets the game apart from many others as you have a goal before the game begins (and get more throughtout the game), and you try to play in accordance to this. The different setup adds a huge amount of variety and replayability too.

I have heard some people complaining about superior strategies; there is a thread about the man/woman building tile being overpowered, but I honestly don’t think it is. At all. I guess the biggest imbalance could be if one of the players bought all the 2 VP man or woman tiles and activated them each round with a green god – but the other players should definitely be able to prevent that player from getting the 3 similar tiles. The temple/priest track has been an important factor in my personal wins, but I definitely don’t think it’s overpowered; it’s only in the last two rounds that the priests earn some good VPs. Sure, the purple god tile is valuable, but it’s definitely not game-breaking.

Compared to Castles of Burgundy, which is another one of Feld’s good games, the luck of the dice is bigger in Bora Bora. This is because of the fact that higher rolls are almost always better (depending on the game situation etc.) and that it’s hard to manipulate the dice rolls (except for using a blue or a white god). I understand the criticism, but there is almost always something meaningful you can do with your dice. And as said, you can always use a blue god card to activate any of the actions or a white god card to make your crappy low die roll a 6. In my first few games I thought that the blue god was crucial, but I’ve come to appreciate the other god cards too as they can come in handy at certain times; the red god can net a big chunk of points if played at the right moment, the yellow god can help you completing a task which might be the key to score the end game 6 bonus VPs and, finally, the green god can really help by activating the man/woman tiles you want. Speaking of the man/woman tiles, they are very important in the game and I like the mechanic of the tiles and how you need to make room if you want to hire more. The tiles can be very strong, and players also face interesting decisions as to when to “activate” them for their bonus shells and especially tattoos for turn order! 

Another thing that I like about Bora Bora is that there is much more player interaction than in The Castles of Burgundy and many of Feld’s other games! Here, the interaction isn’t just limited to taking a tile another player wants – you can actually block the actions and thereby forcing people to forego their actions and have to take a measly 2 points instead of an action. Also, you can push other players’ priests out of the temple track and claim the land so that it is your huts and not their huts which score the fishing bonuses in the end - great!
Speaking of the end game bonuses, there really isn’t a whole lot of end-game bonus scoring. Sure, there are many things which give you 6 VPs in the end, but you’ll likely only be able to get two or three of these, and those 12-18 points isn’t a big deal in the end. Some of the end game bonuses are very hard to complete

7 2pl played:
Good game, usually willing to play.
But no need to own it myself:
* one central mechanic with added minigames = Trajan
* dice as central element, with strong ways to influence your rolls = Burgund
* many ways for scoring = Trajan, Burgund, Macao

I really dislike the random starting task draw; the 2 dark green tasks can (a) be very hard to fulfill and (b) dictate most of your play. To a lesser amount even the light green task can achieve this.

Bora Bora is an interesting game, but I prefer all of Macao, Burgund (with new tableaus) and Trajan to this one.

So many moving parts. Maybe too many. My first impression is that this is likely an ultimately deeper game than Castles of Burgundy---but I kept thinking I'd rather be playing Castles of Burgundy. 

How is it that Reiner Knizia got so much flak for so-called 'theme-less-ness' and Feld just gets a free pass. Really? Why does he get a free pass? Because you have to be smart to play his games? It's such a forced mish-mash. My first thought---it needed a little more elegance and a little less peacocking. There are whole elements of the design (i.e the resource board) that seem completely unnecessary to the experience. 

Want to play again, but I was scratching my head MANY times during this game. Not because strategy isn't clear (it's not and I suspect people will very much like that aspect of the design), but I was scratching my head because I need a reason for things and an attempt at metaphor. He's letting the mechanisms determine the experience without much reason beyond "gameplay demands this". The design put itself in front of the experience. 

Prediction: no one will be playing this in 18 months. It's just another Seasons---really clever design that is not a rewarding enough experience for the effort. 

That said: The interaction design behind the icons made the game much easier to play then you'd expect given the lack of thoughtful coherence in the actual gameplay. Kudos to the user-interface team, impressive work. I may sound critical of the overall game, but I really do look forward to playing again. Not sure I like the color scheme and flourishes however.

It took some time for me to get the gameplay down because of all the decisions in this game. It has resemblances of Castles of burgundy with more choices and more planning. The game can be unforgiving with the decisions made because of the goal tiles. The use of dice in this game is highly addictive and clever, and adding this to the collection is an easy decision, even if I have already have lots of Feld.

Great game, but like his recent games, it feels a little stuffed full of point options, and yet, in this case, sometimes, it felt like the goals dictated game choices too much at times.  Still, I liked it, but not as much as some of his other games.

Off the top of my head, I'd say Bora Bora is the sixth or seventh Feld game I've played. Yep, it's Feld. Which means the game is well-designed, with challenging choices and a neat core mechanism, totally themeless, and a good but not great game that I probably don't need to own.

Bora Bora feels like a cross between Trajan and Castles of Burgundy, with lots of ways to score points, lots of little mini systems/games, and yet another clever way to use dice to choose actions.

I'd play it again but I could also play any other common Feld game.

RATING: 6
So much to do and not enough actions to do them. It seems getting the men/women tiles to combo nicely with your goals is important as it will allow you a key 4th action at the end of the round, which seems to be the key to getting as much done as you possibly can. I enjoyed it and did enjoy the theme, but it was a bit too heavy and long for my liking clocking in at 3 hours for a first play. The task tiles are hugely variable and likely guide you in what you need to do each game as sometimes a strategy won't work if the right task tiles aren't there and you will have to adjust accordingly.

RATING: 7
Each turn you seem to have a lot of good options. You are teasing out the best options and have to keep an eye on what your opponents could do to scupper your plans. There is a lot of long term strategy as well as tactics within each turn. I am suspicious that this may be a very good game.

 At first glance, it appears there's tons going on at once in this game, and there is, but it's so smooth and all makes total sense.

Far too many decisions. Balancing 3 or 4 or 5 things is called choice. Having to balance 10 things is called ridiculous. Too much going on for presumably no point except to add yet another level of frustration. I much prefer Castles of Burgundy. CoB's various pathways to victory all work together in a much more cohesive whole.

Other nitpicks: No catch-up mechanism if you fail an objective or can't buy jewelry in the 1st round. Placing the tiles to build the central building seem overpowered. More than one person mixed up the land vs. sea symbols for the "expand via 2-point route" man/woman powers, to their detriment.

I sort of enjoyed my play of Bora Bora. It felt very well put together and everything seemed to fit, but for no discernible reason. In the end I lost by a single point and the long slog felt very much just that. The game is good but feels over designed in a way, with complexity for the sake of it, like a cake with too many layers. Limited interaction never helps these games and I can't see me rushing to play again.

At first I assumed that this game would be akin to Castles of Burgundy and Trajan, but upon playing I discovered that this is not actually the case. Bora Bora is really much more a close relative of Macao than the previously mentioned puzzle games. The reason why I say this is because the interaction between players in Bora Bora is more pronounced; and there is actually potential for some nasty screwage, even if it is all mostly indirect. Or isn't it? You tell me how to call indirect interaction with yourself!

What struck me mostly about this game is that it is so [i]messy[/i]. If it were possible to visualise the mechanisms in a game, I'm sure we would all see many rivets, sharp metallic edges and uneven surfaces where a mallet was used to flatten the plate steel. Everything is tied together in a rather arbitrary way lacking subtlety and finesse. It works as far as I could tell, let that be clear, and I admit to being jealous that even this throwback from Stefan Feld's design table is probably already much better than whatever I can come up with... but it remains a mess. Add to this that the artwork is busy and annoying, and the result is a game I'm not particularly interested in anymore. Other Feld designs are already pressed for time at my table; I see no need to make it even harder on them.

WARNING!!! For die hard Feld Fans only. I can picture
myself trying to explain this game to new players. I can
already see the glazed looks in their eyes ,as they start
to dream about half naked tropical women dancing on rainbow coloured beaches , halfway through my explanation. 
  Man there was a lot to process. And after a 6 hour solo test run of a 4 player game, my brain fel(d)t
like it had just been through (a gamers equivalent)of an
LSD trip. My head was spinning with swirling psychedelic
colours and images of Gods and light dressed natives.
  When I came down from this high the next day I realized I had no idea how to make a winning strategy.
In Macao and Trajan I at least had the illusion of controll with my actions taken. In Bora Bora I could be
walking down the beach and get steamrolled by a runaway
train full of uncontrollable variables at any moment. Making this game an exercise in futility.
  I will leave this game unranked since there are so many other good games made by Feld. Hope his smaller
games Bruges/Rialto/Amerigo can restore my faith in this designer. Herr Feld !Please give players the illusion of control ,so that they may master their destinys.

Not a fan of the rule book. All the info is there, I haven't seen a typo, but it is tough to see the forest because of the trees. 

An intro overview would have been nice, a little more theme added or explained? I mean are you building one big ceremonially building or 12 smaller ones. 

It makes the game easier to explain to others. Isn't that one purpose of a theme? An earlier reason of why you would or need to store extra resources outside the building area would have been nice. As it is they leave you dangling until you get thru the whole rule book. Hint, some of the task tiles need these resources too to complete them. Duh. If you spent the resources for a building you use up those resources as they go back to the supply.

The light colored task tiles are easier to complete then the dark green, is this mention? You soon discover this and is the reason you start with one light, the rest go into the box out of the game, maybe this was a clue I was suppose to pick up on aka going into the box, the other two are dark green tiles. 

Speaking of this light green task tile and two dark green tiles at setup they say you will place them on the player board later, I swear I never see when you are told to added them to the player's board. Why not just tell you to added them to the bottom of the board when you get them at setup?

Seems silly to complain but there is so much stuff and interlaced things in this game all the above are a distraction to figuring out and remembering the rules.

A short cheat info that the Phase B Man/Women phase mimics phase A, well, you getting more workers, duh, that the god cards/tile are basically die modifies.

That the purpose of taking the Helper action to use die points to move a hut is useful when you not want to populate a region because the last player who expanses into a region claims the fish/fishing ground at the end of the round. The Helper move seems silly and a waste until you realize it allows you to make room for a man/women tile and  plan for the end of the round fish points.

None of this info is a spoiler, you discover it painfully during your first play, stumbling thru the game, the rule book. It just would make it easier to grasp the rules if you knew why you would want to do this. Why is it in the game. 

After getting this knowledge the rules became easier to remember and the game just comes together. I didn't have this problem with the Castles of Burgundy, even FGG convoluted Space Hulk rule book was easier to understand and it is a pile of spaghetti.

Still, it is an excellent game and not that convoluted as it seems. If you have someone who can mock walk you thru a round this would be very helpful, the excellent WotC's video on how to play Lords of Waterdeep comes to mind. Maybe all publishers should consider this. 

Kudos, to the improved main board and parts over TCoB which has a cheap look and feel. Lots of kudos to the big, big improvement over the thickness of the player boards. 

This is a gorgeous game. I could have used some little larger wooden priest, but still, I appreciate that there is a lot of parts and table top real estate is at a premium.

Be warned there are a lot of pieces parts, setup can be a bit long. I take it some people didn't get the 7-8 ziplock bags in the box? Very nice it didn't come with an insert, spared me of having to mull over throwing it away.

RATING: 8
Feld-y Feld is Feld-y. Pretty much takes Feld's favorite mechanics and lays them on top of one another. The best combo is the role selection/dice allocation, which makes for some interesting decisions. God cards prevent total lockdowns, which is also nice.

The turn order track also works pretty well, as first is best until the very end, when you may prefer going last. 

On the downside, it's a bit tough to teach and feels very busy. Setup time is on the high side. Rounds can feel a bit samey, and there isn't a huge amount of difference between the various VP routes in many cases. Fish points at the end can be a little chaotic in multiplayer.

The 4th Feld I've played. At first glance, Bora Bora is a hot mess. Information overload player cards. Pasted on theme. A slew of paths, tracks, goals, bonuses, and piece usage. I would have expected to hate the game. The weird part is that I find myself thinking about what I did and could have done better after each game. That's a very good thing. I find myself looking for another play. So, as inelegant as the game may seem, I really like it.

I like the interactivity of the action blocking, but don't like that it's basically entirely unpredictable: even if you have a firm grasp of what everyone at the table wants to do and is capable of doing, until the dice are rolled, there's just no way to plan for blocking others or against being blocked (other than the blue god, which feels more like a "no, I'm NOT screwed" tacnuke than part of a crafted strategem).

Contrast with Macao, where you can divine longer-term interactions (blocking or otherwise) based on goods taken, ship position, neighborhoods selected, special powers, and the combinations of cubes queued up for future turns. Mind you, I don't think Bora Bora is trying to be like Macao and failing; I think it's simply a different type of game - just one I'm less fond of.

Solid design, but it could be a little more streamlined. It took us a long time to learn the rules, and the many options induced analysis paralysis, occasionally. I love the dice allocation though. It's very interactive, but not overly so.

Strategy thoughts:

First round goal: Try to have at least one man and one woman with useful actions by the end of the first round. The most useful actions are building and getting another man/woman (procreating?), I feel, because those actions free up your dice to be used for other actions. I got a man who let me build in the second round, and I used him every round for the remainder of the game. A person who does expanding (a pathfinder) or one that gets you resources or status is probably in the next tier of most useful actions, but you'll probably need to double them up with an identical person or a green god card to make them top-tier useful. A woman that gets you one seashell is, IMHO, a waste of space. There are far better ways to get seashells.

Second round goal: Build early and build often. Building early (in rounds 1 and 2) gets you the most points. You should build at least twice by the end of the second round. If you can manage to build three times by the end of the second round, I imagine you're doing very well indeed. If you can get a man who can build, it's more efficient to do it that way, I think, and that could potentially allow you to build twice per round in the early rounds. But, by the time you get to the fourth round, you'll need to double up on builders in order to use the building tokens with the higher die numbers or use a green card.

Third and fourth round goals: Get at least a couple priests into the temple. They'll pay dividends through the remainder of the game.

Complete as many tasks as you can. I guess this is obvious, huh? But this doubly applies to the end of the game. Make sure you have at least one yellow god card going into game-end scoring because that should allow you to score multiple tasks at the end.

Don't buy any jewelry that gives you only 1 point unless you're going for the game-end jewelry bonus. The 5-point ones are the minimum you should buy.

Read over the game-end scoring bonuses and keep them in mind. Make it a goal to score a couple of them. Some of them seem more difficult than others to achieve. There's some synergy between the maximum building and the completely-filling-in-your-ceremony-spaces game-end bonuses.

Sixth round goal: Expand into regions with lots of fishing points. This is probably the most efficient way to score points in the last round, especially if you have some red god cards or purple god tiles to effectively score the fishing twice. Try not to be first on the status track at the end of this round. In fact, if you can be last, none of the other players will be able to take away your fishing points (unless they move using a man/woman action in the next phase).

All the god cards are useful, but I feel the white cards are slightly more useful than the others. They let you maximize your helper actions and get you into the leftmost spot in the temple even when you roll low.

Douceur et tranquillité Oui ..enfin ... bon ... c'est un jeu de Stefan Feld quand même (Aquasphere, les chateaux de bourgogne, Trajan..). Donc vous aviez beau être en vacances, il va falloir vous creuser les méninges un peu (un peu beaucoup). Noir sur blanc dans la règle : "le joueur qui aura le mieux observé le jeu et anticipé ses actions remportera la victoire". On est dans du pur jeu à l'allemande et toute la gestion que cela implique. Pas un p'tit jeu à jouer à l'apéro en sirotant une Caipirinha. Il y a plein d'actions à faire (Développer vos huttes, plaire aux dieux, construire, recuperer du coquillage, recruter de la population locale ...).

For some reason this game is simply more FUN than other heavier euros.  I particularly love the round end goals, they really increaase the epic feeling of the game, as your working towards something bigger at all times, while constantly managing small goals turn by turn.  The dice are great and really tactical.  You're not playing this to it's potential unless you are looking at all players dice rolls at the beginning of the round and planning your actions with your own dice accordingly, thinking about blocking, noticing who may block you, what you are willing to risk with where and in what order you place your dice.  The cards are fun too, the actions of the men and women...  again I just find this to have feelings of a fun adventure, although it's actually a fairly nonthematic Euro.

RATING: 5
This is the high point of Feld's (point) salad days. I prefer the tension of his early titles that incorporate penalties, but this is the best of his newer games, at least since Castles of Burgundy.

EDIT: The order/timing the man/woman tiles come out in introduces an absolutely huge and often game determining degree of luck. 

Edit: Feld in a nutshell: "Choose some cards, tiles or bits. Then wait to see if other matching cards, tiles, and bits come into play. If they do, you win."

I like the constant goal setting in this one.  It's fun to plan and execute your plans every turn, rather than waiting for the end game for all of the goals to pay out.  I also really like the dice mechanics in this one.  It looks way more complex than it actually is.  Probably won't see a lot of table time, but it's staying in my collection.

Dice games start on the wrong foot with me, generally, but that part of Bora Bora was mostly unobjectionable.  Here the problem was really that it was a whole lot of spinning wheels that all felt empty.  A few moments held some interest, so I can't say I hated it.  I might have loved it if the whole thing had taken a quarter of the time.  As it is, I can only see playing it grudgingly when others insist.

RATING: 5
It's a very "busy" game.  All the player aids/boards are strictly graphics - nothing written.  This makes it visually distracting, hard to comprehend, and hard to follow.  Next, there just seems to be too many options with each turn.  You can score points this way, and that way, and every which way (it seems), so you really have a difficult time creating a coherent strategy, or even just understanding what's happening.  It's not complicated, just...busy.  Not a favorite.

After 1 play, starting this at an 8.  I really like this game.  There is a ton of stuff going on...and gives you a lot to think about.  I can see this going up to a 9.  Or possibly there is just too much randomness and it may go down a point.  However, the balance appears to be just right.
Update - This game is still going strong after 5 plays.  Great game, but might miss the "9" mark by a hair.

Once again Stephanie fouled has struck it out of the park. A complex cerebral euro game that is not too complicated to teach but yet has layers and layers of depth. I found myself rethinking my strategies and find and in hindsight that there was always a slightly better option that I could've gone with. This left me with the feeling that I had many options and even though I did fairly well and was satisfied with what I got I thought I could've done a little better. I immediately wanted to play this game again after playing. I always felt I knew what I needed to do the trick was there were so many ways to do what I needed to do.

RATING: 8
Players are running a tribe on Bora Bora, trying to earn the most victory points.  Each player rolls three dice and takes turns allocating one of them to action tiles, and taking that action.  Dice can only be played on tiles that have a higher die result on them, and the value of the die generally indicates how much you can do with that die.  Actions include expand your chain of huts across the game board, earning resources.  Using those resources to build buildings.  You can hire men or woman into your tribe, which give you the potential for further bonus actions.  You can create priests to earn points and possibly a god tile (a wild god card - god cards grant special powers, as long as you have an offering to give them!).  The final action is the trader, where you can spend die pips on all sorts of things, from victory points to building materials, god cards and so on.  At the end of each turn, players get the chance to buy more victory points (jewelry), and complete tasks for further points.  

The game lasts six turns, with a further myriad of points granted at the end for maximizing expansion in certain areas of the game.  A very busy game, which Feld fans will lap up.  I liked it, and really admire the dice/action selection mechanic.  The rest of the game is a bit of a brain burner, and requires quite a bit of time to teach it to new players (who will likely be flogged during their first game).

This game is a complete clusterfeld of mechanisms and point salad.  It works, to be sure, but it also feels like an experiment in how many mechanisms can be crammed into one game.  I think a bit of editorial distillation would have been a good idea.  It's like Castles of Burgundy and Trajan went on fertility drugs and had a baby.  A brightly colored, tile spewing, bloated baby.

I was definitely intrigued by Bora Bora game at first, but after several plays have come to the conclusion that I don't much care for it.  All the various mechanisms ultimately seem to take you to the same place at the same speed, which makes you wonder why the game had to be so complicated.  In my games, all the players ended up within a few points of each other, and that's with scores in the 150-200 range.  You are awash in choices, but as long as you are reasonably competent it doesn't seem that any of them are bad, so does it really matter what you choose to do? 

As usual for Feld games, the central feature is an action limitation mechanism. I've found it's a tenuous thing for me whether or not I enjoy the method of action limitation or if I find it frustrating.  My overall opinion of Feld games tends to rely upon this decision.  I very much enjoy the use of dice in Castles of Burgundy and I also really like the way the mancala works in Trajan (the Feld game most similar to Bora-Bora).  However, much like in Macao, I find the dice mechanism in Bora-Bora to be interesting in theory but frustrating in practice.  I'll stick with Trajan when I hunger for point salad!

I would compare this Feld to Trajan - another game which is essentially a bundle of mini-games, all of which earn you roughly the same amount of points.   Here, the game is driven by an interesting and fairly nasty dice placement mechanism...  or maybe you prefer the term "interactive".   The graphic design is busy, busy, busy, and a bit of a visual headache.   The theme really isn't there, but that's not terribly surprising.   None of the mini-games are complex, but the way that everything works together will take a round or two to become clear.  It's a very mechanical game, and somewhat cold as a result.  I think I prefer Feld games that are a little more focused and streamlined - games like Notre Dame or Castles Of Burgundy.  This is more of a kitchen sink approach.

[b][ImpressionAfterMy2ndPlay][/b] This is Stefan Feld's 3rd game published in 2013 and also one of my most anticipated game of the year. 

The way I see it, this felt like Burgundy 2.0. Reason being, if you know how much 'point salad' is in Burgundy, then you get double the dose in Bora Bora. I don't know if that's a bad thing, but I think it can be overwhelmed to some as there are just too many ways for you to get VP. The only thing that's a similar between the two game is just the dice mechanic (in a way).

In Bora Bora, each player has 3 dice and takes turn playing one die one your turn, unlike Burgundy where you have 2 dice and need to use both on a single turn. I'll leave it to you to judge whether this one is prone to AP or not.

Half of your personal board also functions as game reference and it displays everything very well. The board is pretty and the pieces are just outstanding in terms of how they look and the quality. Speaking of quality, this is one of Alea's best produced game to date. The cardboard tokens (there's a lot of them!) are thick and easily punched from their frame. 

After playing many Feld games, I felt weird when Feld didn't choose to penalize a player when he/she can't fulfill one of their mandatory task at the end of a round (you simply discard it and get 0VP). Oh, I think it's worth mentioning that there's no penalty in this game. So is that a good or a bad thing?

This game was fun. But it ended up being fairly confusing to me as far as options that could be done in a given turn. The second detractor for me was that it felt like that the board could be too easily manipulated by one person based on winning the 'god' track if I remember correctly.

Made for a poor gaming experience, and have not really wanted it to play ever since. My gaming buddy might change my mind on this but time will tell.

Opinion getting a bit better.

Typical Feld point salad with mechanics all over the place and with emphasis to dice action point allocation. Theme is good, but not necessarily intuitive. It does have more paths to victory and great deal of decision making, perfect for AP people.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Action selection where you can only place die with a lesser value than the smallest number die already present on the action field. Basically big number gives you more powerful action but smaller number blocks other players.

A lot of bits in this one, but you'll know that if you look at the picture of the game.  I like how all the different parts of the game connect in this one.  I just wish there were less.  It kind of feels like a mess.  There are so many ways to get points that assigning value to your actions becomes difficult.  With more plays that might not be an issue, but after three goes I don't have the desire to explore the game anymore.

My first play of Bora Bora was really mostly an exercise of trying to get my head around the large array of options.  However, it's well worth the effort as subsequent plays were challenging and fun.  This is yet more evidence (if any was needed) of Stefan Feld's position as one of the best of the Euro designers.  Once again this game works really nicely with 2.  I found the dice placement mechanic to be especially clever, given the need the need to place lower die rolls on cards which have already been used.

The main idea of Bora Bora is an interesting one: you roll 3 dice and in turn order you place a die on one of the action selection tiles. You each do this 3 times and move on to the next phase. Higher numbers on actions give you a better action. Low numbers can potentially block other players from taking that action. The rule is you can place dice where others have placed but only if the number is lower than the lowest placed die on that action tile. There are things in the game that allow you to break this rule.

After the dice phase you have a action phase revolving around collected male and female tiles. You activate the special power of one male and one female tile you have on your board. If you collect sets of the same power amongst the same gender, you can boost that power. Sometimes diversification can be better though. To be able to get these male/female tiles you have to clear space on your personal board of huts in one of two ways. The best way is by placing your huts on the actual board. Board placement is a minor spatial element probably equivilant to Burgundy in complexity. That said, the spatial element is done collecively on the main board. There is also racing and blocking for the action that allows you to do board placement at all. 

After that you do a turn order/scoring/cleanup phase. There is some player interaction during this phase. During this phase players will complete and acquire tasks. These are basically in game objectives which will score you points. You can ignore them and play around with one of the other scoring systems, completely focus on them, or do a hybrid choice. 

The luck involved in the randomness of the initial tile placement and tile replacement during the game seems a little troublesome but its just an initial opinion. 

Then there are a lot of interlocking subsystems for end game scoring, in game scoring, and turn order in normal Feldian fashion. This is definitely a heavier game than Burgundy. It's still a point salad game however. I personally would rather play Troyes with 3 than Bora Bora. I would probably prefer to play Burgundy with 2 over Bora Bora. Bora Bora is a a good choice as a 4 player dice-rolling Euro.

Bumping this to a 9. The amount of direct player consideration and interaction puts it currently as my favorite Feld game.

RATING: 6
Personally, I feel this game does not play well with two people. Specifically because (1) there isn't enough competition for goals, men and women tiles, actions, turn order, temple placement, etc., and (2) a huge flaw is that one player can wait for the first player to expand across the islands, then follow behind them and take over these spots, and by the end of the game one player can manage to steal all of the spots and get a HUGE bonus at the end of the game. Because a player cannot go back and reclaim a spot on an island, once it is stolen they lose the victory points and can no longer compete in this area. 

In a three and four-player game both of these negative points disappear and the game is quite enjoyable. For 2 players, I would rate this as low as a 6, for 3-4 players I would rate it an 8.

I've yet to find a Feld game I really *like*.  Bora Bora is the third game of his that I have played (Bruges and castles of Burgundy being the other two).  Dice placement games are also not my favorite mechanism; Alien Frontiers also fell flat with me.

That said, in Bora Bora you can't do everything.  The game is up front about that.  You'll get 6 rounds, and throw three dice each round.  That means, in total, you will have 18 actions.  You get additional points if you can complete one strategy, and work on a second (picking up easy points elsewhere, if possible).

My issue is that the gameplay is not interesting, and because everything is so scarce, you completely neglect certain aspects.  There's no tension, because you *just don't care*.  Someone claiming the temples, and you aren't focusing on that?  Meh.  Someone took a Woman, sure, fine.

Oh, and to make the game even less tense, Feld has added these god cards you can get to break rules.  So, the mechanism that would drive tension (dice placement) is alleviated.

Uninspired game play that lacks any tension.  Completely forgettable experience.

Many interesting mechanics that could have made an excellent game however it suffer from 2 major flaws.

1) Board is cluttered.  Board and playmate has reminders for every rule in the game. But its squeezed into the bared minimum of space.  Would have been better if player board and reference were on separate boards should have been more space between the map and the tiles on the right.

2) Actions and scoring not very satisfying.  There are a few scoring mechanism that are impossible to do if you miss on a single turn.  All the other end game scoring points as simply very hard if you don't work on them every turn.  As a result even on turn 1 your looking more at what points your losing with each action you take instead of what you are earning.

I enjoy a victory point salad game as much as the next guy, but this one felt only ho-hum.  Didn't like that in order to get the really big bonuses you would have to play a basically perfect/scripted game for a given strategy and never deviate.  Although this game was fun to play at Wintercon, it's just another worker placement and rather long.  Would rather play Stone Age or anything else by Stefan Feld.

El juego de entrada es muy bonito y de inicio parece complicado, esto se soluciona con la primera partida pues cada acción puede tener un efecto en las demás acciones. 

Escala muy bien para 2 personas pero a cuatro hay más lucha por las acciones y la mecánica de acciones hace mejor su cometido.

Es cierto que son minijuegos, que es una ensalada, muy cierto pero esto no quiere decir que sea mala, si no te gustan estos tipos de juegos probar antes de comprar.

Altamente recomendable.

Played this game for the first time at a meet-up. I absolutely did not like it! There seemed to be a million ways to score, no tension. Not my idea of choice and consequences, the whole experience was flat. I won, but did not really know why. I now understand the term "point salad". I have yet to try other Feld games, hopefully this was just a bad one.

I tend to like the more streamlined games of Feld. This is not that streamlined, but is nevertheless the complexity that I want for a strategy game. I like how dice are used in this game, the special abilities in the characters, the twist in the cards abilities, and all the different (but not too many) paths to a potential victory. It's slightly more complicated than Bruges, which I also like. Very good game.

My personal favorite game by Feld, and quite possibly my favorite game of all time.  It's an absolute masterpiece from start to finish.  The design is flawless, and the intertwined mechanics have a strong connection to each other.  The game also has a nice "progression arc" to it.

There is a good amount of interaction, and there are plenty of opportunities to gain huge point swings.  Like Castles of Burgundy, the use of dice is independent for each player (compared to Macao's dice that have the same impact across all players).  Feld's biggest talent is his ability to invent unique (yet VERY clever) mechanisms into the core of his designs.  Feld was *THE* guy who made me a fan of dice again!  He was *THE* guy who created initiative track systems that are meaningful and well-integrated.  He was also *THE* guy who twisted the ancient "Mancala" mechanic into blissful brain burning frustrations.  I can go on and on.  Clearly the man's a genius and Bora Bora is no exception.

One aspect I've noticed with Bora Bora (same goes with Castles) is how the last round is often "pre-scripted" by the players.  In other words, there isn't much dodging around the tactics & strategies during the final turn.  This is typical because players have carefully planned their moves 1-2 turns ahead for the endgame, and are often committed on their path.

The last round of Castles has the same effect.  But Castles can sometimes feel a tiny bit "anti-climactic" (compared to the brilliance before it).  Still a superb game though!  Yet... for some reason I do [u]not[/u] get any such feelings with Bora Bora despite the (sometimes) scripted ending.

A++  Feld.  My hat's off to you, and I can't wait for your next masterpiece!

Another big juicy Feld with lots of different mechanisms that come together to form a whole. This time the main mechanism is dice placement. You do this to build your own tableau and your own engine.

The theme is nice with all the bright colors, the game itself is just okay. It's all mechanically sound and plays well, it is just not that exciting to me. Probably too much of a point salad for my tastes.

With regard to complexitiy I would compare it with Trajan (also with tons of different ways to gain VPs) but the dice mechanism (yet ANOTHER one after the ones at Troyes, Burgund Macao and the like) is much more accessible than the rondel/cube mechanism in Trajan.

I will be able to play it again over a 3 day period in November. Hope the rating stands repeated plays. 

Nov. 2012: it does! To be more specific: if you like Trajan: Bora Bora is better. If you don't like it, you are not into Feld games anyway (except maybe Notre Dame), so don'T waste your time

Nekem túl szűkös volt, és túlzottan meghatározónak éreztem a dobás szerepét. Sokkal jobban, mint pl. a burgundban, ahol, azért szinte mindig van jó lépés. Itt kifejezetten beszorulás érzésem volt néha. Kifejezetten szenvedős, struggle játék, nem az én világom, jobban szeretek lehetőségek közül választani. :)

Bora Bora is a very typical Feld game: Lots of different scoring opportunities, most of them in various states of disconnectedness, and almost entirely tactical play, trying to overcome the vagaries of the myriad of random subsystems.

As is often the case with Feld's games the central mechanism of choosing your actions could well stand on its own but the game slapped on top of it is a rather messy thing. Would you prefer Bora Bora to Castles of Burgundy or Trajan? No idea, but I'm going with neither.

RATING: 8.5
The (admittedly slight) engine building component in Bora Bora helps Feld's normally bland mechanics shine a little brighter. The different men and women tiles you collect during the game make this his best design for me.

I also feel there are crunchy decisions to be made each turn with the dice placement mechanics - too many Feld designs involve strategies mostly playing themselves once you get going.

A more fiddly and luck based version of Trajan mechanics, which makes me rate this lower, but still a fantastic game, and better than most non-Felds.  More difficult to teach, however.

RATING: 8
Wasn't sure through the first round if I was going to like this one as it really is another example of Feld's "point salad" approach to design - and this one revels in it! That being said, the core idea of higher rolls giving increased payouts but smaller chances of being able to play them is brilliant and Feld once again surprises me with a design that I have not yet seen and wished I invented myself! Then he built an (at-first) overwhelming number of ways to score points and bonus actions. It's a dizzying mess of symbols and graphics! Once you get through the first round however, it starts to make sense and by the end of the second round this game really zings!  The design choices actually all work together quite well and make this a much more heavier Euro than I was expecting.  But it all makes sense!  The goals create a great amount of tension in the game.  Other than it being somewhat of a mess to teach to newcomers, this is a great game!  I wish it could have been simmered a little bit more without risking the loss of any of its impact, but maybe that wasn't possible.  Overall, quite enjoyable!

This one looks intimidatingly complex, but it's not so bad. Everything you need to know is on the board, and the things on the board all make sense fairly quickly. I have a reasonable idea on strategy, but how to go about making a strategy work when you don't know what will come up when is a puzzle. For this reason it's maybe not a great game like Puerto Rico, but it is decent.

It's a very solid game. 
Somehow overproduced in terms of design. SOme mechanisms seem artificial.
You're constantly short in actions.
Took too long to play and without not enought fun from play - it seemed more like work.
We didn't get any feel of development (and it seems like it's important in these kinds of heavy games) and there were no breakthrough moments. You know - haha! here is my briliant move that I was preperaping for for a long time. Nothing like that.
The core dice mechanism is ingenious.

Whilst this may not reach the same heights as Castles of Burgundy it is still an excellent game.

Gameplay is a little unforgiving, one mistake and you can kiss your end of game bonuses goodbye. But the clever dice mechanism, variety and agonising decisions makes this one of the best games of 2013.

Very complex game, a solid Feld with many ways to score points. More tactic than strategic, with a clever system to manage dice rolls. The games are long, at least 3 hours with 4 people at the table, and longer with AP players. Even the set up needs much time, with thousands of pieces to put on the table. But if you are prepared to those things, you're going to play a deep and challenging game, interactive and funny. A must buy.

Tentative rating after just one play. The game is another fantastic design by Stefan Feld. The use of dice is innovative enough to has its own personality, different from Macao and Burgundy, both fantastic games by themselves. In Bora Bora there are many different ways to score points. You can also try to spoil other players plans taking tiles or jewelry that are valuable for them and still good for you to fulfill your objetives. Therefore the game is interactive enough for the regular euro, and I am very happy with it since I don´t like multiplayer solitaries that much. Two thumbs up for this game and the time will tell if I keep its 8.5 score or improve it to 9.

Probably my second favorite Feld after Luna but it's a somewhat distant second. Rialto might surpass Bora Bora in terms of being slightly less fiddly with lower rules overhead but still enjoyable for the decisions possible.

PROS
-Lots of player interaction.
-Lots of varying strategies.
-Gameplay is going to vary a lot from game to game.
-Busy but still pretty to look at.

CONS
-BB is a number of mini-games that feel more connected than Trajan but has a bit of that kitchen-sink type design.
-Fiiiiiiiddly to the extreme: an absurd number of chits, tokens, pieces, and cards.
-Numerous niggling rules questions but not a deal breaker.

RATING: 10
Bora Bora is directly competing with Castles of Burgundy for my favorite game of all time. It's an amazing game, but there are few things going against it as well.

Some of the good things (this list is much longer in my head): 
- Dice mechanism is a new twist on worker placement. It's original and familiar at the same time. It is essentially the same as in any classic WP, such as Agricola - but your workers are "weighted" here. In Agricola, workers a strictly blocking (as if they were all dice value "1"). In Bora Bora, the higher the dice value, the stronger the worker power, but it's ability to block and to not be blocked decreases. Simple and genius. 
- I love how tasks are implemented here. You sort of feel that you are filling 3 glasses at once, trying to make sure you have at least one glass full by the end of a round, at which point you replace it with a new glass, and by the end of the game you need to fill 9 glasses. It's a very pleasant balancing act. 
- Island minigame actually reminds me of Burgundy, yet it is different enough. While the map itself is static, the fishes are laid out randomly each game, making the island setup different and presenting a new puzzle every time. 

Not so good:
- I love tropical theme. In Bora Bora however, it doesn't work. Not necessarily because of the weak thematic connection of mechanics, which is expected of Feld, but because tropical theme sets expectation of something more relaxing and lighthearted, while here we get nothing but a heavy euro which requires you to concentrate and work.
- The game feels slightly "overwritten". I'm afraid to teach it anybody but the most seasoned gamers. That severely limits my options to actually get this game out..

Some say it´s too fiddly, other say the icons are too small or the game goes on for too long, even that it has dice and for that reason being too luck dependent. If those reasons lead to a bad gaming experience, so be it. Me and my group did enjoy this game. It took
a long time since Alea did publish a rather heavy game. Even if it´s a complex game and one has to explain the rules for half an hour, it feels less "work" than Trajan.
In it´s core it is an abstract Eurogame with the theme helping grasp the rules.
edit: It took four games until I had a such a bad dice roll that I had to confess: I can't mitigate this entirely and I have to accept a set back this round. As this seems enough rare in the game (as long as you take precautions having the right god cards at hand). This made me raise my rating a bit. Really a true gamers game.
edit: after 5 games I honestly had to upgrade my rating a bit as I really enjoy this game (but mostly play bad)

A good game although with a limited replayability.

I think this game is worth checking out for anyone who have never seen it and likes something different than your usual worker placement.

I like the help action, it is quite original the way you use your "worker" you use the pips on the die for the number of actions you can take with the helper. I also like the fact that you cannot place a die on a tile that is equal or greater to a die that is already there... although you can change that with god cards.

It makes me think of Tzolkin, but without the craziness of the wheels but with an island to work with instead. :)

But it's still a point hoarding game. I would have prefered less points and more features. Like when you accomplish a goal, instead of getting points you would get a bonus somewhere, like a character appears to occupy a hut (drawn randomly or not), or collect a ressource of your choice under one of your huts again, or advance a priest on the temple track towards the left, or something.

Point hoarding is so boring.

I would never buy this game... and if I got it as a present, I would eventually modify it so that it is no longer only a point hoarding game.

Didn't really care for this one.  A mess of multiple mechanics.  For a long, heavy Euro, this game is extremely tactical.  Luck of the tiles and your dice rolls make it impossible to formulate any coherent long term strategy.  The board is so busy!  The "theme" is pretty pasted on and it felt like a mix of mechanics that could have been about anything.

I generally like Euros, but this one just didn't sit well with me.  With great games like In The Year of the Dragon and Notre Dame, I'm sad to see that this is where Feld's design career has taken him.

I don't know... it's not a bad game, but it's not great either. Everything in this game has been used several times before and no matter what you do, each action feels the same, as all of them will earn you victory points.

Also, I can't think of a game that looks more crowded than this one. The players sheet may work, but it looks like a mess and the board isn't much different, even though it shows more structure.

To me this is the perfect example for an overcomplicated game. You can do so much, but it all feels the same. I'm sure you could get rid of many things in this game without changing it much.

Of course, there isn't much interaction, too.

RATING: 6
This game is pretty intimidating to play for the first time (or to explain to newbies), despite the excellent iconography on the player boards.  I'm not really sure that I like the game.  There are too many ways to get points, and you can't just follow one strategy to get all your points.  The final scores are in the 130-200 range, so it's not obvious how a 6-point play now is a good idea, or will cost you a turn that you could have used to set you up better to get more points later.

There are many 6-point scoring bonuses at the end of the game, but it's not a good idea to try to pursue them all (or even several of them).  The "all huts on the board" and "all filled with men/women" do seem to work together well, but it's hard to buy jewellery every turn or completely all 9 goal tiles that you receive.  You have to hope that you'll be able to score one or two of these bonuses by the end and not worry too much if you choose early in the game to take a different path that disqualifies you from getting some of them.

One thing that is important to note is that you can only put one hut in each region of the board.  So you're only guaranteed the fish points for a particular region if you are the last player to put a hut there!  This means that it might not be a good idea to go for the big-point fishes early, or at least it would be a good idea to use a Green God card to score those big fish points when you enter those regions early.

It's also important to note that tattoos can be earned (and hence the turn order can change) based on the man and woman actions in phase B.  There are tattoo actions on some man/woman tiles, which is obvious, but more subtle is the fact that there are "build building" actions that will give you a fire bonus as a result... which can be a tattoo.

This design really rubs me the wrong way. It's far too intricate to be good. There are dozens of ways to score, none of which are terribly interesting by themselves, nor do they make any kind of thematic or intuitive sense. Combines the worst aspects of worker placement (Oh you took what I needed? Guess I'm screwed) with dice rolling (Oh, I didn't roll what I needed? Guess I'm screwed). The player mat is one of the most ridiculous jumbles of unhelpful pictograms I've ever seen. This game doesn't even have a clever spark of an idea like Trajan's Mancala-esque mechanism. Playing it feels like an ordeal. I've played Bora Bora twice and will actively avoid in the future.

This game is a morass of victory point collecting.

There is no clear way to determine if you are playing well or someone else is leading the game until the final point scoring. 

You could draw any theme out of a hat and paste it on.

Even though I feel this is a dud, I can see the appeal for players who like the point fest that usually comes at the end of these type of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Bora Bora sat on a wait and see list for quite a while with me, despite being a highly regarded Feld game for a couple of reasons.

First, this is really a point-salad game, with lots of choices to make all the way along in the game, quite a few possible game-end bonuses, and really only one penalty mechanism- which is really not so much a penalty mechanism as just another way of falling behind your opponents. 

This is not necessarily a turn-off or an attraction to me; I like games more integrated with theme, but a well-done palette of point-salad can still appeal. Still the mechanisms didn't create the shiny factor.

More important I disliked the artwork. It seemed unattractive to my eye, and overly bright and multi-toned. Frankly it is still too tutti-frutti for my tastes in general, but it is also a lot less offensive to the eye when playing than I expected. 

Third the tropical island theme: I like it about as well as I like Tropical Island Life Savers; not my favorite, or my first choice, but not unpleasant if you need quick candy.

So I didn't grab up a copy right away. It seems this was a mistake on my part, as it turns out I like Feld's breadfruit game a good deal.

I liked this game guardedly on a first play (with 2), but after a second play (with 4), and after a couple of minor but important rules corrected during the game, I've decided that Bora Bora will definitely rank among my top Feld games. In fact I am setting an initial score of 7.5 for the game.

This game really offers a bewildering number of choices  in general, and like Trajan does to some it can probably seem overwhelming.

The dice mechanism is subtly different; not as involving as the mancala sub-game in Trajan seems to me, but the possible play of denying others access makes die placement choices more interactive, while the God cards can be used cancel the blocking effects enough that it still has a primarily solitaire feel with two.

But in a four player game I found the struggle for dice position tighter, and more engaging than for two. The corrected scoring of fish at the end made the struggle for hut placement more critical, and in fact the game came down to a tie-break.

For four players, instead of a unfavorable first comparison with Trajan (my top-ranked Feld game), I was minded more of Macao and a similar tightness to action choices (Macao appeals to me a great deal, but it's not quite as much of a home run as Trajan).

Bora Bora deserves it's fans, because it offers a tight, worker placement, with limited actions and resources, and just enough interaction to make it interesting, but with enough options to provide alternative choices if your 1st 2nd and 3rd options aren't available for that last die. 

Like Macao, I am starting Bora Bora at a 7.5 - the game has real merit, and it's nicely thought out.  There is no one catch-up mechanism that I see, but it's still very possible to play catch-up, and even win from behind.  The interactive aspects are not a huge penalty, but they make the game interesting, and players almost never suffer for a lack of options.

Bora Bora clicks along like a Swiss watch with too many hands for me- I couldn't make heads or tails of it at first, but once I played it all began to make sense, and it moves forward at the right pace to offer a satisfying experience that lasts just the right amount of time.

I think there is way too much going on in this game.  And the player going last in turn order is at a definite disadvantage in getting men & women helpers.  I might give it another try.

It's very good... maybe a 9/9.5 with a few more plays but currently I don't know if it's entirely good enough that it deserves that.

It's nice that all the strategies are balanced and there's not one cookie cutter strategy which you all rush towards. However they all feel a little 'too' balanced in some respects.

8.5 as it has some very neat mechanics to it (such as the way the dice work and the way the favours work) though neither of them are revolutionary they are certainly implemented well here

(05/17/2014) Comment based on 2 plays.

This is the wilder, crazier, younger sibling of [thing=84876][/thing], where Stefan Feld takes dice-rolling/action drafting to the next logical step of complexity and sadomasochistic pleasure.

Like CoB, dice are rolled and allocated to action spaces. However, instead of two, three dice are rolled for six turns. There are seven communal action spaces that players compete over, as in a traditional worker-placement game: 1) Use dice pips and convert into sub-actions/resources/VP; 2) Build statues for "fire" actions and compete for "god" tiles; 3) Convert land spaces with resources into villages, plus fire action; 4) Select a "man" tile; 5) Select a "woman" tile; 6) Build a hut adjacent to an existing hut via land; 7) Build a hut adjacent to an existing hut across water. What is unique about action drafting in BB is that once an action space has been occupied by a die, subsequent players can draft the action provided their pip value is less than the lowest pip value die on that space. Thus, if Player A drafts an action with a "6", Player B can draft the same action later with a "5" or less die. Player C can draft that same action with a "4", provided the "5" was the lowest die. Someone drafting with a "1" can lock out other players.

However, lower pip values generally mean less options. For example, there are six "man" and "woman" tiles available, each with a different ability. However, each tile is associated with a pip value. A "6" means a player can take any of the six available tiles, while a "1" restricts the player to only the tile associated with one pip. This makes it an interesting and delicious dilemma: either gain maximum flexibility, but allow other players access to the action OR restrict access to the action, but have less flexibility with your selected action. 

Just like the die-adjustment worker chits in CoB, BB does allow die-adjustment through "god" cards, which can be collected through Action #1, and any action that yields "fire" actions, which are generally through building statues in Action #2 and building villages in Action #3. There are two god that deal with this: 1) the "White" god, which converts any lower pip into a "6"; and 2) the "Blue" god, which allows a player to place a die equal to or greater than the lowest pip value die on a given action space. To invoke these gods, an "offering" chit must be made, which can generally be collected through Action #1, and the "fire" action.

As for scoring VP, there are generally six categories: 1) building huts on the various islands, depicted on the main board, which also yield resources; 2) building villages on the player tableaus, which also yield fire actions; 3) building and maintaining statues, whose values increase 1/2/3 per statue for the first third/second third/last third of the game; 4) number of "tattoos", which also determines the turn order for the next game; 5) individual jewelry, which can be purchased for a number of "conches" at the end of every turn; 6) satisfying personal objective tiles, which are evaluated at the end of every turn. In addition, there are extra bonus VP for having completed 9x objective tiles, collecting 6x jewelry pieces, collecting 12x resources, building 6x villages, placing 12x huts, and placing 12x "man"/"woman" tiles.

As huts are built on the island spaces on the main board, these open up spaces for "man"/"woman" tiles to occupy them, which in turn give extra actions/benefits at the end of every turn. There is a very large variety of these, which range from getting extra resources, allowing selection of additional "man"/"woman" tiles, to getting VP, and so much more. Since exactly one "man" and one "woman" tile can be activated, it is beneficial to collect both, and then have a variety to maximize flexibility. Further, if Action #1 is drafted, it is possible to "tap" these tiles on the tableau to a second position, where they give a one-time benefit, in terms of either "tattoos" for "man" tiles, or "conches" for "woman" tiles.

As can be seen from above, there are many, many complex interrelationships between all seven actions. Further, there are two spatial areas on each player's tableau, which serve as constraints for that player. Coupled with a common area where all players compete for a weak-form of area control, this is one complicated game. It took about 30-45 minutes to thoroughly go through the rules explanation, and as with any Stefan Feld game, first-plays are fraught with "What am I supposed to do?" reactions. Therefore, there is a substantial learning curve to play well, and score well in BB, as with any other Stefan Feld game. It is about finding the most lucrative combinations, given the die rolls you have made, as well as your opponents', and what actions/resources/tiles/cards they have taken before your turn. It is both exciting to see what one can do with one's die rolls, but it is equally frustrating as well, especially if the die rolls don't go favorably. That is what the god cards are for, and there are several others not discussed here, but collecting those is a task onto itself.

What is interesting here is that this does not feel like your typical Feldian "point salad", where you are trying to maximize the VP you collect in a given turn, or setting up something more lucrative several turns later. If nothing else, you can simply turn in a die and get some free VP, but there are definitively much better options available, regardless of how the others have drafted their actions. Like CoB, the VP value of completing villages goes down every third of the game, while statues go up in value. It seems there are several paths to victory, but no single path is assuredly the best, as everybody's die rolls constantly introduce chaos into the decision matrix. Further, the theme does not feel "pasted on" like earlier Feld designs; this one in BB is decidedly better integrated with the mechanisms, although there is no reasonable explanation for what the die rolls represent.

Play time is somewhat long at 2.5 to 3 hours for the first few games, but there is very little downtime, which occasional possible AP. The quality of the components is very good, typical of Alea, while the rules are somewhat verbose and dense. There is one heck of a chunky game here, and it will take more than a few plays to really get it. It is yet another Feld puzzle that begs to be explored further. It is a solid "8". Will it displace CoB or [thing=102680][/thing]? Hard to tell, as it is far less accessible than either of these two designs. Still, it seems deservedly placed in the top 100.

Another dice driven game.  Much more complicated than The Castles of Burgundy.  A 6 turn game. The main focus is fulfilling a mission each turn and 3 more at the end.  The action choices are limited by the dice but offset by limitations on placing larger dice.  God cards allow rules busting.  2.5-3 hours.

Very pretty.

RATING: 7
I found this much more approachable than some of Stefan Feld's other recent designs, but it shares an increaingly common characteristic with other recent Euros (Ora et Labora, Terra Mystica) in that it's utterly overwhelming first time you play. There are so many ways to earn points, all described by numerous small icons that the initial game explanation is likely to leave you bamboozled. It gets easier as you play, but I did find myself yearning for the relative simplicity of classics like Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence.

Well, this is ... very Feldy.It feels a little like Macao (you're collecting cards and trying to do something with them before you run out of space) a little like Trajan (there are lots of things you can do! lots of them!).  Mildly interesting, but it was hard to get a sense of it on the first play, especially since I didn't understand one of the rules, much to my detriment (everyone else got it right). Should try again.

I really like this game. At the time I purchased it, my collection was lacking a meatier Euro. This one appealed for three reasons: the price makes it a great bargain, the board and art are gorgeous, and I've always wanted to go to the real Bora Bora (yes, that's a silly reason to buy a game, but hey, I've had less reason for purchasing a game before!) I haven't played too many heavier Euros so I don't have a lot to compare it to at this point. The things I like are the plethora of strategy choices available (which I guess gives it that designation of "points salad") and none that, at least so far, seem overly dominant; the nice layer of player interaction from the dice placement mechanic, with the available but not spam-able options to "smooth over" dice results that don't work for you; and the gorgeous art design. The rules book takes a lot of flak, but I watched a few videos on play and didn't have any trouble grasping the game, and actually I don't think it's all that hard to grok. I'm a fan.

One of my favorite Feld games.  It's a bit narrow, as for the most part you pick a strategy or two early on and run with it, but any strategy can win.  Lots of competition and screwing and some die rolls, but lots of things in the game to mitigate those as well.  Well-designed, fun game.

Fun and challenging cerebral victory points salad with pretty game board and components.  This is a tough game to teach.  The game board and each player's mat is very busy and visually overwhelming.  There are many moving parts that form a fun victory point optimization puzzle, but the different actions you can do and the feel of the game present an unfortunate unpleasant thematic dissonance.  There is no indication of why we are adding huts to the island and adding workers and collecting jewelry and adding priests to the temple track.  Look, as Euro game enthusiasts, we are often professing that the theme is of marginal importance and games should be judged on mechanics and clever game design.  I feel compelled to point Bora Bora out as an example of a game design that failed to tie in the mininimum requisite theme to inform players why we are doing the actions we choose and how they make sense as steps toward the stated goals of the game.  It's not quite enough to have a pretty board and components and clever interconnected mechanisms and resource management, area control and novel action selection.  So now that I have bitched about the ethereal theme, I still enjoy playing the game.  I love the clever interconnected mechanics.  I just wish there was a better integrated narrative to inform players why we are choosing the actions besides the obvious: to maximize score at game end.

This was sadly the first Stefan Feld game I didn't enjoy that much.  It is convoluted and takes forever to teach. I think a lot of the mechanisms felt arbitrary, and there are too many ways to score points.  I love Trajan, and I can excuse the complexity there, since there need to be many things to do because of the mancala mechanism, but in Bora Bora there is just no good reason for them all.  The art is pretty but everything is so small that the boards look very busy.  I'm somewhat sad to say I won't seek this one out again, but as Stefan is in my top 2 of favorite designers, I am looking forward to what else he has coming out in 2013.

RATING: 8
This is the first Feld game I've tried and it seems I've jumped into the deep end. Nevertheless, don't be intimidated. After about two or three rounds, the game starts to move pretty smoothly. I've taught it to several different people now and by the second half of the game they have a good handle on the rules. The biggest task is learning the iconography, which is generally well-designed and easy to understand.

Overall, this is a game about drinking from a firehose of possibilities for earning VPs. At first it feels like a motley collection of different mechanics, however the more you play, the more the subtle connections between them become clear. Thus, gameplay is all about optimizing your options. The game offers many chances to screw the other players such as blocking their action selection via placing lower-valued dice, taking a man/woman/jewelry/task tile that they need, displacing their hut (robbing them of the end-game fish bonus), and pushing their priest out of the temple (causing them to lose an end-of-round VP bonus). The god cards are a handy way to bend the rules a bit, so there may be some recourse to nasty plays. Despite all that's going on, the game is surprisingly well-balanced, with many games ending with close VP totals.

I highly recommend it, unless theme is important to you, in which case stay far away.

'In the Year of the Dragon' easily remains the only good design from him.

Randomness is also too significant for the length of the game.

I realise that I am in the (serious) minority here, but after only two plays, while I get that there are lots of variables, I was left with a sense of "wash, rinse, repeat" and think the game relies too heavily on the luck of the draw with the cards.

So not horrible, but not great. No huge desire to play again (played twice, 4 people both times, 2nd in in one game, first in the other).

In Bora Bora, each player attempts to establish the best island village island by recruiting villagers, building huts, accumulating resources and fostering religion.  Each turn, players roll three dice and use the results, which can be modified by special "god cards," to take actions.  Along the way, each player is assigned various goals, the completion of which results in additional victory points.  

Bora Bora provides an enjoyable one-hour gaming experience with two players.  In particular, I like how the task goals provide direction in what could otherwise be a overwhelming choice of options.  I still prefer the mancala mechanic that Mr. Feld used in Trajan over Bora Bora's dice assignment mechanic, but really enjoy strategizing how to efficiently accumulate the most victory points with so many promising point generating actions.  At the moment, Bora Bora has a slight edge over Castles of Burgundy, but is not quite as satisfying as Trajan.

Great game, there are so many things to do and so many different ways to do them. You get pulled in a lot of different directions and it will require clever use of your actions and your bonuses to be able to do much more than half of them. You get bonuses at the end of each round depending on the people you recruit to your tribe, and you get a certain set of bonuses every time you build a part of your building and every time you make a priest. Dice are central to the game and there are better and worse rolls, but the worst rolls are either all high or all low, you want variety. Plus there are special cards you can collect and use that will even out the die rolls, among other things. These are my favorite kinds of games, the ones where you're pulled in different directions and you need to cleverly use your actions to chain together bonuses to get everything done.

This is one of the more aggressive versions of this kind of game that I've played; there are a lot of opportunities to block your opponents and really hurt their game, so that might bother some people but it really doesn't feel too bad, even as someone who generally doesn't like that too much.

Not very elegant, has a lot of mechanics which don't interact together very well.

Bora Bora features many of Stefan Feld's typical flourishes such as interesting action selection (specifically using dice) and a point salad full of ways to score points. This is usually right up my alley, but Bora Bora falls a bit flat for me. Luck - something Feld is usually a master of keeping in check - seems to be a tad too high for my tastes between the card draws and difficulty manipulating dice (unlike Castles of Burgundy, there is something resembling an optimal dice roll). I also wasn't a fan of the objective system that forces players into certain actions and the way that players don't so much build engines but rather connect actions together (e.g. expansion allows getting a resource that can be used in the future to build and acquire another resource that can be used in the future to...). The game feels more tactical than it seems like it should be. It also doesn't scale down to lower player counts as well as his other games. The art is bright and colorful (but busy) and the game certainly provides a wealth of meaningful choices, but it lacks the satisfying feelings of finding combinations and optimizations that make his other games shine.

Another excellent point salad game from Feld. Beautiful (if unimportant) theme. Excellent decisions all the way through. Scales wonderfully for all player counts as his games usually do. Every decision is tough because you only get to place 18 dice over the course of the game. As always with his games, the key is getting those precious extra actions!

Initial Rating: 8.0 (September 2013)

What a surprise, I (generally) like Feld games, but this one exceeded my expectations by far. Perhaps it can be my favorite Feld and it is certainly the heaviest one I have played. As usual you have lots of options with very few dice to make it happen. The rules are many, but they are pretty simple, the “heaviness” comes from the choices required to play, they are quite interesting and I love them.  

The game components and art are ok, although they are better than other Alea games. I dislike the paper thin and boring theme, but the gameplay is good enough to make me like the game. 

Bora Bora is a very (typical) “Feld” game, nice implementation on using dice, it also features a track to determine turn order. There isn’t anything new going on this game however everything works perfectly together, and I had to think a lot more in this game than in the other Felds, so I really like Bora Bora. 

The game features some luck with the goals and the man/woman characters, but it doesn’t bother me much as you have plenty of opportunities to mitigate it. 

Bottom line, a must have for me, great game and I recommend it.

After many plays, my desire to play Bora Bora has diminished a bit. I still consider it a very good game and I won’t ever get rid of it. 

In one of my recent plays, a player rolled six 1s in two consecutive turns. It was very hard for him to keep up. I continue to believe the luck factor is controllable and mitigable, but I plan to play with the mini expansion to mitigate it even more.

"Boring boring" despite tight mechanics.  Pros: The graphic art and components are well done, and nice and colorful. The mechanisms in the game are well designed, and as is typical with Feld games there are a lot of choices (perhaps too many) and a lot of pathways to get points. Cons: The theme seemed pasted on, in a two player game the hut expansion mechanic does not work very well, and the game was just simply un-engaging.  We could not wait for the first game to end, it just seemed like we were performing actions for the sake of performing actions, and when we finished the game we wanted to put it away instead of having another go at it (never a good sign). Conclusion: Overall, the game is well-designed but simply just not fun.

I've only played a few games but thus far can't help but to think there's several glaring flaws.  The priest track is not balanced nor are some of the men and women.  You can get beat down by some of the goals as well.  Most of that wouldn't bother me so much if the game played about an hour quicker.  A pretty game with some neat concepts but overall I was disappointed.  Burgundy is the better game.

From the makers of Castles Of Burgundy comes another complicated strategy game in which you build huts across islands for your male and female workers to base from. The player mats are heavier in information, and the game is still slow to learn, but it goes quickly once you get the hang of it, and Ravensburg deserves extra points for having a quick recap of the rules in a side column. More importantly, though, the options are more limited, leading to a much closer game than before.

PLUS: tons of options, strategy based on rolls, great manual
MINUS: playing time isn't small

Good game but probably too many interconnected actions. I am afraid that some actions are easy and give many benifts (temple) and others are the opposite (moving, building). There are a lot of differences between the goals as well, this increases the randomness too much. The global goals give very few points in comparison to the effort. Downgraded to 6.

There is a lot going on with this game with many options for scoring. I found the dice rolling randomness to be sometimes annoying. You have plenty of options with the dice, but you may not get the roll you want so you need to adjust your game. The problem is the adjustment sometimes seemed like it might not be your best option. The cards did help work around the dice rolls, but that just added another layer of perhaps unnecessary complexity. I am really liking this game after three plays. Having such a variety of choices can keeps it interesting. I still think the dice could affect your game, but they also force you to think more creatively about your options, so I can tolerate them.

Do I need this if I have [gameid=84876]? Well, it fits the same slot in terms of length, number of players and complexity as a midweigth to heavy euro game. It also features lots of levers, systems, subsystems and a hundred ways to score victory points although usually in the hundreds and not the two-hundreds. Both games are games of maximizing efficiency. Beside that, it's a different enough game. It doesn't feel as constructive, the luck of the dice seems heavier to mitigate, it's less accessible, there's a few more possibilities to screw another player from points. In the long term, it might be the deeper game while feeling more mechanical. After one play, I prefer die Burgen von Burgund as the more cohesive game. Bora Bora - like Trajan - might be a step too far in depth by complexity although it's a good game I'm willing to play more.

RATING: 8
An interesting dice placement game. One of Feld's most cutthroat. If you've played a lot of Feld games, you know what you're getting into. I like that the pieces are a step up from Castles of Burgundy, but there's still not enough theme in the game to satisfy that part of my brain. I would rank it as not quite as good as Castles of Burgundy but above Trajan (I'm not near as keen on Trajan as many others).

Just like most recent Felds, too much stuff going on at once. I can see why some people would like this, but it is a little overwhelming at first, and I get the sense that perhaps the "multiple paths to victory" thing is an illusion. Can you really figure out where you went wrong?

Bora Bora suffers from yet another boring theme, but what drives me crazy about the game is the fish scoring on the island, which gives you little to no incentive to ever expand until the very end of the game.

Probably the most complicated of all Feld games.  However, after a single play it all sort of makes sense.

The game is quite brutal even without the usual Feld punishment mechanism.  There is just way too many things that you want to do and only 18 actions to do them in the game.

I am a Feld fan and my initial ranking of this game would be third after In the Year of the Dragon and Macao.

2015-02-01 - It's OK designed game with interesting dice placement mechanism, but the theme only pretends to be there. I don't see any point in doing all those actions (except getting points, of course), which IMO don't connect with each other too much themewise and it bothers me a little bit. I assume I won't become Stefan Feld's fan, but I'll se after I'll try some other game of his.

2015-02-05 - 6->7 I changed my rating, because I realized that I'm eager to play it again. Still I think, that there is a lot of stupid things to do in this game. We'll see.

2015-04-21 - 7->6,5. Didn't play though.

2015-05-06 - 6.5->6 After another rethinking back to initial rating.

Már a szabálykönyv olvasgatása közben is éreztem, hogy ez nekem tetszeni fog. Pedig a körítés valójában inkább nem tetszik, de igazából nincs jelentősége, ide-oda tologatás az egész, nem sokat számít a téma.

Az akciók kockával való aktiválása zseniális szerintem, azaz minél kisebb értéked van, annál több hely közül választhatsz, viszont gyengébb az akció ereje. Ez egy nagyon konfrontatív megoldás, mert egy-egy kockával mindenki mástól elzárhatunk bizonyos lehetőségeket. Nagyon sokat számít a játékossorend emiatt.

Nem a legegyszerűbb játék, sőt, inkább hevi kategória, de emellett elfogadható a játékidő, viszont a szabálymagyarázat és setup nem kevés. Nem bármikor, de szívesen játszom még vele.

Picked this up in an Amazon sale (only $25!). Have gotten a few play throughs of this and, man, do I love it.

Like The Castles of Burgundy but with a tropical theme. Seems busier, but at the same time the mechanics felt a bit more balanced for a two player experience. Still, it always felt like we needed one more action per turn to actually do all the things one might want to do in a single game.

Well, what to say, a game with lots of different game mechanics without any theme coherence whatsoever. The quickest way to learn the rules is by not trying to make sense out of them, thematically that is. It is a totally abstract game with many ways to score points which may appeal to some. Anyway, for me, there are so many other games in this category I'd rather play.

Grafically overloaded. As a game overdesigned.

To many ideas and mecanics for a game, that could have been a successor for Castles of Burgund.

A lot of choices and things to remember are something I expect and accept in a game of a much higher level of strategy like Automobile or Agricola, but here is to much luck involved for that.

08-27-2014 - Wow, no comments on this yet?  Hmm... haven't played in a while.  Well, it's no Trajan.  This is not my favorite Feld game, nor is it close.  It is enjoyable though.  It feels like there is a strategy to be found that would be superior, though I haven't found it.  Perhaps it doesn't really exist.  But it feels like it does and for some reason that makes this game less enjoyable to me.  I don't know if that makes any sense at all, but that's the best way I can describe how I feel about it.

Kinda just feels like "same shit different day". Feld is designing the same game over and over. I think that overwhelming you with little things to do is a distraction from the fact that theres no real strategy to it. Try to specalize as well as possible, try to maximize this or that, try to take advantage of what you're forced into. Nothing new, not a deep experience.

Not bad, but because don't see that this gets enough playing time, it can go. Macao and Luna are better Feld dsigns, but Burgen von Burgund is worse than this...

A very typical Feld. I rate it slightly below most Felds because the main mechanism isn't anything really new or interesting - it's a not very different variation on dice placement. The actions built on the mechanism are really the usual Feld stuff, a separate track to determine turn order, a building grid that's also present in most Felds (this time it's on the personal boards) etc. etc.
Still, a seemingly well balanced, gamer-friendly optimization game; it just doesn't offer anything as novel or interesting as most previous Feld games.
Update: and yet, for some reasons, it's somehow more well-developed and interesting than most Felds.

A sprawling Feld's with lots of rules, lots of bits, long play but a somewhat shallow depth that doesn't really justify all of fiddling (unlike Trajan for instance).

Not a bad game, but unexciting and unremarkable.

Burgundy is better in my opinion as it comes together better and isn't the crazy mish-mash of mechanics like this one.  This one does have nastiness potential as opponents can mess with you by playing low dice on action squares and forcing you to take a different course of action.  Seems to be multiple ways to victory...there are certainly a ton of ways to score points.  Theme doesn't shine through but that was expected since this is Feld we are talking about here!

Kifejezetten szívesen játszottam ezzel a játékkal mind a 4 alkalommal. Épp megfelelő számú és súlyú döntési helyzetet ad, sok út van, amin haladhatok, szép is, és bár elsőre nagyon összetettnek, túlbonyolítottnak tűnik, de alapvetően tök egyszerű az egész, tényleg nem bonyolultak a szabályai, mondhatni: letisztult. Szívesen játszanék még vele, nagyon profi iparos munka, azonban valami apróság még hiányzik belőle ahhoz, hogy muszájnak érezzem megvásárolni - lehet, hogy csak további néhány játszma.
Egyetlen problémám van csak vele: túl sok kis mütyür van hozzá, amiket nem csak a játék elején, de játék közben is sokat kell pakolászni. De: megéri. Jó játék, tényleg. Kiegyensúlyozott, minimális szerencse szereppel.

I don't know what it is about this game, but I just don't really like it.  It's "too much" in that there are always tracks to be adjusted and pieces to replace and sets to be completed and pairings to be made and yada yada...pick a couple mechanics and do them well is what I say!  This game is like 10 other games threw up and Bora Bora was the result.  Even though my FAVORITE game of all time, Trajan, is similar in incorporating many different mechanics, Bora Bora is just clunky and messy and not nearly as sophisticated.

By far the most sexist of the Felds, this game has big strong men with tattoos building huts and women collecting vagina shells for jewelry. But seriously, it is basically point salad: Polynesian Edition. And it's great. I love the variety in actions and the way that dice are used to take them.

RATING: 5
This is a Feld point salad.  There are a myriad ways to score but the main mechanic is that you roll three dice and placing them for actions.  You can get more actions by placing high value dice, but you can block a space by placing a low value.  Some actions require a minimum value to execute.  

You are collecting sets of various items that increase if you get more of those items.  

I found it about the same weight as Trajan, but lacking the excitement that Trajan brings to the game.  It is an acceptable game and I would probably play again, but I doubt I would suggest it or seek it out.  It is a generic but well designed, themeless Euro.

RATING: 8
Another solid entry in the Alea big box series, and it's easy to see why Alea continue to keep giving the job to Stefan Feld. This is a slightly "busier" design than you would typically expect from Stefan Feld in that there's a lot going on, but it is nevertheless clearly one of his designs, with many of the trademark elements; dice with variable uses, competition for turn order, and a plethora of scoring opportunities.

I'm not totally sold on the artwork and components. Although the quality is good, the colourful artwork and small size of some components can make it difficult to take it all in. The player mats, of which nearly half is dedicated to summarising rules and scoring, is daunting at first, but thankfully the iconography is logical and consistent, so once you've heard the rules, it's pretty easy to remind yourself.

The first play through of this game was difficult, as it's very hard to gauge how everything fits together and what the good strategies are. However, subsequent plays have shown that while there's a lot going on, there is plenty of room for building good strategies. It's not the sort of game where you can do everything, so specializing is rewarded.

preliminary rating after 2 games

In its heart it's a point-grab fest,with the goal to play optimally with the opportunities the game (men/women etc..)  and players (dice placement) you allow to execute. It's not only a tactical game but you have to look forward to reach short term goals; there is a cascade of actions for everything you want to do
The player who knows best these short term goals and  adapt him/herself the best to the always ongoing changes on the board, will be the winner.

best dice game ever

The best part of the game for me is the fact I've never seen a game with sooooo many different pathways to  victory !  Until now, I think that these pathways are very well  balanced.
My only long term concern is how many luck is needed to win  this game once  every player  thoroughly knows the system , every small action is a balancing act of luck and opportunity I think

Played once. Typical Feld, lots of things to do, lots of mini-goals to work towards and feel good about, a truckload of cardboard chits that give various bonuses, and points for nearly everything.

I definitely think the orange promo tiles are a must as they mitigate crappy dice rolls.

such a busy board! but I like it
half of the board (yours and the general one) is basically a player aid.  The iconography really does well telling you whats going on and stay thematic.
No big negative effects for messing up you just miss out on points.  Feels a bit point salad-ie but in a little differnt way than I'm used to.
good dice placement is the main mechanic, though a little harsh for my taste.  Made better with use of god cards which isn't as obvious as it should be.

"More" isn't always "better". Someone should say that to my friend Feld. 

This game feels like [thing=102680][/thing] (and I didn't really like that one). Lots of ways to "collect" points, but in all these options, Feld forgot to add "gaming fun". And yet I'm a fan of most of Feld's games.

Just like [thing=106217][/thing] (not a Feld game), this game tries to hide its dryness by offering you lots of components with very bright and happy colors. Theme? What? Was it supposed to have one? :-)

Off course the game mechanism is well constructed, and I'm sure there will be people that will actually like it, But I would prefer to spend the 3 hours it took (1 hour explanation + 2 hours playing time), to play some other (Feld) game.

Considering the intellectual effort you need to invest in this game, isn't it a bit stupid to let dice decide on your options? Throwing high numbers a lot, can really kill your chances.

Typically a game that, when you didn't play it for a few months, you will be enforced to reread of the rules.

I'm disappointed by this one.

With such a baroque game, a rating after the first game can not be anything but tentative. The many plays that some folks already got out of this one prove that overcoming the initial complexity will be repaid, but to me personally, Bora Bora might well fall under the curse of too many competing games with the same weight.

Which would be a shame, because I absolutely love the action dice mechanic. And at least for the moment, I can't help but wish for a more accessible implementation of that idea, maybe by a designer not from the Rube Goldberg school of game design.

Not my kind of game at all. Took the dude an HOUR AND TEN MINUTES to explain it enough to get us to the point of being able to play it, and even then we had no idea what was going on. Although in the game's defense he was pretty bad at explaining stuff and basically overloaded us with info. That being said, there really IS that much going on with it. There is an absurd amount of mechanics, an obnoxious reliance on obtuse iconography (looking at you, too, Race For The Galaxy), and is all limited to a total of 6 rounds, meaning that you'll never be able to utilize all of those mechanics in one game. Those are 3 huge red flags for me, personally. Others might enjoy it, for sure. But get away from me with that crap. If the idea of Terra Mystica in the Pacific Ocean sounds intriguing, this is your game. If you're like me and you can't stand Terra Mystica or other super-dense Euro games, run for the hills.

This is vying for my favourite Stefan Feld game. I think it varies between this, Trajan, The Castles of Burgundy and The Speicherstadt. Probably depending which one I last played.

But boy do I hate teaching this game. For the look of the game and board/player board artwork forget point salad this game looks like Syd Barrett salmagundi salad. I saw things like this when I was experimenting in my youth! It looks like a starving perp has broken into the carribean supermarket ate as much of the fruit as possible and then done a runner from the arriving cops, vomiting this up on the way out as their overworked legs pumped their stomach into a hyperactive state.

But get past that and the game play is fantastic. Get past the fantastic game play and you realise the colourful artwork is fantastic. Get past this and you realise all those halucinations you saw on the side of your player board are actually useful summaries of what your mind is being taken through. Then you understand what is really going on in the game and you realise your mind has finally raised itself up like an overclocked deck-jacker from "Neuromancer" and achieved that unique Stefan-like state of Feldian mush and probably looks like the artwork you have just spent the last hour trying to interpret.

I digress. What I love about this game is that deep down hidden behind everything your mind is trying to compute, and make sense of, the gameplay is fairly simple. You are lead through decisions by the tasks you are given each round to complete. For new gamers this makes the game so much more a pleasant experience than say Trajan where you are often left scratching your head wondering which way to turn as you realise you are spending way to long thinking about moving small coloured pieces of wood between flat 2D cardboard bowls whilst your fellow players rampage past you like roman hordes after bread, games and wealth. Here you know in the short term what you want to do .... And yes you want to do that as soon as possible and then .... then, you want to bugger up your fellow players with cunning, devious, wily plays of your dice.

This brings us to the dice play, which is delicious. You can truly bugger up your opponent and then sit back and watch them squirm. But squirm they will and the strength of this game is there is almost always another way to get to where you want to be. Pray to whichever god takes your fancy or ask your tribesmen and women for help. It is this ability to squirm and wriggle out of tight situations and accomplish your goals which makes this game so enjoyable.

I really enjoy this game but due to the perceived heaviness of the game it doesn't come out that often.

Love it. Keeper.

My opinion of this game started pretty low, maybe near a 6, but rose steadily, and has now teetered off around an 8. What I'm really growing to love about this game is just how rewarding it is. It's really one of the hallmarks of a good Feld game: you get rewarded for doing good things. Bora Bora looks at the good things you've done in your gameplay, and says "good job, here's a small bonus for doing so well!". It's just very rewarding to play this game and always get that good feeling that you've done something right. What brings this game down slightly is the super long setup time, and how fiddly it is at times. I feel like the setup time is too long for what this game is, and there are just a few too many bits for me to like. It's not really enough to ever deter me from playing the game, just something that annoys me a little when I pull it out. I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get a deep, heavy strategy game that rewards you for planning ahead, and building an in-game engine.

- many viable strategies to try (I haven't tried them all so far, but I feel I can).

I enjoyed the colorful board and fun theme more than i do in most of Feld's other offerings. This game has a lot of different elements going on in it, and i found it slightly AP inducing because of the dice planning. Its core is dice placement, but you have to spend extra time planning and analyzing because in order to choose an action, the dice you place has to be a lower number than the dice that's already on that action. So there's a tight stressful element right there, choosing which order to do your actions in. Overall i felt that the thematic elements such as tattoos, conch shells, huts, and necklaces make Bora Bora a fun and enjoyable game.

We played Bora Bora for the first time yesterday (16/02/13).

A first impression: Overall I think the game is very good.
It's a game where a lot is going on, multiple roads to victory and there is a lot of indirect interaction (therefore very prone to AP).
Bora Bora has a semi original usage of dice (the dice are used to activate actions, and at the same time they can limit your opponents to use these actions (can be very cutthroat) but combined with a lot of random placed tiles this makes Bora Bora a bit heavy on the luckside, especially for such a heavy game. Luckily there are cards to tweak your dice, so that's a good mechanism to counter your bad luck. 


I look forward to play this a lot the coming weeks and months

I've refrained from buying Bora Bora for a long time, since it shares some obvious similarities with CoB and Trajan, both favourites in our collection (we also own Bruges and Luna, but rate them quite a step below the other two). I finally pulled the trigger when I got it for a good price sans shipping costs at amazon.de and have played it twice since. It's just amazing how this game clicked. We just instantly groked the rules and mechanics, who made themselved immediately recognizable as a Feld brainchild. The game was way less daunting and convoluted as I feared. I have a hard time imaging a Trajan fan who wouldn't also love this game. It has the same "minigame collection" style gameplay and agonizing decisions. Its mechanics are maybe even more interlocked as in Trajan but the weight is still comparable. It's also more colorful and less drab as Trajan and provides a nice "change of scenery". Rating this a 9 for now, a smidgen below CoB and Trajan, but that might as well just be me being careful to award it too high a score after just two games. An absolute hit for us and should be right in the ballpark of every Feld afictionado. Highly recommended!

Downgraded to 8.5 after the first shine faded a little. Still a great game and one I'd always be happy to play.

RATING: 7.5
Preliminary rating based off one solo play.  I feel like the game just overstepped on complexity to retain an enjoyable game experience.  Feld has never been known for a great theme in his games, but as games become more complicated, the theme becomes important to remember and understand how everything interacts.  I think Bora Bora could be a brilliant game for the type of gamer who can devote many plays to it in a short time.  Unfortunately, I have a lot of games with not a ton of time.  If I'm lucky, I'll get the same game to the table 3 times in a month...

Edit:
I've enjoyed this game more than I initially expected, but I'm still debating whether to keep it or not.  I simply enjoy Trajan and Macao so much more...

Probably my second least favorite Feld, just ahead of Rialto. It's not a bad game, it's just that it's arduous to get through. The increased rules complexity doesn't lead to deeper, more meaningful decisions compared to a more streamlined game like Macao. I'd rather just play Macao twice in the time it takes to play Bora Bora, and if I'm really in the mood for a point salad I'll go with Burgundy if I want dice and Trajan if I want the mini-game vibe.

RATING: 7.8
My third big Feld purchase, after Burgundy and Trajan. And I like it.
It is a bit heavier (rule complexity) than the other two, but grants you (as expected) many ways and tactics to score points.
However it feels not as open and elegant as the other two.

RATING: 8
Typical Feld. Many engines to build on, many ways to score points. Hard to see the viable paths in my first game: try this, try that. Think it over and do better next time. I am very much looking forward to play this again. Not sure whether it is of the same level as Trajan, but this is a good game, that's for sure. Prelimenary rating, will be adjusted after future plays.

Update: Still a lot to wrap your head around. Trajan I can play comfortably now, but this one is more complex. A challenge, I improve with every game.

Nice mechanic: no matter what's you result with your dice, they could be always useful. 
But the game is not as good. It's a tipical feldian game: a lot of different actions, a lot of points with point salad.

A ridiculous amount of ways to score and a neat mechanic where you roll dice which are used for you action selection. Higher numbers on the die allow you to do more but lower numbers are useful later in the round as you'll need to play a lower die than one already placed on an action in order to use it.

Want a really long game -- this one will trip up any AP-prone players.

Bora Bora feels as if it is intended to rival or complement Trajan, though it doesn't feel quite as slick. I need more plays to decide if it has Trajan's staying power, but it definitely gives you that point salad curiosity that makes me want to keep trying different strategies and tactics. It is an extremely tight game. A decision or misstep on turn 1 can close off certain end game bonuses. It can also be very mean. Blocking is a real thing and players need to accept that going in.

A heavy Feld game in line with the likes of Trajan.  As usual for Feld, it is low on theme and point scoring is odd and all over the place.  Because of the lack of theme teaching it can be difficult and lots of little things to remember to do (fire bonus, how the man/woman tiles all work, god cards, etc).  Even through this its a great game.

This is a heavy Euro that I love for the relaxing theme. Who doesn't love playing on island paradises? There is just so much to do and so many ways to score VPs, esp. at the end. There is never enough time or resources to do all you want. So one really has to strategize. And pay very careful attention to everything going on. The dice mechanism is a nice way to balance HI and LO numbers

Overwhelming at first, mostly because of the crowded and colourful board. After playing the game it makes a lot of sense. Lot's of player interaction, the game can get pretty nasty. I like to screw my fellow players out of some points, so that is a plus for me. The game is very strategic, point salad off course and more on the heavy side for a feld. One of my favourite felds for sure!

This game is highly rated and looks gorgeous - and is victory point salad of the wrong sort for me. I don't mind complexity  - I *DO* mind when the instructions don't actually clearly call out what each kind of piece looks like... which is PRETTY important for the purposes of, you know, learning to play the damned thing.

My good buddy Justin and I gave this a spin, got through it, and both decided by the end of it that it wasn't really all that fun given how much of a quagmire it was to slog through the rulebook trying to figure out which piece/chit/token implies or does.  Hard to figure out the right victory point salad recipe... if you can't remember or don't even know what all the ingredients do.

Also: awesome theme and gorgeous art.

RATING: 9.4
This might be the best Feld I've played. The dice mechanism of worker-placement blocking is incredibly clever (the higher die value, the better action for you - the lower the value, the more you block the field for others).
Lots of rules to take in at first, but it pays off. Pretty visuals and nice theme, tropical islands and flowers in their hair (although sadly the theme feels completely disconnected from the mechanisms - and there's no reason why a female can only collect shells once).

My second Feld title.. I don't enjoy this as much Castle of Burgundy.. It is a good game mechanic wise, and looks awesome, but seems to lack longevity & depth..

Edit:I enjoy this game more as 4 player, more interesting..

I was on the fence about the game for a long time because although it looked fun & interesting, I'd also read it can be confrontational and my wife & I typically don't enjoy those types of games.

Actually, the game is great. My wife & I both enjoyed it immensely and didn't find it especially confrontational Yes, you can get blocked out of certain actions if your dice are too high, but the god cards + offerings also help to ensure that you're able to do something productive with your dice. The promo orange god tiles should help even more.

Fantastic, I really enjoy it! A colourful, puzzly pointsalad. Feld seems to be right up my alley with this one. The game feels a bit like the bigger & meaner brother of "The Castles of Burgundy"; it has more depth to it & better theme and visuals.

RATING: 8.5
Like many other Feld titles the theme is pasted on to a VERY GOOD abstract game.  However, for some reason this theme is not as appealing to me (i.e. flowery victory point track, women creating jewelry), where some of his other titles I at least found the theme more to my liking, pasted on as it may be.

If you already own Castles of Burgundy (I do), then I'm not sure whether or not you need this title as well.

Addendum:  Regardless of what I said above, I got a chance to play this game, and I really liked it and ended up purchasing it.  Damn you Feld :)

A little more spiteful than Feld's usual offerings, but very enjoyable all the same. I have a love/hate relationship with the task tiles though. I can't decide if they help keep the game tight, or are too strict on what avenues you're able to pursue. As I've played the game more, I've found they're not as intrusive as they were when I first started playing Bora Bora due to learning how to utilize the God Cards more often. Unlike a lot of Feld's games, this game has some pretty tremendous depth beyond the first handful of games. It's not my favorite, but I think it's the most rewarding one to explore over multiple plays.

Too much of a point salad, too much of randomness, and the same (now) boring Feld  mechanism: take two or three dice, and let them decide which points you get, while keeping you distracted with other elements, so you think you have control over things. Oh yes, you can tattoo your men and get shells for your women. I think you have to be a Feld die hard fan to be able to toture yourself to learn and appreciate it. Moreover  there are many many exception rules  which you have to remember. Why bother, go try another meaty game from another designer instead of someone who has few dice as his ultimate designing tool while trying now and then to incorporate them into a so called game.

Another good and solid point salad game from Stefan Feld, Interesting use of the dice, where the value of the die defines the power of your action and the availability, as when you place the die it must be of lower value of the previous one (if any). Nice and colorful art, many ways to score points, many paths to victory. Chosing the most efficient action every time is a very good and thinky puzzle you have to solve.

I totally quote this comment:

"The problem is that rolling all low numbers is still far worse than rolling all high numbers, and being able to block someone out of a spot is poor compensation for an entire turn where you can basically accomplish nothing. I think this is why I am not as crazy about this game compared to, say, the Castles of Burgundy, in which you usually have some useful thing to do with your dice. In Bora Bora, you find yourself continually screwed, seemingly on every other turn. There are plenty of other games which have a similar limiting/frustrating feel (Agricola comes to mind), but because in Bora Bora the pips on the dice are often the cause of your screwage, it can seem arbitrary and ultimately less satisfying."

I had the same feeling

A very typical Feld, but this time with much more interaction. This game starts with an overwhelming amount of information, but game play is actually very clean and elegant, while decisions aren't obvious - you need to look at your opponent's dice and predict what they want to do so you can place a dice of suitable value to use the actions. 

If anything, there's plenty to keep track. You need to look ahead the function of woman/man and task tile displayed each round, not to mentioned those that you have, in order to plan your move. That said, once you are familiar with the icons, you can start to formulate strategy much easier. While this game kind of awards specialization, a diversification approach is perfectly fine and scores have been close among players. 

This is one of the Feld's better game, though it may takes a play or two to truely appreciate it. The large amount of info needed also makes it slightly worse than some of his best titles that are much cleaner.

There's a lot going on in this game, maybe a little too much for me to still call it fun :) Will see after more plays if that changes. 

It's a clever game, no doubt, but am not blown away.
FYI, Trajan hits a perfect balance between complexity and fun, so it remains my nr 1 Feld game for now.

In the island of Bora, Bora there are 6 rounds. Each round you roll three dice. You place dice, one at a time on action tiles to do the action: expand by water or land, take a man tile, take a woman tile, build, put a priest on a temple or do a helper action. The higher the dice you put on the action tile, typically the higher amount of things you get to do. However, subsequent plays on that action tile can only be dice that are of lower value. 

You then decide to use one man and one woman tile (which are variants of the action tile). Finally you complete tasks, buy jewels and draw more task tiles.

Finally added to the mix are God cards which let you score fish, or modify dice, or give you more man/woman actions.  In the endgame you score points for being adjacent to fish (the last one in gets the fish points). 

There are a myriad of ways to score points, which may turn some people off. I don't mind it, but certainly this is one of Feld's more complex games. I enjoy the various challenges of trying to meet tasks, and you are jammed for actions. I'm not sure this game is that accessible to all gamers though. Still, I'd like to get in a few more plays.

While I don't always love a point salad, I enjoy them when they have a point.

Bora Bora utilizes the point salad method of distribution to ensure that you can win in any number of ways, and I love it!  So many games, I thought I was assured victory, but forgot all about something at the end of the game, like the fish score and someone snatches the victory.

It is a very balanced game. There are task tiles to give you some objectives, but I've won by largely ignoring these and going for other things. I just love how you can win by using any crazy combination that you can think of. Sometimes, those plans turn out to not be the best, but you never know until the end. The beauty of the game is that with no two games turning out the same, typically you have to adjust your plan based on the plans of your opponents.

RATING: 5.5
A little complicated, but I liked this more than Castles of Burgundy I think. Its theme and game board felt livelier to me anyway, than Burgundy's dryness. Gameplay-wise, I thought the dice locking you out was interesting, but I thought there was a fair bit of luck in how they were rolled and what tiles came out, which strongly affects your prophesies and resources. I'm not saying this isn't a strategic game (in fact, I think you can make a fair number of strategic and tactical choices), but I do dislike how the dice can screw you a bit.

I think what I dislike about Stefan Feld's games is that it sometimes feels mechanically convoluted for the sake of gameplay. I felt like this with Terra Mystica too. I prefer simple rules with deep gameplay, but with this, there's things happening within things, affecting other things, and random things to remember. Perhaps I'm just not good at this stuff or its too complex, but I so much prefer games like Puerto Rico or Power Grid, which feel so much smoother to me. Not sure if my point gets across and would love a discussion about this, as its hard for me to pinpoint what I dislike precisely about his games and would love some talk over this. But basically, a lot of things in the game are kind of arbitrary, and there's not tie-in other than to balance the game/mechanics. I don't mind this a bit, but I think its present in a lot of his games. They also just tend to feel dry/not lively to me, compared to other euros like Agricola or Lords of Waterdeep which feels a bit more lively or engrossing.

Perhaps one way is saying that theres a lot of tiles and chits and stuff happening, so it doesnt feel that elegant when it really should be. Strategy games like Puerto Rico just feel a lot smoother and cleaner and offer a better depth to complexity/weight ratio.

Anyway, I think this game was decent if not a bit much to swallow at once. I would definitely play again if offered, though I am not craving to play it.

This is not point salad.  It's a whole point salad BAR.  The bewildering array of options and the ease with which dick moves (i.e., slapping a one-pip die on a highly desirable tile) can be executed make this one of Feld's nastier games, and not one of his better ones.

It's a Feld game, lots of mechanics all mashed up. The use of dice is very good, giving almost has power to the 1 die or the 6 die, making the luck of the roll not so lucky.

Although it has some luck, I like it, not only because luck eventually is not important (the stronger player wins 99% of the times), but because the game is good and exciting to play. 

A lot of ways to win, really a brain burner at certain crucial points.

The game creates many different situations, forcing the player to adapt and adopt new strategies depending on the current state of the game. The interaction is partly due to the typical "who comes first gets the best", but even more because one has to continuously look at what the others are aiming at.

Replayability is high, but somehow less than I expected given the variability of the game.

This one will be in my collection. It has the number 15 on the side, so it doesn't have a choice. However, it does seem to be quite chaotic and doesn't feel like my strategy can pay off in a big way, probably because there are absolutely so many ways to score. However, it is one of the better, if not the best Alea Big Box game when it comes to the looks of the game. Rum and Pirates might have it there.

RATING: 10
Really very fun, if overwhelming. It almost out-Felds Feld in terms of the sheer number of orthogonal actions and their potential interconnectednesses. You do have to roll high numbers to stand a chance -- something that isn't true at all of Burgundy or Macao, or entirely true of Troyes, this game's Euro dice peers [I no longer stand by this statement, but it does require much more planning than in those games to manage poor rolls]. Has the potential to play quickly, but AP can easily get in the way.
-----
Loving it after a second play -- the balance between strategy and randomness, and between agency and having tactics guided by your initial draw, hits the sweet spot for me. Now feels like a game I can play any time, whereas it still felt a bit daunting after the first time. It might be more fun with 3 than with 4, given the reduced competition for the actions. This game is living up to my expectation that it would become my favorite Feld (followed by Macao)

A complex mixture of VP earning possibilities from Herr Feld. It is much better put together than Trajan was, but a little bit overwrought and definitely not an elegant design (the year of the dragon is long gone). First play was definitely overwhelming. Upon further play the interconnectedness of the game elements start to reveal themselves and after several plays, I think it is excellent, and much much better than Trajan. Turn order is important, generally you want to be first, but sometimes it is very good to be last. Dice throws involve some luck and it is better to have high throws if you are first.

Another Feld dice-allocation game. This one is strongly reminiscent of Castles of Burgundy, but I like it better; there is a worker-placement aspect, and more combo effects and things to do. The objectives also provide a good sense of direction.

The most interesting part is that higher/lower numbers are relevant (unlike CoB), but not necessarily better (unlike Alien Frontiers): a higher number does more, but is more easily blocked.

There is a lot to take in at first, but it hangs together nicely.

Typical point salad by Feld, this time with dice. People says it's similar tro Trajan, but I haven't tried it yet. 

I personally enjoyed more In the Year of the Dragon. It's also a dice game, but the luck factor is less important. In Bora Bora, a bad roll or a tricky dice placement by your rivals can destroy all your long term strategy.

RATING: 8
First impression (4 players): Dices decide how/when you can do your actions. You still have enough control unless you roll something silly like 6-6-6, it only slightly randomizes what you can do. 

One of the better Feld designs. Mainly because it is rather clean without too much fiddly parts. Also there isn't overpowered player-order-track to be found. You can control your round position but it is resetting track. The dices make it so that luck definitely plays a role there on some games. And it might be too simple in the long run. Still was very fun.

The dice system is engaging but otherwise this is just another Feldian mishmash of arbitrary mechanical kludges barely held together by chewing gum and the occasional copper wire. The result does feel less messy than I expected though, and there obviously are quite a few viable approaches to the point collection chaos. The ruleset is simple and clean but getting a grasp of the values of actions and point sources is difficult. 

The best thing about this game is that Ravensburger has finally realized that nobody wants inserts and that dice are supposed to be plastic. Unfortunately they still have a lot to learn about presentation.

Gioco molto complesso, soprattutto per le infinite cose da fare, la miriade di regole da ricordare e le svariate possibilità di fare punti vittoria. Una volta appresi questi infiniti dettagli potreste anche trovare il gioco divertente e piacevole ma le prime partite saranno una tortura. Feld questa volta si è superato con un prodotto che credo non raggiungerà la popolarità e il successo di alcuni sui predecessori per la quantità e cavillosità di tutte le azioni disponibili. I simboli sulla mappa sono talmente tanti da far venir mal di testa. Detto questo devo ammettere che le dinamiche e il bilanciamento delle azioni mi è piaciuto. Come in altri recenti titoli si cerca di utilizzare i dadi lanciati più che subirne passivamente il loro risultato, la contrario di Troyes o I Castelli di Burgundy, in Bora Bora però un lancio di dadi basso sarà più difficilmente riciclabile. Lo consiglierei solo ad assidui giocatori.

Bora Bora? Yup - I was pretty bored. The confusing layout isn't as bad as all that, in fairness, and there's a certain amount of hilarity to be had in the assorted saucy innuendo. But a lot of the time, it's fairly routine engine-building, optimisation and depriving each other in fashions even too ruthless for me.

RATING: 8
Stefan Feld's heaviest (imo) game to date. So many very interconnected minigames! It's fantastic! Not Trajan fantastic (nothing is for me), but fantastic nonetheless. The dice placement aspect adds an unusually mean edge for a Feld. Stock up on god cards!

Verdict:

What I Like: Clever Feldian comboing to be had all over. The competitive dice placement action selection forces a prioritization of desired actions. Therefore competitors' possible choices place constraints (imagined or actual) on each other, while the game itself is fairly generously open handed. All parts feel different yet intergrate smoothly into a cohesive whole. Beautiful, if shallow, theme.

What I Don't Like: This game is on the fiddly end chits-wise, even for a Feld design.

Score 8.1 after first 2 games. We played 2 games consecutively. Each took about 150 minutes. We get really fun. Good and different dice mechanics. Lovely theme. Colorful game elements. A bit complexity as negative. After playing nearly 10 times in first month, I increased its score to 8.3. High replayibility. But time is definetely not 90 minutes. It should be 120 minutes. (It can take 90 minutes if players are playing fast.)

Rating after first play with Stefan Feld at Essen 2012: 9.0. Great, great game. The ultimate Feld. Everything included. There is a lot going on in this superb game! Congratulations!

Edit after the 7th game as of 2013-03-15: The rating is now at a high 9.5. Just got up by 0.5. after the last game. It was such a nice experience. Bora Bora is a potential 10 if it keeps on beeing fascinating for me...

Edit: After 10th game on 12.05.2012: Its 9.9. Did not make the 10 just beacause I reserve it for Macao!

Now after 25 bgames it will stay on a 9.8 as of 04.08.2016.

This is probably my second favorite of Feld's efforts. It's Castles of Burgundy 2.0 and, again, you never get time or enough turns to complete the things you want. The blocking aspect of the dice placement mechanic makes playing Bora Bora that much trickier to complete those difficult objectives. Oh yeah, it looks fun and tropical, but it is a ruthless battle to get the materials you need to win! Fun, aggravating but always enjoyable.

RATING: 3
initially an 8 but after 6 plays raised to a 9
so many options in a game you can be quite a way behind early on but still pick up plenty of points in the latter stages to make it count
edit
after 16 plays found the man/woman build tile far too powerful so game has become a one trick pony shame because first dozen games we played were very tense and close
because of the obvious path to victory game not likely to make the table again give it a 6 because of the good quality of the pieces
edit
tried one more time but same old story
never again so must be a 3 rating

It's another points salad game, but it's got some very likeable bits, including how each turn you have three mini-quests to work towards, giving you focus and reason to drive down this VP path or that one for a bit, and then delve down another. Which I much prefer over others in the genre where you just move to a strategy that others aren't doing and hope to get lucky with your efficiency. There's luck to manage in what action spaces you'll get to action, limited by dice rolls and what others take ahead of you, but there's so many ways to progress, there's rarely a feel of getting hosed. Some of the end-game points are at-the-limit, where missing out on something one turn can lose you points, but everyone faces the same issue and insurance options abound. Lots and lots of moving parts, which means lots of rules and a time investment accordingly, but it also means there's lots of exploration available to those who love point salad games.

I can't understand all the buzz around this game. This is a solid Eurogame but nothing more. 
It offers: 
- many paths to victory
- many ressources to juggle
- nailbiting decisions
- zilions of different tokens that might or might not come into play and therefore offer always a different way to play the game

Still I don't get hot, just warm. The game is nothing special to me. The board is great looking but very busy. The player mats are a mess. For me this is a visual overkill.
It seems there are so many options that it doesn't matter which way I choose.
If I want to play a "Feld" with dice, I choose "Burgen von Burgund" any time.

This is one of the great examples why I appreciate Stefan Feld's earlier designs much more than the later ones.

Based on one play, so take with a heaping spoonful of salt:

The use of dice to determine the availability and strength of actions is brilliant.  I enjoyed the tense decisions of how to use the dice each round.  I do think there are perhaps at least one too many sub games going on.  Some of the scoring elements seem to be a tad silly (my hut is in this box at the end of the game so I get points for that fish), but all the elements with a bit of imagination can be reasonably tied together.  The game is certainly not elegant as there are tons of bits that must be set up and and reset every round.  It could easily be argued the game is bloated.  Regardless, my play of it was quite fun and I would gladly play again, but I think I will remain content to play someone else's copy.

UPDATE:  On a second playing (still someone else's copy) it seemed a little less bloated.  I enjoyed my second play even more than my first.  Bumping it up one notch.

I've heard this game referred to as a "point salad"--like Castles of Burgundy, there are a ton of different, but somewhat interconnected, ways to score points.  However, I felt that this game suffered from being less well-integrated than Burgundy.  You draft various goal tiles that you simply have to complete in a timely fashion if you want to be competitive, which drives your strategy to a large degree.  However, the different paths you can pursue in the game is so multitudinous that it's difficult to tie everything together into a master plan.  I liked the clever dice mechanism, but it was just one tactical aspect of a much larger game.  While this is certainly a good game that I'd like to play more, I think it suffers from a lack of streamlining in the same way that a well-known author can publish a monster book and largely bypass the editorial process.

It's like Castles of Burgundy's bigger brother. It does have the issue that if you roll horrible the entire time, you can be hosed. They have god cards to correct the issue, but it's more of band-aid instead of a nice fix like the workers in CoB. This game plays best with 4, but I like it with 3 as well. 2 feels a bit too loose in my opinion. It's also quite a bit heavier than CoB, but I'd still categorize this as medium weight.

Another interesting euro from Mr Feld, this time (as often) with numerous different interwoven actions, that can be a bit laborous to see the effects of the first time you play.

You cannot get bored when you play this game, so many mini-projects you want to explore, and it only takes 6 rounds before the showdown comes. Another winner from Feld!

1) Ik like games of Stefan Feld really a lot
2) I sold 6 copies of this game on 1 day, I've never done this in the past 4 years!
3) The average rating is > 8.5 at this moment (17/02/2013)

All this made I played this game with very high expectations. And I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed after my first play. What I missed, and for me is typical for Feld, is that 1 original gameplay-element that makes the game really others then others. For me Bora Bora is a sort of Trajan (for example Status track  Senate; hyperfocus on only a few of different possilities to score points) with a flavor of The Casltles of Burgundy (dice to activate actions; the earlier you built your buildings, the more points you get). Off course Trajan and Castles of Burgundy are some (very) good games, so there is nothing wrong with recylcing some of those principles. But it somewhat bothers me that an author recycles (so soon) his game principles, it reminds me of what Reiner Knizia is doing lately and I think we can all agree that it went downhill very fast with the quality of the games he releases lately by doing that.

Maybe just my expectations were too high. My guess is that my rating can still go up, but certainly won't decrease :D

It is definitely worth getting and playing with 2 people.

Feld using dice in another interesting way. Basically worker (dice) placement where the rolled value limits the dice that can be placed on the same action space by other players. Creates nice tension in the placement phase. 

Additional actions can be taken each turn based upon collected tiles (man and woman tiles). 

Many different interconnected actions that lead down different paths to VP accumulation. Pleasantly thinky puzzle aspect to each game. Not quite a brain-burner but definitely a brain warmer.

When playing with less than 4, not all  the tiles are revealed and so you can't bank on a particular strategy with the tiles.

Bad rolls can be somewhat mitigated but multiple bad rolls per game can destroy your chances of winning. Not sure that there isn't an optimal strategy here. Build buildings as soon as possible, get a man and woman that helps with this, and complete huts in the latter game. Exploit priest rack whenever possible. Of course, everyone else will be trying to do the same and therein lies the beautiful struggle.

If you like Feld, you should like this; although, it's a bit more rules intensive than most of his games.

Enjoyable!

This game has the action variation of Trajan, but the theme works together, and different actions influence each other from time to time. It has the dice determining your actions mechanic of Burgundy, but it's player driven rather than game mechanics driven, where in Bora, you get to take an action so long as no player as assigned a lower die value to that action yet (and the higher the die value, the more options you have for resolving that action). I think hands down this is the best Feld game I've played yet, and I'm very pleased he seems to be building and polishing his good ideas from previous works.

Collect victory points by going after them in many different ways. Each of the ways allow for bonuses
Expansion in territories with a fish bonus, and clearing areas to recruit villagers. Villagers who produce various resources, money or points to modify the turn order. building which give god and money bonus, priest track giving god bonuses, buying jewelry, completing collection tasks.

If you can specialize and accomplish a specific victory task every turn you get a bunch of bonus victory points at the end of the game, miss the target one turn and it is out.

The most interesting part of the game was the use of the dice as the action selection mechanism. Lower numbers are less flexible, but lock out opponents. Higher numbers give you more results but allow for easier opponent play. 

It's a very busy game with lots of moving parts, and is hard to explain to new players. 
Ultimately the game too much going on to enjoy it. It wants you to be strategic, but the turn mechanism is very tactical. 
Trajan and Castles of Burgundy are much better examples of this type of game

Szép, színes játék Feldtől, ahol a kínézet elég sokat hazudik a játék komolyságát illetően. Kemény agyégetésről van szó, ahol valamilyen cél nem teljesítése büntetést vonhat maga után. Ügyesen kell optimálisan minden irányban gondolkodni, mert különben kellemetlen meglepetésekre számíthatunk.

RATING: 7
Pros:
1. Holy Option Batman! There is no shortage of options in this game.
2. Dice Placement. I love dice placement. What this game does well is it make low value and high value rolls worth something. 
3. No Focus. This is a game where focusing on only one piece of the puzzle will likely lead to a loss. You need to at least dabble in every part of the board to have a chance at winning.

Cons:
1. Long Teach. There's a ridiculous amount of options and subtleties to each one. New players will need at least one play to get a handle on this game.
2. Long Play. This game take a while to play. With so many options, you're bound to run into a few points in the game where a player hits an AP wall. They just stare at the board trying to maximize. This causes the game to grind to a hault.
3. Long Setup. There's a lot of stuff in this game. It'll take at least 10 minutes to set up. Maybe less if you get a lot of people in on it.
4. Theme. There is a theme, but it's just layered on. Like most Feld games, this game uses theme more as a way to make referencing portions of the game easier, not as a way to drive any sort of story.

Summary: This is a very typical Feld game. It's good and I'd be willing to play it again. However, there are better Euros (even better Feld games) that achieve the same level of thought and strategy that do not require the same amount of time investment as Bora Bora.

RATING: 6
Yet another Feld game that I didn't particularly enjoy playing.  Similar to Trajan in the way that it has systems nested inside systems (making the game somewhat tricky to pick up), and similar to Year of the Dragon in the sense that every move hurts, as each choice you make effectively cuts you off from certain paths or options.  Lots of players like that level of angst, but it isn't something I enjoy.

RATING: 9
Honestly, I seem to love Stefan Feld games. At least the five I own. My family likes games without a lot of "take-that" towards the other players and his games allow multiple paths to victory without getting in each others way too much. Some people love this, like me, others like the opposite.

A game with several paths to score victory points, and so many of them that you cannot hope to ride the domination of only one of them to victory.  You have to remain open to the best scoring opportunities available to you as they present themselves. Polynesian/Island theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An amazing, yet sometimes frustrating game (but still in a good way). One move can often ruin your clever plans, so in essence this is a tactical game that forces you to be very adaptable and keeps you on your toes since the beginning till the very end.

Once again, Mr. Feld proves he is the king of dice - both high & low rolls have multiple important uses. All the mechanics are tightly interlinked and often you have to take several steps to achieve the desired outcome (which is, I think, one of the biggest differences between [i]Bora Bora[/i] and [i]Castles of Burgundy[/i], where getting the points is rather straightforward). Sometimes this can result in analysis paralysis, since no action is guaranteed - it's really easy to loose an opportunity to do certain things if your opponents block you, by chance or by malice. 

After my first games I was really on the fence about this one, but with each play it felt better and better, and now I can say this is one of the best Felds I have ever played. Tight, taxing, absorbing and really satisfying in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really like my first play, even though I have a sneaking suspicion this could be another Feld game that has a jigsaw puzzle element to it that proves biguiling at first but ends up sitting on the shelf in a year's time.

LOTS of scoring options. We'll see if they come together as well as they should. Trajan had a similar concept, and while I also really like that, haven't played it again.

Namorei este jogo por muito tempo até conseguir comprar. Não sei, as cores, o tabuleiro, os dados... de alguma maneira me enfeitiçou.
E realmente foi uma festa quando ele chegou aqui. Todas as partidas foram boas, e todos os participantes elogiaram muito o jogo.

Nele você sempre está perseguindo várias coisas ao mesmo tempo, tomando cuidado com as ações escolhidas pelos outros. E ao mesmo tempo tem que saber que não vai dar para fazer tudo o que quer!! O tempo passa rápido aqui!

Jogaço, certamente um dos meus preferidos!

Another 'daunting to explain' but 'easy once you know' yet 'so many options' Stefan Feld game.

Clever dice action, where higher numbers give you a better/bigger activity/choice, yet lower rolls are useful as each action can only be taken with a lower number dice than the previous one on there.

RATING: 8
As a big Feld fan, I was really looking forward to this. It's certainly a very good and polished game - an 8 is a pretty good rating for me - yet I haven't found myself wowed by it on any of my 3 plays to date. It'll probably see little play in our regular group, as one of them (generally an Ameritrasher, although he plays plenty of Euros with us and even seems to enjoy some of them!), absolutely hated it after the first 2 plays, and one other also disliked it. Indeed, it was another 2 years before my wife persuaded them to play it for the third time (in June 2015) - one of them even won that game, but once again neither was enthusiastic.

The game has interesting new mechanics (what else would you expect of Feld), a seemingly wide space of possible strategies to follow, and many "small" but crucial tactical decisions. And the components are great quality, far better that all other Alea games I've played. Based on my plays so far, I don't see it displacing my favourite Felds (most notably Trajan, and actually I was and remain more impressed with Amerigo of his 2013 releases), but it's a game that I would still be keen to get some more plays of.

Like most Feld games I have played, there initially seems like there is way too much going on when reading the rules but then it all elegantly plays out and I see that the mechanics themselves are not too complicated. I enjoy the action selection in this game and how there is a nice balance between having high dice rolls allow for stronger actions but also require lower dice rolls to be able to take the action in the first place.

None of us had played this before (not recommended). It made it a real bear to get through the first time and we did make a couple mistakes. That being said, its not as complicated to play as that would make it seem. There's just a lot of different areas of the game to know about. The dice placement is GREAT! Higher value dice are more flexible, but easier to get blocked out. Lower value dice are not as useful, but are less likely to get blocked. I think my rating is likely to go up after playing this a 2nd time and better knowing the rules from the start.

RATING: 5.9
(+) Plays quickly and smoothly
(+) Clear and structured gaming rules. All information printed on player boards
(+) Game has the potential to play out differently every time. Depending on how the game develops in the first two rounds, different strategies may become appealing.

(-) Awfully boring (or rather non-existing) theme
(-) Game might be a little too luck-dependant. Some mechanics (like trying to win all assignments) can end up screwing you for reasons you can not fully control. Not gaining those 6 bonus points should nog cause you to lose the game, but it feels rather disappointing.
(-) This game is too much of a point salad. Everything scores you points. Chosing the safe path and scoring them immediately usually scores you a little less compared to when you risk postponing your investment in order to try to score a little more points later on (however, due to some luck-dependance you often have no real control over your possibility to score later on). For starting players it is impossible to make out which type of goods or actions will score you maximum points. Some good strategies can turn out to be impossible to execute to the max due to the (sometimes totally random) development later on in the game

RATING: 8
A clever use of dice, with the whole dishes and sink thrown in on making VPs along the way and at the end. Typical Feldian style. I usually like the main mechanism, but the little things that get you vps, bits turn me away. I still like the mancala in Trajan best for the main driving mechanism for his games; maybe because for once he didn't use dice on that one. Love the look of it.

edit:I'm not a fanboy of Feld's designs, but I played Trajan and loved the depth of things and connections, but it felt a little disconnected. Bora Bora has this same depth, but the disconnect is not there. It is a good amount of choices in just the right amount of time. Plays 2 players well enough, but shines with more if you can find a couple more. 

There are a bunch of ways to gain victory points as in true Feld style, but there aren't too many that I felt everything I did would net me vps. It appears each way to get vps that are significant, requires 2 steps--not just one.

I didn't think I would like Bora Bora, but it actually was fun trying to puzzle out each round how to get victory points.

Good game with complex decisions, but we just didn't ever have fun playing it.  We tried to play it 5 times, but could only make it through 3 plays before giving up.  The decisions are a little more painful than interesting, it is extremely difficult to do the things that you want to do, the dice rolling is a litlte annoying, and the game play is just not fun.  Interesting, but no fun factor.  We were glad to try it, but we are definitely not going to buy this one.

We own two other Feld titles and enjoy them a lot. This one is no exception. There are lots of different avenues to earn points and a whole lot of replayability in this title. The components are gorgeous and the game play is very fun. However, since there are a lot of choices, players prone to AP may be a little overwhelmed. I wouldn't recommend this game to beginners or someone not familiar with Feld games. Start them off with Castles of Burgundy first, then you can suggest this game or Trajan. I can see us playing this game a lot in the years ahead.

Played this a few times now with my play group and everyone loves it.  It's a bit daunting to set-up and run through rules the first time but once you get into the swing of things everyone gets a hold of what's going on and it's really not as complicated as it seems.  I'd never turn down playing this game and only wish it supported more players.

Pretty good game - this is probably my #3 Feld game after Macao and CoB.  It feels a little less like a point salad than many of his other games, which I like. I also really like the individual goal tiles that you're trying to complete - some you can finish early, others later - much like Macao, but the different strategic options for where you going to concentrate seem a little too opaque to me.  Like most Feld, the theme is totally pasted on, which I normally wouldn't mind, but in this one, the theme gets in the way, especially the fire action, and the building action which makes no attempt to symbolize any type of building.

Add one to the rating if everyone already knows how to play and we can skip the 30+ minutes it takes to teach this game well.

I think Trajan/Bora Bora marked an inflection point in the hobby, where complexity and fiddliness became, for some, a mark of distinction. Not a trend I approve of, of course. I think Feld is a genius, but I don't really care for games of this kind. I do think Bora Bora represents the best of a bad breed. I also think the legion of much-less-talented imitators that Feld has spawned has the potential to be harmful to the hobby on the whole. Not that this is All That Serious. First-world problems, and all that :laugh:

Very good 'point salad' type game. My one complaint is that you have to know and go for the end-game bonuses from turn one as they require you to take a specific action every round.

Although I love brainburning games I was first a bit overwhelmed by this workerplacement game with such many choices, symbols and actions. Typical Feldish victory point salad ... is this to balance everything out? Theme is not really there. Of course it's a well designed game with a lot of ways to victory but I don't get rid of the feeling that there's too much in it. Less is more ... not everytime and everywhere but in my honest opinion definitely in this overcrowded Eurogame.

It's definitely one of Feld's best. Once you get past the iconography, it plays like butter and with 2p, it's super fast. It's fiddly as hell, and there are a lot of moving parts, but it's an amazing game. There is excellent dice manipulation, opportunities for crazy combos, great interaction, beautiful artwork, and just amazing depth of play. I played it again after a while and I loved every second of it. When Feld is operating at his highest frequency, he is a force to be reckoned with.

Another Feld classic! This is a board game that at first sight looks more complex than it really is. Core game play does rely on dice rolls and I have played at least once where a continuous streak of extreme low rolls ruined my chances to be competitive (in this game it seems that a good spread of dice numbers are preferable to all low or all high rolls). I have a dislike for games where the capriciousness of the dice gods play an overly important role. However, in this game there are more than enough other redeeming factors to make it a title that I will happily play whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Mr. Feld has another winner in my book!

Not surprisingly, it feels somewhat similar to other designs by him, but also different. I actually find it integrates pretty well with the story it tries to tell of building a clan of native Polynesian villages. The action choices are interesting and the scoring is tight. 

Is it almost too tight? As is the case with most of my first plays of his games, I get the feeling there are lots of zero-sum choices; sure, I can do action X to get 5 points, but you can do action Y to get the same amount of points. But I think as I understand the game more, the differences will be subtle, and finding ways to inch ahead will be interesting to discover.

Uno de los Feld más duros, recuerda en sus mecánicas a Die Burgen von Burgund, pero añade muchos más elementos imbrincados entre sí para formar un quemacerebros, donde cada acción y cada movimiento es decisivo.

La tensión que producen los objetivos a completar cada turno hace que estés siempre dentro del juego.

Un muy buen juego, quizá lo peor es que es muy dado al AP y eso puede hacer que la partida se alargue más de lo esperado.

Beautiful, beautiful game... absolutely visually stunning.  This is probably our favorite Stefan Feld game.  Most times this game ends up being very tight and our scores are very close to one another, which makes for a great play in our books.  We both enjoy the way the dice manipulation works in this game...Feld has really mastered that!  Even though its a dice-rolling game, there isn't too much of an issue with randomness.  Whatever your roll there are always good options for you, plus there are ways to change your roll as well.  Bottom line, this game is darn near perfect.

Don't be put off by initial apparent overwhelming choices of how to earn points. I hate dice games but this game allows you to maximise the potential of your every round through careful use of god tiles and cards. Opportunities for screwage exist, but the game allows you to develop strategies and is not just a series of by round tactics.
Works well with 2,3 or 4 players. Only downside is setting up the board with all those cardboard counters and learning how and when to use those god cards to the most benefit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game overall but there can certainly be some unevenness in the initial goal tiles which are given randomly.  Some are much harder to achieve than others.  While getting hard goals isn't going to automatically result in a game loss it is certainly a disadvantage.  Also going 4th in a 4 player game can be very tough in the first round, I don't think the few extra points is quite enough as some of the men/women tiles are much better than others.  Getting to select first can be a very large advantage.

Anyway, the game is  imperfect from a balance standpoint but that is fine really as the variance in game play that the goals keeps the game interesting across multiple plays by forcing players to adapt their short/long term strategy to accomplish the goals.  That said, a bad roll at the wrong time can certainly result in a loss of 10 to 15 points which can easily be the difference between a winning/losing score.

Very fiddly and inelegant, but seems to work fine for the cube pushers. They could easily have dropped six or seven mechanics and it still would have been a good game, better in fact. As it is, it's a slog and unnecessarily complicated, maybe to distract you from the fact that it's a slog.

RATING: 5
Played once with 2P, thrice with 3P and once with 4P. Bora Bora features a rather clever dice placement system, in which dice are used to claim actions. As expected of any serious dice-driven Euro, dice have their uses regardless of the value rolled – high values yield more choices, but low values block higher values from being placed. However, the mechanism isn't entirely robust, because poor rolls may force a player into sub-optimal moves through no fault of his own.

The rest of the game is a web of interlocking mechanisms. The task tiles are quite fascinating, because they evoke the puzzle optimisation from [thing=31594][/thing], but everything else is not individually notable. As with Feld's other heavy designs, players are expected to orchestrate a sequence of actions to crank out a few VP. The difference though, is that the relatively high degree of player interaction and overlap of mechanisms in Bora Bora makes this feat fairly frustrating to pull off. (Interaction here comes in the form of displacing opponents' huts and priests.)

In the end, I feel that the elements which are remotely interesting end up being lost amidst a sprawling network of tattooing and shell collecting. Bora Bora is still passable for a complex Euro, but it otherwise falls into the bottom tier of Feld's output for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Feld is a popular designer for good reason and Bora Bora is yet another solid entry to his portfolio.  This game blends great art/components with a simple dice placement mechanic and the result is a surprisingly deep strategy game. The setup can be a pain, however, as there are many many tiles to lay out.

We have only played this Feld once so my opinion may change with more plays. However, this is one of my least favorite Feld games. The artwork is beautiful, the board is just as busy as you'd expect in one of his games. But I felt that the setup was a bit involved for what it accomplishes through randomization. It has a lot of elements from other games he has designed so I may just need to explore its possibilities a bit more before I decide if I will keep it or not.

 So there's a lot going on in this game, but at the same time there's not. There's only really five action spots that you need to learn, and everything else seems to fall into place pretty fast.

Feld kezd kicsit túlzásokba esni. Legújabb játékába kb. mint Friese a Copycatba mindent bele próbált zsúfolni. Van benne kocka, van benne kártya, van benne kvázi szerepválasztás, van benne területfoglalás, kitúrás, isteni segítség és persze ezerféle pontszerzési lehetőség. Hihetetlen színes tábla, rettentő sok információval ellátott saját tábla. Még gyakorlott játékosok is csak pislognak elsőre a szabályt olvasva vagy hallgatva. Komoly játék, de mégis az ezerféle pontszerzés közül a faék stratégiák tűnnek a legjobbnak. Tehát egy valamire rámenni és azt orrvérzésig csinálni. Nekem ez nagyon nem tetszett és úgy éreztem nem is annyira kiegyenlített mint egy-két másik játéka. Szerintem jóval túllőtt a célon és ebbe a játékába már túl sok minden beletett, többet mint kellett volna. Annyira dizájn se jött be. Nem katasztrófa játék, de nem tetszett.

I really enjoy this game but the learning curve is steep for what it ultimately is. It's a bit overwhelming to know what you should be doing because there are just so many options. I do like the dice rolling mechanic though. I just feel like maybe 30% of the options could have been shaved down to make the game feeling a bit lighter/more enjoyable. I think if I could find people to play this with regularly I would learning to appreciate it more though. I see the potential for a lot of strategies and depth, it's just not very accessible at first. Production is excellent.

This is a typical heavier Feld, not quite at the level of Trajan but it's almost there.

Overall, it is a solid brain-burning game but not my favorite of the Felds.

Really solid game, as I've come to expect from Feld. I think I most enjoy having the task tokens that give me a goal and make me have a plan for how to go about getting victory points. Certainly each game presents a bunch of options and deciding which actions to go after is challenging. I also find the mechanic of how the dice are used to be especially interesting: higher values on the dice give more powerful actions, but they are harder to place since only the lowest die wins.

Another great dice game by Feld, where there are lots of things to do which interact with each other! As usual, the theme is pretty meaningless, but the game play is very interesting. The dice-allocation mechanism works great -- yet another very cool way to used dice! High rolls give you better actions, but fewer choices of which actions to take. It seems to be a nice balance ... I think this could be one of my favorite Feld games so far!

Another great Feld game, if a little similar to many of his games (most of which I like which is probably why I'm all for this one as well).

In true Feld fashion this game has a unique dice gimmick that makes up most of the game play.  At the beginning of a round each player will roll 3 dice and in turn order place these dice on action spaces.  Where the gimmick comes in is higher pip values give you more options or outright better effects from these action spaces but all future dice placed there have to be lower then the lowest one placed.  So, for example, placing a 1 on a space early wouldn't give you a very powerful effect but would also prevent anyone else from placing there.  I love rolling dice and I especially love unique, fun dice mechanics.

The actions are, also in true Feld fashion, just different ways to score victory points on this themed island paradise of the titular Bora Bora.  This I love as well because it presents varied paths to victory and all of them appear viable.

The boards in this game are a bit smaller than I would like and some of them are cluttered to hell with symbology to remind you about conversion rates and special rules.  Other than that though the game looks pretty good.

While it may feel kind of samey if you've played other Feld games I think the unique dice mechanic and new victory point actions give it enough personality and charm to be another great game from this talented designer.

A very Feld game (maybe too much, even for him! Really!!!!). Everything very much related to getting points. Even if you are distracted you probably going to get some points out of it. Dice mechanic is very nice but the game doesn't underline it enough and loses all the coherence as a whole. 

The game seems and feels very much like a bunch of pieces thrown into a game and they do not make a solid boardgame, in my opinion. It's kind of like a football team with good players but bad football because they don't play together.

Themeless, of course!

Well I am not a huge Feld fan but i always enjoy trying out his new games. Lets see if this is a keeper.

Rules read though this looks 'Feldian' - balancing but specialising in lots of point scorers, own player boards, little incremental bonus actions which are key in Man/Woman section and Fire Bonus. Interaction looks minimal but interesting map and Roma like dice placement, and certainly more interesting than CoB or Trajan

Production values are high - quite colourful design. 

Theme - as ever a total paste on. Could be anything but I guess that does not matter in a Feld game

I am looking forward to trying but suspect that the high scores and many ways of scoring will make close end results as lacking in meaning as Castles of Burgundy.

Anyway game play is the thing so lets see.

---------------

First impressions were not horrible. The action selection mechanic forces interaction, however the gods let you get round it. A little too easily I felt. There is incredible pressure from the beginning to both score and build an engine - or at least find a specialisation. 

Like other Feld games the number of mechanical devices are frustrating witho ut having a thematic hook - for example why does building give you a fire bonus and not expanding?
Alea have really upped their game on the production and the extra cost compared to say Die Burgen is well worth it for a design that has o much in it. My rating is not an evaluation of how good the game is.

--------------------

2nd play and having now explained the rules to 5 different people I realise this is one of Feld's more complex games. The first game is really just a learning exercise as its impossible to see all the possibilities yet alone the things you score for. In my second play I kept wishing for a god that lets you play a dice and then turn it to a '1' - the action selection is just not quite as interactive enough ('Vanuatu' style) as I'd like as the gods dig you out of any hole. The game is very Feldian - you need to plan a series of linked steps from beginning to end. Planning partly will be driven by the opening tasks and the men/women tiles open to you. The end game bonus for completed sets means you can't change course half way through the game. This means players only brush up against each other if they share the same goals- maybe competition for the islands or jewellery. However even if these minor interactions. Don't go your way there is always a god to help you out. The game consumes a lot of brain power to go through a lot of ways of achieving the same thing - because so many of the games actions can get the same result - want a resource? Explore, helper or man or women will get you there, more subtle is the most efficient use of how you achieved this - I'm not sure if this is a hallmark of a good design or a hodgepodge.

------------------------------------------

why when you create an interesting core mechanic (dice must be lower to take an action) do you then make so many ways of circumventing this?

Convulted, dry and boring would be how I describe Bora Bora.

Lots of mechanics and mini-games (à la Trajan) with nothing to tie them together. Surprising amount of randomness considering the heaviness of the game.  You can see that some design choice; manly gods card that let you change actions and the helper action tile that let you trade any(!) ressources following a ratio; comes from the unforgiveness of the draw.

Even considering this, everything in the game makes points and there is no bad action.  You probably won't be able to follow your plan (which you have to set at the beginning of the game to have the final bonus), but you aren't really set back; you'll still move forward.

The game is not broken or badly developed, it will appeal to a certain type of gamers (it clearly does considering its ranking), but I would surely like to never have to play this again (hence to low rating).

Perhaps the zenith of Feld's "point-salad" approach, Bora Bora is nothing if not overwrought. The core mechanism -- players roll three dice and action spaces are taken by placing one, lower than any die already there; high numbers are more powerful but harder to place -- is interesting enough, though to me it feels as though the core point of interest, the blocking, is a watered-down imitation of the action-selection from Vanuatu. And of course, players can place higher dice anyway by playing a "blue god" and an offering, or a wild god tile; it's more about risk and efficiency than genuine screwage.

As in his other games, efficiencies are layered on efficiencies. The most egregious addition in this one is, I think, the "building" minigame: resources are placed on squares on a 4x6 grid and buildings must replace two adjacent resources. This adjacency rule exists for the sole purpose of adding additional considerations to the "expansion" minigame, one already overloaded -- you don't just have to worry about whether you can pay the dice cost on the correct action, the in-game points, the end-game points and the paths opened up from the new space, but also whether its resource will be useful for building. It's just unnecessary: complexity for its own sake.

Perhaps my biggest issue with the game is that, moreso than any of his others, the system feels very driven by short-term goals. The (often competing) incentives to complete task tiles add another wrinkle to any calculation of an action's expected value, but the bonuses are significant enough that players will try to complete all nine; likewise, the specialization bonuses (6 jewelry tiles etc.) are significant enough that choosing any given strategy early may begin to feel like a straightjacket.

Sure, the key here is the much-loved "want to do more than you have actions available", but right now it's just a little too much. My hope is that, like Trajan, where the mancala went from impossibly brain-burning to relatively simple in the space of a few short games, eventually the mechanisms will fade into the background and bring the player interaction, unusually strong for Feld, to the fore.

My least favorite Feld. I thought my brain circuits were going to overload at the 20-minute rules explanation, and then the game itself was overwhelming and I forgot several details, including the most important one which was to get your priests on the temple track. At times the game encourages bad AP because there are so many (too many) ways to score. I realize I am not the target audience for these "gamer's games" or "heavy" games, but I really don't see why it has to be so overloaded with point opportunities. 

This is all after one play, so I'm sure subsequent games will be less aggravating since I won't be completely floundering. The theme did nothing for me, and board was visually overloaded.

Also, the concept that getting more tattoos makes you the leader is just plain wrong-headed and culturally insensitive on two levels. First, status in Bora Bora may be indicated by the type of tattoos, not the sheer number of them. More importantly, tattoos *express* (among many other things) status, they do not confer it.

While I don't always love a point salad, I enjoy them when they have a point.

Bora Bora utilizes the point salad method of distribution to ensure that you can win in any number of ways, and I love it! So many games, I thought I was assured victory, but forgot all about something at the end of the game, like the fish score and someone snatches the victory.

It is a very balanced game. There are task tiles to give you some objectives, but I've won by largely ignoring these and going for other things. I just love how you can win by using any crazy combination that you can think of. Sometimes, those plans turn out to not be the best, but you never know until the end. The beauty of the game is that with no two games turning out the same, typically you have to adjust your plan based on the plans of your opponents.

I'm holding my rating for more plays.

So far, I like this game.  It has the multitude of choices I enjoy in Feld games.  It flows nice after a few games and you begin to see the bits and pieces relate to each other.  A few things in the game get forgotten by us (god tiles, fishing, red god).  Mainly the little add on points.  They help a lot!

I am starting to see a problem with 2 players that surfaced in Macao.  If one player concentrates on the area control aspect it can garner them massive points in the end.  This is no matter what clever things the other player does.  It forces you into competing in the area control game outright.  With so few turns that really pisses me off.  I need more plays to see if I can counter this.

Fun to play but still investigating.

update:  More plays revealed ways around this.  Unfortunately my wife does not enjoy the mental labor needed to plan in this game.  It's definitely interesting but a little to chunky and procedural.  I think more players might make it a touch better and with gamers who want to get into the process.

Intresting blend of mechanics that allow you to score points with many different ways. I like the dice placement as a mechanic and the game flows nicely after you get a few rounds done. I also like the artwork and theme of the game but it still is a pure get your points out of anything kind of game.

complex game with interesting dice worker placement mechanic (higher numbers give better actions, lower numbers are more dominant for placement)

Nice to play, but isn`t it to random? Very low dice rolls are usually bad (poor action). When you are not first than very big rolls would be also bad (actions could be block). For the low rolls you have the white god and for the high rolls you have the blue god, But you don`t know if you rolls will be high or low and to use a god you need an offering.

The task tiles are also random. You can`t be ready to complete them all.

Edit: You could manage the randomnes with gods. Task tiles are random, but you must not complete every task, to win the game.

Bora Bora eats Caylus for breakfast and defecates Power Grid while Le Havre is trembling in the corner. Seriously speaking this is a great gamer's game. I'm not the one to love dice, but in this game they work. Interesting dice placement instead of worker placement. If you roll low numbers, you are more likely to get to do anything you want. If you roll high numbers you get to do powerful actions. So everything is good in a way and luck doesn't play the biggest role. You can also influence your die rolls with cards. Dice force you to think of optimal tactical decisions while executing your strategy. 

Lots going on in this game. I love how it looks! I tend to like Feld's designs and it's nice to finally have one that is visually pleasing as well. 

Get bags to store the tiles in. Shortens setup time significantly.

Update: Yep, it's a 10.

JAF, JAE - Just another Feld, just another Euro. 

At first glance, it looks complex and like you'll have to remember a million things, but the game itself is pretty straightforward. There are lots of ways to score points, but the dice can truly hurt you. If you have played his other games, you'll find a few similar feeling mechanics re-used, but the game itself is new. And yeah, the theme could have been anything. In fact, a space/robot theme might have been much more awesome.

This seems like a very typical Feld game: intricate and disparate methods of scoring very small amounts of points over the course of a set number of game rounds. Your goal is to optimize your point-scoring potential each turn. Fans of so-called "multiple paths to victory" type games will be pleased. I will not.

As Feld games goes, there does seem to be a greater amount of overlap amongst the many different "mini-games," but this wasn't enough to save Bora Bora for me. It felt very much like other Feld games. I enjoyed Trajan more because it at least had an interesting method of action selection (the Mancala track). Bora Bora is a more typical action selection mechanic where you place one of your "workers" on an action card and then take that action. Yawn. The substitution of dice for workers is not that interesting, and can often be frustrating because the luck of your dice roll can have a detrimental effect on your strategy.

Overall, the race to optimize and score struck me as very, very typical. It's not a broken game; it just didn't have anything to make it stand out or excite me. I have no desire to play this again.

If you like point salads around an interesting mechanism, you'll enjoy Bora Bora. It is a very deep game with a nice variety in available strategies, and uses dice in an interesting way.

One big problem I have with it though, especially when compared to his Feldian bigger brother Trajan, is that the game feel very scripted, with buildings at the beginning, temples at the end, and generally just following your objectives, as opposed to Trajan's more sandbox-y feel.

I'm liking Bora Bora so far. It's as busy as we're growing accustomed to seeing in a Stefan Feld design, but this one seems more polished and more cohesive - the parts better integrated - than in Trajan, for instance. Only one quibble so far: the random assignment of bonus mission tiles at the start of the game leads to some big balance issues, with some players receiving tiles that are impossible to achieve in the first few rounds and others receiving slam-dunk easy goals. Seems like a house rule could fix this ... perhaps deal out five to each player and let them select two? In any event, that's a minor flaw in a game that's doing a lot of things right!

First impression: Point salad game which is difficult to learn. There are a lot of things going on and not all of them are properly communicated via board and player boards. The player boards are full of information and I did not get the purpose of some, while I was missing other things. Takes me too much effort and time to learn and master when I have so many other games to fully explore in my collection. But if you want a Feld for your collection and take the time to learn it, this is probably one of his best.

When it comes to Stefan Feld games, this is not one of his best in my opinion. I prefer Macao, Trajan and Castles of Burgundy. Apart from Trajan,I'd say that his games rather tend to focus on a tactical scheme,which means quite a bit of randomness. And I think that Bora Bora excels them all in this category. Random placement of men, random placement of women, random placement of tasks, random placement of fishing grounds in the beginning, random placement of treasures,random drawing of god cards. Long-term planning just isn't possible, especially when never knowing where your coplayers will place their dice (and block) which options. You have to adapt, adapt and once again adapt to the new situation - so the game can be prone to AP. The game does not have a problem with low rolls of the dice but I'd say it has the opposite. If your dice show high results several turns in a row you are reliant on specific god cards in combination for them to be effective, you don't have that problem with low rolls. But that alone wouldn't make me rate the game "low". And it's not the typical themelessness either. What I'm missing here is the innovation. The "dice worker placement" is nothing but an inverted version of Alien Frontiers "dice worker placement system" on some of the locations. That said you can grasp with every decision you make how much thought has been put into this game. Still, not convinced by this one!

Very easy to learn and understand for a game its weight. Very simple and elegant to understand what actions are available to you at any given time and what action will accomplish what result.

The amount of actions you get is not enough to accomplish everything that you want, but it is enough to fulfill your highest priorities.

Yet another quality game from Mr. Fled...I'm getting tired of enjoying every game this jerk craps out. I kind of wish he'd start to suck at game design already. 

2 Player in this game works very well as do most of the Feldian line of games do. I would say there is a good bit less tension in the jewelry purchasing phase and you can tend to get the pieces you need provided you have the shells to pay fro them with but overall this is not a big issue at all.

Bora Bora is definitely a Feld game. It has similarities to Trajan and Castles of Burgundy, but yet is a distinct game in its own right. Like Trajan it has a number of ways to get points. However, unlike Trajan, where you are free to choose whichever path you want to pursue points, Bora Bora gives you some goals and end game bonuses that will direct your play. Additionally the various areas of the game tie together much better than Trajan and overall the game feels more cohesive. The similarity to CoB lies in the dice which determine what you do. It's significantly different in that CoB forces you to use dice for specific spots (taking or placing), whereas dice are used for actions in Bora Bora and theoretically any die in can be used for any action. The constraint in this game is that you must place a lower number than other's dice to take an action, but lower numbers are less effective. Between the various actions you can choose and the ability to divinely circumvent a bad roll of the dice, I feel like it's less dependent on dice luck than CoB. So while it pulls some elements from other Feld games, the dice action mechanic is new and interesting and it all falls together fairly well to create something unique and fun.

RATING: 6.5
[thing=127060][/thing] is a game in the same feel of the one found in [thing=84876][/thing] - almost everything you do will earn you points, the thing is to discover the best way to gain points. There are lots of things to do: build, acquire workers (men and women), put priests in the temple, gather resources, move, buy jewelry, activate workers, use cards (paying offerings) or god tiles to bend the usual rules, complete tasks, earn shells (money), advance on the turn order track (for position and, of course, points) and a few other possibilities.

It is a game with lots of actions to do and can be hard to look beyond the matrix of points in order to see the coding that will allow you to do better than others, being one with the points and controlling them to do your bidding.

[thing=127060][/thing] requires proper thinking and a good deal of timming: it happened often that one or two players would sigh and complain that with "just one more action" everything would fall in place. This could lead to some major AP, as players try to look into the void in the hopes of understanding what to do, in which order and to which effect, but the dice help to act against, as they are hateful limitations to what one can do.

The dice placement in [thing=127060][/thing] is clever: both high and low numbers can be equally useful, so whatever one rolls, there are ways to use the numbers to a good effect: high number allow to do better actions, getting the most of them - more options, better position, greater possibilities; but bigger is the room for other players to use the same place to an effect close to what you did. The lower numbers made for, usually, worst actions, but can prevent others from using the same spot. This makes [thing=127060][/thing] more interactive than [thing=84876][/thing], as there is not only the denial of items (which is the apex of interaction in CoB - taking a tile someone else might want), there is also the denial of actions - it would be as if using a low die in order to block a whole section of tiles in CoB. Since this translates to a more mean game, feelings can be hurt more (I did some nasty blockings when I could and there was wailing, tears and much sorrow in the land), so [thing=84876][/thing] might not be a 2 players game as good as CoB.

In the end of the game - after six rounds - players will score some more points if they accomplish some feats: fulfilling all the tasks, have 6 jewels, put all the huts in the board, and so on. The player with the most points will win.

[floatright][ImageID=1564158][/floatright]I must say I didn't want to play [thing=127060][/thing]. I was scared. The player aid looked to me as a work of a mad man, with so much going on that a simple glimpse of it could make you crazy. But I played Gurps Supers, so I knew I was able to deal with lots of fiddly and options. I manage to withstand the rules explanation, saw the inner workings of the construct and the components of the salad. It doesn't seemed all that bad, even if I prefer thematic meat with gravy events. Everything looked to make some sense, and the player aid was then less Hieronymus and more Bosch (tools).

The game flow is OK, with everyone using a single die in their turn, basically the same of what happens in [thing=171623][/thing], but even simpler; and definitely faster than the turns in CoB, as in this, even when using a single die, there can be several effects activating, like putting a Castle, then using a brown tile, which then activates something else, and so on. In [thing=127060][/thing] I didn't see combos of this sort - there is a progression in the in the game, but a soft one, and the things you are doing in the earlier rounds will be very close to the ones you will be doing in the last round, as they doesn't really became stronger or chainable (I guess this is a word). On the contrary - you will have less and less options as turns go by, since your huts will already be in places, your spots for workers could be filled, your workers already activated, you might not have more room for resources, etc. Though this also happens in [thing=171623][/thing] and [thing=84876][/thing], but with yellow tiles in the latter and with the incoming of houses in smaller cities in the former, things can go in a crescendo, even if the options get more restrict.

In the end the play doesn't finish with a bang - just a tally.

[thing=127060][/thing] is a smart game, heavier than both [thing=171623][/thing] and [thing=84876][/thing], but is less scary to learn and play than I thought. Everything works well. However, my tastes don't fit very much to this type of game anymore - I once liked the sort more, but my experiences push me towards other types of games, usually not those involving optimization in getting points. Still, is a game I would be willing to play every now and then - but I prefer [thing=171623][/thing] and [thing=84876][/thing] over it.

RATING: 7
Trying this because I can't shake the suspicion that it might be fun, despite serious potential downsides: too heavy, not elegant, somewhat abstract, not focused. I have a nagging Feld itch that's hard to scratch.

...Ok, this was more fun than expected. It's mostly due to only getting three measly actions between check-ins (i.e. where you need to have satisfied one of your tasks). This makes the game feel tense and also simple and smooth, even though there are a number of moving pieces. The three tasks you have at any moment also help make the game feel far more focused than it would otherwise (similar to the disasters in ITYOTD, which also lets you do extremely little on a given turn).

The feeling of interactivity is not all that strong, also similar to ITYOTD: You draft actions WP style and can block others, but mostly you're just trying to avoid screwing yourself over.

The conceit is that lower die values have better priority (and thus blocking ability) while high values get better results. However, in almost all situations a high value just gets you a greater selection from a random selection of things, with no guarantee that there's anything "better" available for a high-valued die.

Bora Bora is also a bit of a point salad, making ideal strategies less obvious. Some tension is lost when you realize that the game's options don't all interlock like an economic engine, and that ignoring one element of the game may not kill you, or even be much different from ignoring a different one.

The game feels noticeably random, like most of the other Felds I've played. I appreciate them for the experience and don't feel compelled to study the strategy.

The two spatial elements of the game are rather minor. The ceremonial spaces on the individual player boards could easily be implemented in a different way with a similar outcome. The map that players expand over has no blocking of other players, and the curious property that you're rewarded for being the [i]last[/i] person to reach a region, so that there is no feel of a race.

...I am disturbed by the possibility that the short-term goals (which I'm inclined to appreciate as adding direction to the game) actually drive the game and play the players. While you do draft most of the goals you'll have, you usually just pick whatever looks the most feasible.

...Main sentiment in hindsight is dislike of the weak interconnection of the Feldian minigames. This has almost cured me of my desire to try Burgundy and Trajan.

Only played once.  Really like all the different things going on and ways to score.  Given that's it's a dice game, it would be nice if there were more ways to manipulate the dice results, but there are two different cards that do that, so might not be a big problem.  I will be looking for more opportunities to play this!

Have played 5 times now and really like the game.  Even with "bad" dice rolls you can use those to "screw" your opponents so not concerned about that aspect of the game.  Multiple paths to victory points works well.  Seems complex, but after a turn or two, the symbols make perfect sense and easy to understand.

Got to play 2 games (teaching one) at ConnCON in Stamford 2013. Play is a little more complex than it probably needs to be, and I'm not sure some of the scoring methods aren't broken. I think the jewelry is way over-valued and the end-game multi-scoring for completed regions is not worth enough to make it worth bothering with. I'm interested in teaching it locally and seeing what other Feld fans think of it.

My initial reaction was more positive; I liked it better than most of Feld's designs, as it combines his usual interesting mechanisms with more interaction than usual (at least in his recent work).

However, after five games I am not really sure I need to play it again. The experience just doesn't change much from game to game; most of the difference comes from whatever path you decide to pursue early on (and you NEED to decide early on), as opposed to anything the game does. I am fine with that in many games, but Bora Bora is just a bit too long and too unforgiving for me to enjoy it given that.

En este juego representaremos a una tribu y su expansión por las islas de Bora Bora. Para ello necesitaremos adquirir hombres y mujeres que serán los componentes de la tribu y que a su vez, tienen una tarea asignada que podrán realizar en su correspondiente fase. También necesitaremos tener el favor de los dioses para conseguir importantes ventajas respecto a otras tribus.

This is Feld's design at its worse. I don't mind playing Feld's games but Bora Bora represented a point salad scoring mechanism that is completely detached from the theme and mechanics. Nothing here in the game is surprising. Using of dice to select and limit action selection. Using different combinations of cards/tiles and placements to score points. The game had all these different scoring mechanics that don't seem to tie well together. For example, collecting the persons and displacing huts on the spatial map. Doesn't even make any intuitive sense. Theme aside, the game play is fiddly, lots of moving parts and pieces and the interround upkeep is annoyingly painful.

In the end, we played the games and it just wasn't that fun. It was a lot of sitting around looking at the available dice options left and deciding how to best use those points. Many times, I just had really no good options to choose from. Plus, your die rolls really can hamper your ability to get good options.

I would go with Feld's other designs. This one is just didn't pass muster.

This is a phenomenal game. The game that Castles of Burgundy wanted to be. While Castles of Burgundy suffers from 'point salad' syndrome in that almost everything will get you points, Bora Bora is a much deeper game, as players have to work toward specific strategies in order to win instead of simply taking tiles from the board every turn, then scoring points just for playing tiles on the board. The game is designed so that there is almost always something you can do with your roll, and with clever planning, you will be able to use almost any roll. One of the best heavy Euros I've ever played, and easily the best game of 2013.

More of the same, which in the case of Feld is no bad thing. This is sort of a hybrid of Feld's earlier 'mean' games and his more recent output: the ability to deny/limit the actions of your opponent feels very similar to In the Year of the Dragon, but the game itself doesn't smack you around like ItYotD or Notre Dame. Instead, the meanness is integrated into his more forgiving 'point salad' style from Trajan/CoB. I think the combination works, especially with more players.

Hey, a Feld game where there isn't some niggling aspect I dislike!  It's still perhaps overly complicated, and I'm still not a big fan of the point salad design, but the overall game is relatively engaging and the dice placement mechanic is unique and clever.

easy to enjoy if you like feld.  reminded me of trajan, but not quite as streamlined and intuitive.  the dice mechanic is great.  point salad game, no doubt.  you sneeze, you score points. but i love points, so that's fine for me.  

beautiful boards, bits... but berry busy.

Another great Feld. A bit meaner than CoB and Trajan, with more direct blocking on the action spaces. But plenty of ways to mitigate the luck (or lack thereof) of the dice. Heavier than CoB, but feels a bit lighter than Trajan.

My favorite Stefan Feld game.  Competitive without being too in-your-face.  Lots to manage, but the tasks narrow your focus.  I love the way both high and low dice can be useful.  It also scales well at all player counts.  And while it's still a "points salad" Euro, I personally feel like the theme is better incorporated into the mechanics than Burgundy or Trajan.  My only (minor) complaint is that the rules do a poor job of explaining how the game is supposed to play (especially the very important god cards)... highly recommend a gameplay video when learning this one.  Overall, I LOVE this game!

Far too complex and fiddly, convoluted mess of numerous mechanisms and ways to score points. Clever and interesting dice worker placement / bidding mechanism where higher-value dice give more/better output but are harder to place and easier to block; and lower-value dice give less/worse output but are easier to place and blocks higher-value dice.

RATING: 8.3
It's a bunch of clever mechanics tucked together in a middle-heavy plus point salad game. It has a clever use of dice, and it might be Felds meanest design because you can effectively block other players from doing what they want. Not every mechanic feels well integrated into the overall game, but it is a nice thinky puzzle to figure out how to maximize your points from all of the options available. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For a game with so many interlocking mechanisms and chrome, the decision space sure felt restrictive and shallow. Every new Feld game I play makes me like his previous games less in hindsight. In other words, the more he refines his style the more I realize how much I don't like what he's about. If anything, Trajan is the best of his "point-salad" games; I don't see the need to play Burgundy or Bora as well, lest I get fatigued with the whole genre.

In a lot of ways, Bora Bora is a bunch of nonsense. The player boards are loud and busy, while there is so much information displayed that the game seems nigh impossible to learn.

Once you stumble through a round or two, you realize that the core of it is a very simple game and then the player boards will make a lot more sense after your third turn or so. Still, the puzzle the game throws at you is very tense. You have a lot of goals to achieve, and not much time to do it.

Overall, I think this is a solid game. Easier than it looks, yet still hard to score well.

The priciest alea game, but also the nicest in terms of components. I like the art and graphic design, though it does occasionally get overwhelming.

I have a feeling this will be easier to teach than the rulebook makes it seem. The scaling is, very obviously just on the face of it, not going to produce similar experiences at any count (7/4, 6/3, 5/2). So what's the core mechanism?

I really want to like this, but I'm so far not feeling the love. And the opportunity cost...yikes, so many other similar-weight games that I like that won't get played.

RATING: 3
The game pounds you in the face with weirdly specific objectives every round and i simply hate that. The dice-placement mechanisms where bigger dice are stronger but smaller dice block out others is great though. It's a shame you do that in the game so little.
The game definetly has the Stephan Feld brand of something great about it, but like so many of his games it is ruined for me by few mechanisms.

Intense, tough, complex but not complicated game that, despite a ton of facets to keep in mind, flows extremely smoothly for 2-3 hours giving a profound supreme gaming experience. At the end i was mentally exhausted but rather satisfied. 
There are a number of things you want to accomplish and only 6 turns to do them: very hard decisions awaits you. Paths to victory are innumerable.
Defects: you throw only 18 dices in all the game and despite the many many mechanisms you have to counter the effect of luck, if your dice do not roll well you'll have a great disadvantage. Secondly, but this is not guaranteed to be a real defect of the game: after my first play i couldnt understand what i did wrong and how i could do better next time. 

nonetheless, I great deeply recomended experience

Gods, goods and greatness.  Yikes, a set up board will blow your mind with tiles and choices in an explosion of color. We start with a hut on the island. Our Priests make offerings to Gods, work to achieve goals as quickly as possible. Make ceremonial buildings from sand, stone, and wood. Conch shells and jewelry. Dice determined worker placement. Novel idea to have separate tribe men and women helper tiles.

I didn't really do much research before buying Bora Bora. I was basically in a game shop and the box art really grabbed my attention. The game board art looked so awesome, I just had to have it.

Ok so.. it was a little complicated to learn and get into but that didn't stop us. 

I really don't know what to say about this game at the moment. It just seems like a big humble jumble mess going through the phases. The board kind of represents this also, with gaming aid reminders cluttered all over the place.

Bora Bora seemed more like a chore than actually having fun. I have played the game twice now and i'm not sure if i'll change my mind. Maybe I need some more play throughs, i'm not sure.

Ok the game art is great but I really feel this game is over-rated here on BGG.

I have not played all of Stefan Feld's games but I MUCH prefer Macao over Bora Bora that's for certain!

I'd never really looked into this game before I played it, but I ended up really liking it. First are the gorgeously colored boards and tokens. Big props for art and graphic design here. 

Luckily the gameplay is there to match: figuring out how to most effectively grab those points (as indicated by tropical flowers) is something I very much enjoy in games like this one. It's quite a beast (especially to explain), and I wouldn't wanna play it too often in a year, but it's a game with many possibilities that I very much like.

Can you say point salad?   SOOO many ways to score points in this game.  Excellent use of dice in this game with low numbers being weaker but blocking your opponents out of actions.  This allows for very tactical gameplay and tension.  I also enjoy the card play in this game that allow for different ways to score and manipulate the dice and rules of the game.  Making sure you can always complete your round goals is a constant tug of war against the overall strategy you'd like to pursue.  In my opinion, this is Feld's best so far (not having played a few of his other big name games). The game is gorgeous looking.  One of my favorites!

Generally we love games that are designed by Stefan Feld. Usually if a game is designed by this man, there are a lot of small rules, which give a player lot of possible choices to score points. We call them gather-games, and we love it, as most of the time it’s unknown until the end of the game who will win and there are a lot of different ways to win. We were looking forward to this game, and were very disappointed when it wasn’t released at last year’s Spiel. We saw a prototype of it (which looked very much like the final version of the game), and the look of that, and the, positive, responds of the few people who were able to play it at the fair, resulted in the fact that we even became more interested in this game. Days were counting towards the end of February, when it would be released. We decided to pick this up mid April, but by the end of March, we noticed that almost everywhere the game was sold out. When we saw 1 copy of the game on April 1st at a fair, we immediately bought it, to save it until mid April as a present for my birthday. Within 5 minutes the only table which Bora Bora was available for playing, was free. We sat down and we got a fantastic explanation of this game.

The first look onto the game-board, wasn’t to bad. A much of the graphics become clear, just by looking at it. Then we looking to the small player-boards, and we were overwhelmed by the huge amount of information that is placed on it. After everything was explained, it became clear that the left-most quarter of the player board is just an overview of all the possibilities of the game. A game takes 6 rounds to play, and each round consist of 3 phases.

Phase 1: Placing the action dice

All players roll their three action-dice simultaneously. Then the first player, places the first die and accomplishes the corresponding action. There are a couple of small rules for placing a die. A die can be placed on every action-tile, but the value of it, has to be lower then the value of any die on it. Also the value of the placed die, determines how big the effect of the action is. In general, the lower the value of the die, the worse the effect or the options it provides will be. (but also, the lower the number of the placed die is, the harder it gets for another player to place a lower valued die on that action tile.) The possible actions (some of these combined, depending on how the number of players) from which a player can choose are:


    Temple: Send one of your priest to the temple track
    Building: Place a building tile on your player board (if you have enough resources).
    Expanding (across water or land): Place a hut from you player board on one of the island areas on the main board that is adjacent to  an area where you already have build a hut.
    Take a man/woman tile: Take a man/woman tile from the main board, and place it on (on an empty spot) your player board.
    Helper: This action give a lots of possibilities which are explained later
    Fishing: Get 2 Victory Points (VP)

For example, the Take a man action tile. If a player, places a 6 die on the tile, he is allowed to take one of the six man-tiles on the main board. When the player places a 2 die on the action-tile, he could choose from the two most-left man-tiles displayed on the main-board. When he would have placed a 5 die, he could have picked on of the 5 most-left man-tiles. The same basic principle goes on for the rest of the action-tiles. I.e. the Building tile. When a player places a 5 die on it, he can choose one from his available buildings on his player board valued 1 to 5. If he places a 1 die on it, he could only pick the building showing the 1.

The last example shows the most interesting in this mechanism. While all players rolls there die simultaneously, all players know the values of the other player’s dice. By placing a 1 on the building action-tile, the player blocks this tile for other players to use, as they can’t place a lower numbered die on it. But the low number of the placed die, also limits the choice of the current player back to 1 building.  (There are ways to avoid the limits of die-placing using god-cards, but they are explained in the rules)

The ‘Helper’ action gives different options and allows the player to spend the value of the placed die on several different things such as upgrading males or female, moving huts on the player board, and gaining building materials, god cards and offerings tokens.  Upgrading males gives them tattoos (which give them status which determines player order and give VP’s). Upgrading females gives them shelves which they can use to buy jewels (which give VP’s).

It surprised me that this mechanism of using dice in fact works really well. It doesn’t matter that much how your roll, as every die can be used good. Of course the ideal roll of the dice would be something like 6-4-1 every round, but that won’t happen that much. The mechanism creates also a lot of tension, because a player has to think if he uses a high or a low die. Use a low die, to block another player, or use a high die to get maximum effort of the die. And the rare moment, you really can’t use a die, you can always place it on the fishing tile, as the number of a die, doesn’t matter on that tile, and score 2 VP’s that way. I thought before we played the game for the first time, that the action would be used a lot, but it isn’t that interesting, as it only scores  2 VP’s.

Phase 2: Use 1 man tile and 1 woman tile

After the players have finished all the actions that comes with their dice, the game progresses into phase 2. Each player can activate 1 man tile and 1 woman tile. If a player doesn’t have one of these, the player can’t activate the tile, and the player won’t get any of the benefits. The power of the man and woman tiles doesn’t seem to be that big, but you have to keep in mind that they are cumulative. That means, if you have two man-tiles, that would make it possible to build a 1-3 tile, you can add these two tile together, and you can build a 1-6 tile. Just as the actions in phase 1, these man and woman tiles seems pretty balanced, and not getting one of each kind in the very first round, seems as a missed opportunity to me, as you just miss two action in the game. And when you keep in mind, that you will only get 30 actions maximum in this game, missing 1 action, is missing at least 3% of the possibilities to maximize your score. And 3% in a Feld game is a lot.

Phase 3: Resolve the end of round

At the end of the round, the players have to resolve 4 things:

    Resolve the status track. The status track determines the player order (which changes immediately) and give VP’s
    Resolve the priest track. The priest gives VP points.
    Buy jewelry using collected shells. Jewelry give you VP’s at the end of the game, and can help you to complete an objective
    Complete an objective, or discard one, if none can be completed. After completing an objective, get a new objective.

The objectives are a very nice part of the game. Each player will have 3 objectives at the bottom of their personal player board. The objectives can be anything like ‘have 3 different woman’, ‘have 3 of the same jewels’ or ‘have built a house on 4 different types of islands’. When a player completes an objective he gains 6 VP’s. When he uses a God-card to complete it, he will get 4 VP’s. If he can’t complete an objective, he has to discard one, and he will get 0 VP’s. During the complete game, a player can complete 9 objectives, with which he can score 54 VP’s. In our first game, we ended with 150 and 126 VP’s, so 54 is a huge amount of VP’s if you can manage to score the game.

End of the game scoring

When all players have played 6 rounds, they will still have 3 objectives at the bottom of their personal player board (they’ll have to pick a new objective at the end of round 6). They get the chance to complete these 3 objectives, and score points for them. This way a player can complete 9 objectives in the complete game. After all player has completed (or not) their objectives, it’s time for final scoring. A player will get VP’s for:


    Unused God-tiles
    Fish-tiles in the area they have built
    Jewelry-tiles they have bought

There are 9 different way to score 6 VP’s at the end. For example for building all houses, for completing all objectives and so on.

This is Bora Bora in a nutshell. As usual in a Feld game, there is a lot going on, and there are a lot of small rules. Surprisingly it’s not a difficult game at all. Okay, explaining the game may take a while, but once you’re playing, all the little mechanics works very smoothly together. The biggest minor in the game, is the fact that the 9 different ways to score 6 VP’s at the end of the game, are too low, compared what you will have to do to gain the 6 points. For example, when you’ve managed to complete all 9 objectives, you’ve scored 54 VP’s. To manage to complete all 9 things, you will have to let other things pass. After all the effort, you get 6 VP’s. Also some of the ‘6 VP’s bonuses’ are very dependent on each-other. To have 12 people in your tribe, you will have to build 12 houses. The dice-mechanic works very nice, and provides the interaction in this game. Jusrt like other Feld-games, the theme is pasted on, and the game relies on game-mechanics. I think I don’t have to say that this is a family-game or a starters-game. This is a game for experienced players.

When playing, one have to keep one thing in mind. In Trajan you can do everything a bit, and win the game. In contrast to Bora Bora. This game is not forgiving. You’ll hate it, or you’ll love it.

And we love it…

Seems like a complete dog's breakfast when you first look at it, but it plays really smoothly and quite quickly once you understand how everything works. There are tough decisions to make from turn 1 which I love. The pressure to complete tasks feels almost overbearing but I want to play more to explore different strategies. A perfect balance of lots to do with not enough actions to do it all. I shouldn't have hesitated for so long before picking this up.

Not bad, but strikes me as a lesser implementation of Castles of Burgundy.

Interesting set of mechanisms, quite good artwork and an original theme. However didn't find the game or fun in the box. Definitely not Feld's best (that would be Bürgen, Macao or Trajan)

Certainly the most complex Feld since Luna.  After one play, I have some concerns that this game may be overly luck dependent, but the mechanics are of great interest.  Will require more plays to resolve.

I wish the board was physically bigger. It feels a bit mean for the expansive complexity of the game.

So many things to choose from, so few actions - oh the agony. Obviously the first game went horribly wrong, as I could not estimate the values of things at all.

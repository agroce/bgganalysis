Similar to Settlers of America, including the shifting production-number mechanic and use of gold pieces to avoid downtime. Long time investment compared to other medieval mercantile games.

I like that if you don't get resources, you get gold. Kept the game a bit more balanced for those with unlucky spots.

It's Settlers but you have two things that you need to move around a map to places to win. Can't say I was overly impressed although we played one rule wrong which would have helped me a little more and put me closer to winning the game. I think the short game isn't long enough, seems to be over before it has started so may be better with a bigger map. 1 Play.

See the description for Settlers of America. With the exception of the merchant, it's virtually the same game. I decided to trade this one and keep the America version. either one would be good to have in your collection

I was pretty surprised by this game. It takes several aspects of different Catan games and puts them together, making a fairly good game.

Too bad this Catan doesn't have a modular board.

Good development of Catan with a beginner and advanced board, which is a nice idea.

This is [gameid=67239] on a new map. The only new element is that there's a short game option. Here's my comment from its predecessor which can be fully applied to Merchants of Europe as well if you exchange railroads for wagons and settlers for merchants:

[i]A little more complex Settlers variant but not as much complexity added as I thought after reading about it. Settlers of America introduces a Civ-like settler that can  cross the country indepedently from roads (SoC) or the herewith introduced rails. Whenever it stops on a city spot, it founds that city and further development can start from there. Players can't get stuck horribly anymore. The second new concept are railroads that have to be built up to reach the winning condition of delivering all your goods and are a mean to get money when a rail connects a city to another for the first time. 
Money - an even bigger difference than the open nature of development. It can be used twice per turn to buy a needed resource. Furthermore, whenever a player doesn't get some resource from a die roll he's compensated with a coin. As a result, trading happens much less in America than in Catan. Pretty big change for a trading focused game. Might open up the system to new trading-averse players but that was what Settlers is about for me. On the plus side, the kingmaker potential is reduced as well.[/i]

Oh, it's alright, I guess. Really, it's a tired, bloated form of Catan. Silly things abound. For example, any player who receives no resource cards when the dice are rolled, will instead receive a piece of gold. Each time. Two pieces of gold can be turned in for a resource card of your choice. There are some decent points, but they don't justify a whole new game.

Ugggghhh. The tedium of Settlers of America all over again. There's nothing fun here, or interesting, or engaging. It's just a thing that's there with stuff you do. What is this game's purpose? Why does it exist? Why would you play this if you own just about anything else? Who would keep this around except someone who "collects" the Catan Histories series?

I know I'm being harsh. As I seem to be saying so often these days, there's nothing WRONG here...the game is playable and inoffensive. But it also doesn't do anything to justify itself.

Catan with a few twists:
-> The goal is to sell X goods to rival cities.
-> You don't need roads to expand, you cannot become cornered and left out without space as in the original game.
-> The board is not modular (it's a big Europe map)
-> The dice numbers are also fixed on the map, but some are random, some can be "stolen" and moved to another area and there are hexes with only 2, 1 or even no numbers.
-> If you get no resource cards in a turn, you gain 1 gold; 2 golds make 1 resource and you can move through rival roads when welling goods.
-> No trading ports

I only played the begginers game, and I certainly enjoyed it as much as Catan, but:
-> I think the roads are way too expensive: you don't need them to expand anymore, and you can use a big series of roads from a rival for just one gold: don't build roads, let others do that for you and use them for a really reduced fee!
-> While the variant is nice, the gameplay "feels" similar, and the components are not so different. An expansion box at a reduced price would be enough, a whole new game for this seems excesive.

I want to play a full game.

Deliver me from Evil, where I will be done. Pick me up and deliver me and I will be happy. Pick up and deliver me and throw in the randomness of Catan, now there's a winner? I picked this up to rediscover the Catan bug, however in this game you must pick up, develope and deliver all to get the Catan bug. Now people enjoy the Catan rule where you get money when your number is not rolled, for me the rage of a 8 not being rolled and three 2 rolls have been rolled consequetivaly pleases me to no end, so when you pick up coins to trade with the bank for resources, it goes against the trade aspect of Catan. Catan and Europe are two beautiful things and this edition is certainly pleasing to the eye. It's a long game however, unlike Vanilla Catan which never out stays it's welcome and if you need that Catan hit I would recommended just that. If you think pick up and deliver with Catan is a winner, I would agree, however it would have to be Catan followed by a pick up and deliver game.

Didn't make the cut as I rolled a 7 dropped my goods then spent my money instead of delivering!

I get to play this with an older gentleman at a local board game meetup and I felt this game has too much player interaction (trading) and it locks up the game. We spent 3 hours on a 90min game. Could be better. The older guy's AP didn't help with the experience either.

De Kolonisten van Catan: Europa ontwaakt is een variant op Settlers of America: Trails to Rails. Beide bordspellen kennen dezelfde gameplay: Spelers starten met drie locaties op het spelbord, collect resources depending on a die roll, spend resources to move and build, and branch out to new locations with a long-term goal of delivering goods to opponents' cities. The first player to deliver all of his goods wins the game.

RATING: 3.3
It's better than Catan, I guess, but it still suffers from those core problems where it's very possible to get screwed by the dice rolls, and trade offers should always be eyed with suspicion. At least area control is a soft economic advantage rather than a hard obstruction.

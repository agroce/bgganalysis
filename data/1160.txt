Fun, suburban-themed simple majority and scoring game.  Love the theme, and have an unexplainable affinity for this kind of plain-Jane art.  Inclined to rate it higher, but I'm doubtful that it would be as pleasant with serial replay.

Not much of a game here that I can see. Place your houses in effect betting on the value of each area - try to be in the best areas, but there's a real 'follow me' effect - as you want to share the areas with your opponents to ensure not too many negative shops get placed. Don't enjoy it much when I play, not sure why - partly theme, partly mechanics, partly lack of control and a rather obvious strategy to follow. Just not my cup of tea.

One of the very first 'German' games I bought and much enjoyed.  Shame that this first flowering of a 'German' games industry in the UK so quickly came to nought - Tomb Raider's gain was our loss!

Much of this game wasn't all that interesting; place your houses in neighborhoods and then try to put good stuff in your neighborhoods while hosing other neighborhoods.  The choice whether to veto a neighborhood amenity was semi-interesting, though, and many of the resulting neighborhoods can be very entertaining.

Excellent Steve Jackson game where the only thing ruining the neighbour hood would be the prison and glue factory you have built.

RATING: 8
This game is clearly an ancestor of Big City.  You are trying to maximize your points in your neighborhood by keeping out the undesireables (say, the abbatoire) and welcoming in the desireables (parks and the like).  Each player has limited opportunities to veto during the game, so use wisely!  Lots of fun to justify your choices.

Nice game of city building/planning

RATING: 7
A simple placement game, where you don't want to get too far out of line with what others are doing as a large majority in one area just invites a rubbish dump or something similar. Everything in theory can be calculated, so it's heavily dependent on obfuscation for its effect, but a simple, fun game, typical of its time.

Quite fun, but far too simple. You just take it in turn places buildings on a map. Bit of a laugh to put the strip club next to the Police Station, but really not much of a game.

I think it misses the mark a bit - again (Like Automania) probably not play-tested enough and didnt add anything new to gaming at the time.

Suffers from a "Follow my leader" syndrome. Best with more players as this then sets up combatting factions. You can go it alone, but very risky.

2-6p, 30m.  This is the 1990 British real estate sim with dumps & glue factories.  Like a little sibling to 1999's Big City http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/70 --not to be confused with the 2004 BoomTown (gold rush theme) by the Brunos.

Auction game. You need to buy mines, deciding whether you want a more frequent payout, or if you want the larger payout mines to save for end game. It seems to be vital to get the mayors so you get paid when others buy mines.

Lots of stupid silly fun. Area majority is not necessarily good, since it may cause unnecessary attraction of the wrong kind. Really good game. Unfortunately, kind of hard to get, and probably not that good for two players.

Players must move into one of six neighborhoods by building their houses.  The houses attract players to build businesses near them.  Live in a prosperous neighborhood with good businesses, and watch your score climb more with each house you build there.  But maybe some shady businessmen want to build their undesirable businesses in you quaint little town.  You can try to veto it, but if someone builds a shady business eventually, the value of the neighborhood and all the houses in it goes down.

A simple but dynamic area control game.  The machanics are nothgin special as your just trying to add your houses to 6 different neighborhoods for what you hope will be a positive modifer.  I've played a lot fo games like this, but the neighborhood modifiers really made this fun for me...   It was a delight to watch a neighborhood you had no interest in gain an abitoire and a strip club, bring it's value to a negative for all houses...   this made for quite a bit of levity in our game.  The 'planning commision' vetos worked well and overall it was fun to watch as people worked together in one turn and against each other the next.   I think that the game could use a revision in both art and play (each player should have maybe 2-3 less houses to build so that the entire board doesn't 'have' to be filed)

It's a bit arbitrary how things play out.  Really the game is all about getting in when the getting is good. But the tiles have so much personality and there is a joy in the voting system that result in an experience that far surpasses the abstract stock system that is its foundation.

If I were to make one change in the game I'd remove two player pieces so that players would not have to fill every space at the end.  This would make for some more interesting end game decisions.

I really liked this when we played it; I felt like it had a real Big City vibe.  This seems like a game that a publisher could re-do for fairly cheap (Fantasy Flight Silver line, or something like the same) and it would play well as a mid-range game.

There really isn't much of a game here. You enhance your housing estates and stitch up your opponents. It does make me chuckle when people place things like speed circuits next to cemetaries however.

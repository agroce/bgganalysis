Nice game with a different approach to tile placement. The game area evolves to a nice looking garden when the game progresses. The placement of the gardeners and the ornaments really takes some clever thinking. The rules are very easy although the rulebook is not very clear on some points. This game is best with maximum number of players which is 5.

A light game that reminds me of Hanging Gardens. There is subtle strategic plays you can make, but you are mostly reacting to what other players have left you. I prefer Hanging Gardens, but wouldn't turn this down as a starter game. We played with the turn order variant which allows the person who has the least flowers showing to take a turn instead of going clockwise. This added a little to the strategic level, albeit not much.

Pretty neat looking and interesting little abstract.  The card play reminds me a lot of Hanging Gardens, but the scoring system where you "pick" flowers that your card covers, and then sell them in bouquets is neat.  The gardeners, animals, and garden ornaments as blockers is also clever.  My only concern is that playing the last card seems to be extremely powerful.  The final player gets to not only cover up other players' stuff and also block other players' lawn ornaments from large lawns, but also gets to guarantee that his last card will go uncovered, scoring all flowered spaces on that card while also having a great opportunity to get the yield bonus.  I'm not entirely sure if this concern is 100% valid, but my gamer sense is really concerned.  Still, a fun enough game that I'll play it more to give it the benefit of the doubt.

How did I never hear of this game? This game is much better than it has a right to be. It almost feels like a rip off of Hanging Gardens, but I think they came out at about the same time. I much prefer this one. Very clever game about laying extremely thin tiles overlapping each other in a way that makes a big garden, without really getting much taller. Nice mechanism to protect what you have from being slaughtered. Also nice mechanism to balance placing your good tiles early versus late. I passed on buying Hanging Garden, but would consider Bloom if available fairly cheap.

In simplistic terms you could compare this to Hanging Gardens without individual boards. I dislike the tactical version because of the time required to determine who's turn it is.

Bloom is a rather standard Tile laying and set collection game. Everything works together fine, but theme is really pasted on, and the game suffers some kill/king making.

One of Shelley's favorites because it's 'pretty,' this game slipped under a lot of people's radar and got a small publishing run.  Players try to position their garden plots to establish the best ones possible, using characters to block where opponents can play.

First played April 9th, 2009. Taught in 5 min, played in 40 min with 5 players. This had a good mix of luck and strategy. Each player is given a gardner and 9 tiles (use 8 with 5 players). Each tile is broken down in a grid of 9 squares. Each tile has 1-9 of these grid spaces filled with flowers. Each player has a different kind of flower on their tiles. On your turn you place a tile and then your gardner. Later you earn a animal (when you have 10 flower spaces showing at the end of your turn) and a centerpiece (when you have 15 flower spaces showing) and will place those as well. The tiles must be place so they expand the group of tiles by at least one square in the 9 slot grid. The flowers (if any) that you cover up (including your own flowers) you recieve one flower token for each. When you collect more than 8 flower tokens you must turn them in, unless it's your turn again. You recieve 10 points for a set of flowers from each player. 6 for a set of 4, 3 for a set of 3, 1 for a set of 2. Next you place your gardner anywhere on your one of your own flowers. This protects that space from being covered up. The animal gets place anywhere next two any tile grid space with or without a flower and protects that spot from being covered up. Your centerpiece is placed on a flower section and a grass area and gives you 1/2 VP for each grassland space it is connected to (orthagonally). The gardner and animal are picked up at the beginning of your next turn. After all have placed their initial tile, the next person who goes is the person with the fewest flowers showing, so it may be the same person's turn. If there is a tie, then the next player clockwise goes from the player who just played. Game ends when all players place their 8 tiles. All flower sets are turned in and the person with the most wins.

I think this gamer is stronger than the theme indicates. Yes, this is a game about competitive flower planting. It might put some people off just on that. But don't let it get you down, at its heart it is an abstract strategy game.

RATING: 5
Fun overlapping card laying game with some similarities to Hanging gardens but with a common board instead of individual play areas. Use of different playing pieces that are "earned" for having a certain # of flower beds adds some blockage elements, but I strongly recommend using the "advanced" rules to help minimize the potential for a big advantage due to poor placement by a prior player. Seems to play better with more people, but still fun with less. Don't overlook any end game bonuses as they could decide the winner if bouquet sales during the game remain comparable.

Looking at the box I expected a light filler, but instead got an AP-prone brain burner (expert version).

Some nice ideas (especially how player order works), but the game is a bit too dry for me, since it has no random elements or hidden information.

Nobody seems to know this game. Thematic it is a laugh, it is about crushing other people's flowers. Great interactivity, great with 3-5 players. Flower collecting, area influence everything fits together beautifully. Always play the poorest player moves first. Setup is easy, language independent, simple rules, gameplay about 20-40 minutes, likely to ask for a rematch.

-1 for the 2 player variant with dummy player however is, ehm, dumb. No fun.

I was surprised how "meatier" game this is. Turns plays fast yes, but you need to think of blocking and other tactical elements as well. Looks like a light and a game for the childrens, but works best with adults. Nice game which feels a bit like Hanging Gardens, but has still it own touch. Nice game, although for me the biggest problem here is, that I don't know where and with whom I might play this?

Played the tactical version.  The game is very colorful, particularly when finished but the large amounts of downtime proved to be its undoing for me.  There isn't a whole lot of control in the game and is mostly tactical in nature as long range planning is very difficult.

Area control mechanism reminds me of Hanging Gardens. Being able to block certain areas helps in the strategy. Sometimes you want to just take as many as you can, so you can sell more bouquets.

A mean little abstract tile placement game. The turn order system in the expert version is brilliant, and along with the end scoring makes for a devious hand management scheme. 

Might be a bit AP prone, and has some kingmaking issues, but still very good when played at a fast pace.

The components are of high quality but there's an essential part missing: Player aids with prices of the bouquets, and the end game scoring, should have been included.

Put flowers in a garden, on top of those of your opponents. The main mechanism in the game is similar to that in The Hanging Gardens, but Bloom has its own dynamics. It takes a while before you understand it. Not bad, but I don't really feel the need to play this again.

Surprisingly tactical yet nicely themed game with no luck at all. I have to emphasize that the theme is greatly refreshing.

The game itself is not so nice whatsoever. Your moves should basically consist of blocking the others. I did enjoy the game but this kind of game won't be tolerated in certain groups.

I expected something lot worse when saw the game and heard about it. It turned out to be a good game after all.

Prefer the tactical version to the family version, btw.

I was very unhapppy with my play of this game.  There are certainly some interesting "tile placement" things going on that I do like.  However, the game in general did not seem to be very fun.  A big part of this was a rulebook that didn't help to understand the game.  There were several places where it was not particularly clear.  The collection and scoring of flowers just didn't seem right.  Overall, it was just an unpleasant experience.  [01-01-2010]

Played the family version for the first time, and that really is the way to go. The expert version adds nothing but extra AP and game length. 

With the family version and 3-4 players, this is a nice and vicious puzzle game.
-------
Interesting game, that may be too clever for its own good. Given the open nature and perfect information, this may fall victim to AP, for which it is actually too simple.
I liked it with three, but with two, it's way too fiddly for my tastes. The sequence of play changes continuously, which gives you a headache if you have to play two sides, one of which is also controlled by your opponent. 

Reminds me a lot of Hanging Gardens, but that seems the better game of the two. Graphics are gorgeous, if you like bright colours.

RATING: 10
Awesome quality materials all around, great art, great gameplay, miniatures have multi use - 30k, 40k, this game, display, conversions, etc.

One of the better games here.

My initial rating after one play of the first scenario: Betrayal at Calth is a superb game, with quick and easy rules but with a surprising degree of tactical depth. 

Here's hoping for fan-made units and scenarios to keep the replayability high.  Even better, it would be wonderful if this was the first of a series of boxed sets using the same basic rules but with new boards and command cards.

As usual, very smooth design by GW who really know how to keep the essentials and cut out the fluff. Excellent skirmish game.

High quality components and a new gameplay. I love the tactical aspect of the game. But it is not better than Space Hulk. But with some expansions in the future I could change my mind.

The game is good, the bad rating is only for the GW marketing plans. Why only one shot games ??? No extensions ? No possibility to play others races with this gameplay ? They got me once, not twice... Be aware all their games will follow the same rules : ONE SHOT Only.

Best games workshop game I have played.

Would greatly benefit from better rules summaries.

Rules and game pieces (excluding minis) available cheaply on ebay (as at Dec 2015)

Bought the boards, tiles, dice and rules off ebay for $13.00  Fantastic rules for a light skirmish game.  Pretty balanced and love the activation mechanism on it.  Considering purchasing the full box now.

RATING: 9
Excellent design, which manages to capture a great deal of 40k flavor while offering playable and interesting mechanics.  Scenarios have been pretty good to date (two left to go) and reflect a certain amount of thoughtfulness in giving both players things they actively have to go do to secure a win.

Surprisingly light and fun wargame. It showed me, that removing minis doesn't have to make the game loose any of it's theme or playability.

I love Word Bearers and Warhammer 40k. Anyway, it is not very great board game and it's expensive!

Can be a nice quick play. Not a fan of flame weapons and not bei g able to shoot the opponent next to your hex, so you have to close assault. So the heavy flamer is pretty pointless on the terminators. Otherwise i like it.

Great and elegant game, bring me back to the 40k (30k pardon) after 15 years of "meh!"
With the right support from GW this can be one of the best game system around.

Will be watching this one and my interest level in this game will be inversely equal to its cost.

I would really like to buy this game but I fear GW will price it ridiculously expensive and will push my interest to zero.....

Edit... just checked GW website at its runs for $265... Are you f'kn serious!!! 

Well that's me out, leaves one more copy for the Fanboys

Purchased the components apart from the miniatures and box, ie, tiles, cards, dice, rules, bags.  Now also have painted Ultramarines Captain Steloc Aethon, Chaos Contemptor Dreadnought (Sor Gharax)  Have also bought Chaos Chaplain Kurtha Sedd, some Cataphractii Legion Terminators,

Proxies the models after buying all the other game box contents.  Quality components, could use a nice QRS.

RATING: 6.5
The first scenario was a moderately interesting race/combat game, but I can't help but feel that all of the games and scenarios are basically playing a significant second fiddle to the models and the pictures in the rulebook. As such, I'm far from certain that much if any thought has gone in to the game and it is perhaps luck more than anything else that has resulted in a fun and playable first mission.

I suspect that this rating would plummet with additional plays.

Finally a new boardgame from GW that I really, really like. Almost as much as my most beloved games from that company, Space Hulk and Warhammer Quest. Just as those titles, could very well become a classic skirmish game. The squad based manoeuvering is elegant, original and tactical. The quality of the boards outstanding, and the scenarios interesting. Looking forward to playing this some more!

GW returning to its roots?  Well somewhat. The rules are pretty simple. It's a slugfest akin to Space Hulk but the forces are fairly balanced. The difference is how and when you play cards that will boost your situation or benefit your position. And, it all plays out on a board with movement regulated by hexes. All good stuff. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Got the gaming components for $15. Intending to use my underused dark vengeance miniatures for this to try it out. 

Played the first scenario. Some cards are real game changers but it seems pretty necessary to prevent a situation both players are trying to stall for time by staying out of each others line of sight.

A boxset designed to sell miniatures for  Horus Heresy, an offshoot of Warhammer 40K, (takes place in 30K).  Fine and detailed miniatures that are not for the faint of heart.  Buried under the miniatures is a boardgame with quality components.   Instead of a typical boardgame, a straightforward head-to-head squad level game on boards that uses the miniatures in the box.   It is actually the best game "system" GW now sells.  Most folks who buy the box want the miniatures, not the boardgame.  But, it is a VERY good game.  Might just be the best game no one ever played.

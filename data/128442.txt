RATING: 7
Plays very much like Talisman, with some key differences. You now level up instead of improve stats individually. Spells are replaced with power cards that can also be used instead of die rolls. No PvP (without expansions, at least). Three threat decks instead of one adventure deck. Relics are actually useful. The board is ridiculously busy-looking and really hard to guess where things are if you aren't really familiar with all the spaces. Overall, I like it fine, but will always want to play Talisman 4E more. Talisman is, to me, the more intuitive game, with a theme that appeals to a wider range of people, is easier to teach to new players, and has a lot more expansions that I use. Compared to Talisman, Relic feels a bit over-engineered and cluttered for what it is.

Relic improves upon the classic Talisman, and provides a setting that I enjoy.

RATING: 6.5
Slow and kind of boring. Many turns feel kind of empty or futile. Roll dice, draw encounter, hope it's an encounter that you have a chance at, repeat.  Game can be a slog if you keep drawing very powerful encounters, but if you get some weak or average ones your character can snowball quickly.

Relic is a board game in which two to four players each assume the role of a powerful hero from the Warhammer 40,000 universe and bravely venture forth to shield the Antian Sector from certain doom. By completing missions and defeating enemies, characters compete to gain rewards and experience, furthering their chance of being the first to defeat whatever evil lies beyond the Warp rift.

RATING: 8
Yes, it's Talisman with a few improvements and rethemed for Warhammer 40k.  BUT I DON'T CARE.  I love it!  It's relentless, unforgiving and just plain mean, but the theme is fantastic AND THE GAME DOESN'T CARE.  Oh, what's that, there's a MASSIVE Eldar standing in your path who just squashed you?  TOO BAD.  I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but it's fun enough that I'd love to play it a couple times a year.

One solo runthrough and one 2-player run so far.  Game is hard.  Feels like a competitive Eldritch Horror.  I want more player interaction, so Nemesis sounds like my cup of tea.  Not that there's no player interaction, it's just pretty sparse.  I feel like I have quite a bit of agency and choices to make, wasn't sure if that would be the case, having not played Talisman and heard a lot of complaints.

Relic is exactly like Talisman, in that it is literally the same game with somehow even more stupidity pasted into the corner of every tiny card and detailed miniature. 

It is without doubt one of the most bullshit games of all time... but as with all bullshit, if one approaches it knowing that it is bullshit, the bullshit seems somehow less bullshit than your average bullshit.

RATING: 7.5
Talisman with prettier minis and grimdark 40k theme. I'm OK with that.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After the first few plays: It has an "upgraded" Talisman system which therefore looses a bit of its simplicity. IMHO the game lacks the expansions. For me it took too long to enter the innermost ring since some of the challenges could kill a player too fast. If you play it with a very cautious group it leads to boring "level up" run-arounds.

A pro is the lv. 12 max rising of the abilities which keeps the whole thing in range. Also the various challenges on one space so that a strong hero is once in a while forced to use his lower skills in a battle.


Rating might definitely rise when:
- I'm more familiar with the board and don't have to look for this darn place I have to go to
- expansions are out and expand the gameboard like Talisman

RATING: 6
Adds improvements & new elements to the Talisman game system for a better experience with the bonus of fixing some of its predecessors issues.

Only appeals to those who know and love the W40K universe, which I do.

Unfortunately far too much luck is involved for such a long game and many times players wont feel like they control or influence their own fortunes or destiny. It invites run away leaders, crazy unfair dice explosions (roll again if rolled a 6), and others - although it is lessened here compared to Talisman. 

Sadly there is No PVP, players only interact via a few card side effects.

It is better than Talisman. I really like the theme here but it still could have been better. They were so close with the addition of the cards that could be used instead of a die roll, but they were just too few and far between. I am still going to keep tabs on it though. I just can't ignore the call of the Emperor.

RATING: 4
I have to start by saying this is really not my cup of tea. The game is utterly random, it features almost no decision and the only impressive things are the graphics. Since I am not even impressed by the theme, I can give it a 5 because of the quality and art work and promise myself never to play this game again. Even the miniatures are ridiculous and after half an hour of play I could only wish the game would end no matter who and how achieves victory.

RATING: 8.1
A nice version of Talisman placed in Warhammer universe. Some new interesting additions to characters build, gameplay, monsters and other cards, some new mechanics. If you love Talisman you'll love to try this new improved baby :) The only problem is the huge amount of time that you'll need to finish it, especially when in more than two players. A way to finish it quickly is to declare the player higher in level winner after an amount of time 1-2 hours.., if tied the one who acquired more assets and influence etc. Or you can start directly level 5 and make a speed run to the end. Good quality and artwork on miniatures, cards, and board. A pleasant way to spent an afternoon if you find at least 1 ppl who wanna try it!

RATING: N/A
A much needed "reboot" for the talisman series.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a roll and move, draw a card and resole the text game, however, they have added more to this title to make it a story telling game.

First, the art and components are beautiful.  The flow of the board's art and the sculpts of the miniatures included are breath taking.

Second, the rule set has been tweaked to cut down the play time.  granted it is still a longer game.  However, it is now highly unlikely that all players will look at each other after hour 3 and decide to flip the board from sheer frustration and boredom.

Lastly, its Warhammer 40k.  This game takes place in a rich, vibrant universe chock full of theme, story and expansion potential.  This game should have legs for many years to come.

I would play it, but frankly it takes too long for what it is. Sure, there are chuckles here and there, but the run-away leader effect and the luck factor are limiting the game.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I enjoyed this one, and for a role and move type game, they actually threw in some interesting choices.  They also found a way to drop the playing time (probably due to not as much player back stabbing).  The 3 adventure decks is a nice add on.  The theme is pretty cool, but I think I would have preferred this to just be Talisman 5th edition.  Interested to see what they do going forward with this game, and will be keeping this one as it is a nice one to pull out to scratch that Amerithrash itch.

It's good, medium depth.  A cleaner version of Talisman.  There just needs to be a little more screw your neighbour in the play.

UPDATE : This has been getting pretty regular play.  We took a house rule from Talisman and applied it here.  Bump up initial character deployment by 2 levels.  Game flies by after that, with losses still being possible.
Still needs screw your neighbour angles - we're waiting for news on expansions.

This game is right up my alley. I love the RPG (character building, item collecting) aspect of it. Leveling up feels awesome. I can't compare it to Talisman because I've never played it.

Relic has a pseudo difficulty to it because of the dice rolling mechanic during combat. It feels like you have to level up and get great items before your dice rolls become less important....but in order to do that you have to get good dice rolls....its a loose/loose if you aren't great rolling the dice. 

If there was a different combat system that struck a good balance, it would be perfect.

RATING: 9
Excellent replayable themed Game. Better than Talisman as its varied gameplay is more defined and more controlled towards the goal of winning with thought and skill (of course huge dice luck is vital now and then lol). 
Good fun, initial steep learning curve for new players but all easy after a time.
Movement mechanic can become a pain (power cards crucial here). The Inner tier and Scenario endgame battles are its weakest parts, this is easily overcome with some houserules (check downloadable files).
Played without Nemesis and 3/4 players. Long 3/4hrs.

RATING: N/A
This is basically Talisman recreated with lots of fixes to the common complaints. Set in the Warhammer 40k universe, players take on the role of a member of the Imperium battling monsters, surviving events, and moving through the universe. The first person to accomplish all of their individual goals is the winner. A solid game but a bit complicated and long and mostly luck based with little room for strategy.

Talisman with reusable equipment, special skills, and... explosions. A nice retro experience for 30 minutes, where you get away with saying "kaboom" all the time. But if you play the full game, it is painful. 
Maybe there is something at the bottom of Talisman that makes it something else than a stale mix of Monopoly and an RPG, but this relaunch didn't uncover that for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Relic is literally Talisman with a Warhammer 40K texture map. Many of the locations do the same things in the same spots. More meat has been added to the bone, however, and Talisman fans that have grown out of its simplicity will find Relic to be a breath of fresh air, at least for awhile. You don't need to know anything of 40K to enjoy your time here (I sure don't) and there's plenty of new bits and baubles mixed in with the old school familiarity. It is still probably simple enough to show a neophyte this instead of Talisman, if you're so inclined.

Improved version of Talisman and with a different theme. I rate it slightly higher than Talisman due to its improved game system and components. It is what it is - a fun adventure game which, like Talisman, is completely unbalanced. 

The player interaction in this game is reduced compared to the Talsiman game, and I expect I would rate this higher if this element was enhanced (via the expansion).

Overall, fun in the right setting.

While the WH40k fluff is a definite plus, Relic suffers from the same weaknesses that kept Talisman from true greatness, namely the moronic endgame dice-off, rich-get-richer gameplay paired with the lack of a catch-up mechanic and descision-poor turns. Based in your initial draws and performance, the game may get less interesting the more it moves forward. Maybe the added PvP in the Expansion helps to remedy these flaws.

This is essentially 'Talisman' in the Warhammer 40K universe, and plays very similarly in many ways, including the design of the board, the encounters with enemies and the character stats. Some subtle difference however detach it enough to make it an enjoyable game in its own right. Fans of 40K will recognise and appreciate the locations, characters and enemies in the game, whilst Talisman fans will be familiar with many of the game mechanics.

Pros: Very thematic, great FFG component quality, evocative art. More of an adventure game than a serious competitive game.

I'm impressed with this. I like talisman, but its far from my favorite game (i rate it at 6). To me this is a significant improvement. The downside, is it comes at a greater rules cost. Relic whilst not a complex game is no longer in the family fun bracket i'd put the easy learning talsman in.

It does a number of key things to improve on the talsiman system.

first there are lots and lots of ways to mitigate die rolls, both in combat and movement. You get cards specifically to play to force specific die results, but also items allies etc.

secondly your characters increase in power fast, making the game quicker, giving you a feeling of 'im a badass' and pushing forward the experience.

thirdly, there is simply more variety in stuff; enemies, items etc.

I like the 40k universe more for its fiction/art than GW games and Relic does a good job of representing / evoking it. The artwork does most of the heavy lifting here. The overall board composition is a little all over the place, but the individual images on board and cards really nail it.

The only other downside of me, is the middle of the board is possibly a little to easy to get through, making the ending perhaps a little to fast coming.

In summary, Relic is a faster, more exciting and evocative game that gives you more control.

RATING: 3
Beautiful artwork.

Boring, frustrating game. Talisman is dated and this shows it. 

Your decisions are quite literally move left or move right, and then the game plays itself.

The game goes on forever. Last time we played it was 3 hours, and no one was having fun. It just dragged.

Some characters are just better than others (Ratling Sniper vs Sanctioned Psyker anyone?)

Relic is a much harder version of Talisman. The game is in many ways very similar, and the rules play a lot like an expanded version of the basic Talisman rules. The biggest addition to Relic is probably corruption, which will give your character either bonus's or penalties, but which will also kill your character if you get too much. You should probably expect your character to die at least once while playing, particularly as not all characters are equally balanced and luck is rarely on your side in the grim darkness of the future.

This is 40k Talisman, but I love 40k. The tweaks to the usual Talisman rules speed up the game and also provide more choices.

Overall, the increase in player choice means that this is always the better alternative to Talisman.

RATING: 6
Children and children at heart will find a lot to enjoy with Relic, and as part of the WH40K brand this has already developed crossover among miniatures gamers the way Lords of Waterdeep pulled in D&D players. Visually the board is heavily thematic and the encounters are all steeped in the lore of WH40K.

Fans of the setting will love this game and its offspring while ignoring comments below.

The busts with interchangeable plugs seem likely the first component to break, and I wonder why the choose to use the plug at all. Overall the components are "stunning" if you like your art beyond overwrought. At a glance the board is nice, but the text is all but unreadable if you aren't pressing your nose against it.

Aesthetics aside the game is an attempt at Talisman envisioned as a taught, tense serious adventure for 4 players...it fails as the gameplay is made fiddly with managing multiple components, inventory slots, trophy types, mission cards, bonus effects, corruption counts...while still retaining the "engine" of roll & move, exact count.

Talisman was a fun romp across a fantastical landscape with the occasional impossible task and was best with huge groups of friends using house rules to speed the gameplay. This revision has lost that simplistic charm of rooting for your best friend to fail and the shared laughter of everyone when the leader sudden transforms into a helpless toad.

RATING: 6.5
I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this. 

Whilst in Talisman you can go around and around the board forever this version allows your characters to level up more quickly and therefore if feels less repetitive. 

The enemies are split into three encounter types and you have some control over where you land thus what you face (a power card can be discarded for its value instead of rolling for movement)

It is also nice that there is no way to continually be throw out of the centre ring if you decide to embark upon the end game track, which is a major flaw of the taliman game IMHO.

Several different scenario cards allow for different end game conditions and there is plenty of flavour and epic artworks included in this box.

Overall I am actually quietly impressed with this and look forward to many more plays.

Gameplay is a tepid nightmare. No excitement, no strategy. Do not believe people that say you can play this solo, either. It is even worse.

I played a lot of Talisman back in the late 80s and early 90s, and Relicreallllly brings me back to those days. It's an attractive game although the Warhammer 40k motif does make for a dark theme and graphic design. The mechanics represent an improvement over Talisman, in my opinion, with one more character attribute, improved character progression, and a Corruption mechanic that adds an interesting risk-reward dynamic. At its core this is still a beer-and-pretzels game, but one that takes 3 or more hours to play.

Talisman in space.  Production value is through the roof.  While pretty to look at, this suffers from the same problems as original Talisman.  Luck-driven, roll and move, few choices.

The mechanics are a bit better than Talisman, but you are still limited by a die roll to move (I would have removed that and replace it with a progressively more dangerous path on the game board and a move attribute to a characters).

Try it first, don't buy it if you already have Talisman, it's not worth it unless you find it better and sell your Talisman collection to get this one.

Will buy the video game if it ever comes out like I bought the Talisman Digital game from Steam this year.

RATING: 8
Players b$tch about this game backward and forward: "too much luck, too long, leaders runaways, loser never leveling up, dodgy dice...ect"
Relic is NOT a serious game. You SHOULD NOT sit down and think "I will play to win this game" because you may lose with all the best strategy in the world (yes there is strategy). Your opponent's dice will explode and there will be NOTHING you can do about it.
Think of it as Talisman/munchkin/warhammer 40K all together in a big mix. 
I give it 8 for the exceptional board and pieces and the diversity of cards and adventures, however, after multiple plays, it is obvious that house rules to the basic rules are needed, especially as a pick-up games with new players.
First game will take a while just to get it. Second and subsequent play through are much faster. 
Finally, to speed up the game, lower the leveling up threshold from 6 to 5 trophy points.

I was looking forward to trying this one, but the movement is too close to MONOPOLY for me (roll 1d6 and move x spaces left or right).  In 2013?  Really??

Played a 4-player game and it was a waste of 3-hours of my life.  No fun, no enjoyment, no control.

After 2 hours, managed to lose the only 4 points/trophy I had accumulated... and after 3 hours, still had not gained a level.  Other players were passing their tests, I was failing more than half of them.

The board was nice but too "loud".

Nice sculpts.

Will never play this again.

If you don't like [i]Talisman[/i] or 40k then keep moving—[i]this wasn't made for you.[/i]  It's a choose-your-own-adventure where the bulk of the "choosing" is done behind a veil of kinked probability.  Sure, [i]you[/i] chuck the die, but every bounce and clatter before it stops is a poison kiss blown from Lady Luck's smirking lips.  If you can't just relax and groove with it then you're gonna rage-poop yourself a little.  If you're on the fence, save yourself the trouble and go play something you know you'll like. 

[b][thread=952961][/thread][/b]

Also, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/12267511#12267511]this[/url].

UPDATE:  Definitely a kinder, gentler [i]Talisman[/i].  The knockouts are softer, allowing you to keep most of your crap even when your character is corrupted and bursts with tentacles and hate and scurries off into one of the Threat decks to become an encounter.*  Also, while it's still possible to get royally hosed by CARDS & DICE and wind up wandering from world to world like some kind of piteous cybernetic hobo, this is less likely if you "stick to your color" and grind on worlds that bend to your strengths.  Instead of the usual mid-game malaise there is a whirlwind, a heady upward spiral of mad leveling where Middle Tier encounters bring multiple foes into your dread presence to ablate hideously in the effulgence of your gaining three levels at once.  This makes for a shorter game (not that brevity is expected or even desired in Epic Adventure, but still) while increasing the tension of the race... and that just leads to more ill-considered risk-taking and derring-do (read:  [i]hilarity[/i]).

[size=7]*Okay, this doesn't [i]actually[/i] happen, but we can dream, can't we?[/size]

UP-UPDATE:  8 --> 9  The Mission mechanism is a neat way to drive character motivation in interesting directions—you have a clear goal from the get-go—as well as making the path to gaining a relic (this game's talisman) obvious and achievable.  Also, the more we play the more impressed I am with the almost perfect synthesis of game and milieu; this is the full flavor of the 40k mythos laid on thick and tasty.  The game unfolds beautifully from the interplay of the random decks and static board.

The 40K world is one for dreamers. I have the books and play the video games, but the actual tabletop experience is a hallow shell of what the world represents. Cue the board game spin-offs. Despite being a re-implementation of Talisman, Relic takes you to the 40K world and relishes in it's long history of funny naming schemas and ultra dark presentation. Sometimes you just want to move around a board, purge things, and get stronger.

Relic is repleat with all the things that make a game Ameritrash in all the best ways. The theme is fantastic and rich in its imagination and boundless in it's scope. The board is super busy, as the Relic universe necessitates, but the artwork is phenomenal and it all really sells the theme. The mechanisms are very easy to learn and understand and keep the game moving along at a good pace while still offering the players strategic choices.  At its core the game is a roll and move, but all the card powers( assure, mission, power, threat etc) and the mechanic of choosing which direction you will move provide for freedom of movement and meaningful decisions. Like all Ameritrash, it's not deterministic- every safe decision has some risk and every reckless act has a chance. Excellent game.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (April 2015)

Relic is a mediocre adventure game. Very similar to Talisman, but with an improved theme (for me). Like Talisman, Relic can be a fun game to play once a year. The components are very good as is usual from FFG, however I would have preferred to have a whole miniature instead of a torso, but it is a very minor quibble, the torsos ARE very detailed.

In Relic you have a bit more control than you have in Talisman, however the luck factor continues to be through the roof, so the player who rolls the best will win. The decisions are very easy and obvious so most of the fun to be had  depends on the game group itself. The characters seem to be very unbalanced (like Talisman) but that isn’t a problem with this kind of game (most of the time). Also it is a gentler version of Talisman, In Relic when you die you can begin anew with few penalties.

As the game is so simple, I get bored between turns so I think Relic is best played with 3 players. I feel the game is way too long for what it offers. I hate that Relic removed the PvP aspect making it a worse experience for me. Some missions allow you to attack/steal other players, but it isn’t the same.

I expect FFG will release tons of expansions for the game (also like Talisman) and there is a certain appeal to this, but I don’t think I will ever buy the game.

Bottom line, I would play again Relic if requested, but this kind of game is among the lowest in my gaming priorities, it is way too simple and slow for my tastes. It can be a good family game, when I was a child I would have loved it. With more plays it surely will go down in my personal ratings. If you like Talisman you will surely like Relic.

We had mixed feelings about this game based on reviews and the fact that the theme did not appeal to us, but I managed to find one half off, so we decided why not.  I will say, this game grows on you.  At least it did for us. At first we hated it, but found ourselves wanting to play it again and again.  The only thing I will say is be ready for a long game.  We tend to set it up and leave it for play over time.  And we enjoy watching our characters lvl and grow.

This is an interesting game to rate. While it certainly feels very much like Talisman, the simplicity of Talisman is gone. Instead, you have a much more complex, more fiddly (lots of cards and markers) game than its predecessor. 

Its difficult to say which I like more. This game is definitely more involved, has more rules and special powers. And feels more complete. Unfortunately the game really does slow down because of this.

RATING: 6
Great level up system and loot stuff but Unfortunately, it is a too long game match. There is some variants that makes the game shorter and you should try it. The main problem is at the end of the game at the inner tier, that transforms the player turns simply in a casino style, rolling dice and watching where your lucky drives you to.

- Best played with 3
- Limit players to 3 in normal game

Totally dependent on the theme.

i'll admit i don't really know Warhammer so it all felt a little dull. If i knew who everyone was it may have been more interesting - as it was there was a lot of 'Oh, i need to get 16 in red to be able to get a +2 yellow bonus' - i feel we missed out on the role playing element a little!

The game itself felt alright but i can't imagine pushing to play it again.

A game very true to the mood and environment of the 40k universe. That being said it is a long game and currently is designed for only 4 players.  The art work is excellent and the quality second to none. I love the game but it does not get the amount of uses it deserves simply due to the length of plsy time.

Relic is a board game in which two to four players each assume the role of a powerful hero from the Warhammer 40,000 universe and bravely venture forth to shield the Antian Sector from certain doom. By completing missions and defeating enemies, characters compete to gain rewards and experience, furthering their chance of being the first to defeat whatever evil lies beyond the Warp rift.

Building on the foundations of the Talisman system, Relic is an adventure game in which seemingly straightforward choices mask scores of possibilities.

Can be a fun pass of time when played with a couple of house rules. The main weakness is the lack of progression in the game and that can be fixed with the house rules. Might cause some strain between spouses and/or friends (dice work always better for the enemies). 

House rules:
1. Difficulty progression: 
1.1 Levels 1-4 cost 4 trophies to level up. Players win ties. 
1.2 Levels 5-8 normal rules apply. 
1.3 Levels 9-12 cost 8 trophies to level up and enemies win ties.
2. Active mission limit is 2.
3. During setup give each player one mission card. If the mission is not in the outer tier, discard and draw a new one until each player has and outer tier mission.

My rating is based just on 1 play, so I might revise if I play again.  This isn't a game I would buy at this point, but would be willing to play again.  The quality of components is excellent.  It is not overly complex, but seems a little bit so at the very beginning.  There was a lot of fun with leveling up, gaining powers and equipment.  The one mechanic that seemed to be a drawback with the roll then move, was that you had to move exactly the number of spaces indicated on your die (either forward or backward, so atleast you had a choice).  One of the other players, kept comparing it to Parcheesi.  This mechanic was particularly difficult for us at the start of the game because we kept passing by our objectives and then trying to double back and missing it again.  Later on some of us picked up movement modifier objects/allys that reduced the severity of this mechanic.  Aside from this one complaint (which is pretty major) I really liked the game.

One of the longest games in my collection and nary a dull moment. Have yet to play under 3 hours. Good balance of luck and strategic planning to manipulate the die rolls and combat outcomes with cards and special abilities. Great as a 2 player game. The board could use better differentiation between spaces.

It's essentially a Warhammer 40k version of Talisman, an old 80s game I love. It's very much like its predecessor except with some nice twists. I like Talisman, but it isn't one that gets any play anymore, so this was a chance to revisit it and I was glad to do so. Unfortunately there isn't much point in me buying Relic, as I already own Talisman and it never leaves the shelf.

The game obviously jumps off from the Talisman engine, which is perfectly fine in its own right.  However, there are vast improvements.  The level up system is amazing, and I would love to see it in another game.  The setting is well evoked.  The variety of scenarios is rich and interesting.  The board art is fantastic.  In the end, though, this is still Talisman gameplay and Talisman movement and Talisman combat, and it that's a problem, the 40K setting won't help you at all.

It's very rare that I rate a game a 1. But any game where everybody at the table is txting on their phone while 1 guy is doing their move is garbage.

There is a ton of downtime waiting for your turn. The game is completely dependent on die rolls making for absolutely no strategy. 

With all the great games out these days. This just feels old fashion. Roll to move, roll to fight, rinse, and repeat.

I found my happy place with Talisman: alcohol, an interest in laughing and not worrying about the game, and a disinterest in winning. Relic is much the same.

I like the "Talisman 4.5" changes -- seals to give you a meaningful decision about movement, cards to influence movement and other rolls, scenarios for the endgame, and a host of other little and big things. It's smoother and meatier, game-wise.

But it's still Talisman at its heart: punishingly difficult if the dice go against you, and nigh-impossible to win if they go against you for too long. If winning were the point, I'd rate it much lower; for me, it's not the point.

---

That said, I honestly don't see myself suggesting we play Relic. It's pretty, but Talisman is more stupidly-fun, and I don't need to own it. Sold.

Love this game!  

I have grown tired of Talisman, as it is a bit too random, and the theme feels a bit generic at times.  I am a big fan of Warhammer 40K, and sci-fi in general.  Relic captures that feel perfectly!

A lot of the cards in Talisman lack flavour.  For example, most monsters have a printed strength value and no special rules.  In Relic, however, almost every enemy you encounter has special rules, that are very true to Warhammer 40K's back-story.

The board in Relic might seem a bit busy at 1st glance, but it all starts to make sense the more you play, and the artwork looks amazing. 

Relic also gives you more choices \ strategy than Talisman via power cards.  I think these are great.  I also love exploding dice as they make any encounter more exciting, and challenging.  In Talisman fighting low strength creatures becomes boring, eventually.

Relic also gives you multiple different endings to chose from which effectively give you a different experience \ game each time you play.  I know Talisman has some of those now as well, which you can obtain in expansions, but the core Relic set already comes with five!

I cannot wait for the expansion!

A story machine - and one that works a couple of kinks of its older brother Talisman, and adds some new hilarity to the mix in the shape of CORRUPTION. "Why yes, I will take a corruption in order to receive a shiny new Bolter gun. What do you mean I go insane and run gibbering off into the darkness screaming about Khorne?"

So it requires the right playful attitude to be fun, but if approached with that attitude a good time is had by all.

As far as games that feel epic while not requiring much brain power, Relic is one of the best. It's not a game I want to play all the time, but it's very enjoyable considering what it sets out to do. I do wish that they would adapt this system to Talisman, as I enjoy that theme better, but I do appreciate this one for having a more unique theme. I have had those games where the rolls go against me at every turn, but those are offset by the games where I remain competitive the whole time. A solid game, but really needs some more expansion content, and I'm not sure it has sold well enough to warrant that.

It really is Talisman with a new theme. Given I've tried to mostly forget Talisman from long ago, I can't directly compare. But all the main features are here. Roll. Move left or right. Flip a card or cards. Fight it/them by comparing dice rolls, adding your stats. The more you win, the more you can level up, the more your stats increase, until your stats are high enough to get you through the inner circle, and then you attempt to do so for the win, maybe going early if others are on the move there. There' hardly any player interaction apart from the occasional steal as a result of a mission successfully completed - complete three of these and you earn a relic which is a passport into the inner circle. Once it's clear how it plays, everyone can pretty much overlap turns and get the game going fast, because the faster it's over, the faster you can get to a game that's more than simply flipping cards and dice rolling. This one's for those who are fine with theme immersion attempting to cover a multitude of design sins - I need a little more.

Really like Warhammer and like this game because of the theme.  I like the leveling mechanic and the art work, but I find the game fun at the beginning and end.  The middle of the game kind of drags along.  It seems like the second hour of the game is just trying to level.  Then the time I spend in the 2nd ring is just long enough to get me to the third ring to fulfill the victory conditions.  If there was a way to speed up the middle of the game or to require more time in the middle ring it might make the game better.

Fun, but longer than Talisman. I like the changes from that system. The power cards replaced "Fate" tokens. I like the dual ability of those cards.

I originally wished they had used actual GW minis instead of the busts. But the busts don't look bad when painted up.

UPDATE 7/15- a few games in now. Thinking about house-ruling the exploding dies. You can be in a combat with your combat 11 to an opponents 3, and the opponent can roll and explode 6's twice and you roll shitty and the level 2 monster schooled you! Happened 3x in most recent game. 

Yeah, definitely need a house rule for that. This was only complaint and this from Talisman fans.

Talisman is definitely on the "too damn random" side of the board game spectrum for me, and while Relic feels a little more playable, it's only marginally so.  40K theming does nothing for me either, so it still ends up being a not-particularly-interesting grind to the magic numbers.

Not just a retheme of Talisman but greatly improved and enriched game. They have managed to add more content and complexity while making the game play shorter and smoother.

a solid game based on talisman. Many improvements to talisman's mechanics. Beautiful board. Photo's don't do it justice. 

This would have been awesome as warhammer fantasy, but as warhammer 40k..meh. Fails to generate the narrative and "choose your own adventure" elements that Talisman has. While mechanically superior to Talisman it just doesn't generate stories the way Talisman does (with it's expansions). Perhaps future expansions will help this game out.

Ah Warhammer 40k.. you know I do occasionally dabble in this world.It might be a novel or even the purchase of the latest rulebook or a miniature or paints. Then that nostalgic inner geek even contemplates what it might be like to put paintbrush to overpriced miniatures and play wargames with like-minded adults. Then I realise that in the real world this is something of a ball ache and it all ends up on ebay again. Thats the great thing about boardgames all you need to do is open the box, theres no  overhead..
Back to Relic, I like Talisman a lot its pure chaotic fun.That system is what a fantasy adventure game should be like.. setting off as fresh adventurer over verdant fields not knowing what's going to happen, finding stuff killing stuff and completing the quest. Its not perfect by any means that fucker can drag its needs like minded players with house rules because Bob didnt quite get it right the first time. 
Back to Relic then..this is what happens when a designer is allowed to break away from a 30 year old system, it looks great more choice, more nail biting. No PvP though that surely is coming in future expansions because if Warhammer isnt about antagonism then what is. Kiss my Storm Bolter!!

Good game, but make sure you've got some time left on the clock to play it.  Our first game took about 3+ hours.  

If you look at a lot of the people who scored it low, they say it's "to much based on the luck of the dice".  Well, what game isn't based on luck?  "What card will I get next?" "what will my opponent do?".  They also say that it can become lopsided.  True, our first game, I died twice and couldn't get my character above level 2.  But again, Poker can become lopsided, Magic can become lopsided.  

The game offers a variety during play.  A challenge one turn, simple the next.  Extra's allow you to customize your character. When you get a new ability or weapon, you get to look at two or three and pick the one you want.  So it offers plenty of variables.

Good Talisman variant with a cool space theme.  I'm not convinced that the system is a "better Talisman" even though there are a number of interesting changes.  More is not always better, there is a certain beauty to the utter simplicity of Talisman.  Time will tell after I get to play a few more games.

If you enjoy Talisman (Any Edition) you will very much enjoy this game!   Not directly compatible as an expansion but a separate game.    Some of the mechanics such as character attributes are tracked differently and there are limited opportunities for re-rolls (i.e. Fate Tokens).  However, there are many more opportunities to directly develop and play modifiers such as Power Cards and use of Assets to influence your own fate.

A sleeper hit with my wife (!!), Relic is a fantastically simple game with a lot of deep elements built in. It's as simple as roll and move, but there are a lot of other mechanics added in to give the player more control over the game. The components are beautiful and there's a lot of replayability here. This is built on the talisman engine, but it is much more forgiving than talisman. You will have a lot more control over your experience in Relic. Still, a lot of it is left up to chance.

Theme is gorgeous and very well put together. This game has some of the finest art and components in my closet.

I like "Talisman" a lot: it´s a classic, and a ideal game for certain moments at home playing with friends. At the moment, I´ve only tried this version once and with 2 players, so I'm looking forward to trying it with more people. Anyway, first impression about "Relic" has been excellent, of course.

RATING: 9
Pure fun. Better than Talisman.

Strategy is deep and at first glance non existent. But then you notice that power cards give you decision on how to move. Places on the map give you a choice in missions. You can decide if you want that corruption card or not etc. The better the player is the less the dice decide what happens. So if you complain that the game is random the problem is you not the game. This game gives a player a lot of options to mitigate randomness.

This is one of those games I really enjoy with a lot of push your luck moments and risk managment.

It pays to be bold.

Whenever I set up a night of bonding and catching up with my mates to smoke cigars and drink whiskey Relic hits the table.

Some nice rules tweaks from Talisman (and I don't hate Talisman at all), but somehow feels more empty than its predecessor - maybe due to the abstract nature of space (and despite this, there seems to be too much happening on the board graphically) and the many empty spaces. The roll-a-die and choose which direction you're heading hasn't felt old to me before, but in this game it does.

No PvP, yet you get some cards which can sabotage the other players' efforts. Influence, this game's "gold," feels like it has few uses, but can be essential at times. Basically, it's a bit difficult to grasp why you need it. Until you do.

The best improvements are the variable endings (even though one of them is somewhat anti-climactic in that it only requires you to reach the center spot) and the missions.

Talisman updated, but oh man, that ugly board that makes me dizzy, and what a weird theme. Some of the changes: a) Now there are three kinds of encounters, not only two, and the players know the spots where each of them is more likely to appear. b) Player can exchange any combination of trophies to win a level, and how a character grows its preset in its card. c) Players get a relic if they fulfill three missions, which they get automaticly. d) I miss the spells, the variety and the theme of the original game.

RATING: 7.5
Incredibly thematic but heavily luck driven - I normally don't mind a heavy dose of luck if (1) the playtime is reasonable or (2) the luck factor doesn't yield huge swings in outcomes. Unfortunately, this game lacks both attributes - it's long and swingy - making the luck a little too much to bear at times.

However, that said, the game does seem to have a nice narrative arc, the artwork is beautiful, there is a solid replay value due to a wide variety of cards and scenarios, and the turns go fast.

I will gives this another try, but part of me thinks this is no more than a fancy "roll-and-move". I will be generous with my score at the moment, but time will tell if this is worth being in my collection.

RATING: 6
I like a lot of the changes they've made to the Talisman system: specific leveling up tracks for each character, corruption, 3 different challenge decks, use of Power cards to mitigate luck of die-rolling, etc.  The board is a bit busy, but it's quite attractive once your brain adjusts.

Ultimately, Relic/Talisman just can't cut it compared to modern adventure/RPG-ish board games.  It's too much rinse & repeat, there's not enough narrative to hang your coat on, going around and around the same world (or universe) defeats any sense of real exploration.  Sure, there's some satisfaction in watching your character grow in power and ability, but having that be the entire game is ultimately a fatal flaw.

It still overstays its welcome, even with just 2 players - but that's the nature of the beast.  Grab some whiskey, a good friend or two who like to roll dice, and try to have a good time.  Just don't think too much about it.

RATING: 6
This is basically a race game. Probably works best with 2 players IMO. Unfortunately it lacks something - player interaction. There is very little decision making involved in this game - just roll the dice and do what you're told. The only real skill involved is remembering to use your special abilities and figuring out whether you are strong enough to enter the inner tiers. 

That said, rolling dice certainly makes things exciting and theere is a lot of anticipation, but this game relies too heavy on the roll of the dice.

Production values are fantastic - great looking artwork. Only production quibble is the box text is tiny and there needs to be better differentiation between spaces.

It's okay I guess, but I don't much like the Talisman style of it, it feels very much like the game plays you for the most part, but not with any overt storytelling. It has to come from you and I guess I'm not a very good storyteller when I play games. :p

RATING: 6
Rating might be influenced by my last play: we had a rather lopsided game, with my buddy leveling up to 12 and having two relics, before I even hit 6th level (without any Relic to support me). Because of unfamiliarity with the game, he then waited too long to finish it off, taking the game time to almost 3 hours which is definitely too long for this game.

It remains a rather enjoyable rump though, even though it is a really, really light game with just the base end-game condition present. So far, played only vs the base end-game condition, so will try out different setups to see if that makes it more interesting..

Excellent adaptation of talisman, beautifully designed board, excellent artwork and theme. If you like talisman thaen this is a must, it plays as well if not better, the added twist of 3 threat decks (adventure decks) that bring a new twist to planning your moves, yes its all down to the dice rolls, but even when your rolling badky its still fun. And the new take on not toatally starting from scratch when you loose all your lives is a breath of fresh air, this mechanism was already adapted as a 'house rule' for our talisman games to prevent a few bad rolls and card turns leaving a runaway winner and someone starting from the ground up again!
Cant wait for the next round.

Talisman, but slightly better.  Nice theme, and with some of the randomness mitigated.

Just played part of a game to learn so I'll have to see how a full game plays out (and how long it takes) but initial impressions are really positive. I've never played Talisman, but I always thought this looked interesting so I grabbed it when it finally went on sale for $22.

This game gives me a very similar feeling to playing Eldritch Horror. First is because of the basic gameplay. In Relic you move, then you have an encounter which consists of a battle or a skill check. In Eldritch Horror you do basically the same thing except you don't roll a die to move, you just get to move one space (or two with a ticket). They're both very random and you don't have a lot of control over the outcome, but the fun comes in the amount of variety. In both games there are plenty of decks to draw from and there are a lot of different characters to play as, and they all play differently.

Enjoying this so far, and I imagine it would go over pretty well with people who have are just now transitioning to modern board games (because of the roll and move and the overall simplicity).

Update:
Still enjoying the game, the length is my only concern. I have played where each player starts on level 5 and that speeds up the game considerably, while still taking two hours or so.

This is my tentative rating. I want to play it at least twice more before I make a final judgement.

I bought this game on a whim. I have little interest in either of the Warhammer miniature franchises, but FFG has done a wonderful job with their use of the license, between Chaos in the Old World and Death Angel.

As a point of reference, I have never played Talisman and will not use it as a basis for my comments.

Relic certainly looks gorgeous. The board, the minis, and the artwork are all top notch. I really felt drawn into the world, and I was psyched based solely on that.

Then I started playing it. To say this game is luck-based is really an understatement. Yes, there are cards and abilities that mitigate luck. But all of that goes right out the window when your enemies' dice "explode" (re-rolling sixes, potentially over and over again).

One of my group of four became the clear leader early on with some lucky rolls, acquiring two relics and four levels within an hour. The rest of us floundered, losing battle after battle against weak enemies that rolled disturbingly well. After three hours, we just quit.

I don't mind losing. I have played Seasons seven times and never won, but I LOVE that game. The problem is that when one us pulled ahead, it seemed impossible to ever catch up. And we losers all had the feeling that, if we had just been a little luckier, it would have been us at the top instead. Little skill was involved.

So far, this game is a disappointment, but I'm not giving up yet. To be continued.

EDIT: Gave up, traded for Battlestar Galactica. =P

Got this game as a recommendation of a friend who is a big 40k fan.  It's not bad but not a big fan of the style of race to the end.  The outer and middle paths can be enjoyable but can feel like a slow grind up towards the inner path.  Would prefer it to be more of a co-op than a race.  I feel like first one to the inner path wins.

Awesome Game! Great new entry in my collection.
Still Talisman but visually spectacular, faster, meaner....better! 

I like it a lot because:
-Its sweet to see your character improve through dials and level ruler (no more colored cones)
- Missions, power cards and corruption  mechanics are AWESOME
- overall character sheet design is GREAT
- relics itself are powerful equipment and it is very satisfying to get one!
- more decisions in your turn!
- Payer Vs player interaction is subtle but still here
- Busts miniatures its weird but very well done and add a lot to the visual of the game

                       BUT

Our first game (4 players) still took three and half hours to complete! Let me think... same game in Talisman maybe would have take 6 to 8 hours! Now that's an improvement!
Want to play again ASAP and i think rating will rise especially with the PvP expansion!

                      BUT NOW

I really have to trade my Talisman 4th edition with all (one!) expansions!

Two-section player boards manage special character traits, vitals using wheels, and track level bonus unlocks. Corruption cards are bad, mmm kay. I like the rush to level up and be the first to the Warp Rift. Almost everyone doesn't prepare enough. Beautiful artwork on the game board. Pretty light, RPG taste, fun.

Długa i mecząca gra. 5 minut czekania na swoją turę tylko po to, żeby rzucić kością. Losowość w grze jest absurdalna. Decyzyjność w praktyce ogranicza się do tego czy pójdę w prawo czy w lewo. O wszystkim pozostałym decyduje rzut kością, więc tak naprawdę człowiek jest w tej grze niepotrzebny. Nawet w Chińczyku jest więcej strategii niż w Relicu. Niestety bardzo zła gra.

Very happy with the pieces and the way the game plays; I think it fixes some of the minor problems with Talisman, and doesn't introduce many more problems in doing so.

Also, while i like and enjoy the game, it's one that you have to be in the mood for due to the grind at the beginning to get your levels up.

A game for social groups that can handle gaming with other conversations going on around the game.

Color me a Talisman-hater and Warhammer tourist.

But Relic IS better than Talisman, and as long as you enjoy light level-up adventure games you'll snatch fun from the jaws of boredom and live to tell about it.

Until the one game when your luck turns sour and everyone else has 10 levels on you, with no hope of ever catching up. Then you'll drop Relic in a ditch and wish it farewell.

Like: Two directional movement. Power Cards. Equipment. Character powers. Level up system. Scenario Driven. Expansion adds alot.

Dislike: Almost too much luck involved, new players can be easily discouraged.

Talisman 40k is awesome.

Its a better game than talisman.  Its more interesting, has better mechanics and decisions and its more fun.  I like the corruption mechanics, the power cards are cool, and the adventure (threat) cards are awesome if you like the 40k theme.

FYI, This is not a strategy game, its an RPG board game.  It is chaotic and open ended and meant to be an experience, not a brain puzzle.

3 hour grind fests were never really my thing. Traded without playing.

Talisman sucks and so does Relic. 95% luck 5% trivial decisions

Very fun game, but towards the late game it stops posing a challenge.

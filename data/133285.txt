RATING: 8
A mean auction game with Euro elements on the board that actually has a theme that really comes out in game if you know the history of the opening up of the American Airline industry from a almost Monopoly situation. 
Downsides is some people will not like the mean parts (Which I love) which can mess a person up badly if that player does not prepare for it. Auction games can also have the randomness of someone kingmaking by bidding too high or low for a plane that someone needs to win. 
That being said I think all the above adds to the theme of what did happen in history. The most thematic being you start the game hampered by cards that represent bad monopoly business practices which you have to get rid of to improve your airline. The addition of the board for routes and all adds a lot of strategy than if it was just a straight auction game as you can buy less planes but get more efficient routes. Also the tension of the mean cards like plane crashes makes one never feel safe and you literally will hold your breath when someone reveals their card for auction. 
Overall, a great game almost like myrmes which is a mean Euro with theme. The designer also designed my favorite boardgame which is Sekigahara.

Brutal, unforgiving game.  Don't fail to buy planes early, they get a lot more expensive as the game goes on...  and the last thing you want is a turn where you can't place planes...

The concept is okay, but there are better airline games out there. This one features once-around auctions where the player who puts up a plane usually gets it. If you don't buy planes, you can't connect cities on the map, which does little except bumping up your token on the income track. (Money equals VPs.) The international routes fell like an afterthought and seem too powerful. Not much player interaction except for screwage cards, which seemed rare. Oddly, bonds can be obtained without paying any interest. Sorry, not for me.

First Play: A game where the first play should be considered a learning experience. I misunderstood rules and some were played incorrectly but one game needs to be under your belt to appreciate the nuances of the game flow and balance.

In hindsight I feel there might be an issue with turn order. Sure you bid for the bonus card and the highest bid goes first, but unless you have all of your cards in a tight group, there seems little point in wasting money on any bid. 

Secondly, going first seems to have tangible problems. Tail end players have several turns to win an auction for a plane before their turn, whereas the first player better win the first auction or he can't expand. Likewise at the end of the game the last player knows that no strike or crash cards will come out and so doesn't need to build a contingency for this. Their last turn can be 100% efficient.

Thirdly the turn order is a complete lottery if you don't win the bid. Unless you have cards to demand going first, you might as well save money and bid $0 and have an equal chance of any other turn order position seeing how tun order is clockwise from the start player.

Not so happy with the  personal housekeeping and the implications of other players not being on top of hazard points recorded on the board. There is no penalty for not doing it yet if you need to check peoples boards regularly you are telegraphing that you hold an event card. The flow of money to and fro from the bank is frequent and a pain for those players who need to administer to this. Keeping paper money secret behind the screen is a bit of a farce, poker chips or coins would be much better.

Nice production but just doesn't hang together sufficiently for my tastes.

Another comment: like Sekigahara, the play time estimate on the box is actually quite conservative. 30min per player is reasonable for your first game, but after you get a handle on the system it can and should play significantly faster than that.

---

Really terrific medium-heavy economic euro. Sekigahara was *so* good, I was a bit nervous about Tin Goose, whether Matt Calkins could keep it up or if he just had that one game in him. Tin Goose isn't quite in that league (Sekigahara is a truly exceptional game), but it it very, very good. Nice business management game of balancing risks and managing cash flow, and the auctions add a nice edge of player interaction. The events can be a pretty big deal; when you have them in your hand you don't get to be in the power seat when auctioning a plane (definitely a bummer) but if that means you can hit people hard with a crash or fuel bill, that's cool. The risks of crashes, fuel costs, or strikes don't hit often but they can hit hard when they do; if you're skating on the edge of liquidity with an expensive fleet and get hit with a fuel event, it can be really bad.

It's nice to see a euro/business/management game where the scores can have really huge spreads, depending on how well you play. Part of this is the events, where if you manage the risks badly you can get hurt. But a lot of it is the cool auctions. There are a lot of them, and it's usually really unclear what the ROI on a fleet is going to be - it's as much about your position and game tempo as it is about a pure cash return calculation. So there is a lot of opportunity to both be shrewd and to badly misjudge the auctions.

It's also cool that it really is nicely evocative of early aviation; this is not just a generic euro, like an Automobile or Aeroplanes, which are pretty sterile brain-burners. This is a real attempt to model and evoke the period.

For me, this is total win: serious and thoughtful but not a total brain-burner, strategic, nice blend of skill with randomness, very nice narrative arc. Very highly recommended.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: Tin Goose is growing on me. Like any auction game, it requires a bit of experience to accurately value the items being auctioned. Overly cautious bidding can lead to the game being overly tame. If you're the experienced hand at the table, bid hard and wake people from their dogmatic slumbers. You'll either win or you'll lose interestingly.

I find this game entertaining as hell, but I do stand by my assessment that it's significantly better with five than four, and to be avoided with three.

---

OK, I'm three games in and I feel somewhat empowered to render a verdict. Tin Goose is a good, solid economic Euro with some interesting auction mechanics that plays in under two hours, and all that is to the good. It is not, however, the awesome game that one might expect from combining themes and mechanics I like with the design genius behind Sekigahara.

The good stuff: it's a smart and snappy game that uses auctions in a fun and challenging way with some interesting stuff to think about on the board -- Medici meets Power Grid is a decent strap line -- and like I said it plays quick for this sort of game. It's pretty to look at; I wish some of the box art's Mid-Century Modern flourishes had been replicated on the stuff in the box but I can't fault it for making it hard to see the relevant information. Apart from the cards being a bit thin, it's all well done. There is a minimum of luck involved. You know the identity of all the cards in your hand from the jump and you should be able to intuit to an extent the cards your opponent is holding from context clues. And it's nicely thematic; it feels a bit more like running an airline empire than you often find in this sort of game. Also, downtime is gratifyingly low over the board unless someone's AP is pathologically bad. Supposedly there is an iOS app in development, which would be great, but even if that gets scrubbed, Tin Goose would make for a solid asynchronous web-based game at Yucata or somewhere.

Some elements of the game that turn off other people don't bother me. There's a bit of blind bidding in the game, but it's not a major factor. The once-around auctions are also a turnoff for some people, but I like them just fine.

But there are some bogeys on the scorecard. Turn order is important but invariant. You auction off first player at the start of the game but it stays in that order for the duration. Feels like there's some wiggle room there to add a layer of intrigue without ramping up complexity. Not a deal breaker, but maybe a missed opportunity.

A bigger problem is with the auctions, in my mind. Like I said, I don't mind the once-around auctions for new plane fleets or the blind auctions at the start or during strikes. But I do mind any auction game where you are not necessarily given a clear path to punish people who consistently overbid. You can hit people who are cash-poor and plane-rich by dinging them with event cards but whether you have those in hand is up to the whim of the deck. The advanced deck preparation rules where everyone is guaranteed an event helps a little. I would also consider a variant where everyone gets dealt more cards than the turns + 1 per era they get now to be a potential solution.

Another ding against the game is scalability, or lack thereof. With 3 and to an extent with 4, the map feels too open and the game is not interactive enough. I have played three games so far (one each at 3/4/5 players, conveniently) and the game is clearly and evidently better with each additional player, to the point where I would say that this is a 5 player game that can do 4 in a pinch and has a rather unsatisfactory 3-player variant. If you're considering Tin Goose (and I do want to circle back here and emphasize that this is a good game overall) I would strongly recommend thinking about how many opportunities you will have to play this at the optimum player count. This is not the end of the world for me (I often have 5 at game night and frankly, the world needs more games that are best with 5) but it's worth thinking about.

The last thing I will note is that the game seems to end a bit quickly for my tastes. Like a lot of engine building games with a fixed duration, Tin Goose seems to end right when you've finally got your machine humming.

Still, this is a fun game, and I certainly haven't plumbed the depths of the system after three goes, so I'm not ultra-certain about where this ends up in my estimation but it's hard to imagine this being better than an 8 or worse than a 5.

Players are founding fledgling airlines in pre-WWII America.  Clean playing game about growing an airline business, expanding it, as well as trying to manage financial risk from set backs.  Feels a bit retro, with auctions and actions, but almost feels fresh because of this.  Some nice decision points in the game - when and where to expand, and how to grow your fleet and income, while clearing out the five initial "set back" cards.  Clean design that puts the onus of good play on the player - liked it a lot.

Very solid auction/economic/network building game with some damage mitigation.  It comes together in an interesting way and is engaging throughout.   The presentation and components are very well done.   I'd consider adding this to the collection if I thought it would get played (but I'm not sure it would).    There are some contentious design choices (once-around auctions, possible huge 1st player advantage) but I think that gives it some character.  The game that it reminds me of the most in terms of style and feel is Power Grid.

Tin Goose is driven by auctions. One auction every round drives the game forward. There is a map which you spread around as your plane network expands, but the main game is the auction. Imagine Ticket To Ride with auctions and you are half way there.

The simulation of the US air companies expanding from the 1940s onwards is well presented in the game and it feels like a decent simulation. I like that it does this so well.

The game can be pretty brutal if you get left behind, but it is a neat and a rather overlooked Euro from earlier this year.

RATING: 8
The fun of the game is managing the effort to extend your operations such that you make more money (which is VPs) for either in game use or endgame points while still maintaining a defensive position (against events played by other players). 

The conceit of the game is that it starts you off with five negative conditions. For example, you don’t get end of turn income or crash events cost you a lot of money. When you buy a fleet, you may remove one of these negative conditions. Some of the conditions are tied to the event cards that make them even worse.

You don’t know when other people will play an event card, and yet when you buy a fleet, you are usually making yourself vulnerable by having less cash to pay for events or adding to your crash/oil risk profile. The goal is to catch each other while vulnerable and force each other to take emergency loans. Loans are simply negative VPs and while they usually give you $40, emergency loans only give $20. So forcing someone to take, say, -80 VPs but only getting $40 is a thrust of what you're doing here. Always keep a cash reserve. You need to think and play defensively because you will lose VPs. The winner will lose less.

While you’re trying to maintain a cash shield against the shenanigans of your opponents, you also are trying to expand your operations to make in game money and claim endgame VP spots. Everyone will feel vulnerable to each other and be subjected to the same crucible of trying to play offense and defense at the same damn time. 

You will get your paint scratched in this game yet I don’t feel it enters “take that” territory but more push-your-luck or risk mitigation. The game presents you chances that you know you need to take but you feel the heat soon as you take them. And I like that.

There's light and shadow in Tin Goose but it does exude the air of a game quite a few years older than it is in any case. Elements I liked were the company deficiencies at the beginning that allow for players to take different routes through the game, the auctions for planes and the trade-offs between playing planes and events and quite generally, the need to balance your exposure to disasters with the expansion of your company and your cash flow. All of these work pretty well in my mind.

I do have a bit of an issue with some of the disaster events, in particular the strikes with their blind auctions that you even need to spend additional actions to prepare for (and which, in spite of all that preparation, only one players will come out of unharmed), and their distribution in general. If you do get disasters that mesh well that is a definitive advantage over someone with a hodgepodge of non-synergistic cards or no events at all. It also seems like spatial competition is really muted until about the halfway mark when the medium planes come into play.

RATING: 7
Tin Goose on sight looks like another connection game across an American map, maybe something akin to Airlines Europe or Ticket to Ride? In fact, Tin Goose stands on its own as one of the more distinct auction / money management games I've played in awhile. Designer Matt Calkins (of "Sekigahara" fame) took some risks doing things different here. Once-around auctions don't get much love, nor does the oblique sense of value of each airline, nor the seemingly "take that" negative events that can come without warning.  In reality, the game forces the players to develop their own sense of the economy and adjust their bids and actions accordingly. In fact, instead of responding to the game's attempts to set obvious value (which it doesn't) you have to respond appropriately to how your opponent's set their sense of value (which can feel indistinct but adds a certain meta game and encourages risk taking/conservatism which is often irritating in auction games of this type, but not here). Really, the fleet/event decks are so large and only a few of the cards come out of each deck, so you never really know the make-up of events and the characteristics of the fleets that will make an appearance.  It's this uncertainty which unhinges the game of a strict economy, but in this case, it's part-and-parcel of the game. This might feel random, but it surely isn't. Players see their all the cards they can play for the entire game and can plan accordingly. Plus, you can bet that certain fleets will come up (based on # of each fleet in deck) and you can watch for telegraphed moves to determine which hazards may appear.  Having once-around auctions makes sure that each player has the opportunity to buy their own fleet card, though sometimes at a great price.  And again, you can often spot an event coming or you can plan to minimize the impact of your own events, so "random" doesn't exactly cover it (but it is true the make-up of your hand during setup is random to a degree).

Overall, I would say that Tin Goose is one of the most misunderstood games of 2016.  It has some real interesting ideas (the starting "condition cards" being a prime example), however everything else is just funky enough that TG feels distinct, but not popping or catchy the first time it's played. It's going to find a lot of people either not interested in even trying it or not appreciating the way the game sets players to value the fleets. It's a shame. Calkins could have copied tried-and-true auction / route-connection game methods to make this game more accessible or more "likeable" but then it would have lost its edge.  Tin Goose is such a strange game, it made me think, it irritated me in a good way and it forced me to ask some serious questions about game design. It's by no means a great game in terms of something people may have missed out on (this is simply not a game for everyone) but it manages to be completely its own thing, a distinctive mark for a designer who has been so celebrated for Sekigahara.  I'm quite looking forward to trying this again and continuing to consolidate my opinion.

Components: not bad, ok for the game but could be bad if you take into account the price
Complex: easy to teach, need several plays to really dominate it
Weight: medium
Players: 4 or 5
Length: could be played in less than 90 mins when you know how to play
Opinion: I have liked it, probably the rating could go higher with more plays. Really easy rules, but not so easy to understand everything that is going on, and the difficulty of the game comes with the actions of other players.
Managing your Air Company you try to serve cities with your planes (earning revenue and income), for doing that you have to acquire new fleets or upgrade the ones you have, taking into account that planes in this period are not as safe as they should.
Length is a good point for the game, only play 7 turns, during 3 eras, and you have all cards you can play from the beginning. Your turn is as simple as... play a card and do 3 actions, if the card is an event, apply it, if the card is a new fleet a bid starts.
The events, they are only of 3 types, and all are bad, but not so bad that you could not avoid them. In fact, I like the variant of starting cards being divided among fleets and events evenly between players, this way you can have one event and can play it (hurting others more than yourself) or just ignore it.
I think this game will see my table quite often

RATING: 8
A very well-designed game with unique mechanics that unfortunately suffers from the fact that minimizing bad things feels harrowing rather than fun. Most of the game is about mitigating negative effects, which while a very interesting design and perhaps mathematically equivalent, is not psychologically equivalent to experiencing positive effects. This game is very polarizing and whether you like it really depends on if you enjoy management and mitigation, as well as bidding. Lots of bidding.

The game pretty accurately simulates the feel of starting a new enterprise and the kind of struggles one must endure to become successful. Unfortunately, the game is not long enough to really get to the "success" part--you basically just get to the point of starting to feel ok and then the game is over. I'm not sure this is really a knock; if the game did go further, it might be satisfying but would also be so long that it would overstay it's welcome. Nonetheless, it has a strong feeling of progression, even if that progression is more about digging out of a hole than climbing a mountain.

The game could be cutthroat and the people you play with is an important factor in your enjoyment. My game group liked it pretty well but also was good natured about it. One player really loved it and cited the management aspect as a lot of fun.

I suggest giving the game a try because it's hard to predict how anyone might like it ahead of time. I appreciate a lot of the subtle design choices (like the city names on the Fleet cards) and think the game is definitely much better than its current rating (~7). Even if you don't end up enjoying it, it's worth experiencing from a design perspective at least once. It will certainly help teach you what you like and what you don't like about these types of games.

The one thing I would knock about the game is not the game design but the relatively cheap materials in this printing. Rio Grande does disappoint here, with cards that aren't black-core stock, paper money, and lack of included bags. The board and all-wooden plane and building (demand) tokens are nice, but the money would be better done as chipboard "bills", and the flimsy cards are just lame. Don't let this dissuade you from buying the game, but if Rio Grande is listening: this is not up to your usual standards and we expect better from your brand.

RATING: 7.5
Three plays, once with three, once with four, and once with five. It's a fun strategy game that provides lots of stuff to think about and do without drowning the players in calculation, and it also provides a good amount of player interaction without ever making things too cutthroat. There appears to be more than one path to victory, based on my limited experience, as in one game the winner was the player who had the most international routes whereas in the other the winner had only one international route but had advanced far on the income track and had made some lucrative late-game connections. 

I'll admit that there are a couple of wobbly aspects to the game, though. First, it's very difficult to evaluate how much planes are worth at auction, since there are a lot of factors involved besides how much immediate return you'll get on them. Second, the labor chit mechanism is pretty uninteresting. I wouldn't say that either of these are big detractions for me, but very picky gamers may find them a turn-off. 

I've played once using the variant whereby all the players receive the same number of event cards, and I thought it worked well. I don't have a strong preference between the two and am fine playing either way.

It's probably slightly better at four or five players rather than three, just because the map will be a little too wide open, but really it's playable at any number.

Me encantaría leer las notas del diseñador de este juego.
Me recuerda mucho a los juegos de trenes de la serie Winsome Games, pero más caótico e interactivo con el resto de los jugadores. 
Después de Sekigahara el nuevo juego de Matt Calkins estaba en seguimiento, hay que ver que nos podía ofrecer y a mi no me ha defraudado.
A diferencia de otros juegos económicos de los que se denominan sin suerte, Tin Goose contiene un alto nivel de incertidumbre, así que amantes del control y de las estrategias calculadas a largo plazo abstenerse de este juego.
La gestión de riesgos es un elemento importante en el juego, no sabes cuanta mierda te va a caer en un momento dado, ser previsor, o pasarse puede ocasionarte perdidas al final de la partida.
Independientemente del caos y el azar, parece que el jugador que se plantea una buena estrategia tiene más posibilidades de ganar.
Un juego muy a tener en cuenta y recomendado si te gustan los juegos económicos más realistas, donde el riesgo y el azar están presentes.
-----
3 partidas y optimista con el juego.
Distintos caminos a la victoria y estrategias diferentes que seguir, alta interacción entre los jugadores.
Es importante generar una estrategia de inversión y gestionar el riesgo por el peligro de tener que adquirir bonos de forma obligatoria.
los eventos pueden imponer un ritmo de partida muy ajustada y un evento bien jugado puede desarmar a tus oponentes o destrozarte y otorgar la partida a otro jugador.
El juego es muy rápido, la duración de la caja hace referencia a la primera partida.
Los resultados no son nada ajustados, hay una gran diferencia de puntos entre unos y otros jugadores y eso es un punto que en este juego en particular me gusta.
porque cuando sabes jugar el juego va volado, lo cual es una ventaja también.

Very open, with great theming and an interesting set of handicaps at the beginning. That said, the game is not as interactive with the other players as I'd like--sure there are lots of auctions, but at the end of the day your fleets seem to look pretty similar; and this reduces some of the competitive tension. Partially asa  result, rather more dry than I'd like.

RATING: 5.5
Neutral - on occasion

Basically "Try to buy a plane, or crash those who buy it."

A risk management game that whose "risk" is players triggering bad events to hurt others. While this direct negative interaction is something that most modern board games try to avoid, I don't mind it and it's fun. And overall players are still making progress, so the main feel is still pretty Euro.

There are parts of the game are seemingly redundant:

(1) the strike cards with blind labor bidding
-- why it's required to gather a resource(labor chip) that is of no use other than strike events? It seems to add nothing but rules to the game. Don't get it. Maybe it can be replaced with the blind bid on cash instead of labor chips.

(2) Oil/Crash duality
-- Oils and crashes, as two different risk sources, are kind of symmetric, but I don't understand why it needs both two.

Maybe I need few more plays to figure out. But now I feel the game structure is not clean enough, and the "meat/rules ratio" is a little low.

The other minor complain is that the rule-book is somewhat vague.

Some fun and interesting concepts here. I'd rate it higher but I think replay value is limited since it's an extremely linear game. And a few minor issues: The mail routes at start should be an open auction instead of blind. That way the routes would go for market value. The first time you play you have no idea what to bid. Ditto for buying planes. In our first game they were going for 10-15, in subsequent games they were selling for 30-45 (especially those with longer range). Remember there can be no plane auction on each player's final card play. That's an easy rule to miss.

You're running an airline company competing with all the other airline companies to build routes throughout the U.S., and with some international flights. When the game starts, you have old, inefficient, dangerous planes, and as time progresses you can upgrade your fleets of planes to more modern, more capable models.

RATING: 7
It looks like a family game set in the developing commercial airline industry of the 1930's and the simple rule set and components support this impression. But once the auctions start, with the strikes, oil shortages and crashes all flushing your hard earned cash down the toilet, you are left having to find creative ways to keep your business expanding that feel nothing like a family game whatsoever. Even for serious economic gamers, however, there may even be a bit too much unpredictability to fully satisfy their needs as well. All of this makes Tin Goose a game in perpetual search of its audience.

That doesn't mean it isn't a good game. As part of set up, players are dealt a hand of 10 cards from 3 eras in quantities of 3, 4, and 3. In the course of the game, players will play 2, 3, and 2 cards from each era respectively, so you know from the very beginning of the game what cards you can play over the course of 7 rounds. Every turn starts with the play of a card, which is either a fleet of planes or a negative event that affects everybody. Fleets are sold off in a once-around auction and events happen immediately. The events cost money and income depending on how much oil your fleets require, how prone to crashes they are, or how many labor chips you have collected to defend against strikes. After playing a card, you get three actions which involve expanding your network or increasing your income or labor chips. You can collect an income at the end of your turn and when you connect to cities that have demand, which is seeded across the board as part of set up. In an original twist, every player starts with 5 negative conditions (do not collect income, oil is expensive, your fleet is more hazardous, and so on) that you can only remove by purchasing new fleets. 

At the end of the game, you get bonuses in cash for having connected to big cities and international destinations. Most cash wins. The game is balancing act between growth and protection against the events. Of course, events are played by the players who have them in hand, so those players have some insight in what to plan for and others can deduce their intent by watching their actions. I can see some frustration in being limited by your initial draw, and the "take that" nature of the events, along with their unpredictability. It won't be to everyone's tastes. That said, there are decent opportunities for planning and good decisions will more often be rewarded. I also discovered there are a couple of fans of the early aircraft industry in my game group, which certainly added to the level of interest around the table. Not a bad game at all, but I'd say it's a game for those with more flexible gaming tastes.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating based on a half-dozen plays thus far (two of which were games played with the game designer and an unfinished prototype several years back).

While there are a plethora of railroad themed games out there (from the very heavy 18xx type games down to the simpler "family" type games like Ticket to Ride and TransAmerica), there is a dearth of really good games that simulate the airline industry and/or airline economics.  Only a few come to mind (Air Baron, JetSet, Airlines Europe and Martin Wallace's Aeroplanes), and in my mind, this new release from award-winning designer Matt Calkins compares quite favorably with all of those.

Three things I look for in a reasonably heavy strategic boardgame are:  (1) streamlined mechanics that go hand-in-hand with a well-developed theme; (2) interesting and meaningful decisions at every step of the way and (3) multiple paths to victory.  Tin Goose fills the bill in all three and, in addition, the game gets extra points for replayability (due to the random setup and card draw, each game is going to play differently) and some unique design features, notably the condition cards which give the players an extra decision to wrestle with when introducing new fleets of planes to their deployable assets.

Some of the interesting decisions include:  how much to focus on issues like safety, avoiding labor unrest and keeping fuel costs low (representing the three negative events sprinkled in each era's deck of cards) versus aggressively bidding for new planes and expanding one's route structure.  There are long-term versus long-term aspects, such as keeping some cash in reserve or taking out bonds to finance future expansions, versus grabbing a lucrative international route or expanding rapidly in the US to beat other players to high-demand markets and push rapidly up the income track which is key to many aspects of the game.  Money management is also a key aspect, because being caught short if penalized by an Oil, Strike or Crash event can be costly in terms of one's overall position in the game.  And this only scratches the surface after just a few plays with the finished product.

Designer Matt Calkins became well known a few years back when he won a Charles Roberts Award for the unique card-driven wargame/Euro Sekigihara, and Tin Goose follows in that same mode, a card-driven game that also features some very unique game design elements and also plays in a reasonable time (two hours or less with experienced players).  

In summary, I highly recommend this game, which IMHO should have gotten the same degree of attention and promotion from the publisher, Rio Grande, as Dominion did a few years back.  For me, it has a tentative rating of an 8; right now, I don't see any way it will go down but can see bumping up to a 9 with more plays.

RATING: 5
There are things I love about this game and things I hate. In the end I think it may be worth trying to salvage with house rules, although I'm not sure when I'll get the chance to experiment. I may even buy it because the good stuff in the game was [b]so[/b] good.

The basic idea is that the players are controlling airline companies during the decades that air travel became an industry. You set up networks of flights, upgrade your fleet, deal with accidents, the cost of fuel, and strikes. There are three eras in the game and in each one you are dealt 3 era-specific cards. You have all 9 of your cards from the start of the game so you can plan accordingly.

On a turn you first play a card, this might be a hazard of some form, in which case all players have to deal with it. Paying money for fuel, or money for unsafe aircraft, or trying to appease the striking workforce. The other type of card is an airplane, in that case the plane is auctioned and the winning player adds it to their fleet. After playing a card you get three action points to spend on a small list of possible actions. 

[b]Auctions:[/b]
There are many types of auctions available to the modern game designer, and many clever twists have appeared over the years. For some reason Tin Goose features the two worst auction mechanisms I'm aware of. 

Once around auction: or my right neighbor gets to the set the price I pay. The planes are auctioned in this manner. You play the card then the player to your left begins the bidding, you get the final bid. This ensures two things 1) the only planes you can guarantee getting are those you put up for auction and 2) if you want a plane your opponents set the price for you. This leads to very volatile plane prices which reflect the money people happen to have on hand more than they reflect anyone's true evaluation of the value of the plane. 

Blind-bid all pay: or are you #$%*ing serious? These auctions crop up during the strikes, players bid union tokens to avoid the detrimental effects of the strike. The player or players who bid the most avoid the pain, all other players suffer, and regardless you all lose the tokens you bid.

[b]Starting tableau:[/b]
This was my favorite part of the game. Each player starts with an identical set of 5 cards in their tableau that have negative effects on them. One makes fuel more expensive, another forces you to use one of your actions for income each round. As you acquire fleets you can cover these up. There are pros and cons to covering each one and that decision is awesome. It stratifies players and offers a fun sense of progression. 

[b]Route building:[/b]
While far from revolutionary, the route building is very well done in the game. Upgrading to better planes allows you freedom in choosing which route to build, and there are incentives to get to certain cities before other players. This also gives a wonderful sense of progression as you expand your network throughout the game. It's also a great source of player interaction.

[b]Lemonade:[/b]
The once around auction is easy to fix, it can be an open auction. If the player starting the auction needs an edge they can be given some kind of discount when they start the auction. Perhaps they pay $2/$4/$6 less in the 1st/2ed/3rd era.

The blind-bid auction is harder to fix because there is an underlying issue; the union tokens are few and easily tracked. It is almost trivial to remember how many tokens each player has. If it were only blind-bid then everyone would bid the full amount they have, or possibly the person with the most would spend the amount of the second most person. It breaks down. I'm not sure what the solution for this is, but I'm sure one could be devised fairly easily. For example: all players suffer less based on the number of tokens they have, then all tokens are lost.

Unfortunately, the game I played had issues and I rate that game a 4. With modifications perhaps it could be a 7 or even an 8. I hope I get to find out.

Tin Goose plays like a game developed ten years ago. Aircraft are auctioned, players develop their network and income, events inflict penalties on them. Players have three actions per turn and a choice of five different actions. Richest player wins. No worker placement or special powers. Economic games by Martin Wallace come to mind. The most similar of them is the wrongly forgotten Aeroplanes although Tin Goose is closer in depth to Steam than Aeroplanes.

Valuating the aircraft in the once-around auction is challenging. Groups will develop their conventions for the right pricing as the different aircraft usually have a similar value for all players. The linchpin of Tin Goose are the events. If players refrain from inflicting them, I can see Tin Goose becoming a boring exercise of growing as fast as possible. When players recognize their potential, a much more interesting weighing up of growth vs. risk comes into play.

Next to the events, the handicaps of the players are an original element. With each new fleet, one of five handicaps can be discarded - a reverse specialization. Tin Goose might be the best plane game, at least the best one that feels like a plane game and not like a plane-themed share game or a wargame.

RATING: 8
The differences in plane size, once-around fleet bidding, and ability to attempt to read information about players' anticipation of events (based on their hands) from their bids really give this fairly easy to grasp game some depth. Fantastic theming, good balance.

4 plays.  Handsome game, and an attractive theme.  Lots of auctions, so if you dislike auctions this isn't the game for you.  But otherwise, there are some merits to this game.

Control of capital is key.  If you don't have enough capital to win any auctions, I urge you to consider issuing some bonds.  Otherwise you may have a miserable game.  But assuming you raise some cash, the bidding is interesting, and you should be able to expand your fleet, at least on your own turns.

This is a game of adversity.  Play this like a wargame - elbows out.

Similar to "Rachel Simmons," "Matt Calkins" is one of the few things you can say to get me to auto-buy a game.  Do read the designer's notes [thread=1528214]here[/thread].

[b]After 3-4 plays, 3-4 player:[/b] interesting, easy enough to teach, want to play more.  In our second game, one guy crushed us by going heavy international, horrific safety, very little income; in the game after that, victory was pretty much tied to how many international boxes you got.  I want to see if there's a way to beat that, because if the game is all about how hard you go international, that will make it somewhat less interesting.  (If it's how hard you go international [i]depending on the mix of events in the game,[/i] that's OK.)

I got this the same day as [gameid=31730], so that's the natural comparison for me (but keep in mind that I've only played each game a handful of times, and finish every game of CE in dead last).  The games are similar in that they both have bidding, route-building, and money-equals-VPs.

Chicago Express:
- much less randomness (the random initial draw in TG really does have a big effect on your game)
- a little easier to teach
- sets up faster
- much shorter playing time
- allegedly goes up to 6 players (although I haven't played with more than 4 yet).

Tin Goose:
- more long-term planning, sort of
- a more predictable pace/ending (as novice CE players, every game has "holy crap, it's almost over!")
- a little bit of blind bidding (some people like that; some don't)

Right now CE is the one I'd slightly rather play: it's had much more mustache-twirling, teeth gnashing, wails of rage, and threats of interpersonal violence.  So far in Tin Goose, no one's threatened to throw another player down a flight of stairs after the game.  I still [i]want[/i] to play Tin Goose, but the edge goes to CE.

Simulation-wise, I'm mildly dubious about what it means to be holding event cards in your hand.  I like hidden information, and being able to plan for bad things you know are coming, but it seems a little strange to me that I alone get to decide whether there's going to be a crash.  I wonder if it would be better if, instead of being dealt 3-4-3 cards, you were dealt 2-3-2: you know the oil event is coming & [i]have[/i] to plan for it, vs. pitching the event because your opponents got rid of their rural stops in time.

[b]Update:[/b] gave away; it was an OK game, but was never getting chosen over Power Grid or Chicago Express.

RATING: 7
It is interesting that this game creates a lot of dialogue after the game ends where people express that they think the first player has a significant advantage and also how if this is so, turn order never changes. Another discussion also usually results concerning the luck of the draw in your hand of cards and bonus bumps on the income track if you have a plane present on that card. Some people also have issue with the disasters and how much of a crimp and/or unpredictability that brings to the game. There aren't many rules in the game really - it is fairly simple but there are also some small things that first time players often miss in the rules explanation (income bumps versus decreases in city presence, one can't do the same action three times in a turn, loan penalty if forced to take one as a non-action in response to a disaster, and a few other items). Sometimes, I've felt that people expect more complexity to the game than actually exists as well - like I mentioned earlier, it is fairly simple - the complexity is in managing your finances in such a way that one doesn't over-expand and lose significant capital in case of disaster expenses. The final round where one may not buy a plane also confuses people. I find the game fascinating and desire to keep playing - we'll see if people in my groups feel the same way.  There is a fair bit of challenge sometimes in deciding if you play a disaster instead of a fleet card (oftentimes, one has a difficult time purchasing a fleet card if one does not play it due to the nature of the once around auction). I do wonder if some of that tension/challenge would be lost if one allowed a typical auction where one keeps going until only one is left. Also, I wonder if our American mentality/culture gets in the way here - on a once around auction, bid what you are willing to pay. If you don't end up winning, then that's fine - you wouldn't have won anyway, right? 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The first play makes me want to come back and play again! I'm really curious to see how the group think works itself out for this game - I can see different groups really playing this one differently. Some may play the nasty events more frequently while others focus more on development. There is a fair bit one can do to prepare for nastiness, but one must also balance preparation for nastiness with pursuit of development and growth. There are several different strategies/avenues for gaining significant points. The once around auctions and the blind bidding in this one doesn't really bother me - it works quite well. However, as in all auction games, it will likely take a game or two to get a handle on what is a good bid in different situations. 

The little wooden planes are quite nice - none of mine were broken but I know others had some issues. I would have used a different color than gray for one of the plane colors as well since the cities (demand markers) are also gray. Paper money is also present and is annoying - I'd switch to poker chips or something of that ilk if possible.

While the "plot" of this game is about the early days of US airlines, it's really about taking and mitigating risk.  The more planes a player owns, the more chance of soaring costs if there's an oil crisis and more chance a crash could affect your reputation (and, more importantly, your ongoing income).  And as players trigger hazards through the play of cards they possess and those hazards impact [i]all[/i] the players, it's a question of if/when to play them to minimize the damage to yourself while maximizing it for your opponents.  I'm not really one who likes "take that" games, but I like that in this one, everyone even the instigator has to take it.

So much randomness. Youve no idea whether you are in a game thats going to have lots of strikes,crashes etc or few yet this is crucial to cash management. Five player is likely to have more of these then a three player yet has less chances to boost you income and cash. And its not even about building an airline network, its about placing disconnected planes overseas.

RATING: 6
An interesting auction and route building game marred by a few things. 

Paper money is a disaster in this game where hiding your available resources is very important. 

Blind bid at the beginning of the game is just an awful idea. Blind bidding for strikes is just an awful idea. Once around bidding for planes doesn't work, in my opinion. 

All of this is fixable. Paper money can be replaced. Having an open auction for airmail routes and open strike auctions might work. 

Open bidding for planes might make the game tedious, but I may try it anyway.

So far reactions to this have been mixed, and I don't mean the table was mixed, I mean every player was mixed. The auctions can vary wildly, and our plays probably haven't exercised the events properly. Still, tense auctions and nice spatial and cardplay decisions.

RATING: 8
Giving this one high marks for the time being. I'm four plays in and this could go up or down depending on successive plays. I find that there's a lot of real tension in the decision points in Tin Goose. Managing money flow and risk take planning and mistakes are often punished rather severely. Much like any highly interactive economic game, a inexperienced or "wildcard" player can throw things off a little, but I say bring on a little chaos. This has so far been a rewarding game exploration with very little in the way of rules overhead. Looking forward to playing some games with a more experienced group. I'm a little unsure of the value of the international destinations but am convinced that the static turn order is not sufficiently advantageous to any one player so long as everyone is play aggressively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on 2 plays at 3p. Solid medium economic Euro with some nice little twists. Could see this being even better at 4 or 5 players.

Edit after more plays:
This seems to be a polarizing game, as I think most people are expecting something much, much heavier from the designer of [thing=25021]Sekigahara[/thing]. It's not really all that heavy, however I do think the game has more lurking under the surface than is first apparent. It's the kind of game that requires multiple plays and also requires the players to really drive the pace and feel of the game by being more aggressive with the auctions and event card play. To me it feels like a more classic/old school euro; simple rules and straightforward mechanisms combined with a bit of a nasty edge. I've quite enjoyed my plays, and I'll happily make this a regular staple as long as I can find people to play it with me. Solid 8.

2 plays, basic rules ([url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/207536/item/4561835#item4561835]here[/url] and [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/207536/item/4563965#item4563965]here[/url])

I kind of like the system but I am not at all crazy about the catastrophe cards! You know what MIGHT be coming, but they might not actually get played -- it depends entirely on what other players do (assuming they actually have a choice; getting one extra card isn't exactly a lot of choice). They end up feeling very random/chaotic. Nor do I love the fact that turn order never changes between rounds: early is nice for board access, but late can make some catastrophes really (painfully) powerful! And finally, that start-of-game blind auction ... is blind auctioning ever a good thing?

Note: it turns out there is a variant setup where everyone gets only 1 event each phase, with the other cards all being planes. I wish that were the basic rules -- might have made initial plays more fun! So I guess I do want to try this one more time ... rating 5 --> 6

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
At the start of the game, there is a random setup with several cities getting 1-4 demand tokens (a few permanent), and an auction to choose starting cities/route goals. Everyone is also dealt a hand of cards, which will be your hand for the entire game. The cards might be catastrophes (e.g. pay $1-3 per fuel icon) or a type of airplane (S/M/L range, 1-3 planes). Everyone starts with the same set of cards on display ("conditions"), each showing a particular reward/problem.

There are 3 phases, and cards correspond to a specific phase; you get one more than needed for each phase. Each round, you'll play one of these cards appropriate to the phase. If it's a plane, the card gets auctioned (card player gets last bid). The winner takes the card and covers one of their setup cards (cancelling the icons covered). You get 3 actions (not all the same) with which you can expand your network (if you have appropriate range planes available), or send a plane to this round's international market (used for endgame VP). If you expand into a city with demand, you earn cash. If you ever need cash, you can take a very expensive emergency loan for $20 now, pay $40 at game end (versus when you use an action to issue a bond, you get the full $40).

1.5 plays > Interesting (if a little dry) game of risk management and valuation. The game was not loved by everyone at the table but provoked more post game discusion than anything else i have played in 2016.  Its not another solitaire optimization game which i like - however i am not sure what I am doing and like that it will need a lot of exploring. It is not a very cuddly because valuations at the beginning of the game appear crucial to not either being left behind.

And only got the rules right on my fourth play (and they are not that difficult).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting and compelling. Nice job handling the theme. Some cool decision trees are presented to the players on their turn (and their opponents' turns with the auction). The variant setup should have been a standard rule.

Brilliant design stroke to have players start with 5 negative cards that can only be covered by acquiring new air fleets - this keeps the game moving and the auctions brisk.

The one-round auction format works great as it keeps play time down and gives an advantage to the current player (as well it should) with the final bid. This really helps level the auction process (though prices will vary, depending on the players themselves!).

What sets Tin Goose apart from other route building game is that it is both offensive (routes) and defensive (events). Managing your cash flow is key. It really takes a full game (or two) to understand the depth that the design offers, and how to best play your hand of cards (10 of them, all of which start in your hand so you can better conduct strategy).

The game is fairly easy to learn (I've had good luck teaching it to others). 

I like this game more and more with each play (there's more here than initially meets the eye), An underrated release, this is one game that should be growing in popularity but I fear too many players will write it off after a single session.

I was interested to read the designer's notes for this one.

There is much that I enjoyed but the game does have some problems. Not least the rules which are critically vague in places. For instance, when auctioning a plane, who gets the money? We assumed the bank but it does not say that! And as it draws on Modern Art bidding, who knows? 

I think it still does have luck. A lot of it in the card deals. If you are holding strikes, oil or crash you have a big advantage. And the pain of those cards is beyond Feld. I had a spectacular turn early on and gained $58. It had gone almost immediately following three take that cards.

The game is oddly paced, chaotic and requires very careful attention to cash flow. Oddly, buying planes is not always a good thing. 

There is a lot of change making. Poker chips advised.

Even so, a nice design if a little dated and needing another year in development.

Love the theme. That all the randomness is in the initial deal doesn't make it a low randomless game. Whether you can actually get synergy by buying planes for cities you are in is very chancy. My first game was rather disaster-free: if a 4p game had 4 disasters in each of the 3 eras, the game would be appalling. I think I need firm card stats before deciding on this game.

Quick notes: auctions are great, but I've yet to figure out if the incentives are bland or subtly interconnected with the actions of the other players. What I find lackluster is the race to extend your network. Players start in separate pockets, and expand quickly into their area, but it seems like the competition for overlap between these pockets is where the heart of the game on the map should be. Instead, it feels like its incidental until the last few turns -- especially with a lower player count.

Just not really my kind of game.

The whole system of starting with several things that hinder you in a big way, and then slowly working to remove those hindrances throughout the game was pretty unique, but not what I would call fun.

The whole card system is also pretty unique, kind of similar to a CDG. You play a card that will usually affect everyone negatively, so you try to get into a position where it will hurt your opponents more than yourself.

The strategy is fairly obtuse and it seems like it will take multiple games to learn to properly evaluate bids during an auction. Those are good things for a lot of people but not what I usually like in a game.

As usual with economic games: it's not bad, but not for me.

Will be acquiring this game soon based on reading the rules and other commentary.  Funny to read some of the complaints here by those who haven't liked the game so far.  Blind bidding or once around bidding - there's a time and place for such rules and they have been a part of several classic game designs, such as Modern Art and Medici.   It's clear to me that there's a reason and inter-connectedness behind every single rule in this game.  Really looking forward to this one.  Nice to see sophisticated originality in Euro game design again rather than the plethora of worker placement games that have dominated the market in the past many years.

Enjoyed this one and would play it more but probably wouldn't buy it. Mix of power grid and airlines Europe with the stock manipulation (only as an end to get income). There is also bidding thrown in and cards which hurt your opponents (as well as yourself). A lot of things going on but fun.

Tin Goose has two things going on- the auction/event prior to each player turn and what you are doing on the board with your actions. The latter is standard Euro fare, with an engaging spatial element and the ability to formulate a long-term plan based on your starting hand of cards- good stuff. The former is what elevates the game to another level: the prevalence of auctions and the events which tend to drain your capital make liquidity a major axis of concern, which in turn informs the auction dynamics. It's not just about the expected ROI on what you are bidding for- you have to consider the opportunity cost in terms of liquidity and how winning an item can expose you to certain events (which in turn might incentivize an opponent to play them). Money in Tin Goose is most definitely a weapon, in a way vaguely reminiscent of Winsome/18xx. The different mechanics are intertwined very well and create some meaty decisions for a game that's relatively short at 90 mins. Recommended.

Manage an airline, buying new planes and extending routes. There is a variant where all players have an equal amount of disaster cards.

"Solid 7" Euro with great card art photos of classic planes.

My go-to introductory economic game... an under-appreciated gem, with tough choices that rewards long-term planning, risk-taking and tactical flexibility.

Tin Goose wasn't engaging until players started blowing up the world with hazards - entirely for fun - despite the fact that the instigators hurt themselves as much as their opponents.  I haven't laughed this hard during a eurogame in years, so kudos to the designer.

There are some neat decision points - particularly which of the five negative starting cards to cover up after each new airplane purchase.  The game might grow on me over time, although if decisions become rote the opposite will occur.

I will say that there is a huge drawback for new players: It isn't at all apparent how to value airplane cards ($10? $50?), and the majority of our auctions were won by the auctioneer by one-upping the final bid. That doesn't seem right.

P.S. I played a prototype years ago and wasn't impressed. Given my semi-positive response, it appears that improvements have been made.  Nice work!

There's more vindictive play in this than I'd prefer, but I really like a lot of the concepts and mechanisms. The plane size to travel distance aspect is really unique, in my experience. I positively love that your small company starts with five "inefficiencies", and you want to get rid of all of them. That miserable choice is wonderful. :)

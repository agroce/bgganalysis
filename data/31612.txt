08+ or 10+, 2-5, best with 2-3 (Ender), 20-30 mins. Blind bidding, bluffing, out-guessing game that works with 2-3. Jewels: 12x white (worth 1 point each), 11x red (2 points each), 10x yellow (3 points each), 9x green (4 points each), and 8x blue (5 points each). Collecting sets earns bonus points. Special rules for 2-player game. Quick, family fun!

Initial rating:   Simple blind bidding game involving gems and numbered cards where you can ruin other player's dreams.  What's not to like?   Plays pretty quickly, and there's certainly a little strategy in what you save your big cards for and how you try to bluff.

Rating an 8 after one play.

I hate hate hate games where you're blind bidding with cards, hoping to outguess the choices that other players will make, and this is possibly the worst offender I've ever played in the genre.

Each turn, some jewels are available for auction, and everyone plays a card to try and win a jewel. One player will get lucky and get a gem all to himself, while the others see who wins the crapshoot.

If you're a fan of this sort of thing, knock yourself out, but I really dislike it.

The kind of filler that reminds me of games like High Society and For Sale and [gameid=175]. Blind bidding and lots of bluffing.  Especially good with 2-3 players.  Great components!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Each player has a deck of cards 1..15 randomly divided into 3 hands. You play one card per turn face down in one of three auctions for a jewel. In a five player game this tends to mean that one jewel is uncontested. There are bonuses for collecting sets of a colour.

I only figured out what Andrew was collecting otherwise it felt like a card management game with some bluffing.

I was surprised that I liked the game enough to rate it a 7.  I can see how a lot of people wouldn't like it, and I certainly didn't talk it up when introducing it.

But if you have a fun group that enjoys dead simple bluffing games, there's some fun to be had.  It's quick enough that the lightness of the game isn't that much of a problem.  Maybe it would be better with 5, as there would be a little more competition for the gems.  With 4 only one player usually went away empty handed.

Very innocuous game. When playiing with older players, I'd play one round with 15 cards (instead of drawing five random cards).  But with kids, the rules as written levels the playing field a bit.  Great FHE game....plays quickly and even the youngest can play.

Je n'avais absolument aucune attente, me fiant à un rang sous le 3000e. Mais l'occasion était trop belle d'enfin donner une chance à Sultan, puisque je jouais avec 4 autres joueurs, dont une enfant de 10 ans et deux personnes pas très "joueurs" (disons-le: mes parents!).

Nous avons tous apprécié le jeu, moi y compris. Assez pour rejouer une deuxième partie!

Certes, il est un peu frustrant de se faire ravir nos joyaux favoris, mais j'aime les éléments de bluff, de mémoire, de persuasion et de déduction de ce jeu.

EDIT: J'ai rejoué une dizaine de parties avec le même groupe, et l'intérêt pour ce jeu ne fait qu'augmenter! J'ai aussi essayer une partie avec un joueur de moins, et je déconseille d'y jouer à 4. J'ai aussi jouer une partie avec un autre groupe, dont deux joueurs habitués, et ils semblent eux-aussi avoir apprécié!  Bref, ma note passe de 6,7 à 7,5 puis à 8!

I've played this a few times now and had fun with it. I think its rating may have suffered for how it was packaged by Queen Games. It's a filler presented in a big game box so people may be surprised when it's so light. Don't Queen have any more suitable box sizes? At one point when I was trying to minimize my shelf space I managed to fit 4 small box games into the empty space in this box.

A passable game I suppose.  Players draw an portion of their cards and hope to beat anyone else that has played on thier targeted gems.  I found this to be only tolerable in that it played quickly, though the fact that you have only a portion of your scale of cards means that no matter what you do, if you compete on a card, you loose.  I found myself wishing we had played something else with similar mechanics like Basari or Raj…   at least those games are more mechanically sound and competitive.
This game feels like a failed attempt to fill a product catalog.

Raj is a really dumb game, but its advantage is that it is super simple and is in and out in 5 minutes, so all the random results are funny and fun.

Sultan lifts the entire game, makes it more random by only giving you 1/3 of your deck at a time, more chaotic by having three simultaneous auctions, and more complicated by having a set collection game thrown on top of it.  

This is the classic case of subtraction by addition.

10 minutes in you realize you could have played 2 better games of Raj. 20 minutes in you realize you could have taken a dump and read the paper. 30 minutes in you are pissed off that this game wasted this much of your life.

Short and simple blind bidding game. The object is to win auctions for different coloured jewels with an ever decreasing number of bidding cards, each of which have a different value. The jewels count as victory points at the end of the game and their value depends on their colour. You're also awarded extra points for having sets of the same colour jewels. There's a bit of bluffing involved with the bidding but there's far too little depth here in comparison to the many other auction games available to make this game particularly memorable. It also becomes repetitive quickly.

I like blind bidding when done right and shiny gems in a game never hurt (Basari, an example of both these features, remains a favorite). Nevertheless, Sultan is a clear miss for me. It's just too simplistic to hold the attention of gamers, although it might work on the family level.

This was a semi-blind purchase, since I'd never heard of the game.  Picked it up on clearance, and only bought it because it was by Queen Games.  After reading up on it I decided it wasn't for me, so I passed it along to Cyberslugg, since he is more likely to get it to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sultan is a simple.  quick.   blind bidding / bluffing gem of a game,  that is as pleasant to play as it is to look at.

To a high degree,  the production serves to cosmetically enhance this game and raises it to another level.  The bright colors of the jewels and the highly functional design of the screens contribute to an overall experience that truly transcends it's somewhat limited design.  Oddly enough,  I prefer playing without the screens,  as the open information lends to juicier decisions and less reliance on memory.

It is a perfect choice for those who enjoy light games with simultaneous action.  While most of the decisions may be tangible,  blind bidding inherently leads to many a surprise. It will never offer a brain burning session,  so if heft is what you seek....seek elsewhere.

However,  I heartily recommend you accept the challenge to collect these gems....and hopefully,  at game's end when the family jewels are all tallied,  you will wind up being the one that more likely resembles a mighty sultan rather than a lowly eunuch.

To be fair with with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31612/sultan]Sultan[/url] I must say we actually played a game we called [b]Khaliffa[/b] a game created by the owner when he read the rules of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31612/sultan]Sultan[/url] completely wrong. The correct rules are:

- The players bid in secret for [u]one[/u] jewel at a time;
- The scoring of the jewels and its bonus are counted only after the final round (the 3rd).

The rules in [b]Khaliffa[/b] are:

- The players bid for a set of 3jewels at a time;
- The scoring happens at the end of each of the three rounds of the game.

The wrong rules gave a totally different flow for the game and, of course, the scores were way higher than they should be. But now the funny thing is: we liked [b]Khaliffa[/b] better. The bids matter more, a good play is more rewarded, and scoring every round, even though in a sense it doesn't matter, because everyone else is also getting more points, gives a feel of accomplishment after a round well played.

A match of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31612/sultan]Sultan[/url] was played afterwards, and I can say it wasn't as much fun.

Anyway, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31612/sultan]Sultan[/url] plays fast (around 30 minutes) and the bits are nicely done. If it isn't as good as [b]Khaliffa[/b], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31612/sultan]Sultan[/url] is a fine game on its own.

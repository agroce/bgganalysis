Unlike any other game in my collection I just couldn't resist this as I love lego.  Ok there is not much to it, but if you enjoy playing with lego you'll have a blast.  Some of the cards are frankly nigh on impossible for me - and I would consider myself a dab hand - let alone an infant.  Thus, the lower score than it may have got.  Oh and you be in hysterics at your friends attempts!

Literally some legos and basic words (think Sun, lion, traffic lights). If you're a fan of legos i'd recommend Not to buy this since you already have more creativity and game pieces than the box offers.

I could see gaming stores having this.

As has been stated, Pictionary using LEGO blocks.  Plays alright with some added house rules (such as giving additional word hints after a minute or two of building).  But ultimately, the LEGO medium while fun to build with can be a bit too hard to actually use.

Actually not great as a game. Lika a cross between pictionary and building lego. But the building lego part is so much fun!

RATING: 5
House rules are a must for Creationary. The rules in the box are almost non-existent and the game will drag on forever if you don't set a time limit for how long players can take to build their objects.

Putting a time limit on each player's turn (~5 minutes seemed to work well for our group) and limiting the number of guesses that can be made before the turn is over work as house rules.

The concept is great, but the execution falls a bit flat. Still, it's a decent warm-up game to get people into gaming mode if you're planning a night of several games.

20 plays:

It's basically Pictionary with Legos. There's no real game here, it's more of an activity where each person takes a card and tries to build the object on the card--or rather, tries to build an object that evokes the object on the card! (Color, and the player moving the object and making sounds, end up being crucial.)

The Legos included aren't really enough, but any home Lego collection will provide plenty of fodder for creations. It's really a pack of cards that you're buying. But the cards are very well chosen and designed. There are three levels of difficulty, so while a young player is building, say, a table, a more experienced Lego builder can be building a chainsaw or a wristwatch (I've had to make both of those!)

A fantastic activity that gets a lot of requests from my kids, and really works the imagination in a way that off-the-shelf Lego kits don't.

The concept is fun, but the execution has some issues.  The cards that come with the game aren't very useful.  It's sometimes hard to tell what it is you're supposed to be building.  I think it would have been better to include some text so the players know what they're supposed to guess.  If you're going to play this, use cards from some other guessing game, like guesstures or pictionary.

Lots of fun, obviously your skill with lego is going to be important, unlike other creative games where you might have a choice between acting, drawing, or singing.  "Game" element is a bit of a stretch, it's really just a good excuse to sit around and play with legos in a semi-guided way.  This is not a bad thing.

I don't know if actual scoring makes this game more or less fun, but pictionary with Lego is great as it is.  Building things isn't as fast as drawing though, so it can get bogged down while the builder tries to figure out how to make a frigging zoo out of 100 pieces on a 6x8 plot of grass.  Needs a few house rules to keep people from yelling out every vehicle they can think of as soon as the builder grabs the wheel pieces.

RATING: 4
This is an example of a game that is more fun in theory than in practice. The components are obviously great (it's Lego!), but the rules are incomplete and ambiguous. You'll need to figure out a way to play it. The trade off is that the game needs a timer to create some tension, but then the Lego models suffer. But if you give people more time to create nicer models, there's no tension in the game. The rules give no way out this problem and I have yet to think of a way to do it. But I suppose if you don't like it, you can always add the pieces to your Lego collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The basic idea is right up my alley - use legos to build objects that people try to guess.  I absolutely LOVE games with a creative element like this.  However, lego cocks up a few bits.  For instance, their scoring mechanism could easily be gamed such that I am disincented to not guess what someone is building if that give them the win and it doesn't for me.  Also, I don't like that they used pictures instead of words.  A) that plants an image in the mind of the builder of what it should look like and B) it doesn't let you know if you've gotten it right (several times we didn't know what the word or phrase for the object in question was, even after looking at the answer).  All in all I like it, but I'd just as soon create my own content and play with my own legos.

Being able to use Lego well is a bit of an art form. Unlike a doodle they take time to build and often the end product doesn't look like what it's supposed to. A drawing may look awful, but at least it's usually quick. This takes time and ends up looking way off.

This game is simply pictionary, except you build with legos instead of draw on paper. It is a blast for EVERYONE that isn't blind.  My retired parents love to play this game.  My friends who are lawyers and doctors love this game. Kids love this game.  My friends who had never touched legos in their life before loved this game.  And in fact, they were better at it than me.  While I looked at the card to determine what I was building, I would immediately imagine where to put a hinge for the tail of a crocodile, what I would use as teeth, what I would use as feet, etc.  My friends who never played with legos in their life do things like grab two 2x8's and wiggle them around together.  And it WORKS, which is part of what makes it so fun.

The only real downside is that you don't actually need the game to play it.  Its a bunch of legos and a bunch of cards with pictures on them.  You can easily grab your own legos or run to the lego store and fill a small bucket for 15 dollars of whatever you want, and write things to draw on slips of paper.  Though if you love lego, I recommend buying to support the company.

Normally I greatly dislike party games, but this one uses Lego, so it's good.  You definitely have to tweak the rules to fit the group you're playing with, but there are lots of options in the rules as written, so this is pretty easy to do.

I recommend only allowing one guess per player if playing with adults.  We tried unlimited guessing and people were getting it just based on the pieces being pulled out of the box!

This is Pictionary with Lego. The rule book suggest that you invent your own rules and that is the best advise in the book. They are not only quite boring (Pictionary hasn't aged well either), but they are in many points hard to understand and ambiguous.

I'm a great fan of LEGO since I was 7 year old and I'm definitely a board game geek, so LEGO board games seemed to be the perfect symbiosis for me.  Unfortunately, the first two LEGO games I've tried are not that good.  

LEGO Creationary has a nice idea: Build things with LEGO bricks, let others guess what you're building.  Unfortunately this doesn't work too well,  Building with LEGO is nothing you can really speed up.  You need you time: think about your design, find the right bricks from a very limited set, try this and that, modify your model etc.  This is great fun when you do it just for yourself but it takes too long in the context of a board game.  The game simply drags. Setting up a time limit however just feels wrong because building with LEGO is something you don't do in a hurry.  Furthermore I found it rather frustating when I try to build something and the neccessary bricks are missing.

All in all I'd rather spend my 35 Euro for a nice LEGO model that to buy this game.  What a pity.

This is a fun little game. But, I tend to like playing Lego Creator with my young kids better. There is an element of tension with the dice rolling that is lacking in this game. But, this game is fun to just build and guess without keeping score. So, they both have their place in my collection.

To me, this is the most disappointing of the Lego games.  In theory, this should've been the best.  It is basically billed as Pictionary with Lego.  What could go wrong?  I remember seeing the little examples on the side of the box and thinking "this will be cool".  There are two fundamental flaws, though.  First, there is barely a game outside of "draw a card and build it".  How many guesses do people get? How do rounds/turns work?  How long do you get?  Do people guess while you are building?  We basically had to make up our own game.  The other problem is one that can plague Pictionary or Cranium as well.  Remember those cool little models in the box?  You won't be making anything like that.  You have to be a master builder to make anything fancy and even they wouldn't ever get that far because people will be throwing out guesses long before you've put on the final touches.  The kids enjoy it, and it is a good way to get them to use creativity with Lego rather than just having them follow instructions.  But as a game?  Serious house-ruling is needed for me to want to even think of playing it.

Not only that, the difficulty level on the cards is not in line with my experience--the level-3 card I got was considerably easier than the level-1 one.  We were playing with Cluzzle rules, so I don't know what it is like with the official rules.  (1 play)

RATING: 5
A much bigger disappointment than I was expecting. Usually vascilates between players guessing wildly and quickly based just on the colors you picked (frog! Gator! Grass! Puke!) To being completely unable to identify the item at all. In either case the whole building part of the game becKkomes irrelevant.

The game has a great amount of components and Legos. The game lacks any solid rules and very lenient on to make it easier for larger groups or families. Some of the card suggestions seem impossible but fun to try. Some more solid house rules may really help.

Pictionary with Legos!

I have never liked to build anything with Legos, so I naturally dislike this game. Since I was a child, I hate (and suck at) drawing, sculpting etc. I recognize it can be a great game with some people but this is as far from my coup of tea as it can be.

I feel  there are some problems with the rules, if you know the category the player is building, you can guess as soon as the player began building, many times the guess is correct, other times, some players have a better view of what he is building so they have a better chance to guess correctly so I feel the game is underdeveloped. I would like the rules to be more clearer. The components are great (obviously).

Bottom line, I will do my best to stay away from this game, I heavily dislike it, but it can be great for other people and/or families.

One of those "why didn't they think of this before" type games. Not being a Lego enthusiast, a lot of the appeal is lost on me. In my mind, speed is more important than creativity, so the slower pace of this game is a definite minus.

I am also very dismayed by Lego customer service. I have tried multiple times to get all the correct pieces for the game and they have failed each time - I doubt I'll ever have all of the pieces that are supposed to come with the game.

RATING: 6
This game was not really for me, but for my husband because he's a huge Lego fan. So, to be fair, my disinterest is partly my own fault - I don't like Legos enough for this to appeal to me in the first place. 

The good news is that the rules are incredibly easy (assuming you understand Pictionary) and this game is easy to get to the table even for casuals (in fact, especially for casuals). The bad news is that just like Pictionary, this game just isn't that fun, especially not when taken at all seriously. (It probably would be better with moderate to significant inebriation and/or substance use, but that's not a good measure of a game imo). 

More specific to this game, it really doesn't come with enough pieces to give a lot of good building options, forcing players to become pretty "creative"/abstract. This is both a pro and con in some ways - it would be really boring to play a game where people try to be really finessed, since that's not really the point. On the other hand, sometimes it's frustrating to not find any pieces that are even remotely useful for the clue you've gotten, and sometimes it means you have to just wait until someone figures it out by process of elimination rather than actually building the clue. 

The difficulty levels are also kind of bizarre - some "easy" clues are actually really difficult to build, while other "difficult" clues are pretty easy. And then some are downright impossible - without knowing about it, would anyone *really* guess the Mars Rover? That card has now become a running joke because of how specific it is. Also, because all the clues are pictures, we sometimes run into the problem of not actually knowing what something is called, or not knowing how specific to be. So it's rather subjective that way. 

Finally, the lack of rules is also kind of a pro and con. It's nice to have a basic game that you can adapt as you see fit (for example, adding a time component or randomizing the difficulty level), but it also means that each game feels rather pointless as scoring is sometimes kind of random. Still working on figuring out a system to make this more than "fun time" and into "actual game".

Pictionary but instead of drawing you build it with legos.  Truly genious.  I don't know why they didn't think of this sooner.  An enjoyable family/party game.  Some of the cards are practically impossible to do and the instruction booklet basically says, "Make your own rules" but that doesn't mean you can't make this fun.  I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind it hitting the table every so often.

RATING: N/A
As far as Lego games goes, this is one of the cooler concepts. However, a serious shortage of cards - particularly for the most difficult category - limits the longevity of this game significantly. Additionally, the lack of text on the cards means there's too much room for interpretation; is "white building" an acceptable answer, or does the player have to say "Taj Mahal"? This game is a cool concept, but I don't think it's been developed to its full potential.

[b]A slightly unusual variation on the "guess the word" pattern. I like it, but there are two problems with it:
1. The words you have to guess are printed in picture form, so there can be discussions on what the word actually is (could be fixed by writing it down before the guessing starts, or by using word cards from a different game).
2. Tere aren't enough building blocks in suitable shapes for some of the more challenging building projects (could easily be fixed with adding extra lego blocks).[/b]

Pictionary with LEGO, which should be enough said if you love LEGO. But building with LEGO is slow, so waiting your turn can take ages. The things to build vary like crazy in difficulty from super easy to near impossible. House-ruling this game seems mandatory; even the rules state so. But hey, it's LEGO, you can build anything. One game we had to guess Pok√©mon! Do what you want! And it's easy to expand upon. It's just LEGO!

It looks simple.  It looks like something to scoff at.  But quite honestly, we've had fun every time we've played this.  We haven't even played it with kids yet.  I wish there were many more cards, as they're starting to become familiar now, but we have well and truly got our money's worth already.  

With 4 players and up we have two people building at the same time.  It takes some of the pressure off the person building, rather than having everyone watch them struggle.  We don't put a timer on them.  If they're still building when it would have next been their turn, they just get skipped over.  It acts as a natural timer without people having to feel stressed out about it.  In practice, this happens very rarely.

I have no trouble recommending this game.  Varying numbers of players. Suits different ages and abilities.  And if you're not worried about scoring (we certainly don't take it too seriously), you can have onlookers join in once they see how much fun is being had.

The rulebook is a total joke and it's best to just ditch that completely. There are also too few cards, and the quality of the questions is very inconsistent. Especially, some of the images are way too specialized and nowhere near being universally recognizable (for example, the Space Needle). 

If you can get past those issues, there's some real fun included: You get quite a decent selection of LEGO pieces and the entire game is about building with LEGO.

Draw a card with a picture on it. Build it using Lego pieces. Others try to guess what you're building to earn points. The problem is that the pictures are real life things, which are odd shaped, circular ... all sorts of things that Lego is really difficult to capture, which turned the whole thing into a guessing competition, adding animation to try and get people guessing along the right lines. The other problem is that if kids are playing, they often didn't know the exact the thing they were trying to replicate (eg mini-moke vs car) which created a new level of difficulty in assessing rightness. On the plus side, it offers different ways to play (teams vs multiple builders vs multiple guessers vs etc) and you get a lot of lego bang for your buck for the kids to, well, just do lego stuff. But the high frustration factor means I'll be leaving the game in the box.

Not enough pieces come with the game.  Good luck trying to create some of the harder objects, such as the Taj Mahal.  Good idea just implemented poorly.

RATING: 6
A cute take on win-lose-draw style games, but doesn't include complete rules (just suggestions as to how you might play, without including key details like time limits and target scores).  Once you get the hang of what pieces are available things get easier -- at first it is often a bit overwhelming even for adults, but that smooths out after a few rounds.

When played as a family coop, it is a good introduction to giving clues, thinking about distinctive details, resisting giving verbal clues, and other game playing basics.  Nothing exciting for veteran gamers, but a good introduction to game concepts for kids.

Nice family game (kids presence is essential). It's possible to easy alternate the rules so everybody has a fun. We've added a lot of pieces to enhance variability.

Probably the best of Lego series to date.

It's Pictionary with Lego!!  I think they're right with the 7 and up marking, as my son, although my children still enjoy trying it under that age-group - they really need to be 7 to build things that are recogniseable though.  I actually find this really frustrating, and would happily get rid of it, but the kids love it!

Si te gusta LEGO te encantara este juego. Con ni√±os y mayores funciona bien.
Lo dif√≠cil es mantener ordenadas todas las piezas.
Las reglas b√°sicas, pues eso, muy b√°sicas xD
Pero el juego se presta a personalizarlo.

Legos!!  hey, even if you don't want the game itself, the parts are at a pretty good price here, i think.

I think having a picture of the thing you are building, made by people who have "Build this in lego" in mind, is a lot different than using pictionary word cards.

I considered it, and the actual value of Creationary is pretty awesome, here.

Not my favorite; the objects seem either ridiculously easy or amazingly difficult, even for adults. Even with a mixed group of 2 children and 6 adults the game moved exceeding slowly and I have a hard time imagining this becoming something that is often played.

After some thought, it was decided to just give my youngest the Lego pieces and ditch the game as she really likes playing with Legos...the game, not so much.

RATING: 2
My son loves legos so I thought this game would be a hit.  There wasn't much creation building going on.  Once we knew what type of item was to built and we saw what color the builder was using...it was easy to guess what the item was. We were able to guess what the person was building way before they were done.  Also, there didn't seem to be a big enough variety of pieces to make what was on the cards.  The storage trey is great for my son to use to store some of his other legos though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pictionary with Legos sounded so fun. However, many of the items just aren't that fun to build, and its often too easy to just get them guess fast with a simple kludgy structure instead of getting to really build things. There's also the issues of often having no idea what the people building are actually supposed to guess just from the pictures (pick whatever you want I suppose, but its often hard to decide) and that you see all the limited number of cards in very short order.

Lego seemed like a good idea for a party game but this didn't work for me. Too slow to find the pieces to build things which massively cut down the sense of excitement and urgency that's important in games like this. Would much rather play rapidough, charades or pictionary so traded away. Could be a good way to spend time with a kid though.

Still reckon there's the potential for a good lego party game, but for me this isn't it.

The rules were bizarrely wide open. But the result was that we did bend the rules to suit our group.
We had the most fun with teams simultaneously building the same object and racing to guess it first.

Played at Essen Spiel 2009. We quit after one round because building was too slow to be fun. 

You draw a card and roll a dice which tell you what you have to build, other players guess. There are variants like all players build, one player guesses etc. Building can be challenging (sledge and dog or a salad with Legos). It just takes too long to pick the Legos out of the box and assemble them while the players watch and start guessing.

I hesitate in calling this a game, although it is fun. We never really keep score of even play the rules as they are written. We mostly just take turns drawing cards, then trying to build/guess the creation. I love Lego, so I have fun with it. Ollie really likes it.

*This has since just become a part of our lego bin, and we threw out the box and the instructions. We still use the cards to build stuff sometimes.

Great drinking game or game for play with kids. Hint: buy an egg timer or use a timer on your phone to add a level or urgency to the game. Also, we play with all the difficulty cards jumbled up in one deck, and then take one point for a correct guess regardless of difficulty.

Like Pictionary with Lego. They could have done with tightening up the rules before publishing, the rulebook basically says "well you could play like this, or like this, or however you choose really, it's up to you..." which isn't very helpful. We had fun on our first play and eventually decided on some rules that work for us.

Lego mit Acticity oder Montagsmaler zu kombinieren war l√§ngst √ºberf√§llig! Es liegen genug Steine bei, um die vorgegebenen Begriffe fantasievoll umzusetzen. Leider aber zu wenige Karten... Man ist zu schnell durch. F√ºr die geniale Idee trotzdem 8 Punkte.

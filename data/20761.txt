A similar concept to Anno Domini except with a geographical background instead of asking for historical dates like the original. The nice thing about this version is that it fixes the one problem that plagues Anno Domini, games sometimes taking far too long because players keep collecting cards.

Decent game, in the vein of Anno Domini, but much easier and without the endlessness issues. Entertaining, but for my mixed groups, it is hardly a good choice. I should try out the Uppsala version instead, I guess.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Geographical Anno Domini (or the similar US game Chronology). In contrast to Anno Domini the player who knows Germany's geography better will win this game. The bluffing element is only given when all players haven't got an idea where to locate the city card. I enjoy it a lot but I'm interested in the topic. Due to covering Germany in detail and many cities or sights that even Germans don't really know this game probably won't appeal to non-Germans. On the other hand the bluffing element then starts to shine again. Buxtehude is enjoyable but I like "Finden Sie Minden" better.

Beautiful game parts--use of the distinctive colours and typefaces for the signs make you think you're traveling on German roads!

I sometimes play with the 37 largest cities (i.e. 200,000+ population) and it's sufficiently challenging for our players who are not from Germany.  I always look forward to playing with my mom or other German ex-pats to see how I fare when using the whole deck.

Very nice game. Anno-Domini style with a twist (2 dimensions). And a bit educational as well. I like it.

Fun game about german geography, but if there are high knowledge difference within the group, some wont stand a chance of winning. Still it is a short and entertaining game.

Rating after browsing. It's Timelines/Anno domini put into geography. Instead of time line, there's 2D coordinates. But there's other things:

1) The burden on proof rests on other people calling your "bluff" (or lack of knowledge) instead of being on the person who plays the card. This introduces psychology to the game which increases replayability, but I think it also makes it too complicated for its own good and too harsh on players who don't have a clue (and they don't).

2) There's no logic to geography. There is logic to history - things make sense if you know historic context. Geography has no context. It's just boring facts and memorisations. 

3) Slovene version is a bit drab. Publish together with weekly catholic newspaper, slovene version consists of 200 locations with churches across our diminutive country. Each card comes with a depiction of a local church and 2 sentences about it. Which means - even if you know Slovenian, it won't help you. It's a game made for those religious maniacs that make it their mission to visit every small parish that exists in our country - and then they need some clear grasp on geography as well. 

What I would do: get a game that deals with the WHOLE WORLD (yes man) and play it Timelines style (start with cards and get rid of them). Especially if locations wouldn't be just cities but other geographical features, landmarks and peculiar sites.

Excellent game if you're not totally lacking knowledge geography. A friend of mine actually designed a USA version which has become my favorite.

Update (09/02/2011):
Florian Koch has made another variant and presented this to me as a wedding gift!
It's called "Ausgerechnet Austerlitz" and the topic is famous (and infamous) battles of world's history.

It's a geography trivia game that takes some mechanics from the Anno Domini series: Sort the cities on either East-West or North-South axis.
There are several editions, this one is for Germany.

Kind of Anno Domini variant. The interesting thing is that the layout is two-dimensional. The boring thing is the theme (and i'm german!)

Definitely a nice game but when a player is good at geographics s/he will likely win anytime - same goes for me with losing :) I can only see myself winning against players that are as bad as I am.
There is no mechanic that dimishs the influence of skill, well maybe some bluffing but that won't help you much against people that know germany.
Nevertheless a great little filler. I would love to play it again and not suck at it.

Just not my cup of religious strife. It was an early game in the whole GMT card-driven gaming system (actually all descendants of the brilliant "We the People" game system by Mark Herman). Sorry God. I sold it.

RATING: 8
I don't know why some geeks here rated this game that low, maybe they haven't understood the rules, ok you can't blame them for that. But the rules are not that complicated and the game is really nice and balanced(!), especially considering that there are few games around dealing with the 30 years war you could compare this one with. As usual GMT provides good components and an after sale support.

RATING: 1
The entire economic system of the game doesn't work sensibly, which makes touchingly poignant those finanacial events that influence it. There is no point I can see in bothering to move and fight, other than to bring the game to an end before the arrival of the Swedes threatens its prolongation. The fighting itself is a bit of a joke since losses are usually unimportant, because recruitment is not part of the economic system, however leader losses are significant, therefore battles are mainly fought to kill leaders. The Wallenstein rule has the desired effect but it gives the impression of second-rate design, and indeed the game ignores Wallenstein's skill in raising money to spend on recruitment. Overall there appears to be a fundamental misapprehension of the difficulty of the task: the war wove matters financial, religious, societal, military, political into an intricate web, whereas the game has a single military strand. I never had much problem with the rules, except that I understood all too clearly that they weren't the product of brilliant design flair. It is this way round: there's nothing actually stupid here, except the decision to publish, rather there's generally aridity in the article of cleverness. I don't believe you can learn anything from playing this, even as a "how-not-to" guide, and that is unusual. I found it actually unpleasant to play, presumably because it won't appeal to anyone except those who mechanically go through the motions of a task without asking themselves why they are doing so.

The card driven mechanism seems to work fairly well in this setting. But you must have the updated rules as the  original rules leave out some very important rules.

RATING: 4
Being interested in the period, I bought it as a preorder. I read the rules, and then I gave a few  tries solitaire. I discovered that some mechanisms described in the rules never apply (like foreign aid), and the armies go on pounding each other to kill leaders. Many events never get played. I really didn't find in the game the Thirty Years War, with all its economic and social implications.

The complexity of the rules aren't a problem to me, but I doubt about game balance. The Catholics starts with a huge advantage, with Bavaria, Austria and Spain on their side. Uprisings can be oppressed quite quickly. And then they build up forces before the Swedes and French comes. But it's not an uninteresting game. And not a bad game after all for such a complicated event as the Thirty Years War.
Furthermore the game has got some nice mechanics, like pillaging, looting and recruiting. But aid adds in my opinion not much value after all. Also the leader loss check is way too random. I also miss depth going game mechanisms like in For the People.

RATING: 7.5
Intersting, challenging and realistic game with beautiful counters and some defects: 
1- I found necessary to underline regions borders for a more readable map
2- It would be better to have a reminder of events happened, not only those small counters
3- Netherlands war is too much abstract and card driven.
Anyway is a game that always deserves time spent playing.

RATING: 9
I have played this game probably 6 times now, handling both the Protestant and Catholic sides, and have found it to be engaging and carefully researched.  The game renewed my interest in the Thirty Years War (30YW), prompting me to obtain and read Peter Wilson's 850-page 2009 history, "The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy," which is a definitive but admittedly exhausting study of that conflict.  I was particularly impressed at the job the game's designers did, given that Wilson's history wasn't available when the game came out.  

The map and components (units and cards) are attractive, and I found the rules generally quite clear, although sometimes it takes a bit of paging around to find where a particular rule is located.  (There is a certain level of complexity in the interaction of the movement and the Leader seniority rules, but it makes sense from a historical standpoint and isn't that hard to grasp if you study the relevant rules passage carefully.)  I have always found the game engrossing and tense: there's enough variation in the CRT that battles, even at a comfortable superiority, can still be a gamble, and you're always on pins and needles after a battle as you roll to find out whether any of your top leaders have been killed, which can upend your well-laid plans in a nanosecond.  Also, the play of the cards can be unpredictable: in the game I played, the Swedes and French didn't enter until 1640, eight and five years respectively after they did historically.  

I do think that it would make more sense if possession of Prague, Briesach, and a few other important cities and fortresses that have no VPs were worth some; some fairly insignificant places (Rottweil) are worth VPs when these aren't, and the Protestant player can actually take Munich and Vienna but get no VPs for them unless he holds a majority of cities in the broader region in which each is located.  But the Protestant side is far from being as hopeless as it may seem in the early going when you have few good leaders.  I find the game to be well-balanced overall.

Good solid card-driven wargame.  Portrays the theme well.  There are some optional setup rules that provide a slightly better game.  While it's not the best game out there in this general style (Paths of Glory and Wilderness War are definitely better), it's well worth the time invested.

RATING: 7
Very good CDG, a bit too long and lacking interactive mechanics other titles have offered like interceptions. Situation is interesting with a lot of choices and options. The early stage of the game has not enough cards I would have like to see more.

Nonetheless enjoyable and not as complicated as some people seem to think.

We should always use the Tournament VC to avoid draws.

RATING: 8
Good game that is easy to learn (for a wargame) and fun to play. I enjoy the pillaging and attrition a big army can generate. Most of the information you need to play the game is on the board...little bookkeeping. Learnt a lot about the 30YW. MUST GET THE LIVING RULES!!!!!

RATING: 10
Truly the thirty years war! Ebb and flow between the high tides of the imperial and the protestant faction, very historical with a lot of possibilities for alternate steps to change the course of history. Wallenstein system is ingenious. Every nation gets it's special rules, but not too much so. Above all, a very playable game system, becoming natural at the latest after turn three. Towards the end of the war, Germany is becoming a true wasteland and every army without foreign aid may suffer from starvation and desertion. Fun, interesting, challenging, informative. Up to now, the best of my cdg's.

After owning it for some time I finally got to play it. As my opponent said doesnt have the edge of the seat stuff of some of its CDG brothers and it is slower paced and more 'chess like'. Having said that the game appears to go in bursts as a critical leader loss can swing momentum backwards and forwards. In the game I played recently ,  Prague changed hands 4 times !. It is underrated I feel .

So many expectations unfulfilled. This game is a beta at best (some rules simply don´t work) and contains quite a few historical mistakes. If you´re a tinkerer with some knowledge about this conflict, you could improve this game considerably (say up to a rating of 7-8). But isn´t this someone else´s job?

I think some of the review of this game here at BGG are a bit too harsh.  The game plays well, the system needs some small tweaking, but all in all a good game.  It does appear to be weighted in favor of the Protestants, but, when you look at history (Sweden and France on their side) it does not seem to be a stretch.  Update 8/2008: FINALLY an outright Catholic Victory! :)  Took long enough and, in all fairness, it was a crazy game with many of the strong leaders being killed after just one battle! :what: :shake:

Significant rules problems plague this promising release from GMT. A game with a lot of potential, but was published at least one playtest cycle too soon. This is always painful, because once it's released it's unlikely to be taken back and done right, especially in light of the fact that this seems to need a lot more than just some tinkering to make it work. We could have had a great game (probably), instead we end up with somthing that hardly really bears mentioning considering how many other good games are out there.

Probably the worst of the CDGs, played 10 games because of the situation. Repeated play of the same card (deck trimming) is really annoying. No Catholic player in his right mind will trigger the second deck before destroying protestants forces and recruiting an host of mercenary.

Very good CDG covering a complex conflict that is extremely difficult to represent in a playable game. TYW succeeds in it. I give it only an "8" for some inconsistencies that were fixed in the living rules but remained in the text of some cards (e.g. Catholic Player's Saxony Switches Sides).

RATING: 7
This game has beautiful components - an attractive map, great counters and quality cards. The game requires some thought and planning. Due to the historical situation it is not immediately obvious as to what is the best plan of action. The rules are not difficult but they are detailed. Several playings are required to get the most enjoyment from this game.

RATING: 10
I don't give out many 10's but have just upped my 9 on this game! Playing this game made me want to read up more on the TYW and that says a lot about it! Having done some of that reading I realize the game deserves that perfect 10. Even the sometimes very a-historical replays I have had (e.g. Wallenstein falls to "leader loss" very early) have nevertheless felt as if the alternate history created by the game was both engaging and plausible! A constant suite of challenging choices and a nice mix of meaningful "chrome" and solid historical fundamentals.

"Europe in Agony" has its problems. The three decks for each side are badly timed so you run out of cards, there is no real reason to pay your troops (just let them pillage) and so on. The exclusive use of outdated, english language books for such a continental topic may also be a problem...
But I'm interested in the period and it's good to see someone develop a game on the 30years War.

This game was a good surprise...
It flows nicely, is well though  and is quite rich (a better game than Wilderness War for example).

Very short on the historic simulation part, comparable to Wilderness War on that aspect.
It has a nice period flavor and definitely pulls you into learning and reading more on this conflict.

Also, there are several variants and house rules developed by the community than could spice this game.

RATING: 7
Good game on a very complex subject that nicely mixes elements from [i]Paths of Glory[/i], [i]Napoleonic Wars[/i] and [i]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/i]. It definitely incorporates its own ideas as well, such as foreign aid, looting and pillaging, all of which can make maintaining an army, or recruiting a new one, a difficult endeavor.

It does have its share of chrome, though given the political complexity of the subject matter, I think it's unavoidable. I don't have a problem with chrome if it's both relevant to the subject matter [b]and[/b], it influences the game in interesting ways, [b]and[/b] it doesn't bog the game down in details ala [i]Clash of Monarchs[/i]. Too many games add chrome for some bit of nitpicky historical accuracy that doesn't really affect the game (or could have been simplified in some way), but here it always felt both important historically and relevant to the actual game play. Remembering which units get free AP in which areas is definitely a bit of a pain, however.

This game has taken some heat as the result of a poor rulebook that shipped with the game. I was fortunate enough to have acquired the game after a much nicer set of living rules was published, and I would encourage people who were initially put off by that to give the game another go. I do recommend playing with the optional supply rule that has the players check supply at the end of their respective turns instead of always at the end of the Catholic player's turn. Otherwise you'll end up with gamey Catholic maneuvers designed solely to cut Protestant units out of supply, a situation I resolved to avoid after my experiences with [i]Paths of Glory[/i], although being out of supply is nowhere near as fatal usually.

I think the other thing that bugs people is the lack of an intercept/withdraw mechanic, but here you either love it or leave it. It feels weird at first, but you adapt. It has the side effect of making solitaire play easier, too. There is some concern about excessive deck thinning and the victory conditions in the Early War scenario, but I have not played it enough to decide if that's a serious issue yet or not.

Anyway, thumbs up for now.

Very good looking components. Similar playing time time to PoG, BtB, etc.
Good, new interesting stuff: The setup, spanish line, Netherlands subgame, entry of new nations, pillage & supply.
Not so good stuff: Quite random battle results and very easy recruiting/reinforcement can bog down the game and up the luck factor. Less tension around needing to play a card one way, but not having the opportunity to. Very high probability of a draw (but this is easily fixed).
Still a good game I enjoy playing, but not as much as H:RvC,PoG,WW,WtP and many other CDGs.

Another game in the &quot;card driven&quot; wargame series, started by &quot;We The People&quot; several years ago. This game depicts the 30 Years War, that began in the early 1600&#039;s and ravaged Europe for three decades. Players take on either the &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Catholic&quot; side. The game is a visual feast, and as it borrows heavily from the mechanics of Path Of Glory, quite fun to play.  Worthwhile, with the living rules off the GMT home page.

This game has problems, which a lot of people have already pointed out: lots of errata, uneven card mix, lacklustre events etc. But the main problem that this game has is that it is boring. Gameplay is basically - activate a big stack of troops and hammer your opponent. and on your opponent's turn, he'll do the same. Rinse, repeat. I also don't get the whole foreign aid thing. There's very little need to get foreign aid. Many troops are automatically paid, and if not, a little pillaging doesn't hurt, as there's very little downside to pillaging. Pillage Recovery is QED, and the few steps lost can be easily replaced.

If this game was a horse, I wouldn't even know where to put the saddle on it.  At start, pretty much everything is wide open and choosing an avenue seemed as confusing to me as this Dutch War business.  I'm certain I made all the mistakes in the book, but then I'm from the "burn yourself first to really learn what not to do" school of gaming.  As such I was crushed utterly in first game.  However, I kept going back to all the possibilities and the subtle strategies and constraints that the game pushes on both players.  I find myself eager to try it again to see how much better I can perform next time.  I think the erratas and fixes are essential to fully enjoy the experience.  Definitely a winner for me.

Strategic, Thirty Years War, 17th century. Card Driven. 

Despite the low rating, this is a game I love. The balance between historical elements and playability is quite accomplished. Perhaps it's not the definitive game about Thirty Years War, but it's quite good, fun and endowed with historic features which make it enjoyable by lovers of the period. 

Here we'll find many wargame elements of course: attack-loss-movement factors, different types of troops, recruitments, sieges, supply, attrition. In addition we have politics, foreign aid, Dutch War track, struggle for electorates, nations changing sides or entering the war... VPs are awarded mainly by taking regions, in an area-control-like system. 

Don't expect a deep simulation, nor a complex game. This is fun with a good dose of historic flavour.

A really wacky CDG.  It is full throttle with units flying around and smashing into one another from the first turn.  Feels a bit fragile as the game could go off the rails with the punishing leader deaths and lack of Early war cards (don't use them all for events!).  I liked my first play of it, but it certainly is not the best designed CDG game ever.  I don't know very much about the period, so I can't comment on the historical accuracy.

Experience with card driven games like Hannibal, Paths of Glory, Napoleonic Wars, make it easy to get into this one.  There are some special rules about nationalities, supply (aka foreign aid) and pillaging/foraging, but a handy player aid covers those nicely.

The "frontless" nature of the conflict makes it so you have guess what you opponent might do when you army is away doing something else.  It is very entertaining.

Leader death can be harsh.

Excellent game, even more better with the optional rules in the official living rules.Balanced game. The catholics are strong at the start and must win before the Protestants become stronger than longer the game gets(Gustav Adolphus and others) though the Catholics are still no push overs. The Protestants have better resources(aid points) vs. better Catholic military forces(at the start anyways).Very very nice game which captures the flavour of the 30 years war and still be historical(along with the potential of changing history).Also a very underrated game and certainly is one of the best CDGs that I have played. Also a very wild game.

Un magnifico juego que no tiene una justa valoracion. Quizas se deba a que al jugador debe interesarle la ambientacion historica para disfrutarlo plenamente.

Es cierto que hay algunos aspectos que no me terminan de convencer, como el escaso aliciente para jugar muchos eventos y las reglas de pago a tropas. Mas grave es el hecho de que el mapa y las reglas permiten destruir ejercitos enteros con relativa facilidad de forma un tanto exagerada (no dejandoles espacios de retirada). Pero en cualquier caso es un excelente wargame.

Es importante descargarse la ultima version de las reglas (en ingles) y algunas erratas adicionales para jugar correctamente.

Fabulous counters and a good map (even though the center of mine is developing a hole in it after only four playings). A bud and I played it twice and kept overlooking rules, which soured me on the game. I also don't like the offering of peace mechanic which just strikes me as, well, gamey. The first phase, Early War, needs more variety; players keep playing the same cards because there are so few in it and so many are of the one-time event variety. The Thirty Years War begs for something along the lines of Here I Stand brought forward into the Seventeenth Century and I will salute the wunderkind that can do it.

OK, this game has taught me:  NEVER LISTEN TO BAD PRESS!!  ALWAYS judge a game for yourself.  The rules are hardly changed between the online version and the one that comes in the box (in fact you don't even need to read the updated ones, they're only minor clarifications, and no rules changes at all)!  I played a solitaire run through, and (unlike PoG, BtB and FtP when I played a solitaire run of them) I actually felt like finishing the whole thing, it was always at a very very interesting board situation, so much so, that I couldn't put it away until I'd finished the scenario.  The foreign aid, supply, payment of units, and recruitment is brilliant IMHO, and make the game flow MUCH better than PoG or BtB (I'm talking system-wise, as they're not really comparable games).  The rules are very easy to pick up, and after about 3 turns I wasn't even looking at them anymore.  I can see great potential with vastly differing strategies in this game, because the situation is SO open!  The card-mechanic also works better in this game than ANY of the other card-drivens I've tried (Tried Hannibal & Sword of Rome now, and I still hold to my comment).  The cards are extremely playable for ALL of the 4 variations of their use, none of them seem to be "must be played this way only" type cards.  The Victory Point system is elegant and the various ways to win are well matched (eg. if the Catholic player uses Wallenstein too much then he has to dismiss him or risk losing the game outright!)  The draw-offer rules, seem to actually DO something for the game, with the ability to have your opponent give up control of areas (and thus victory points) by offering truces, but at the risk of ending an entire turn, or even losing the game to a minor victory (this is different to other games with offered draws, in which I think they detract or do nothing for the game).  All in all NEVER LISTEN TO BAD PRESS!!  UPDATE: Now I have played this numerous times (not just solo) and everything I said holds, in fact I upped my rating too (from 9.1).  If you can't stand your games being draws then use the developers suggestions (or halve the draw result range down the middle and give to the appropriate side)

RATING: 8
Very Good: Strategic - 30 Years War - Easy 

+Very accessible CDG
+Theme
+Components
+Evocative

-Balance maybe in favor of Protestants
-not sure about the foreign aid rules; it could happen that both players do not use cards for foreign aid without severe concequenses; it only triggers pillage and the penalties for pillage -1 markers are neglectible.
-Early cards recycle a lot whereas later cards are not (same issue as with Twilight Struggle).
-IMO the Dutch War does not generate enough points for the Imperial player if an early peace can't be forced. Better send the Spanish pick up points Palatinate and face the Danish and Brunswickers.
Better react to Protestant Dutch War actions.  


I'm surprised about the low rating of such a fabulous game. 
The topic Thirty Years War is not an ordinary one and by many misunderstood. It depicts the chaos of many nations involved bonded by religion or opportunism. This is something the game brilliantly simulates. A true masterpiece on an almost impossible task to accomplish: make a decent game on this topic. The designers more than succeeded in this and came up with one of the best games. If you have interest in the era, it is a must have!

Here lies the problem for a lot of users: misunderstanding. It is not a straight forward topic and here many gamers forget that the Thirty Years War is about the Thirthy Years War with all its chaos and complex alliances etc. What they overlook is a geniusly compact system based on card driven game. If the topic interesrs you, to give the game a second look To all gamers out there with an open mind and interest in the topic. You will not find a better game out there.

Thinking to upgrade my rating but have not had the chance to play it face to face.

RATING: 7
Un juego interesante y complejo. Por dar una idea general, la guerra comienza con un enfrentamiento entre el bando formado por España, Austria, Baviera y Sajonia, contra Bohemia, las Provincias Unidas y Hungría. Poco a poco otros principados alemanes y Dinamarca van uniéndose al conflicto del lado protestante. En una primera fase, las tropas imperiales, de mayor calidad, van haciéndose fuertes y acaparando territorio. Justo cuando la causa parece perdida para el bando protestante, Suecia entra en su socorro inclinando la balanza en sentido contrario. En esta nueva fase el movimiento de tropas es continuo y el territorio queda totalmente devastado.
El resultado final es incierto. Todo depende de cómo se desarrolle la partida, de la capacidad de la alianza austro-bávara para frenar el rodillo sueco y del estado en que se encuentren las tropas españolas al final del juego. 

PROS:
+ Magníficos materiales. Las cartas son de una bella manufactura y resistentes. El mapa es muy bonito. Ningún componente desentona.
+ Visión histórica. El juego está muy conseguido. Una gran simulación del aquel periodo con la posibilidad de alterar la historia. Consigue meter al jugador de lleno en el conflicto. 
+ Engancha, es divertido y dinámico. No hay tiempos muertos, sino que, al contrario, falta tiempo en cada turno para lo que uno quiere hacer. Hay que planificar bien cada jugada, táctica y estratégicamente.
+ Rejugabilidad. No hay un único camino a seguir. Es rico en opciones, por lo que difícilmente dos partidas se conducirán de un mismo modo.
+ Rápido de jugar, al menos para ser un juego de guerra. Con jugadores experimentados cada turno puede llevar 10 minutos, por lo que en 3 horas puede estar resuelta la partida. También da la posibilidad de jugar escenarios.

CONTRAS:
- Las reglas son farragosas, por lo que hay que consultarlas continuamente, al menos en las primeras partidas. Hay cuestiones que, además, no están del todo claras. Recomiendo buscar en bgg la última versión publicada.
- Las cartas pueden jugarse de distintas maneras y una de ellas es como evento. En la parte media y final del juego es difícil que se utilicen de este modo, pues se tiende a emplearlas para reclutar y desplazar ejércitos exclusivamente. Hay una variante propuesta por Laskas que puede resultar interesante en este sentido.
- La guerra hispano-holandesa se trata muy de puntillas y no acaba de tener un encaje acertado en el juego.
- Hay un cierto factor de azar pero, como en la propia vida, es inevitable. 
- El mapa, aunque grande y bien diseñado, se queda un poco escaso para albergar cómodamente todas las fichas que se necesitan.

My rating is based on one solitaire playing, though the impression I got was largely positive.  A couple of reservations, particularly wondering whether mobilizing some factions was ever worthwhile, but I'll chalk that up to my inexperience.  Would like to give it another shot some time.

RATING: 7
One play using the 2009 Living Rules. Thirty Years War succeeds in terms of providing an atmospheric experience, but has some problems as a game. TYW portrays the main features of the war in question through such mechanisms as Pillaging, Leader Deaths and differentiation by type of unit (militia, mercenary, veteran). Meanwhile, the card deck provides an overall narrative while allowing some flexibility over the occurrence of key events. However, even this third edition of the rulebook is poorly written and contains ambiguities and omissions. The variant rules correct some perceived problems with the game, but the question of victory conditions remains unresolved - in the basic rules there is a very wide spread of VPs in which the result is a Draw, while in the variant a Draw is reached with exactly 20 VPs and thus is extremely unlikely. The mechanism for adding the Intervention cards (when the score exceeds 30 VPs) can result in the Catholic player consciously avoiding gaining VPs. The Pillage mechanism creates a lot of work for players considering its modest effect on the game. Overall, I would recommend TYW for anyone interested in 17th century warfare. However, if you are just looking for a good card-driven wargame then I can suggest a number of better alternatives.

TYW is a card-driven game released by GMT, inspired by such games as "We The People" and "Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage". I am not too fond of this game. The rules have some weird quirks, eg. determining victory points when you gain or lose control of provinces. The map artwork isn't to my taste either; quite nice to look at, but not very functional (I never can see which province locations belong in, due to the thin, dotted border lines). The game has lots and lots of errata, which isn't a good sign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a very good game that IMO has unjustly gotten a bad wrap.  Some of this came from some initial confusion with the published rules compounded with by some conflicting answers to questions from the designer and developer.  Some of this came from the lack of interception and evasion rules.  Most of it likely came from expectations that were not met.

I have found, when played with the Living Rules and itsoptional rules in play (except for the Foreign Aid optionals), the game is a hoot and reasonably captures the history of the conflict.  I feel it is one of the most enjoyable to play of the Card Driven Wargames.

RATING: 3
The game Didn't work for me, the armies seem to scamper around Europe with no rhyme nor reason, chasing each other (actually this part is good) and trying to assassinate, via battle, the other leaders (this part isn't).The supply rules seem backwards too, as a stationary army has an easier time supplying it self than the moving army which has to forage after movement in addition to the normal supply phase. Historically armies of that period had to move to find susitainance and when they stopped they suffered.

RATING: 9
A sexy dandy game.  It has all the colours and flavours of the period and features you want from a game, a historical simulation, an intense battles model.  Many strategic options and very very nice action and event cards which drive the game mechanics smoothly and realistically along the complex historic and political line.  Systems and sub-systems are nicely and perfectly integrated.  All the important and tantalizing leaders present and subject to a clever battle loss rating die-roll in which leaders die every now and then from fierce battles and sieges.  Political considerations are also added with Wallenstein's career in the Imperial forces and Spinola's Spanish initiatives in the beginning of the war.  Siege mechanic is simple and yet realistic.  Despite all other comments, I think 30 Years War is THE one that utilize cards to drive a game most beautifully of the card-driven series by GMT.  It is a game that utilize most out of the cards and it plays so fast and true to historical ferocity. I do not know why people would complain about the victory conditions which often end in a draw by both sides because historically both sides lost the war as by 1644, neither side could achieve an outright victory but a devastated Europe with enormous loss of life.  Instead, a cleverly designed early victory conditions would encourage players adopting more than historically aggressive strategy to break the deadlocks and thus end the war as soon as either side can.

If you really play the campaign from the beginning till the end, you really does not have enough markers for the devstation and looted cities.  Some gamers love the game so much that they bought a second copy just to play the campaign game with sufficient markers.  The game, however, has a magic touch on the players with two very useful player aid charts summarising the sequence of play, national effects, pillage and loot results etc. so that players can game with a bliss.  

All in all, this is the best and superlative game on a subject long awaiting for and you can't afford to miss.

For the panning it received in reviews, I though the game played pretty well, and gave a 30 Year War synopsis of main events and historic flavour (which is about all CDGs do).

The more CDGs I play, the more I like 30YW. Starting to seem like best of the genre in that my view of CDGs is that they are strategic "event driven" games where the military force provides the conditions to play political/diplomatic events.

Found a copy- interested in learning more about the era.  Rating based on solo play of Early War scenario.  Looks to be some good stuff in there, but a lot of details in the payment of troops that will slow things a bit.  I don't know the history of this one too well, so am not sure what I should be doing sometimes.

Dec '16:  played two full turns of the three turn Intervention scenario, and have a bit better feel, but hard to play this one solo.  Still tough to see objectives with this board.  Especially keeping track of payments.  Not wuite sure of the severity of the pillaging, either.  Does it really hurt?  Want to try this against an opponent sometime.

After several plays, I found that while not perfect, Thirty Years War is not truly deserving of the heaps of scorn piled upon it by some of the reviewers. That said, the game plays well, has high quality components, an interesting subject and generally good mechanics. On the other hand, the restriction to one move per turn needs changing, the Siege combat rules don't seem to work all that well. I like having separate decks for both players as this tends to balance play (the French, in Wilderness War for example, can suffer tremendously with bad card draws). Second play with Living Rules have improved the game.

Only played the Early war, so this is a very preliminary notice. Enjoyed playing the big picture, but a lot of the smaller design decisions were questionable. Additionally, my opponent refused to pay for his troops, rendering useless almost all my events. Battles were fun, but several times I was attacked by a superior force with superior leadership and managed to barely win the day through no talent of my own. Really would love to see a second edition to this...sad to see so much designer bravery and creativity not realize its proper potential.

You know that's something wrong with a game when the living rules are almost twice as the printed rules in length.

Events are so dull. I guess its a good wargame from a stricter military standpoint by its fans, but with underwhelming political tension or historical appreciation to offer.

I'm a relative newbie to wargames, but I really like the card-driven games. This one was strange, though. No real front to speak of--just a bunch of armies pillaging and looting all over the map. And for the last two turns before the Intervention cards came in I had NOTHING in hand. A bunch of 1 value cards that allowed me to do squat. That was frustrating. 
Overall, I enjoyed Sword of Rome more...but I really appreciated Hans putting up with me.

I had lots of fun with this and it did a good job immersing me into the period. The rules didn't strike me as broken at all. Then again, I'm neither a grognard nor a military historian, just some random guy who likes playing games, so what do I know?

There are some cheesy, gamey strategies that the game unintentionally rewards. For an example, the catholic player can delay the coming of Gustav Adolf by just recruiting troops and sitting around, rather than claiming territory to get victory points and advance the game, if they're way ahead after the early game. I can see why this would bother some people but I'm fine with it.

Unfortunately, Thirty Years War is not well designed. Many cards are lousily constructed, it does not make any sense to ever play them as an event, so why bother thinking about your options?
Furthermore, the recruiting and maintaining of troops doesn't work at all.

Not quite as good as Paths of Glory, though a fascinating adaptation to an interesting period.  Also somewhat simpler if that appeals to you.

A poor game, none of whose mechanisms worked or made any sense.

Lots of errata for this one, but once you get used to that, a very good game. Lots of inconclusive but bloody clashes, as in history.

I agree with Chris Farrell that this was a near miss.Thirty Years War as purchased is unplayable.The victory conditions result in virtually 100% draws between competent players.The card driven system, which even to a crusty old board gamer like me is fantastic, in this case does not provide the wonderful historical background nor provides an adequate drive mechinism.The rules are for the most part clear and those that are not are addressed on Consimworld.The components are fine the map effective.Initially the game seems to "feel" like the period but as you play on gamesmanship causes you to lose that feel.Coonsimworld has provided aforum for devotees which has resulted in a "house rules" version which shows great potential but for those of us who prefer our games finished when purchased then moving on to better titles is the way to go

Good but somewhat scripted CDG. I suspect replayability might suffer.

Clearly released too early.  And why?  Was there some pent-up demand for a 30YW game that couldn't wait another couple of months?  Each card can do four different things but there's little of the tension which what to do with your cards that games like "Paths of Glory" have.  (Incredibly, some view this as a feature rather than a bug.)

This game is the most complex in the card-driven genre of wargames.For me it doesn't have the "feel" of other comparable CDW titles.

Probably the most complex of the card driven games, but then again the thirty years war wasn't that simple of an affair. A very attractive game with a high production value. The map is by far the best point-to-point game system map I've seen.  The counters are of the highest quality and easy to read.  I like the game play, which is fast and easy to learn.  The chrome is in the cards.

Was disappointed with the Early War cards. We cycled through them too much and had a very hard time getting to the Intervention cards. I would say this is the largest issue with this game as the Early war deck is the smallest but can last for half of the game. Not sure I would play this again. I have heard there are varients that improve this game so I may give them a shot.

Not a huge fan of the CDG, but this is about the only strategic game on the subject, aside from Holy Roman Empire, and the better of the 2.

We've just started playing this game and, despite the largely negative comments about it, are really enjoying it.

unplayed, but I've had a blast reading the rules and playing solo.  Once I get more of my pals into this type of game, I look forward to giving it a spin.

Very good game on thirty years war. On my opinion it's also a balanced game. Someone stated that imperials are advantaged because can sweep out protestant from the map befor swedish get in.

Fantastic pieces and parts, great theme! The more I play the more I like it.  The errata and living rules helped.  I got comfortable with the randomness and fate that play a hand.  Makes for a very intriguing game.

Bitterly disappointed by this much-anticipated release. Poorly tested, poorly-written rules, and bad history.

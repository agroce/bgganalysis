RANK: 4080

RATING: 7
Lots to like here, probably the most thematic post-apocalypse board game yet made. The art is particularly good and the compnents are very nicely made.

Main criticisms are:
1. The tone goes awry in a few places, such as the 'amusing' puns in the names of characters and places. Not that there isn't scope for black humour but that's not really what this is.
2. They probably could have streamlined this a lot more. It feels like there are just a few too many subsystems and slightly clunky mechanics. as a result the rulebook is pretty hard to get through.

Waste Knights looks great, component and art wise. Theme is strong and for a fan of post apocalypse can be easily adored. That Great, however...
The game-play is where bad things come up.
Encounter deck is ... how to put it? Random. 
Example: You plan your route, move out of the starting location. Behind the city gate you are ambushed by one of the strongest enemy in the game. 
Options are: 
1. Run (roll a die 9-10 - you get away, 1-8 you get stopped and lose your turn)
2. Face the encounter and get killed and lose your turn. 
A lot of event cards force you to loose your round unless you make a die roll of at least 7+. If you are lucky to get a test on a thing you are good at you get to roll up to 4 dice.
Then there are missions. Most of them are: Go to point A, roll a die, if successful go to point B and roll a die if successful get a reward. Sounds kind of OK, right? No.
Example: 
Turn 1. Plan your route to point A. On the way get an easy encounter card that will not waste your round. Get to point A. Try to pass a test 7+ to get a mission. Fail
Turn 2.  Try again to pass a test 7+ to get a mission. Success.
Turn 3. Plan your route to point B. On the way get a lucky encounter that will allow you to stock up on fuel but you loose you round, or lose your round rolling a die on test 9+ to avoid the encounter. 
Turn 4. Continue your route to point B. Get another easy encounter and get to point B. Try to finish the mission and roll 7+ with 3 dice. Fail 
Turn 5. Mission has expired. Bad Luck mate, missions have 3 turns time out from the moment they get available. 
At this time you are 2 hours into the game, and it is turn 5 of 10. 

To enjoy this game you need to know how to play it well. And even if you know how to play well it is not easy. With all the randomness that happen it is highly probable to have a game where one or two players get to situation where they are not able to achieve anything, and they do not enjoy a single moment.

Game suffers form a feedback loop. Where if you get lucky and get ahead, you will steamroll the game. And if you lose starting items, ammo fuel, then there is no way to get up from that in 10 turn. 
There is just to many situation where your turn gets abruptly ended by a simple die roll. Example. One location on the map is a town where you need to pass a 7+ speech test to interact with it. If you fail the test you lose your turn and achieve nothing. I have never managed to get to that city. 

Highlight of one of my  games:
Turn 1. Get out of the starting space. Got killed in front of the gate.
Turn 2. Got up and went back to the city to recover.
Turn 3. Stayed in the city space, Gambled and got lucky rolling a 7, got a good item (train cart of smokes).
Turn 4. Stayed in the city space, Exchanged (train cart of smokes) for Unique Long Range Sniper Rifle.
Turn 5. Trying to get out of town to get a mission. Stopped in front of the city and killed by a cyborg and never scoring a hit on Unique Long Range Sniper Rifle.
Turn 6. Get up, try to continue to another location. This time got attacked by a dog. Lost the fight again. Again not a sing hit with a Unique Long Range Sniper Rifle.
Other player mercifully got me up and gave me a laser sight mod for my Unique Long Range Sniper Rifle. 
Turn 7. Run out of fuel try to push the car back to the city. Got ambushed by a Crows of people Brotherhood of steel of something. Refusing to roll run test and determined to on shot kill anything with Unique Long Range Sniper Rifle with Laser Sights Mod, got knocked our again not scoring a hit on a crowd of people.
Turn 8. At the end of this turn game ended.

Next game I played was using Sniper character with personal objective to get the same gun again and score at least one hit.
Got the gun, never scored a hit. 
Other highlights that happened that game. Having gun skill at 4 I tried to get a mission in mutant town where you roll 9+ guns test (4 dice) to get a mission or interact with town. Got to the town, tried the test 4 times failed all. Realized that there is no fuel in range of 4 riles away, and my card can give me only ammo. Wasted 6 turns to go back to starting tile. Game ended by table flip.

As frustrating as it is, it leaves me with strong emotions, and ridiculous stories of how unlucky you can get in post-apocalyptic deserts of Australia.
I will play it again and fail miserably. But I will play it.

Very good game. Great art, great theme, solid components. Cool combat system. The game needs an expansion with more encounters and equipment though, but I´m afraid that´s not gonna happen :(
For now my favorite post apocalyptic game!

A heavy sprawling game.  Take the mechanical weight and efficiency of Arkham Horror and blend it with a Mad Max/Fallout style adventure setting and you have Waste Knights.  

The game is very interesting, including its 3 round combat system that is reminiscent of Forbidden Stars.  Very cool and interesting game.  Not as complicated as the large rulebook seems.

The only reason this is on my wishlist is because of the 'STRAYA theme, which is a completely shallow reason to want a game but I don't care. I'd be surprised if I can ever find a copy to play locally before wasting my money away, so I imagine the most likely outcome is that I'll have to buy this blindly and hope for the best.

I am not a big fan of pick up and deliver games, so there's that. I found this one not that original and rather fiddly. The theme was awesome, but that's where good things stop for me. Not enough to make me want to play it.

Oh wow, someone "designed" Runebound with a bunch of extra chrome and a post-apocalyptic theme. 

I radiated palpable suffering during the hour we spent completing a turn. 

Strong pass.

Great adventure game dripping with theme, with outstanding artwork and some innovative ideas (the combat system is very unique and awesome i. e.). The only thing holding it back for now is a lack of expansions and additional missions (a fully cooperative one would be great). Hopefully there's still lots to come, as this gem clearly deserves a successful future.

Upon reading it's name i thought the game would have something to do with recycling.
Glad it's a combination of Mad Max and Fallout but i do like recycling as well.
Looks interesting but i'm concerned about the play length.

Great adventures in post-apocalyptic Australia. Availability of more tasks would increase the number of choices in actions to be done. Miniatures for the player characters will also be welcome for better visibility than the current standees (apparently they are being produced already.).

Waste Knights feels a bit bloated and inelegant. I appreciate some of the mechanisms it tries to employ, like another player controlling how to apply cards to the active player when they are traveling, but in practice it felt a bit awkward and the choices seemed mostly obvious. The quest system also seems like a cool idea, offering incentive to travel to various locations on the map, but again it was a bit clunky and not exactly clear how these quests played out. The battle system is another area that sounds really promising and can be exciting as players maneuver to different distances and choose different approaches, but the rules and tracking all of these elements becomes a bit tedious. The item trading system is awkward (a couple items are placed in opposite cost slots making one more expensive and one less expensive which makes the iconography on the board very confusing and easy to forget). In the end, I think Waste Knights could be a great game if either it was simplified a bit, or you had someone with a great understanding of the rules running the game.

This has all the makings of a game I would enjoy. Great character customization through found items, simple combat and test resolution systems, and a modular board with random encounters. Unfortunately, the game just isn't that fun. It's a touch too fiddly, and the mission-based system wasn't enough to keep me invested in what was going on. It kind of felt like a half-baked Defenders of the Last Stand with a bit of Talisman thrown in. This could have been really good, but unfortunately it doesn't unseat Posthuman as my post apocalypse game of choice.

This score may come up with future plays, but the biggest thing holding this game back is how dense the rulebook is.  Once you play everything feels pretty straight forward, but learning the game is an uphill effort, especially with the lack of runthrough and overview videos out there.  The combat system is still wait and see for me, may end up loving it or hating it.  But, I like the idea of this game and its presentation, so it will get another shot.

Interesting game. I need to play more to solidify rating. 6 rounds seemed too quick in a 2-player game, although it took us a long time to play due to first-time rules issues. I want to play the longer 12-round missions, especially the semi-coop one at the end.

I enjoy the tactical combat of the Waster vs the Player, but not as much as Runebound 3rd Edition.

This game has a lot of potential but desperately needs rules reworking. Everything is just to damn over complicated, the long distance weapons suck and snowball effect may very well ruin the game for rest of the players.

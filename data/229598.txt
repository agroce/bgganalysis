Another unlock series. Want to see, though I wouldn't be adverse to a game.

Printed this out. Not a favourite; some of the puzzles were slightly more obtuse than I prefered, and the opening seemed to dump way too many cards at us at once.

Still worth the price, I guess.

Given issues reading some of the visual clues on the cards for some of the other print and play Unlock games I played with some of the printer settings to see if the images printed any clearer.  (That being said we did have issues with hidden numbers on the professionally printed cards for the Island of Doctor Goorse.

Scenario came in a French magazine as a free gift. This is a very thematic scenario, simulating dungeon crawling and monster fighting and is very good, I place it second in quality to only The Elite (on the free scenarios).

It would have been nice if the new rules for how to work machines had been explained on the cards for this scenario...

The star puzzle was illogigal and felt rushed.

Possibly due to the quality of my PnP version of this demo module but I experienced two major problems. The first was a hidden item in the very early part of the scenario which I couldn't see even after checking the hints. The second problem was right at the end where I couldn't solve the final puzzle even after getting the solution from the hints. Not a demo that I would use to introduce newcomers - I found 5th Avenue to be a much more solid demo. May re-evaluate if I can get a better quality version.

One of the weaker Unlock! demo adventures. There is some good in this but not really up to the standard I have become used to by Unlock!.

RATING: 6
more Unlock is always good, 
it's short but there are some nice tricks

Print 'n' Play. The final puzzle is an interesting take on the typical puzzle fare of the other demos, but it is not enough for this to get a higher rating.

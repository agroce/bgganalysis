RATING: 7
Love the topic, great work incorporating individual ships and personalities into the game, game pieces tend to blend into the map due to color scheme, rules and rulebook not intuitive and terminology not consistent, playbook helpful, after 4 plays it seems a little less of a dicefest than initial impression, may be imbalanced in favor of CSA but fixes for this have been presented

Punched, played a few times, components and box in excellent condition

Our gaming group played the game over the ten times.  Only once did the Union come close to winning the game.  It appears that one would have to use one of the pro-Union optional rules to balance the game.

This game is a lot of fun, much prefer to play the Rebels. History and look of the game is excellent, only problem is that it has not got a mounted board - so will need to buy this when it comes available.

RATING: 7
First Impression: This is a fast paced, "card enhanced" light wargame about naval actions during the American Civil War. Both sides are played very asymmetrically. The Union is concerned about land gains while the Confeds focus on defense and generating VPs from moving cargo. This game has aptly been described as a "roller coaster ride" and the cards/dice can really swing the game within just one or two turns. I would need to play a few more sessions in order to form a more solid opinion.

Theme is interesting and original, but the game felt like a crapshoot game, pretty obvious choices and strategies, a lot of die rolling.

Enjoyed the game and will play again.  Think the amount of die rolling took a bit away from the strategy side.  As the south I got very hot and was able to do very well no matter what the Union did (had an angry Yankee on my hands).  I am not sure how to fix this, but think in a normal game this should happen if one has average die rolling.  
The map, counters etc were all first rate.  Maybe the counters could have used more information printed on them to avoid checking charts etc.

RATING: 6
After one full game as the confederates, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I think the game concept itself is good, the mechanics are basically sound, the cards are kinda cool, and the game does appear to be balanced.

On the other hand, the game is simply too long for what it is. There's a lot of repetition, especially for the Confederate player, both in terms of the actions selected and the amount of dice rolling involved. The die rolling especially can get pretty tedious. To be fair, though, we definitely had some fun with it. Lots of cheering back and forth as blockade runners completed their runs, or raiders scored their VP's. Or not.

I'm also worried about replay value. I don't think you're going to see a lot of variation overall, especially for the Confederates. There just aren't that many choices to make. So, this is a game that I might play two or three more times before I think I hit a hard stop. Even then, I would pretty much insist on the 1862 scenario to bring the game back down to a reasonable playing time.

My friend and I both agreed that this would be more fun as computer game with a computer AI controlling the Confederate side.

2016 - got one play in...2015 or 2014...hope to play it again.  Neat concept and a fun game.  While not too complex, it seemed as if there were just enough different rules to keep track of that the fist go round had more errors than I like, but if played a couple of times it should flow rather easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a rather fun lightweight treatment of the U.S. Civil War.  I enjoy the unique focus shift from the land war to the naval battle.

The game moves along quickly, and the rules are easily absorbed.  It can feel a bit like a dice-fest, but given that the game can be played in about 4 hours or so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

The more I play, the more I warm up to it.  I've returned to this game a few times and it took less than an hour of skimming the rules to be up and running again.

The 1842 start may be more balanced, but the 1841 start is great for learning as there isn't much to do for the first year except build ships and run a few raids.

It's not a card driven game, but each side is given plenty of cards that allow for a wide range of combat and map-altering effects that help give the proceedings some fog-of-war and historical flavor.

I'd give the game a solid recommendation for anyone who wants to play out the civil war from a unique perspective without needing a ton of time or reading a ton of rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game with a combination of cat and mouse blockade simulation and a less tactical inland waterway fight. Not card driven but card modified, which is a nice change.

I like the idea of having the confederacy depend on VPs for builds, I would have liked to see more flexibility for confederates to spend VPs for in game advantage/units, but the are fairly limited by the number builds. Would like to play again. A really good theme for a war game and I think this one pulls it off successfully, although I am not totally blown away it is still a fun time.

Everything I look for in a game.
1) War Between the States.
2) Strategic Level Game.
3) Great Pace of Game.
4) Low Complexity.
5) Favors Confederates. (LOL)
The last one was a joke (sort of) the game does seem to be unbalanced to favor the Confederates you can use the advanced rules to balance it (but still not to historical correctness in my opinion). But other than that this game is a home run.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is fun but flawed.  It takes too much time and is too process intensive to be great for what it is.

The gradual Union shutdown of the Raiders.  The tightening of the Blockade.  The slow and steady increase in Union capabilites.  These are all perfect.  But, the assaults being decided on the whim of a few dice (given how many dice are rolled for medium-sized naval battles), it's just too much.  A couple of bad assaults and missed opportunities and the CSA begins to have enough space and breathing room that they can almost just quit playing (in 1864).  Maybe my opponent just had bad luck with cards and dice, but I feel like it's just too random whether the actual assaults, which are the way the game is won or lost, aren't too slipshod and random.

RATING: 4
Rather disappointed in this game.  GROSSLY unbalanced in favor of the Confederacy.  Victory conditions ridiculous.  Designer must be from the South or just have a fictitious outlook of how successful the Confederacy was in the Civil War.  

We will try it again, but with SUBSTANTIAL changes to the game to make it more of an even chance for either side to win.  And the rules had serious problems.  The "ghost" card of Emancipation Proclamation is a grievous, disheartening, serious flaw on GMTs part!  And the paper map a laughing joke!  C'mon GMT, MAN UP and make a real board for this game!!

RATING: 4
rating based on one F2F and a bit of solitaire play.

played the full 12-turn game and it was a bit long for what it is.  there is also alot of up-hill die-rolling for the Union without a great deal of strategic decisions to be made.

it was fun though, so 6 it is until we try the reduced-length 9 turn game; the setup looks a bit fairer to the Union.

update:  traded after WBC results where 16 out of 18 games were won by the Confederates INCLUDING an optional rule benefitting the Union.  Balance anyone?  Perhaps this can be fixed with even more optional rules, but then you also have the repetitous nature of the game to deal with.

ACW game concentrating on the naval aspects of raiding, blockad running and capturing ports. I found the Union difficult to play, and they have yet to come anywhere near their historical land grabs. Most of the game revolves around getting CSA blockade runners between their ports and the outside world. This earns them VPs, but as their lose any VPs above 50 they are usually converted into extra builds for fortifications and ironclads.

I liked the idea of a civil war game detailing the naval war and abstracting the land war. The confederates gather points by cat and mouse with raiders and blockade runners.  The Union by taking Confederate forts, cities and ports. The Union is stronger but they have more to cover. Die rolls cover the difficulty of searching for ships, and hit points for combat.
The cards generally provide special resources and advantages for attack and defense. Mostly they modify rather than drive the game, adds the uncertainty element to the play.
It has a really good theme and I'm interested in exploring it some more.

I like this game very much: it's one of my favorites. I love the theme and the flow of the game. The game it's not complicated (even though the rule book is not so well organized) and the pace is fast. The basic game seems to be a little bit "CSA-oriented", so the advanced rules are greatly recommended. A game that every Civil War Gamers should have in his collection.

When I saw RR on GMT P500 list I thought it was a neat idea for a CW game focusing on the naval war with the land war abstracted. Sort of the opposite of the majority of CW ones. I had been rooting for it to get published. I thought RR was a light, fun game to play. If one doesn't like a lot of dice rolling, you may not want to get RR since there can be many rolls during play. I would have like to see what (the new) Avalon Hill could have done if they published it. It would have been neat to see the plastic ships used as pieces instead of counters.  When I was playing it I thought of my late wargaming friend Jim, thinking to myself I wish Jim was around to play this, I think he would have like it.

I thought it played fairly fast, enjoyed being introduced to the naval part of the war. Became a little more personal when I found out my Great-great-grandfather's unit, The North Carolina Junior Reserves, were present during the first Battle of Fort Fisher, December, 1864.

RATING: 5
Severely disappointed in this.  This was on the P-500 list for many years, and I was eagerly awaiting it because my favorite wargame is by this designer: Mark McLaughlin's The Napoleonic Wars.

Alas, this is very repetitious with a lot of dice rolling over and over again and is actually a "puzzle" game, meaning once you solve the optimum things to do, it's less interesting.  It's good for a couple of plays (probably rating of 8 for the first two games), but replay value dramatically falls after that to this long-term rating I'm reluctantly forced to give it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unfriendly rulebook which feels like a shotgun blast to the face with all the bullet points - talk about making the simple complex. Good luck trying to figure out Amphibious Assaults.

Lots of theme and flavor, but exceptions and special cases are many. There is no detailed Sequence of Play, and the play aid could be better too. Poor development spoils what otherwise could have been an outstanding game.

First impressions were decidedly mixed, but further play reveals that this is a really fun game if you can muddle your way through.  Good design, well worth the effort to learn properly - but it should have been more accessible.

I actually dislike giving Rebel Raiders a mediocre score, as I very much wanted to like this game and feel as if I'm part of the target audience (Civil War naval buff).

The game as simulation fell completely flat for me, and did not much feel interesting/deep enough to otherwise keep me wanting to pull it out.  It feels like a good deal of shuffling pieces around the same track to no real effect, while the game is decided on the heavily-abstracted and rather simple/straightforward land battles.  

I was probably set up for disappointment in wanting the 1805-type treatment of the naval war along the coast, which this is not.  It suffers, however, from not really providing the game landscape which allows for meaningful decision-making at the level this game operates at... I was hoping to investigate the types of decision trees faced by the Sec-Navy and Naval Board, and this does not really head down that road.

As much "WoW Factor" and excitement as Combat Commander as far as I'm concerned. Another "Heart Thumper" of a game! I just love wargames that can be played in ONE sitting. A must have!

 EDIT: Played today for the first time in quite a while. Spent most of our time flicking through the rules and playbook trying to re-learn the game. Until there is a better version of the rules (Living Rules) my rating has dropped to 7 from 9. It is quite normal to read rules to re-familiarize ones-self with the mechanics, but this was just too onerous. The game is great fun, just don't stay away too long. Original rating June 2013

Once you get through the rulebook and its walls of text, the game is actually not bad.  It's tough -- and fun -- to watch the blockade net slowly tighten around the South, and you get pretty excited when you manage to successfully run through it.  

I'm not quite sure how good the replayability is, but it's probably fine.  The cards help, but I think the overall gameplay is going to feel somewhat the same each time.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  

It's a game I see myself enjoying each time I play so long as I don't play it too often.  Sadly, if I don't play it too often, I'll have to wade through the rulebook rather heavily each time.  That's not too appealing.

IMHO, this game should focus only the Naval war.

The Naval system works very well.  It is really exciting to see how the North's blockade strategy progresses on the map.

But, the Land system doesn't work well.  Just a disappoihntment.

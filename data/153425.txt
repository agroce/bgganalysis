RATING: 8.75
A streamlined (ergo, much better!) version of Starship Catan with gorgeous art by Franz Vohwinkel. Since you have to upgrade your ship through various actions, I think North Wind makes for a great gateway game.

Luck driven? You bet...for the first quarter to third of the game, that is. The first part of the game you should be trying to improve the quality of ship and crew, and exploring all three sea lanes, and the latter is where the luck comes in. But when you've been there a few times, you SHOULD know what's on a particular path, unless you have a really bad memory: not counting the "destination" tile (which each sea route has) there are a mere seven tiles per sea-lane. Once you know that, the game becomes a light strategy affair, in which you need to keep an eye on what cargo (and captured pirates) your opponents are carrying, and know when to abandon fulfilling one contract in favour of another. One also needs to be on the lookout for who stands to be getting the majority at a particular port, since that can lead to unexpected changes in VP status.

I was amused by the comments of one user here, who said, "Starts interesting and then wears thin during the first game." My experience was the direct opposite! I was drawn into the game on account of the theme and components, and was pretty disappointed within fifteen minutes, thinking I had stumbled into a duller, lighter version of Starship Catan. Then, by mid-game, it really began to get interesting!

Negatives? The lack of player interaction: it's all of the you-took-my-spot variety, and choosing an action which benefits one or more of your opponents.

Gegenüber Sternenschiff, Anno 1701, das Kartenspiel, und dem Seefahrt-Modul bei Fürsten von Catan nicht nur nicht innovativ, sondern bloßer Abklatsch, nicht einmal so gut wie etwa Sternenschiff. Komplexität nahezu null. Als einfaches Familienspiel mag es durchgehen, für zwei Spieler relativ uninteressant, weil der Glücksfaktor bei Würfeln zu dominant ist. Wer die Vorläufer alle nicht kennt und ein einfaches Familienspiel sucht, das nicht herausfordert, mag das besser gefallen. Schade, hätte das Spiel gerne gemocht.

A re-imagining of Starship Catan by the same designer, North Wind is a tight pick up and deliver game with a small hint of combat and exploration. Each round you are turning through a certain number of tiles in a stack representing a certain location. In those tiles you can buy & sell cargo, find $$$, fight pirates or deliver your cargo to port in order to score points leading to victory. There are only a few tiles by comparison to other games but part of the strategy is going through these tiles and learning where certain resources and events are and exploiting them to the best of your ability. The components are top-notch including a three dimensional player board that looks like a sailing vessel of yesteryear. Some players may find that 3-d aspect fiddly and they might be right but we certainly enjoy looking at this game on the table because of it.

I don't even want to deny that this game is not for hardcore gamers - high luck factor, reused mechanics etc. as mentioned in other comments.

But it was a hit with my parents and brother - immediate replay requested, which puts it in the range of Ticket to Ride, Bohnanza or Settlers for that playgroup of mine.

Great components, elegant gameplay as to be expected from a Teuber game - you just need to set your expectations correctly in my opinion.

Mooi materiaal: boot, mast, kraaienest.

Probeer zo snel mogelijk je blokjes op het bord te krijgen.
Spelregels vallen best mee, je kan vrij snel van start gaan.

Toevalselement is voor iedereen hetzelfde: welke kaarten zitten in welk pakje (onthouden), en welke komen eruit.  Door mannetje in kraaienest te zetten, en je zeil te verhogen, schakel je die onzekerheid bijna volledig uit.

Let goed op hoeveel blokjes de anderen nog over hebben.  Het kan zeer snel gedaan zijn.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Fun game with a very different push your luck feel.  A lot of neat ideas in this one, but it was probably a little too "gentle".  Being able to pay off the pirates for 1 gold and continue seemed too easy early one.  Later one, it seemed to easy to kill them.  Also not too sure about replayability on this one, but with the 3 stacks being randomized each game, it could make each game feel different enough.  Want to play more, but we'll see what kind of longevity this one has.

Lots of great game elements: 3D player "boards" are ships, press your luck, strategy, little memorization of where things are, and a "following" action mechanic means that you're always paying attention, even when it's not your turn.

End-of-game can be a surprise, but it's never a done deal until the last card is revealed.

Complexity: Easy

A fun competitive game with great component quality.  Picked it up at Strategicon as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. Uses a random event stack that allows you to trade and build up materials to complete missions.  Objective is mission completion to gain influence with ports until you have reached 10 influence overall via mission wins and bonuses.

Cool - this is a multiplayer rebuild of Starship Catan, one of Teuber's best games and one of the most interesting and unique 2-player euro-style games available. The jump to 4 players isn't a total win; in can be a touch slow as you don't have much to do on other players turns, and the game runs maybe a touch longer than you'd like, at least with the full compliment (2 or 3 I'm sure is fine). Still, Starship Catan is such a great game, and wonderfully thematic, that this is a welcome addition to the collection. North Wind cleans up some of the complexity of the original to make a much more streamlined game with very little loss of depth or nuance. The switch to the Caribbean is also well-handled, it's not just a new coat of paint but has some nice touches.

Anyway, Teuber is one of the greats - he isn't as super-reliable as Knizia, sometimes it takes him a few iterations to get a game just right, but he always does interesting and well-drawn games with some depth. Like Starship Catan, I imagine North Wind won't have anything like the same huge replayability level of the main Catan franchise, but still a lot to like.

The production of the game is fantastic. The ships, tiles, goods, etc., are all visually attractive and extremely functional, a rarity in game design where standards of presentation are typically quite low and usability is often sacrificed (bloodily) for ornamentation. Teuber games are usually excellent on this count as well.

[b]Not for gamers![/b] Not even gamers who like light games.

Ok, [i]maybe[/i] for gamers who like memorization. This game uses three stacks of tiles (randomly selected from a single set), but those tiles permanently stay in the three stacks. The stacks are face down, but you run through them over and over, reshuffling after each player's turn (where they go through 4-7 of the tiles). So you're both encouraged and rewarded for memorizing the tiles in each stack. You almost really have to. Which is mind numbingly tedious.

And then even after you've memorized the cards in each stack, when you draw them on your turn, the stack is shuffled, so you still don't know what you're going to get. 

I can't imagine who this is for. When I first saw the pictures, I thought it looked gimmicky. Playing it confirms that first impression.

2014-11-08 : Beneath the incredibly nice looking ships, there's actually a rather good streamlined game - build-up your speed, guns and crew and ferry goods around in an abstracted manner.  You have to really watch what your opponents are doing or will be doing and try to beat them to a goods delivery. Plays fast and the "trade letter" really makes for agonizing decisions you constantly need to make - even in an opponent's turn. I'm upgrading this from a 7 to an 8 after the second play. Third play with a heavy eurogamer group and they liked it as well, so a definite 8

As a game itself, probably 6/10, but great components elevate the rate to 7/10. Nice thing to build a 3D cardboard ship to all the players, in which you can load all the goods and pirates. You could have done the same thing with just a player board or something, but this feels so much better and helps creating the right atmosphere for the game. The actual game-play is very simple. Use your ship to sail to various cities and towns, trade or buy or sell goods of different sorts, then ship those goods to certain cities to make contracts and getting a bit closer of winning the game. Even though game-play is quite simple, it is still compelling and a strong theme helps. The only negative thing about game-play is the moving mechanic, in which you use three piles of tiles to determine where you can move etc. It's really a push your luck -mechanic and at the same time possibly the biggest source for displeasure in this game. Sometimes you really need to get to a certain location, but the tile that lets you to move to that location might be in any of the three different piles. That's easily frustrating if even after several attempts you still haven't found what you are looking for.
All said and done, game is still recommended for all who enjoy nautical merchant theme and doesn't mind that the game is a bit on light side and might have an annoying push-your-luck thing going on. Easy to see that because of neat 3D ships game could be played with children.

A push-your-luck trading game with a few memory elements. You can be massively advantaged by the luck of the tile draw and as the game's a straightforward race to get rid of 10 cubes, luck is the main determinant of the outcome. Oh well, at least it wasn't called Privateers of Catan.

The theme is fairly well pasted on, but the components are stellar! It's almost overproduced for what it is...
  The game has the feel of area control, set collecting and a sort of push your luck thing going on while being very light and fast to play. The tile mechanism makes it pretty random, but being able to upgrade your ship to where you can go thru 7 of tiles in a turn mitigates that in the late game.

Teuber recycles the exploration mechanism from Starship Catan in a ridiculously overproduced multiplayer game stripped down to a family target group.
It is one of the four games selected for the German boardgame championship finals. Accordingly, I went into it with the wrong mindset of playing a competitive game and got disappointed. This is to be played casually. There's a strong starting player advantage, luck is decisive, strategies converge as everybody starts doing a bit of everything opportunistically.
The target group will be flashed by the blown up sailing ships. They are merely a gimmick and easily could have been replaced by a simple player board. But then, how to justify the big box.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Entertaining first play that was at times frustrating with the tile pull - I had three chances to win before I did so despite being able to look at 6 of 8 tiles in the stack. There is a fair bit of luck of the tile draw in this one, but there is some mitigation of the pirates if you build cannons/hire crew, etc. Beautiful looking game with 3D cardboard ships that are craftily built. Happy to play someone else's copy from time to time. It is a race to 8 points; unlike Settlers, when a tie occurs no one earns a point for a majority (IE, longest road/biggest army in Settlers).

Very repetitive kinda memory game. The ships look nice, but are only used to store your resources and crew. So they are only there to make a very simple smaal game look big. But this is a game to forget fast. Mr Teuber, I expected more from you. Although, if Catan were to appear in 2014, I guess it wouldn't have had the success it has had over the last decade.

(funny how much space in the rulebook are reserved for explaining how the ships should be assembled)

RATING: 6.51
Interesting "pirate" game.  Luck based....not strategy based.  Upgrade the cannons, sails, and crew (each new crew member adds a new benefit) on your ship.  Buy goods, capture pirate captains.  Be the first to place all 10 of your cubes (by being the first to reach certain destinations with goods/gold.

Fun family game, but not really a gamer's game.  It gets a little long for what it is....no real meaningful decisions.

[i]I had to practice the game for the German Board Game Championship 2014, which explains my high number of plays. Unfortunately, I liked this game less with every additional play.[/i]

Rather light family game. You basically upgrade your ship and then try to do the shipment runs before your opponents get there first. The die rolls and the tile draw give a lot of randomness to the game and it seems that the starting player has a not-mitigated advantage. There is a nice idea that you can copy actions in your opponents turn with trading certificates. These get awarded for doing less actions in a turn and therefore mitigate at least some bad luck from bad tile draws or pirate encounters. With 4 players there is also a little too much down time (especially because of the constant shuffeling; the game is also so light that you do not have to think much about anything during other players' turns).

The components are very good and I assume that especially children will like how the wooden resources and crewmembers are put on the ship, but in the end they are sheer gimmicks. For families who like only indirect interaction this game is probably well suited; for gaming enthusiasts not so much.

RATING: 7.7
A light fun almost area control game that includes exploration and trading  and delivering goods.  The game is very light on rules and is not to be taken too seriously as luck is high but most of the time it is either push your luck or you have opportunity to enhance your luck.  Fun light game but is at its heart an area control game that a winner can really sneak up on you if you're not paying attention.

Components = awesome. I did not find the ships cumbersome to use as someone else stated. The constant tile shuffling is not fiddly. I do not like fiddly games at all and this did not bother me. It only takes 3 or 4 seconds because you are only shuffling 8 tiles at a time.

I like this game. It actually feels thematic, like you are out exploring and searching for goods and treasure. I like the buying and selling goods to increase cash. Fighting the pirates is fun and upgrading the ship is cool.  I am not a fan of memory games at all but this one didn't bother me.  You only really need to remember where 3 or 4 tiles are (the real important ones) and you will do fine.

Rating based on 2 players. Recommended.

The problem here is that there is nothing to strategically think about or contemplate between turns.  Sure, if you have resources and a parchment tile, you can do something during other player's turns, but there really isn't any sort of opportunity for strategic though between your turns.  You just zone out and disengage from the game completely.  

At the same time, I absolutely love the beautiful setup, and believe that it only adds to the game.  Ultimately, I feel the game's downfalls are completely independent of the presentation.  I hope other games in the future try to implement such a beautiful setup, yet attach a truly strategic and innovative GAME to it.

A very fine family game. Gorgeous components. The memory element may not appeal to many Serious Gamers, but I found it a nice change from The Usual. Really clever idea to make your personal board a 3D model. Manages to be pretty thematic for a cube-pushing Euro. A winner.
Plays very well with two (but drags with four--not recommended!). Also, to speed things up, try this Quick Start variant (much like you get a bit of a start in Catan...): in reverse player order, everyone gets to choose a free Crew Upgrade, and one free basic resource (one of the basic four). Can't choose the same upgrade/resource that another player already took.

The ships are very cool. But that is this games main redeeming quality - the game play is repetitive and far too long for it's weight. Your outcome in this game will be a direct result of your memory of which tiles are in which stack and your luck in turning up the appropriate tiles.

This is a family-friendly version of Starship Catan, that plays up to 4 players instead of 2. Nice, but I prefer Starship Catan. Although the big ships look nice, they are quite cumbersome to operate.

We didn't manage to finish the game, but I did get the impression of what it is. 

Basically it's a bigger [thing=156009][/thing] - sea trading/pirate theme with some press your luck and economic engine. Only it's not as good. 

- More engine building, less press your luck. You need to buy and sell goods to get money, there are more parts of the engine to be upgraded, so the game moves in small increments. Press your luck matters more in the negative way than in positive (it's more about avoiding stuff you don't want then getting something cool in return). As a consequence: 
- It's longer and moves at a slower pace. There's also some fiddlyness with constant need of shuffling a deck of tiles. 
- It tries to do leeching like it was done in Port Royal, but it's not as elegant or interesting and is a bit of a chore. And it's even less interactive. 

I've played it as I hoped Teuber still has it, unfortunately the problem of the design is in being too similar to what other designers are making currently and there not being enough of what made Teuber's games unique. 

Ships are cool, so if this impresses you and you seek for a family type game with cool components and some luck, I would direct you to [thing=153938][/thing] instead. But if you want a sorta piratey theme with kinda engine building check [thing=156009][/thing]. 

Edit: down to one because - uninspired. Why this be printed? Why? Why not just white cardboard?

tl;dr: fine, but too long (with 4 at least)

[person=11][/person] is a fine designer, but let's be honest: it's been a while since he put out a game that stood out. Most of his output consists of variants and retreads of [thing=13][/thing]. So it's good to see that every now and then he does make a non Catan game. I always take notice.
For sure this game is completely overproduced. The custom wood bits could just as well have been cubes and the 3D cardboard ship could just as well have been a simple player mat. It's nice that the publisher made the effort to go this extra mile, but what it comes down to is the game play of course. And I liked it. Flip cards to do actions, upgrade your ship. It all works pretty well.
In one clear reference to Catan the game ends as soon as someone scores 10 points which is indicated by placing cubes on a number of scoring positions. But of course there's nothing wrong with reusing something that works.
The problem was that everyone enjoyed themselves for the first 2/3rds of the game and then it went of for a bit longer. I can see that being less of a problem with 3 players, but I wouldn't recommend this game with 4.

I didn't know anything about this game. They described it as a game where you're a ship captain exploring, trading and fighting off pirates. Then someone said the word Catan and that was almost enough to throw me off of trying this game. Apparently this is a re-implementation of Starship Catan.

In the game you are a captain who is sailing a ship to three different ports. The object of the game is to be the first person to place all of your player cubes on the board. Each port has an objective track where you redeem stuffs (some combination of money, grapes, pineapple, sugar, fish, wood and captured pirates) for the right to put your cube on the board.

North Cape wants mostly money and grapes. Fort Haven wants mostly pirate captains. Olsand wants mostly goods. Additionally, if you have the majority of cubes on a particular port, you can put a cube on that port. If you have at least one cube in each port's objective track you can put another cube on the board.

The way the game plays is that you pick a port. Each port has 8 exploration tiles. One of them is the "Redeem an objective" card for that fort. The other 7 are randomly determined each game. The possible tiles you can see are either action cards or pirates.

At the beginning of the game, when you go to a port, you start flipping over tiles, and can flip over as many as four of them (later in the game you can increase how many tiles you can see). During your exploration you can trigger two action cards, which ends your turn. If you pass on taking an action and flip the next tile, you cannot return to the previous tile and take that action. You continuing flipping tiles until either you take a second action or you hit your exploration limit.

If you don't trigger a second action during your entire turn, you get a commercial letter. Commercial letters can be played during other player's turns to follow an action they take.

The actions that appear on exploration tiles are:

Buy/sell the shown good for 1 buck
Buy/sell the shown good for 3 bucks
(There are copies of those for sugar, pineapples, fish and wood)
Buy/Sell grapes for 2 bucks
Take two gold
Do a merchant action and buy/sell anything for 3 bucks
Upgrade your ship (increase your range, add cannons, hire crew)

The other type of exploration tiles are pirate tiles. You roll a die and get either a gold, 1 pirate, 2 pirates or 3 pirates. If you get pirates then you either, pay a gold to bribe the pirates to go away or you fight them. If you fight them, you roll the attack die for each cannon on your ship. The die has several blanks, several single hits and a special double hit (that you only get if you've hired crew to man your cannons). Winning a pirate bout gives you a captured pirate captain (unless your brig has two already and is full, in which case you get a buck). Fighting pirates doesn't count as an action. If you lose to pirates your turn ends and you don't get a commercial letter, even if you would otherwise qualify for it.

Hiring crew gives you bonuses depending where you place them on your ship. The bonus abilities are:

Sell goods for an extra coin
Get 2 coins when you start a turn without money (as opposed to the normal 1)
Have access to the double shot die face on the cannon die
Use the wildcard trade tiles twice when you use them
Flip over and take/reject the first tile when exploring

So what did I think of the game? The massively overproduced ships were kind of cool, but totally not needed. The game is very pretty overall. There were a lot of interesting ideas in the game. Ultimately though, the game had too many flaws for me.

First and foremost, it was really random. The tile draws can screw you. You might desperately be racing to fill the next objective in a particular port (each objective varies from the previous one and they get progressively harder generally) and just not get the tile that lets you complete an objective. The next player can steal the objective away from you... which might leave you with the wrong stuff for future objectives. Tile draws can be mitigated by increasing your explore distance though.

The distribution of the 7 tiles for each port is random as well. In our game, 3 of the 4 pirates were at Fort Haven... the place that wants captured pirates. That greatly benefitted the player who went heavy into pirate hunting.

And pirates are just random in general. I lost 3 pirate battles... two of them in which I had three cannons and the doubleshot ability. And that's just random dice luck. Losing to pirates means you lose the rest of your turn... which is horrible in a race game.

Additionally, I'm not sure the game is balanced for all play styles. It seems as though pirate hunting has an advantage. They're more likely to try and fight pirates, which doesn't count as an action. So they can be competitive towards board objectives (the ones that require pirate captains) by doing something that doesn't take up one of their two actions. Which either means they get to do 3 things (fight pirates and get a captive, and 2 actions) or they do 2 things (fight pirates/get captive and 1 action) and get a commerical letter (which is effectively a third action, just on someone else's turn). Maybe this wouldn't have been as much of an issue if our pirates hadn't been clumped at Fort Haven.

Overall it was okay. It was interesting. I liked it a bit. I just don't think I really need to play it again.

The really nice ships and fantastic wooden components cannot save this mediocre game. Gameplay is just really, really bland. It plays well enough, but it does not have what it takes to feel the least bit involved. The main mechanic (choosing a pile of action tiles each turn) is not new, and has been used to much better effect in Starship Catan. I really like that game, but this is one that I do not need to play again.

Very light game about sea voyage. Great components though a bit abstract. I always roll bad result when playing this kind of game (oh I see you Rum & Pirates).
It's a racing game, which is not my favorite but I think we can put a variant for point scoring after the game ends.

I first played this at a gaming convention a couple of months ago, and was pleasantly surprised. It was made by Klaus Teuber, who also designed Catan. The game itself it just as light but it has miniature boats and nicely carved wooden chips. Sometimes, a game just speaks to you. That's what this game did to me. And even though the rating here on BGG is pretty low, I'm still glad I own it.

Family pick up and deliver on the pirate infested high seas using 3-d cardboard ships with stepped masts. Fill the fiddly crew and cargo spots in a race to explore action, event, and charted island tiles to unlock ship upgrades and gold. I would like more variety of explore tiles. I like the shared action mechanic using the Governor's letter.

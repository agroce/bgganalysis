Management and building game where you have to build the railway network in Japan self-financing the works with the freight done.

     This is one of my favorite of the crayon games.  I've played it with three others, and it plays well.  It tends to end sooner than other games of this genre due to the huge payouts.  I would give it a ten, except for the geography problem, though this is somewhat mitigated by player aids.

Crayon game. Nippon Rails is one of the best two player  euro games I've played. The board is sized well so that you might need to rent track from the other player in the 2-player version simply from being blocked in. Islands tend to have two paths leading in/out. I have yet to play a 3 or 4 player game, but I imagine it being quite cluttered and frustrating for 4 people to play on such a small map.

RATING: 2
Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

Tubular storage unit.  As a result the board and players aids are warped but very playable.  No demand cards to stack or deal.  The players aids have 100 printed demand cards selected by rolling 2 ten sided dice.  No true loco cards unless you want to completely destroy the rule book. Still playable just needs some self improvement.

Nipponなので日本語で。
４人プレイでは、勝利条件成立がかなり厳しくなるため、
３人プレイが限界だと思います。
というのも、SapporoとFukuokaを結ぶルート取りがかなり限られているからです。

あと、Sapporo,Tokyo,Osaka,Fukuokaの大きさは同じでいいと思います。
Kobe、Kyoto、YokohamaをMediumCityで独立させて、生産物も分散させ、
一部のMediumCityもSmallCityで良かったのではないでしょうか？

北海道はRumoiではなく、Otaruをおき、
OtaruとFukuiから２マイルポスト話した所に港（Tsuruga）をおいて
Ferryを通し、北海道への乗り入れルートの確保を追加してはどうでしょうか？

同様に、名古屋（nagoya）から高知(kochi）経由、鹿児島（kagoshima）行の
ferryルートを追加して、九州の南から入る事のできるルートがあれば
４人プレイでもバランスのとれたものになると思います。

All of my crayon rail games are gone now - victims of my complete lack of interest in drawing lines on a map for 3  hours and yet be totally subject to the roll of the dice & the turn of a friendly card.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The single-axis geography of the Japanese islands makes track-building decisions less interesting compared to the other games in the series.  Since everyone will build more or less the same long, linear track, the game is won or lost on the luck of the cards.  Sometimes there are some interesting timing decisions, but often the cards leave you with no real choices.  Of the Empire Builder games that I've played, this is the weakest by a significant margin (I've played all but Australian and Lunar).

This is the weakest of the Empire rail games that I have.

This is a perfect setting for a three-player crayon rail game. Japan is cramped enough that cut-throat is enjoyable, and it seems the contracts are much more lucrative than Euro Rails or Empire Builder. Thus, the cash comes in quickly, making for a fast and fluid game. It may be too tight for four, and too open for two. More plays will tell. The features are essentially the same as Euro Rails, as there is a "chunnel" connecting Honshu and Hokkaido, plus alpine dots. My rating is a solid '8'. As with all the Empire Builder series, geography is a matter of personal preference.

Update (04/22/12) 3 plays: This is quickly becoming my favorite, when there are two or three players who want to scratch the crayon rail itch. It is relatively easier to fulfill the middle to high end of two out of the three initial contracts, when compared to the others in the Empire Builder series. This is both good and bad. Good that the game gets going much faster, and can be finished within roughly two hours. Bad that the initial "struggle" is missing, which is prevalent in the original Empire Builder or Euro Rails. In those, the contracts are tougher to complete. Perhaps the starting cash should be cut back by $10 to $50? $60 seems too easy.

I've been curious about Nippon Rails for a while. I love the crayon rails, but it seemed to me that Japan would be an extremely challenging map--it's all mountains and islands!  I mostly play crayon rails with two, and that's how I played this one. With two, it's a pretty fun map. It's quite small, so it plays quickly, and there is a clear trade off between making the efficient  little loop in the south (east?) to get lots of quick deliveries, or making a larger loop and going for the really valuable ones. Of course, this is the tradeoff in every crayon rail, but it's really obvious in this one, so that's nice.  It's also nice that it's so quick. But it is a really small map, and island-hopping gets pretty expensive.  I can imagine playing with three, but it'd be tough.  The existence of a 5-6 player variant in the rules makes me shake my head.  People who want to play Nippon Rails with six, you are just being silly.  (1 play)

Met some "hardcore" train gamers at a convention once. Decided to try out some crayon rail games, and I liked the concept so much I had to go and buy one for myself. Being an inexpensive option (found one for cheap on ebay), and supposedly good for low numbers of players, I picked up the Japanese map in the form of Nippon Rails. Sure, I have no idea how to pronounce most of the city names, or where they are in the country, but I'm learning my Japanese geography fast. Only played once in a two-player game, but the map seems to be nicely made so far. On one hand, it's pretty basic, with track from one end of the island chain to the other being ideal. On the other hand, it's also quite competitive, with a lot of choke points. I like easy yet competitive games, so there you go. A good addition to the Empire Builder series, in my opinion. Plus it comes in a tube, which is better then boxes, also in my opinion.

My current favorite Mayfair rails game, but with the following caveats: I just bought it, and I've played Empire builder, Euro Rails, and Iron Dragon to death, so it has novelty.  I'm enjoying learning Japan's geography, so hunting the locations isn't tedious.  I usually play 2-player with my wife, so the tight  paths makes for a good game - but I can see how the same paths might show up game after game, making it a bit repetetive, and difficult for 4-player.

A good Empire Builder version for 2, maybe 3 players, looking for a slighly shorter game with more competition for space than most maps.

Another awesome crayon rails! I really am so glad they updated this game with a nice board, color chips (no stickers), and color cards. The game play is actually pretty fast. The pay outs for making deliveries seem a little higher than usual, but this makes for faster playing games. The tight Japan map is great for forcing players to use each others routes. My wife and I seem to play crayon rails on Sunday nights. It just seems to be the perfect fit for us.

And finally such a high quality and beautiful production of this old game is a wonderful tribute to the victims of the 2011 earthquake in Japan.

As expected, all of the mountains and water in Japan makes this a very tough map; often there's only one good way to get an entire section of the map.  It seems like the game tries to make up for this by having some incredibly large payouts, but in actuality that just makes it kind of swingy.  Personally, I wouldn't play this with more than two, because the third person is going to get screwed.  Playing with 3 is at least imaginable though--more than that would be completely ridiculous.

Not a bad game (probably my favorite of the "Crayon Rails" line), but the cheesy components cut down on the "fun factor" quite a bit.  I am not a fan of "fiddly bits", and this game has more than its share.

The enjoyment of this crayon rail game is limited by the extremely congested terrain. This can be a nice challenge, but creates too many headaches for more than 2-3 players

Great game for two players. Plays much quicker than other crayon rail games. Map is interesting. I think 3 player would be interesting, but one player may end up getting screwed and that may not be any fun.

This crayon game is my favorite for TWO players. The building area is narrow and creates much conflict for the best routes.

Gameplay is the same as with other rail games, but the board is Extremely tight.  If you like the crayon rail games for their lack of interaction, this one might not be for you.

Certainly the most difficult of the crayon rail games.  The terrain is unforgiving and extremely tight.  Very hard and expensive to move.  Plus, the land and names are completely foreign to most people.  A great challenge and a good game.

Best expansion - Pewter trains to replace the markers.

Best extra/variant - Poker chips to replace the money.

This is the best two player map of the series. However the Japanese landscape is unfamiliar so is hardest and slowest to play.

To me, this has the most challenging geography for two player.  There are places that are highly competitive for the best routes.  Someday, I would like to play this with 3, but it looks as though it would get really nasty, really fast.  I have a hard time getting my wife to play this one because all of the names are so unfamiliar and the terrain is so difficult. [8]
------------------------------------------
All of the above actually still applies.  I have played this with more than two on several occasions, which is indeed a challenge.  We still have trouble with the placenames.  Like Australian Rails, this one also seems to have problems with luck of the draw with the high payouts.  The narrow islands only serve to emphasize this because you are always going in the direction of a big payout or you will be soon.  Still, it is pleasant enough to play from time to time.

I like this map. It's the best of the Mayfair games series for 3 players that I've played. It's an interesting game. I'm not sure why people vote for it less than the other crayon rail games. I like it more than some of the others!

played it once. Sort of: I got myself into a position where it looked like it was hopeless (no money, not enough track, ...) so conceded the game. This was VERY early. Not much fun, although I guess I'd like to try this again. Is it too difficult, or do I just suck at these? Or both?

I love all the crayon rail games I've tried and, while Nippon is not my favorite, it's still a great way to spend a couple hours.  The geography was killer for me.  After playing I at least now have an idea where many places are on the map.  I do agree with some other reviews that each player ends up with similar tracks by the end, although where to build first and last can differ and still prove quite challenging and interesting.  The map is small enough that afetr a couple plays, my lack of geographic knowwledge would be an afterthought.  I still think the most difficult crayone rail game by far is Lunar Rails, but I haven't played them all yet, including Iron Dragon.

An excellent game in the Empire Builder crayon rail series, with a perfect map for a smaller number of players. While the trains move a little slower, the map is smaller and the payouts are giant, which means the game is constantly progressing and doesn't overstay its welcome. You'll reach the money goal not long after you've finished your network.

Of all the Mayfair rail games that I've played, this is my least favorite.  Part of that may be my unfamiliarity with Japanese geography--most of my time seems to be spent try to find cities on the map.  Also the shape of the islands and the distribution of cities makes everyone's track layout look pretty much the same every game--one's track layout is dictated less by the demand cards and more by the map itself, which makes for less variation and a less interesting game.

If it weren't for the usual barriers to Empire Builder games--learning where the cities and commodities are--this would be the perfect entry level EB game as the track structure needed is a simple north-south mainline.

Slightly inferior to Empire Builder, the saving grace of this game is if you want to learn Japanese geography (like I do).

RATING: N/A
Maybe the most unforgiving of the Empire Builder gameboards.  Over four players would definitely be a harsh game.  Once you connect the northern and southern ends of the board it only takes a couple of runs back and forth to finish.

I had the old tube version.  Components weren't as nice as other versions, but the map was very good.  Especially for two.  Gave me a new appreciation for japan's geography.

Now I have the new version with the colored chips.  I think it's great.  Love it!

If most people looked at my Top 100 games of all time, this would be the 1 game they would scratch their head about. This is an old time solitaire game that was included in Ares Magazine back in the 80's. This just blew me away when I first played it back in my teenage years so I knew I had to copy eventually. This has paragraph resolution as you explore planets and have adventures. You need to track (by pencil and paper) each crew member's stats. I don't mind! I also really like how you load up before each expedition after you land on a planet and see what the environment is. Solo players, try to find this, you won't be disappointed!

Fantastically innovative little game. 
But, the keyword is little. I love this
thing, but there're so few paragraphs that
even in a single 30 month game, you tend to
get most of what there is out of it. 

Pity it was never expanded. I think the
concept is one of the best to which the
paragraph system was ever put.

Amazing sci-fi adventures with a bunch of counters and a story book to follow randomly. It has the simple and spooky feel of a tv serial, like Stingray or Star Trek. The perfect solo game. I played it really a lot and loved it.

Enjoyed a few plays at the time of its release.  Wouldn't have played it now for 15 years or more.  Quite a different gaming experience, perhaps the paragragh event mechanic got side-tracked into all those choose-your-own adventure books..

Succeeds wonderfully well in capturing the space exploration theme while providing good tension and a good challenge.  As a paragraph system, replayability is not indefinite -- this is what keeps my rating from being higher.  Until D-Day: Omaha Beach came out it was my favorite John Butterfield design.

RATING: 9.5
The most brilliant solitaire design ever - and in a sci-fi mag game of all places! Concise, compact, and yet with replayability (almost) as infinite as the universe itself. I am tough on games - this praise is not an exageration. Strategic and operational planning on constantly changing environments; tough tactical movement and combat decisions; exploration of the unknown; discovery of ancient artifacts. Depending on time you can play the short, average or long games. And it's no push-over light weight, it is a challenge to win. What's NOT to like? All this in what is essentially an interstellar zoological expedition. I never give any game a 10, but I was sorely tempted... Pay WHATEVER price you need to on eBay - just get it!

I like this game. It seems like a good candidate for replaying, as I've barely scratched the surface of the number of planets and creatures. I had a lot of bad luck on this voyage, so I hope to do better next time. You have lots of choices to make about equipment and personnel, and there is also a lot of luck, but it balances pretty well. Make a note of which paragraph you get when you first visit each planet. That way, when you play again, if you visit that planet you can choose a different paragraph, thus having different gravity, atmosphere, etc., and probably encountering different creatures. The roll is supposed to be random, but I think this is a good way to improve enjoyment of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In the beginning, it is interesting but the paragraph system hides the real goodies so deep that you need too many playings to get the the "interesting events".  Since you need these events to be rare, they are low probability.  Because of this you can play for a long time only collecting "insects and mice".  Would work better with a disposable chit system that would prevent redundant events.  Chits would map to matrix that maps to equal "level" of events.  Another feature that would improve the game would be a variation on the early, mid, late decks seen in CDG games where each planet visited would add additional chits to the draw pool.

I enjoyed my first play. It took a long time to play since I was constantly referencing the rules. After playing I decided I want to improve a few things before playing again.

:d6-1: The map needs to be bigger. The hexes are just too small.
:d6-2: Along the same lines, the planetary attribute track needs to be bigger. It's not useful as the markers don't fit on there.
:d6-3: The rules are pretty well written but some points were not clear to me after reading and took play experience and constant referencing in the rules to understand.

To address those complaints, I am enlarging the environ maps to one map per page and including environ specific information next to the map. I'm also redesigning the planetary attribute track and time and supply track. I'll upload them once completed.

I think this is quite fun and am optimistic this will provide more replayability than I anticipated. It can create a very interesting narrative. However, the game is so random that your planning decisions will have some, though not much tactical effect. Since you can't predict the encounters that will happen, success will depend largely on how close your choices were to the actual random events that occurred. It's kind of like playing the lottery.

Finally played after all these years!  At first the rules are intimidating, as I imagined reading them that a lot of bookkeeping was necessary. 
After a first play, I must instead say that I found it very enjoyable,  as the history of your expedition developes on the table and in your imagination. 
Probably not very fit for instant gratification fans.

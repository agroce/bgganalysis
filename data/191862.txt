RATING: 6
2 plays / 4 players

LIKE: Good interaction and possibilities to play mean (in a fun spirited way), by choosing where a boat docks. Being mean doesn't really cause major problems. Nice chunky blocks.

DISLIKE: A little dry. The blocks can occasionally block some player's vision from seeing which blocks are where. The blocks could use some brighter colors to jazz it up.

OVERALL: I liked it, but I wanted to see something a little interesting, perhaps more variance in the boats. Maybe an expansion can add bonus spots in the boats. The game did ramp up in tension and viciousness towards the end, which was interesting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very impressed with this.  After two plays, I'm not sure about replayability, but for now it is an almost perfect lighter game.

Update : Lowered to an 8 after half a dozen plays.  Not much replayability and the B sides are far too similar to the A sides to add much variety.  Still, a very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A solid light Coloretto implementation - beautiful production which certainly helps. The scoring systems are easy and low stress. But there is a bit of chicken in when to place cubes and when to push ships. There are more 'gamerly' sides to the scoring tiles which might extend interest. Honestly, I don't mind the frothy play. It is good fun and fits into a super-filler time slot (about 30-40 minutes). Enjoyable!

A pleasant surpris as I didn’t have any expectations for the game. Rules are reasonably simple and intuitive. Your options are limited each turn but still the decisions feel significant. However, I must say that the game may not be at its best with 2 players because it rarely made sense to place your stone onto any other space in a boat except the one at the front. I reckon this will change with more players. In other words I have only played the game with 2 (as of this writing). 

The contents to length ratio is quite close to the optimum here. Perhaps the game could be one round shorter since all rounds follow the same pattern and the board doesn’t evolve enough to make the later rounds much more interesting. But it is still within the limits of reason.

Quite a strong design with good, chunky bits.  Very direct confrontation, a mean game.  It seems like there are so few choices to make, though.  Almost tug-of-war-like to me.  Kinda like [b]Coloretto[/b].
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1st play: Lots of great choices packed into a very fast, streamlined game.  Plenty of tension between which action to take and where to best focus efforts.  Variable boards and scoring methods.  Sometimes a game comes along that's so simple you can't help but appreciate the elegance.  Imhotep is that game.

2nd play: Wow, just as good as the first game, and we randomized the board setup.  The big stones are chunky and feel good in your hand and I can't emphasize smooth and streamlined this game feels while you're playing it.  Plays very fast, at around 30-45 minutes with gamers, maybe 60 with muggles.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting piece of game here. good components and great feel. I like games of shipping cargo and this is a very simple and clever game about this. It reminds me of Egizia because of the theme, Panamax or Container because of the shipping mechanics. But it is a very unique game and plays really fast.

Really easy to explain and much deeper than it looks on the surface.  There is a lot of predictive work you have to do with guessing what your opponents are trying for and trying to block them or have their moves help you as much as possible.

I have only played this at 3, but it has worked very well at that count.  I feel that 4 might be too chaotic, but feel like 2 would work very well (untried).

Imhotep is a fantastic game that should have won the SdJ in my opinion.  

Turns are incredibly simple - you have 1 Action from 4 possible options: 
- collect stones form the quarry, or
- put 1 stone on a boat (where you place determines how it is unloaded), or
- sail a boat to a port and unload it in sequence, or
- play an action card.

Each location on the board is different:
Pyramids - construct the pyramid - score immediately
Temple - place stones in a wall structure - score at end of round
Obelisks - build the highest obelisk - score at end of game
Tomb - construct a flat tomb - adjoining stones score at end of game.
Market - collect cards which can score, give extra actions or increase end game scoring

Where the real beauty comes into the game is the planning combined with the mercy of surrendering control.  You can place stones on boats - planning for them to go to a certain location, only to have another player move them elsewhere.  With multiple ways to score points - iteratively during the round, at the end of the round, and at the end of the game there's plenty of simple strategy in a very fast playing package.  Turns are very quick with many tantalizing choices and just a little bit of enjoyable blocking.

The game scales well from 2-4 in 30-40 mins, good, solid components (those cubes are huge and so chunky) and fit the theme well.  Good artwork, thick boards and lovely boats.  Best of all, the various boards are double-sided, adding additional scoring options, interchangeability and replayability.

A solid game that is simple, accessible, easy to learn, a doddle to teach and quick to play.

An OK game. The cubes are the best part. Became a bit dull after several plays. Oversized box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is assuredly getting a lot of buzz at the moment, but Imhotep seemed to me to be a very modest game without a theme, essentially a thinly dressed, modest abstract.  

Yes, the rules are simple.  You either add a cube or move cubes on boats that are either full or close to full to certain victory point scheme docks, or add cubes to your supply, then tally the victory points.  Zzzzzz.  And yes, there are certain cards too, which is almost interesting.  

Bottom line:  I am not sure where the fun is within these mechanics or wafer thin theme.  The fun, I guess, is in the screwage, doing bad things to other peoples cube boats, but really, is that single "fun" thing to do in the game that much fun?  Not really. On a scale of 1 to 10, I might give that aspect a 7, but the rest of the game, for example adding cubes to boats, caring about the sequencing of cubes coming off boats, and replenishing is about a 5 of 10.

Reminds me of a streamlined Egizia... or a simplified take on Trajan. Send your cubes to different areas, each with a distinct way of scoring points. While nothing really new here, it's a very tight, elegant package that moves along fairly quickly. Highly interactive: every decision you make will have a direct impact on other player's position.

Very easy set of rules and simple to play. The challenge comes in trying to figure out when to place cubes, where to place them, when to launch a ship, and where it should go as you try to second-guess your opponents and what they're going to be doing next. Found that I enjoyed this game quite a bit more than I thought I would.

RATING: 5
Too much chaos, especially in a 4 player game.  Cube placement doesn't seem to have much significant as things can then be shipped pretty much anywhere since after you place a cube, 3 people can ship into a place that really hurts you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Interesting that there are so many paths to victory - we've had victory by obelisk, by burial chamber, by statue collection.  I didn't enjoy this as much at 2 player count, so that's why it's not a 10.  I like the 4 player because what you intended to do can change so much before it comes back to you.  You play more in the moment rather than scripting out turns in advance.  Great for the pub, love the chunky bits.  Also, replay value in having B sides.

Phil is really one of the most reliable designers in the business, and in addition to stuff like Cacao, Sushi Go! and Archaeology, we now have Imhotep, a fun game in which you are delivering cubes to ships, sailing ships to various build spots and then trying to earn points in different configurations. The game has a nice tactile feel where you are stacking these big wooden cubes up vertically, and the cards you buy at the Market help flesh out and deepen the strategies. Also comes with B-side variants for the various locations and other variant material packed in. Wonderful game.

A hit with my gaming and non-gaming friends alike. 
The choices each turn are limited but making the right one is a fine balance  – Put a stone on a boat? If so, where on the boat? Sail a boat and if so to which destination? Collect more stones for your sledge? The cards in the market present their own difficult choices. I'm inclined to think that the blue action cards are most powerful (especially Sail, allowing to you place a stone on a boat and immediately sail it) whereas the green decoration cards are not likely to yield more than three or four points, but there are always likely to be exceptions. 
I don't have many games that are as satisfying as this but play in under an hour. Looks good too, with the chunky stones and cut-out boat pieces.

Like everybody, I became aware of Imhotep's existence after its nomination for the Spiel des Jahres. When I finally looked into it, I saw a simple game of building things with large chunky cubes... and that's what it really is!
But when playing it, I felt a compelling sensation of going back to the origins: the rules are so simple, but the emerging gameplay is nevertheless interesting. Imhotep feels like a classic Knizia from 10 or 15 years ago.
A great great gateway game. I hope in these days' crowded and ever changing market it has legs to become a classic...

An engaging game evolving from a very simple rules set is how I have always defined elegance. And this game is rife with elegance. Load your blocks on a boat, get more blocks, or send any boat to a location? The locations are interesting to consider, as is deciding when to immediately send your blocks or to wait for later. Engaging without being too complex. Fun game.

It felt like this game may have a problem with one player helping one other by decisions that are not necessarily optimal. With 4 players, that seems even more likely and makes it super tactical... very little planning between turns because so much can change. Maybe it would be better with 3 players? 2 players wouldn't be enough. This isn't my style of game. I'd play it if the group wants to, but I wouldn't ask to play it.

Imhotep is an easy to teach/learn kind of game that still has depth and interesting decisions. Each player has their own colored blocks which they are trying to get onto board and have those boats go to different locations for different uses. Your turn has 3 simple options. Either add rocks to your quarry, place rocks from quarry to boat, or send a boat (mission red planet esque) to a port. Once all of the boats have been sent the round ends and the boats reset. 

Easy to teach but you still have decisions to make. Also had just the right amount of player interaction for a game of this nature.

Perfect little play-the-player game.  Simple to teach, quick to play.  A great gateway game for people who like high interaction.

On a player's turn, he can put a block anywhere in a boat, get more blocks, or sail a boat (whether or not his cubes are in it) to one of five docks.  Each dock empties blocks and gives players points or powers.  Depending on the dock, the points are either one-time immediate, end of round, or end of game points.  Simple to teach but lots of trying to get other people to do your work for you.

Decent game of placing rocks on ships, and hoping those ships go where you want them to go. The rocks go to various destinations that all score points in different ways, based on what quantities of your rocks go there, or the placement of your rocks in those locations.

The trick is that on a turn, you can only place a rock or move a boat, not both, and anyone can move a boat so long as it meets a couple conditions. So, there's a lot of screwage in sending boats with other peoples' rocks to places that aren't that great for them, while also trying to get your rocks where you want them to go.

Overall, the game is OK and I'd play if someone else wanted to, but I don't think it would ever be my pick to get to the table.

Nice components and I like the A and B sides of the tiles for some variability, but I just found the gameplay very lacking, especially for a SdJ nominee. Limited strategic thinking possible since other players could finish a boat you place a stone and sail it before it gets back to you. Probably good for light gamers but not my cup of tea.

Not terribly convinced that this is actually a game...scoring happens, but I didn't really have anything to do with it.  Sort of like how old video games have a demo mode where they play themselves and then as if you took the high score as your own.  I remember putting stones on ships, but I don't really remember why.  I also remember trying to hose the other players and realizing it isn't really viable.  I liken it to Joshua playing Tic-Tac-Toe at the end of Wargames...if any single move is no better than any of the other moves, the best move is likely not to play.

Grossly underrated game for what it is.  This is a medium filler which challenges spacial recognition while employing a pick up and deliver mechanic.

Not a bad little game... reminds me of Coloretto or Zooloretto in terms of tension between filling up a boat/truck/row vs. wanting to take that row. One wrinkle here is that you can "hate ship" a boat to a location, even if you have no cubes on it.

Not a game I need to own, but one I'd be perfectly fine playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best thing about this game I think are the stones that you use to move from boats to the monuments. It makes this game stand out on the table and if the game had regularly sized cubes I don't think it would be as popular. The gameplay is very simple as there is only one of 4 things you can do on your turn and they can be summarized in 3 words each (take 3 stones, place a stone, move a boat, or play a card). I think that is where the SdJ nominee came from and I can understand why as it causes the game to move along at a very nice clip. However, I was hoping those 4 simple choices would lead to some tense decisions and I never saw them. When the boat moves to a monument you'll always get some points or a card, and it was never really mean enough for me to want to care about where I ended up since I never really felt like going somewhere hurt me.

A box full of screwage, which you either like or hate. Can very well serve as a lovely family game, if playing nice. The B sides of the different areas are much more interesting than the A ones, as expected, and prolong the replayability of the game considerably. But OMG; the chunky half-inch cubes, they are so good, I'd buy the game just to fiddle with them. Nicely thematic in an abstract way, and a winner for Mr Walker Harding. A solid game from Kosmos, that is expandable and will probably sell well.

+ Interesting action selection/intent mechanism
+ Lovely variable scoring mechanisms that prolong replayability
+ The awesome big cubes!

= So much screwage potential, it hurts. :)

- Leaning towards considering the ability to move a boat without having a a cube in it a fragile, even half-broken mechanism

Excellent family weight game.  Place your stones on a ship (in a specific slot) and try to get that ship to sail to the desired port to maximize your points.  Ships can sail with one less stone than maximum capacity so there is risk that an opponent can see through your plans and sail early to a less desirable port to thwart your plans.  Market cards allow for expanded scoring opportunities, but any stones spent at the market are not scoring during that round.  Very satisfying game!

RATING: 5
A simple but still fun little game of timing and [i]zugzwang[/i]. Or perhaps not precisely zugzwang, but rather offloading responsibility of taking a certain action onto someone else's shoulders. There is lots of intended collateral damage in this game, and it is often played quite destructively to one's own position... it's just that others fare worse in the process. While playing I was reminded of another game which had (at the time of writing) recently been released, but I just couldn't put my finger on it until it suddenly hit me: Legendary Inventors. The games share quite a few principles in collecting 'influence', and how to time its arrival with respect to its subsequent expenditure. But Imhotep is clearly the better game of the 'minigames' are different; and not just a matter of filling up slots as is the case in LI. It makes Imhotep charming in its own way.

That said, I wish there were a few more ship mooring tiles in the game. You know, for a little extra variety.

A bit of an abstract puzzle-game.  You first fill up boats with your building materials, once a certain amount of cubes are on the boat, a player can choose to ship it to one of 5(?) locations, whereupon you build up the monuments (or buy cards) from the front of the boat moving backwards. I can understand why this won the Spiel de Juares (sp?) award, but not sure how long it'll stay in my collection.  (It's a bit too light and abstract to my liking).

Players take blocks, put them on boats, and sail these boats to 5 building places. During each of the 6 rounds each building place can only be visited by 1 boat. By placing your blocks you can earn victory points, or in the market collect cards which allow you to score extra points at the end of the game, or to bend the rules a bit, or to take two actions at once.

One of the family games that really hooks up pretty much every type of player.

This game is all about the timing, when to load stones, which boats and where to dock them, should I punish the guy i think is ahead or push my stones to a location that will grant me points.

Add to the above a set collection element and some nice end scoring and you got -probably- one of the best family games out there. But beware, it will create some tension between the players!

Players are Egyptians doing Egyptian things, which basically entails getting their stone to the places that score the most points.  Interesting, featherweight design, where players take turns performing one action from a selection of four possible choices.  Take Stone, Load Stone, Ship Stones or play a special card.  Stones are sailed on ships to one of five "projects" where they are unloaded, triggering various things.  Very, very easy to learn, increasingly chaotic and less tactical with more players, but quite interesting with two.  Not sure if I like it or not, but it works as a 30 minute super-filler.

Little zerosumy (as many two players are) but I still found the block placement intoxicating, there's just something fun about the patterning and building with the large cubes, also theres a small point salad on offer here, which was palatable to me a gamer, though I am sure it could be served up to none gamers also with unmixed results.  Game will be explored further and rating adjusted, though I can only see this going up with more plays and more players. I think in future I may just buy PWH games as he makes great games that I can more of less teach to anyone.  Also the 45 minutes on the box is correct for two, so play time will come come down if anything, which is great for school night gamers like myself.

RATING: 7.5
Imhotep is thoroughly deserving of its SDJ nomination. A simple rule set driven by area majorities belies a game of considerable depth and constant head-scratching decision making. In any turn you can do one of three very simple things: take cubes, put cubes on ships, or sail a loaded ship to one of 5 ports. When a ship is in a port it unloads and various points are scored in the location at turn end, round end or game end. Throw in a few cards which can be gained and that is it. 

The decisions are in terms of what boat to load your cube and whether to instead sail a boat. You can sail a boat with only opponents cubes on too. And in that comes the nasty streak in this game. You may well happily be loading up a boat to gain a tasty score at the temple only to find someone deliberately and maliciously sails the boat to somewhere mostly useless to you. 

This combination of optimising your own moves whilst screwing your opponents' moves whilst second-guessing what everyone else might do produces a great game.

Imhotep won't win the SDJ, it is too mean and nasty for that, but its recognition in the nominees is welcome. This is a real gamers' game which works as a family game too.

RATING: 9
Highly tactical, easy to explain & understand, quick playing, satisfying. All players are always engaged. It is a most deserving Spiel des Jahres nominee, and perhaps would have been a better winner (and I like Codenames, but primarily with 6+ players). 

Some have criticized it for being "mean", but I don't see that. It is highly interactive and you need to not "put your stones all in one boat", but it's not mean like Survive: Escape from Atlantis can be.

Great family game!

The wooden cubes could not be more fun to play with. The gameplay is interesting and sound, but lacks much meaning since it is very hard to plan ahead (since the boat you load to will often be snatched away before you can control the outcome).

Definitely worth checking out and only worth owning if you need more quick approachable games to teach others.

Firstly, cubes are loaded to ships and then ships are moved to ports. The cubes are then allocated to the port boards and they score points different way in each port. I like the scoring mechanics of this game. 

As anyone can move the ships to any port, the game can be quite chaotic sometimes, but still it feels somewhat meaningful.

This was my favorite of the 2016 Spiel nominees, and plays well as a family game, or as a spiteful free-for-all. Tactics dominate player decisions as long-term strategies are difficult to realize. Since each stone placed at a site scores points, it seems at first glance that placing as many stones as possible is a strong general strategy, forcing your opponents to take sailing actions for you. But the game does a fabulous job at making each site different, such that the order of placing stones is also important. Thus, a few well placed stones can easily defeat a load of haphazardly placed ones; making this game a wonderfully tense experience. The game can get a bit swingy, but final scores have been fairly close. Overall it delivers on its SdJ nomination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In order of priority:  

1. Put your stones on ships.
2. Have enough stones to put on ships.
3. Refer to 1 and 2 above.
4. Very situationally, move a ship.

At 10+ plays I'm just not sure there's much more to it than that.  Honestly, when playing on Yucata you can win simply by never moving a ship... and I'm only mildly embarrassed that it took me over half a dozen plays to figure that out... :)

Maybe the game is significantly better when everyone at the table understands how (potentially) detrimental moving your ships can be - conversely, maybe that would just cause it to end up looking like a glorified game of chicken.  But, I do think it's worth finding out.  So, for now, I'll say that the mildly prejudiced jury is still out on this one.

Szuper beltartalom (a doboz kicsit túlméretezett), nagyszerű grafika, rettenetesen gyors játékmenet, végtelenül egyszerű szabályok, fenomenális! Mivel minden helyszínen csak pontok és lehetőségek várnak nagyon lehet pörgetni a játékot. Persze lehet hosszasan agyalni is, csak épp semmi értelme. A kulcsszó az optimalizáció! Nagyon bejövős. Sokszor fog előkerülni a jövőben. Méltó a Spiel des jahres jelölésre!

Straight-forward euro with tough decision-making all the way through.

2016-12-28: Quick bigbox-game suited for 'non-gamers' to get a feel of a 'real game'. I kind of compare it to 'Kingdom Builder' in that regard, but only that.
In reality it is more similar to 'Misson: Red Planet' but not just as evil as you can't blow up the transporters(boats) in this game at least. 
It is a decent game, but I worry that only two sides of the main tiles isn't enough for variety and also the chaosy nature can make it dull.
And also. . . holy crap this was expensive when I bought it for the amount of components. phew!

Easy, relaxing family gateway game.  Light, yet experienced gamers will appreciate the strategy of this game.  Sneakiness has its place here--such as grabbing control of a boat not fully loaded, a boat only loaded with your opponent's stones, and sending it off to a less desirable location, while the juicy spot is still available to you.

A very seemingly light Euro on the outside. A 40 minute playtime that often finishes sooner couldn't be all that strategic. But about half way through the first game, when it clicks, you realize just how clever this little game really is. With variant sides that you can mix and match to play with the varying degrees of strategy needed, there's no reason this game shouldn't be a must in for everyone getting started into Euros.

Simple rules, highly interactive, a light family game with a mean streak. There is no setup to speak of, the rules are explained in a minute or two, and the game itself hardly goes beyond 30 minutes. It might get a little repetitive if played several times in a row because it is so simple. Not a game for players who want to be in full control and not have other players foil their plans, however.

Based on several 2-p yucata plays:
Wow! Incredibly simple game, very much in the Cacao style (this touch of the designer), however, so much more interesting. The timing is everything in this game - when to add stones, when to send ships (maybe ASAP to make someone else loose actions on for example sending cubes to the already won by him obelisk, or to cover his own cubes in the temple?). However it still is repetitive in the sense that most cubes that go onto the boards are just points. It would be so much nicer to see more spots that give you extra something except for points.
Anyhow - I'd love to have it (but definitely for smaller price than it usually could be found in our stores).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
With 4 players things can get very chaotic, and at the other end of the scale having just two colours of blocks at the various sites takes away some of the scoring finesse. I reckon the game is best with three, a nice balance between control and competition. So far I have had a lot of fun with the game which is easy to learn, plays quickly and has a lovely tactile feel

I love Cacao and Sushi Go by this designer, but this game is... a waste of time.

The game lacks strategy with more than 2 players. All tactical decisions with little control. The player interaction amounts to constantly messing with your opponents. Your blocks usually go to places you don't want them to go. If you are the current leader, the others' best catch-up mechanism is to screw with your shipments (bashing the leader). Sure, you can "play nice" I suppose, but then you are basically just not playing as well as you can, in a relatively dry eurogame, so... you should probably either play a better eurogame or play a more fun interactive game.

Got it couple of days back at Yellow Submarine. Played it with my fellow board gamers, it was really fun. Sailing a ship with opponents blocks were really fun. We enjoyed the "take that" element too.

Overall a really fun and easy to learn. Enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a semi-complex, family friendly, easy to learn Egypt based thematic game.

And yes, you literally build pyramids in this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent family game where the players are builders in ancient Egypt, trying to make sure the giant stone blocks go to the right place. Super solid and elegant ruleset.

Picking which boats carry the stone blocks is a lot of fun. You need to take in account the timing and the fact that any player can sail that ship to a place where you really don't want to go.

It's one of those games where you look at it in the end and feel proud about what you've accomplished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My first game felt slightly rote, with ships rarely sailing before they were full and players rarely refilling before their carts were empty. I would totally try again (especially with some B-sides in setup, or the inevitable expansion) despite not having very high hopes.

[Edit: When I try to think in more detail about what I didn't like, I keep finding little points of interest I'd like to explore more. Maybe I'm just pessimistic because Sushi Go disappointed me so abruptly after a few sessions.]

The players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.  Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card. While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing — and the stones to back up their plans — will prove to be Egypt's best builder.

When I saw the first explanation video, I was very underwhelmed, as everything sounded and looked boring. However, I was still happy to give it a try, as a single short explanation rarely does justice to a game.

Well, while I'm still not sold, it for sure was much better than I thought and I actually liked the very cutthroat nature of this game. At the same time I thought it was too chaotic to really influence the game the way you want (playing with 4). I need to try it at 3 and maybe 2 players only, as I guess it will be better.

Seems that it doesn't get much better at any player count. Best played with 3, but after a few plays I get the feeling that there arn't (m)any meaningful decisions to take.

Had a feeling I would enjoy this. Turns are fast and there is an interesting game of chicken that evolves as you need to make the decision to either dictate where a boat that has your color on it goes or if you want to move another boat to a less favorable location. Or you can just get more cubes and pass the buck. Haven't figured out how to win, but I'm seeing that having more end game scoring cards seems to be better than having more in game action cards. Or maybe I'm just not good at evaluating when is best to use those actions.

Clever action queues in board game format make for an active brain game in Imhotep. However, actions are often "chosen" from the perspective preventing a leader is more beneficial than helping yourself.

Played three times at BGG Spring, two 4P games and one 3P game. Great components, looks like it would be an interesting, light game. After each game I felt disconnected from my score, like it happened almost randomly, despite all the choices I made. 

Big disconnect in that any player can send any boat at any time. It makes it very difficult to predict where your stones will end up, and it feels more like the game is "spread your stuff wisely and hope other people choose things that happen to also be good for you". 

Perhaps there's a way to be "good" at this game, but we couldn't find it.

The more I play this game, the more its growing on me. In my earlier play sessions I thought this game relies too much on what the others are doing and you almost had no control for how things turns out. But now I'm starting to see that its a game about minimizing your loss of points by trying to go with the best point average placement on the boat. And for some reason this game always put you in a dilemma where your brick could score you a lot of points on 1 monument but less on the others. So there is a bit of risk element to the game too.

Bokkensprong 18/11/16. Snel uitgelegd spel in Egypte dat niet te lang duurt. In je beurt kies je een van volgende acties: een steen van je kleur in een van de boten laden, een boot aanmeren aan een van de laadkades, je voorraad stenen aanvullen met max. 3 stenen, of een kaartje spelen. Punten worden verdiend aan de laadkades, vb. door aan piramide te bouwen met je stenen, door de hoogste toren te maken, door je stenen in bovenaanzicht te zien in de stapel, etc. Sommige punten verdien je direct, andere pas aan het eind van het spel. Wanneer alle boten zijn aangemeerd, komen er vier nieuwe en begint een volgende ronde. Na 6 ronden is het spel gedaan. Toegankelijke spelregels, vlot spel, leuk voor af en toe.

Played 4 player, with all of the A sides, and no one I played with liked it at all. It seemed like because you can move any ship anywhere there's basically no opportunity for planning or going for a particular thing, since most of your blocks will be moved by not you. And in fact any time you put yourself on a boat with someone elsewhere you both stand to gain from going to a particular place, a third player will probably move you somewhere else. I want to make it clear that I'm not complaining that the game is too cutthroat, I'm complaining that almost every action felt pretty meaningless since your stones were just going to end up God knows where anyway.

"Should I give myself a chance to score points or should I decide how the points should be scored?" That is the central dilemma of Imhotep, a simple game that can feel a bit too chaotic at times but ultimately provides a quick, satisfying experience (often with memorable moments of cunning, aggression, and luck).

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2016)

Imhotep is a good family game, but it isn’t a game I would like to play often.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 7 minutes. Game time is around 60 minutes and Imhotep plays at a quick pace.

The components and art are very good, when the cubes are on the boards, the game looks gorgeous. 

The theme is ok and some of the mechanism do support it, but still, you don’t feel the theme through the game.

The luck factor is low as there is only luck with the cards, but as they are available and visible at the beginning of each round, the luck factor is totally controllable. However, there is little control in-game as each player undoes/hinder your moves often. 

The game decisions aren’t obvious, but aren’t that hard either. In each turn you only have 3 options (play a card, take two stones, or ship a stone). There are lots of tactics in the game, planning ahead can prove difficult as the game situation changes so much between turns. With 2 players it is much more strategic than with 4 players.

I love that the boards are double sided with different conditions on them, it adds to the replayability.

Bottom line, Imhotep is a great family game. It can also be used to to attract new gamers to our beloved hobby. I would play again if requested, but it is way too light for my current tastes. With 4 players there is not a lot of control. I already sold my copy of the game. Harmless game.

RATING: 6
Granted, when it comes to lighter games, I tend to prefer games with a spacial or connection-building element. This is the reason, probably more than anything, that Imhotep will not last in my collection as a family-weight game of choice. There is nothing wrong with the game by any means. Every turn you take one of four actions: add 3 stones from the quarry to your sled, add one stone from your sled to a boat, sail a boat to a destination if it has the minimum stones required, or play an action card you acquired on a previous turn (which usually allows you to combine two of the previous actions into one). Each destination scores for different things and at different times. A round ends when all 4 boats have sailed. After six rounds the game ends.

The game is incredibly simple to explain and play. You can sail boats that don't have any of your stones, sending your opponents to where they don't want to go. Stones are resolved in order at the destination, so where you place them in a boat is significant. The destinations give you cards (for scoring or action purposes), immediate points, end-of-round points (stones visible from above), and end game points - one for groupings and one for majorities. While the ability to impact each other makes this game tolerable, I really don't find any of these actions and scoring options to be interesting and don't think I'd ever think about this game if I never played it again. If I was newer to the hobby, I'm sure I'd like this more and thus my respectable rating.

RATING: 5
Hmm. Room for positioning but the lack of control over who is on and moves the boats means dickery will rule the day. This is  somewhat offset by the plethora of places to get points though ultimately this delves into trying to net more points over your opponents. Not bad but not interesting enough to be good either.

RATING: 7
Imhotep is suitable for playing with the family as well as with gamers. The material is appealing, the rules are easy to explain, the decisions are interesting, replayability is given as a good part of gameplay is in the player interaction. 

Depending on the group, Imhotep will shine or suffer. Seat order is a major influence. Players have to keep an eye on the options of the next player. Some options can be so strong that they have to be denied by launching a ship to a destination not intended by the owner of the cubes on it. As launching a ship hinders a player to further his own interest, this decision is double-edged. The end result of a player is directly dependent on the play style of the player in front of him. In all-casual or all-experienced groups, this shouldn't matter or balance out.

A pleasant constructive game in a casual group, potentially a mean affair with core gamers. The sweet spot is probably three players as a good compromise between control and competition for majorities.

A great mechanic, distilled to its purest form like one of Knizia's classics. Placing cubes always helps you, but not deciding where the boat goes means you don't necessarily have a say in how much. Trying to position yourself so all spots are equally good is a strategy, but hard to pull off; pushing your luck, hoping to profit off of other players' placement, is high risk/high reward; trying to control where all the boats go will assure you maximum output for the cubes you'll put, but you'll put fewer. So many different threads to pull on, I love it with a passion.

We like this one quite a bit.  It's got great components and it looks cool as everyone is building up the various areas.  Even when you lose you feel like you did something.  There is quite a bit of player interaction as you can figure out what the other players are up to and then sail their boat and (cubes) to a different location to wreck their plans.  This plays smoothly and is easy to learn because there are only so many actions to choose, but that doesn't mean there aren't smart and tough decisions to make.  I think this is a great game and seems to work for me at every player count.

Tienes que ir colocando tus cubos en los distintos barcos, que luego atracarán en el puerto que elija el jugador que utilice una de sus acciones para hacerlo. Cada puerto te permite obtener puntos de una determinada forma. Gana el que más puntos obtiene al final de la partida.

Underrated game. Turns are almost TOO fast; the only downside to the game is also its greatest strength; block-plays are SO NECESSARY. That's great because the decision of "well THAT probably gets me most points but then Greg would go here and get THAT many points and I can't have that but then I get nothing and Cat gets a FREE TURN maybe I can make her block Greg BUT SHE'S ON THAT SAME BOAT SHE WON'T AAAARGH!"... is a truly interesting little puzzle that you normally only find in the Big Beefy Euros. But here it's slick! It's a downside because it relies on everyone in the game being similar skill levels. The block-plays only bring balance to the game if there is equilibrium and everyone contributes. If you force someone else to block play, soon they'll give up on blocking to seek their own fortune, forcing YOU to do it, or you'll have quarried a big enough lead that EVERYONE is subverting YOU with great prejudice, This is a thinking gamer's game that takes 3 minutes to teach and has almost no downtime. A favourite.

This game utilizes a mechanic akin to Zooloretto where you stockpile various ships with your wooden blocks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.

Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card. While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing — and the stones to back up their plans — will prove to be Egypt's best builder.

I LOVE this game, which is odd because there are so many things here that can be annoying. It's not a game where you can plan your next several moves. You basically have to wait until your turn and see what move will suit you best. Sometimes you end up playing too much defense - moving ships to ports you don't want to be in just to prevent opponents from making high-scoring moves. Sometimes you just never get any of the objectives going in your favor. Still, the game looks fantastic and it's got a lot more theming than most games. We built obelisks! We built pyramids! And the various objectives are kind of like fun mini-games.

More complex version of Zooloretto or Coloretto. The varied scoring criteria keep the game fresh, and it plays really fast. Considering that the box is full of empty air, not sure why they didn't make the score board bigger since using the large cubes is tight on the small score track.

Imhotep is my favorite Phil Walker-Harding's game. I like the theme of constructing Egypt's mythic monuments. The game is well illustrated and has simple overall in-game mechanisms which makes it a great getaway game, but the variety of tile scoring still brings lots of depth for gamers. Imhotep is a very interesting puzzle trying to figure out how to optimize your game while keeping opponent's from getting more points than you.

A fast-play resource game that requires you to play close attention to what your opponents are doing and plan accordingly. From that perspective it worked better as a 2-player game; in a larger group you could be completely shot before your turn came. Undermining your opponent's plans is a legitimate strategy, but beware it occurs often enough that it will feel to some people like screw-your-neighbor.

RATING: 6
Family weight game where you are building structures in Egypt.  You can take stones for your sled, deliver a stone to a boat and if it has enough stone, sail a boat to a location on the board to resolve in order of the placement on the boat.  I found the game interesting where you did have to think ahead a few turns.  Players could mess up your plans by sailing to a different location.  There are multiple paths to victory.  The game has about the same weight as Splendor but with more interesting choices.  It is good but not great.  Plays very quickly and very easy to teach.

Easy rules relativity quick game to learn and play
have yet to run into a complex play where rules had to be referenced, just double checked order/how to score
choices and timing are key
choices seem harsh but fair
(just scoring one point for temple on a side seemed a bit weak, b side is much better)
decent quality of components, modular board is just for ease of packing and laying out, seemed like the right choice over a solid board.  Cubes might annoy some for not having their color but it works better in the theme of it all.

this is one box that went standard size that could have probably fit better in a smaller box.  I hope to rebox this one soon

First Impressions:  Always on the lookout for light-medium euros that are fairly replayable.  Imhotep looks to hit that mark.  This game is tactical with lots of player interaction so each play should feel exciting and somewhat different.  

The rules are straightforward and it plays quickly.  Perfect level of complexity for its weight, but offers good decisions to make each game since you need to watch what your opponents are doing and react accordingly.

The side B monuments are much more enjoyable to play with!  Offers more interesting decisions to make without adding much complexity.

I really really really don't understand why almost everyone love this game so much. There's absolutely nothing compelling about it. The abilities on the cards, the dock spaces are all completely uninteresting and dull. There are so many other games in this weight with more game and less blah. It just feels lifeless/souless.

This is the absolute definition of mediocre and overhyped.

Everyone has enjoyed this game. It has just the right amount of decisions and player interaction for its game length. Coupled with great artwork and the tactile big stone blocks and you have a game that will be played in our house for quite a while.

Both of these games were four player and I do wonder if the end game scoring cards gained from the market have more influence on the final scores with this player number. They just seemed to award proportionally (to the final scores pre-end game scoring) a much greater reward. Still this is only an observation.

I actually like this game better now than when I first played it.  This is not common as I tend to move on to newer games after I learn how a game works.  In this case, the "meanness" of the game which was a mitigating factor early on has had less of an impact on me recently as I have become more familiar with the game (thus being able to take into account better the actions of other players "hate" shipping, etc.).  I have added the mini-expansions to my plays, and they had a nice extra strategic element that also helps balance the game a bit in my opinion.

Rating based on 2 & 3 players.

Preliminary rating with the potential to go up. A straightforward game that is a friendly take-that, in that much of the game is about tactically screwing other players, but since scoring is available with every move it goes down gently. Components are good, with nice big cubes!

Wow i loved this one. Has an excellent mechanic where players can reroute opponents' cubes so that they deliver to the wrong port. That's really the crux of it all, a bit of take-that. But it works beautifully. It's not too harsh, because every port scores or is beneficial in some way. The cubes are nice and oversized, and there's actually a nice visual component as some of the ports make the cubes stack up into pyramids or columns. Definitely a keeper.

Really like this game.  The decisions were not agonizing like I thought they'd be.

Imhotep deserves the large amount of praise its received. Its quite accessible and can be played easily by newcomers to Euro games, yet is challenging enough for experienced players. I applaud the publisher for including building sites with A and B sides, thereby keeping the game fresh with the ability to use them in any combination. I find all five building sites equally valuable, yet different.

A very enjoyable game that combines easy to make turns/gameplay elements with very complex repercussions to those decisions.

If you enjoy 'leveled thinking' as a metagame concept and constantly trying to stay one step ahead of your competition, you'll get a lot of mileage out of this game.

Because of that, however, this game can also be a turn-off for players not interested in the "screw your buddy" style of player interaction.

Components are nicely made and are HUGE. It seems silly at first, but really adds a nice sense of gravity to your structures and buildings as they're erected.

Super easy to learn and plays quickly at around 40mins however there's a decent amount of depth here as you decide where best to place your stones or do you instead choose to sail a ship? Often you'll gamble that nobody's cottoned on to your cunning plan and keep loading up a boat with your cubes but there's a high chance your greed will be punished and someone will sail your boat to an area that does not benefit you quite so much as where you were intending to go!

Has always looked like a family friendly reincarnation of Egizia, and now that I've played it this impression has proved right.
It's easy to learn yet has strategic- or rather, tactical - depth. 
What it lacks for me is some sort of dynamic. There's no engine building, no rush to be somewhere first, no desire to complete something first, no change in resources. 
That leaves a slow and steady collection of small advantages - well balanced and with good replayability, but not very exciting.

This is a fantastic game with a near-perfect amount of weight and strategy for 20 minutes of play.

Imhotep is a frustrating game of micro-turns interleaved between all the other player's turns. And each player has a chance to to interrupt what you're doing.  I put a cube on a ship with the idea of going to the market.  Since everyone knows I want to go to the market, they send the boat to the temple before my next go.

It's pretty good at doing what it does, but I'm not a fan of what it does.

Imhotep is a quick to learn game of building Egyptian monuments with satisfyingly chunky wooden cubes. Each turn you will select one of four actions to try and get your colour blocks into the best scoring areas. It's a game of managing your expectations and frustrations and choosing the best course of action given that someone else has just messed your intended move up. Is it best to protect what you have already built or make a power play for another monument? 

Family weight to learn but surprisingly deep and enjoyable.

RATING: 6.5
Players are Egyptians trying to emulate the master bulder, Imhotep. Each turn you either load stones on a boat, get more stones, move the boat to an area or play a market card. The meat of the games are the areas: Market, Temple, Obelisk, Pyramid or Burial Chamber. Each area has different scoring mechanisms, and there are two sides to each area to add variety. 

The fact that you can move any boat does make you vulnerable to being screwed out of your optimal points. So it's a bit of a lighter game from that perspective. It plays quickly, and has some interesting areas for scoring.

Imhotep is a very precise and clever illustration of how to interplay a small number of players: the simple turn-order options make for deep and very tense interaction, which is a commodity to be praised on its own. Nice chunky pieces and easily-explained rules give the illusion of it being lighter than it actually is.

Unfortunately, the game becomes its own enemy to some extent: because it is so tightly balanced, then rounds with small boat numbers become virtually decision-less for players late in the turn order, particularly with 4P. The promo expansion looks to be a decent fix for this, at least partially.

A remarkably solid and flexible take on word association, with a quite baffling amount of legs. I was cynical at first, but plays with many opponents and player counts happily proved me wrong.

Very nice family game with great components, simple rules but still some interesting choices to make and some very light take that mechanic that brings some fun kind of tension. Hits the nice sweet spot to play with the family (and I think therefore a deserved nomination for the SdJ).  
For some reason it reminds me a bit of Splendor, except I do not really enjoy Splendor and much prefer this. hope I can convince the family and make them forget about Splendor. :D

[b]Imhotep[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Imhotep has been played during a few family game nights and has been well received overall, which is good since a few other games didn't fair so well with my wife and kids. I was quite surprised and impressed by the difficulty you have making decisions for what is a very simple and straight forward set of rules. I'm not going to give an overview of the game play except to say each turn you can choose from four very straight forward actions. However; timing in this game is crucial due to what I consider the most important rule in the game: [i]you can move any ship you want even if you don't have your own stones on it[/i]. In fact your enjoyment of this game will depend on whether or not you want a lot of direct player interaction in your games. This opens up the game to a lot of screwing your opponents over... oh you wanted to go to the pyramids, nah how about you visit the tomb instead. 

I really appreciate Phil Walker-Harding creating a family weight game that has some teeth to it. You can never be certain you're going to get to do what you want since ultimately anyone can affect your best laid plans. Imhotep is an excellent 45 minute game that packs quite a punch,  as long as your family is okay with what ends up being a very confrontational game.[/i]

Played a 3p game with wife and 6 year old son today. Kept my eye on the end game scoring although I was lagging behind round after round as my son was left untouched in the temple with 4 pts each round. Managed to eke out a win with 3 pts by scoring big through the Burial chambers and 2 of the end game scoring cards. 

Just adore the decision making space and risk taking involved in this game, trying to second guess what your opponent would do and subtly foiling their plan. 

I love this game in 2 and 3p and would gladly play it anytime.

Oh man, I so love this game and the decisions one has to make while balancing their resources. Can't wait to try the other side of the buildings.

Very tactical game without too much influence when you have a lot of players. Scoring points in different ways. You are really depending on others to move or not move your boat to a location that benefits you. Seems quite some luck involved to win the game.

RATING: 10
This game is just brilliant.  SOO simple, because there are only 4 things to do on your turn and only 5 ways to score points, but the game is just wonderful.  It gives you great decisions, and looks and feels great on the table.  Having double-sided boards makes for some variability in the way a game plays, which keeps it fresh, but honestly the flow of the game makes every situation a little bit different.  Imhotep is LOVELY!

A good enough game but it seemed that the players had little control over the scoring. Usually it would be managing to get the right blocks on the right boat only for another player to sail that boat somewhere you didn't want it to go or you would sail a boat somewhere to stop the opponents' blocks scoring optimally. Whoever won or lost didn't really feel down to strategy much. Nice components though and the big wooden blocks were satisfying, it would have been a horrible experience with little fiddly cubes.

It's quite clever design. Put a bunch of standard different scoring methods at one end, put a place 1 stone mechanism each turn at the other end, but create tension by introducing a boat mechanism in the middle in which you may place a stone in a boat with the intention of delivering that boat to one scoring mechanism but it ends up going to another. Players need to weigh up the point at which the other players gain more benefit by moving a boat with your stones on it to somewhere you don't want it to go, so you need to place with the mindset of gaining as much benefit as possible without engineering those hose-type situations. Whilst looking for those same situations yourself. The other clever thing is that order of stones on a boat matter - with some scoring mechanisms, you want to be first off, others last, others in a particular place. Which adds another layer to the hosing decisions. Having said that, the game is still probably too simple and repetitive in play to be a long-laster in my rotation. But it has a lot to recommend it in its genre, especially when you consider how easy it will be to introduce a ton more scoring mechanisms via expansions or print-and-play.

Nice and solid family game with a lot of tough decisions. Provisory rating with only 2 players. I expect this to be considerably better with a full table.

A much better game with 4 but rating will remain the same for now. I want to try the B-sides to see how those play. I feel like they could be more fun because of other benefits they can give over VPs.

I just bumped this up to an 8 after trying out the B-Sides. I now will always play with B. It's a lot more interesting. Maybe the chamber I might use with side A sometimes, but A feels a lot like a learning game now. B-Sides for ever!!

Love the theme.  Love the competition for placing your blocks on the boats vs. moving the boat to a site.  And then you have to decide which site is best for you to go to.  And you also have to decide which spot on the boat to place your block.  Just the right amount of intriguing decisions to make this a fun family-weight game!

Brilliant and brilliantly simple.  Once again Phil Walker Harding has proven that he is the current master of designing games that bring hobby and non hobby gamers together to the table in such a way that everyone is competitive and everyone can enjoy it.  This game is more unique than his other designs.  It most has a Puerto Rico feel where everything you do seems to benefit you and others, you just have to find the action that helps you the most and them the least.  And the fact that the game has outstanding components is just icing on the cake.

Imhotep is a relatively simple eurogame in which players try to get their colored stones into one of five areas, each of which scores a different way.  In a player's turn, he can either place a cube on an empty spot on a boat (order matters!), move a boat to one of the regions and unload it, or get more cubes.  The regions can either get you fixed points depending on the position, earn you points for chains of your cubes, earn points for straight area majority, earn points if at the end of the round it is one of the last five cubes placed, or gain cards with special powers.  In playing the game, players have to balance just getting more cubes onto the boats with making sure their cubes go to the place they want (or making the opponents' cubes to go the places they don't want).  For me, this is a filler-ish game that I wouldn't mind playing more, but I think the lack of depth will make me lose interest after a while.

This is a pretty fun, interesting worker placement game. My problem with it is you end up having to be really mean to other players and throw off their strategies in order to win. This game could easily start arguments/fights I'm sure, and one player usually ends up getting stuck being the player who doesn't get to add more bricks to boats, they just have to send the ships to different areas to stop the others from advancing too far.

Imhotep was a good game with decent decisions for boat placement, sailing a boat, or restocking.  It played fast, had decent rules, and was interactive and cutthroat with others.  Having different cards and sides added to its variability.

I would like to see a little more scoring options and less oppotunity for king making.

Very nicely designed game, easy to play, but hard decisions throughout. Move stones to different locations, build monuments like pyramids and obelisks. One great aspect is the double sided boards, brings a lot of variation into the game play, playing only A side is a bit dull after a few plays. One thing to note: Played a couple of 2 player games, and the game seems a bit unbalanced if someone starts dominating, and the other player is left just playing defensive for the rest of the game. Like the obelisks, where the player who has the highest gets 10 points, but the second only gets 1(!). Or maybe I'm just not a good enough Imhotep player.

This is not a game. This is a pastime. 

Put blocks on a chit, move that chit to one of five places where you use the chit to play variations on tic-tac-toe to win a point salad.

Component quality is admirable - way above average - but the game is too light for the table space and setup/teardown required.

RATING: 7
More of a family game with lots of different scoring abbilities. The 15 points on the Obelisk however seems to be the determinating factor (impression from my first game with 4). With 4 you seem to have not enough control. I think this game would be better with 3.

I saw the box and I knew I had to play. A bright purple maroon box and I very much enjoy that cover. Too bad the game is just drab and boring shades of gray. I found the game very OK. You are taking actions to send your cubes to the boats and then to the action spaces to build up the ancient wonders. It is a nice game. We only played the easy version and you can skip right to the harder version which might make it more interesting. I would like to play it again with the more interesting sides and see how it goes. Solid game- perhaps forgettable, but a game I still want to revisit.

In this game, you are choosing between 3 actions. Getting bricks, putting a brick on a boat, or moving a boat with whoever's bricks are on it to one of the scoring areas in the center of the table. It feels like a smoother, more interesting version of Zooloretto or Colorerro, ect. The different scoring criteria keep the game fresh, and the game only takes about an hour. It's cute, but I'm a little over the basic mechanism having played a lot of ~loretto games already.

The game requires you to balance what YOU want with what you want to deny your opponents. This tension is *critical* for this game, so more players is often better.

With 2 players, this tension is diminished to (more or less) multiplayer solitaire. But with 3, you start getting some more "take that"

Just when I was thinking no one makes them like Medina any more, here is the hot-off-the-presses Imhotep, very much in that classic Euro mold. 

The rules are a breeze to teach, with a very Knizian structure of 'take turns to choose one of four simple actions'. And all of the players' attention is directed towards the central board area - there's absolutely no individual complexity as a barrier to interaction.

Like Medina, it's about timing, occasional collusion and frequent screwage. And it has another feature I love - variable setup with 2 sides to choose from for each of the 5 scoring areas. (this also makes it eminently expandable).

I think Codenames will deservedly win the SdJ this year. But Imhotep is certainly deserving of its nomination.

Worker placement strategy with building blocks (really the resource stone). You fill ships with stone then sail to one of several destinations to unload to build different objects (each with different scoring rules). The bonus is the tactile element of building in a pure strategy game.

Game scales well to 2 player.

Easy to learn, gateway game that plays very quickly (40 min). A well-deserved Spiel des Jahres nominee. It has extremely nice components with the large chunky wooden blocks. It has a decent amount of depth, and the ability to sail ships with other people's blocks on it requires players to pay attention to everything. The game started to feel the same after a few plays. It also is less fun if people are less willing to screw others over.

Had quite a bit of fun in my first play of this. A quick an easy to teach game that has plenty of decisions. 

But the tough part for me is to assess how meaningful those decisions are. I'm not sure how much strategic depth this game offers for those decisions and that is what will ultimately determine how much I like this one. I could see with repeated plays and trying the B side of some monuments that there could be more depth here, and if that comes to be I would expect this to raise to an 8. On the other hand if repeated plays reveals that the decisions are not very meaningful and there isn't really any strategic depth here my rating will go down. 

Still overall it was an interesting and quick game with a nice level of player interaction and I'm looking forward to trying some more.

Best part about this game is being able to see how many points you and your opponents have. I wish more games implemented this feature. The unknown factor in this game is great, you can really screw people over and waste their previous moves by shipping them to a place that gives them minimal value. I feel like this game you need to convince others to sail ships. If you are the one sailing all the ships, you won't be placing any stones on the ships and receiving points. The first few games have ended like this which has been frustrating. I think it could be played as a 2 on 2 team game, will test this theory. I will also test the personal boat expansion where you place a stone and ship the boat to any port (open or closed) once per game. I also like the 3D feature the game provides. Just don't bump the table.

I usually can only play two player games, and those with my wife. Despite the fact that she's won four in a row (very tight, competitive games) her conclusion is "challenging, but not fun." She would rather play Tokaido, which is definitely not as challenging, but, also,  does not have "screwage" as a basic game mechanic.  She doesn't like the lack of control. I'm beginning to think Rhado has a very similar situation :)

Good game.  Quick.  You move blocks from a central supply to your sled to a boat to the construction sites (4 steps).  Very simple rules, some interaction (via shipping a ship to a place that benefits you more than your opponents).

On your turn you do one of 3 things:
1) move 3 blocks from the central supply to your sled
2) load 1 block from your sled to a boat
3) sail a boat to one of the 5 docks (and unload the blocks to score points)

Although some complain it is overly cut-throat, I didn't find it that way.  You need to go in assuming the boat can go anywhere.  You have to load each boat so that where ever it goes, it's still OK for you.  If you load a boat thinking it will end up at one exact site, you will be disappointed as it goes somewhere else.

Also, I prefer to not ship boats at all.....unless there is an opportunistic point grab in front of me....or it's the end of the round, so I don't have a choice.  My thought it that if other people are using turns to ship boats, then I'll have more blocks in the construction sites.  Why waste a turn shipping blocks when you can add another block instead??

This is a very simple game.  I'm not sure there is enough here to keep me interested in the long run, but definitely fun enough to bring out for new/casual gamers - or when I'm not feeling up for something too big or thinky.

This is ideal game for one who likes short rules set but deeper play.  This blends a unique bunch of mechanics such as outguessing your opponents with resource management, puzzles with high tactics and long term strategy.  Mechanically a great game that has a good look after the game is up.  Fun interesting brain burner that I' terrible at but still enjoy.  One of those that I'm just happy not to come in last all the time.

I thought I would really like this game and I was not disappointed. The timing of what to do when, what ship to place your cubes on, and what open spot on the ship. Doing all this and then trying to also ensure that the ships go to the locations you hoped for. You can really plan ahead and try to limit the randomness of the benefits you get no matter what location it ends up at.

Fantástico. Um jogo em que você de fato constroi monumentos egípcios empilhando pedras/cubos. Muita interação, com decisões interessantes, leves, em que é preciso saber ler as intenções dos amiguinhos. Com 2 fica menos bom, mas com 3 ou 4, fica espetacular.

I sure do love me a dry soulless euro.  Optimize action efficiency as you push cubes into ancient Egypt to use triangular scoring, a draft board, and area majority to score points.  It's clean!  It's pleasing!  It's almost thematic!  I quite enjoyed it.

update:  on subsequent plays it felt a bit too obvious what to do -- just put as many cubes onto boats as you can.  The subtlety of when to ship is less important than just putting cubes anywhere you can.  It's still neat and pleasing, but less deep than it first appeared.  I suspect  house rule such as "when you ship, also get 1 cube from the quarry to your sled" could open up the options and timing judgments a lot.

Simple rules, but a a lot to think through. Strategy seemed opaque to me the first time I played. Opponents have so much control of the board state and it's pieces between turns that it's difficult to plan for future turns because everything could change, which makes it very tactical. I'm sure there's a lot beneath the surface and probably warrants another play.

A light game but with some decisions - do you place a block or sail a ship, and when do you skip your turn to take blocks.  It did feel slightly overbalanced with almost every block being worth 2 - the aim of the game being to make them worth more.

Very elegant design by Phil Walker-Harding. I prefer his Cacao a bit more, but this is still great. Only a few decisions to make, but a lot to consider. The game didn't seem too mean to me, but that's because when placing stones I was trying to think of where I'd rather it go if it went to any of several locations, and not just picking a place I really want it to go and get  annoyed when someone sends the ship somewhere else.

RATING: 10
(14 plays)

This game is a 10 for me after having played it all player counts. It is a radically different experience with 2, best with 3 and excellent with 4 and although it's a little chaotic at that player count, it's still a blast. Imo, this is the best gateway family game in the market and Phil Walker's best game. He makes the tyope of games that I love above any others. Simple rules, fast paced, family friendly and strategic enough for us hardcore gamers to enjoy. After my last play this game cracked my top 10. Therr are do many little levers to consider here and yet it's all soo simple. When do u place, refill, or move? The risk/reward feeling is great as you never really know when an opponent can move a ship. It's always a good idea to place as many cubes as possible in every ship but you will have to refill at some point, so the timing is key. I love how every location is double sided, it adds a lot of variability to the game and big time replay value. I also love the two mini expansions as they add yet two more options to game. The artwork is inviting, the components are top tier,  and the 3d element as the cubes stack up is awesome. I look forward to that expansion coming up as it looks to add some insane new elements. Imhotep was one of the best games of 2016 and a game I'll play anytime, anywhere.

RATING: 7
Very easy to teach and light offering for the family. There's almost no down time as the very limited options for each player keep the game racing along. Excellent! There are some nice little decisions and choices to be made along the journey, but they don't take much time to make. We normally get through a four player game in 20 minutes. The theme is just because a game moving cubes around has to have a theme, and it fits fine - it could have been about zoo animals or bears or herding sheep or...

I enjoy the limited options. I like that your opponents can sail any ship into a port, even if they have no stone on it. But I've played with a family member who doesn't like this and would therefore prefer to play a different game. I don't know why, but everyone is an individual. Luckily I own a few other games and can accomodate all tastes.

Theres something special about this game. It's one of the best gateway games out there. The rules take no longer than 5 minutes to explain, during every point in the game you're involved in what other players do and you're constantly on edge if your stones will get shipped somewhere or if the spot on a certain boat will get occupied.

RATING: 9
A fun quick worker-placement type of game. It is definitely very competitive and cutthroat, as you have the opportunity to place others pieces where they don't want to go based upon how you send the ships. It's got a nice combination of all the elements you'd like in a short confrontational game: including cards that give you special actions or endgame scoring, a couple of different places to score, including a way to score every round, one to score immediately, one that builds over time, and one that only scores at the end of the game.

UPDATE: After a couple more plays, I appreciate the smoothness of this design: there are only a couple of decisions that can be made, but everyone is meaningful and it can really impact your opponents.

UPDATE #2: I'd say that this is worthy of its SdJ nomination, as it's a great, fast-playing light-to-middleweight Euro with lots of interesting decisions in a short timeframe, with easy rules and interesting strategy.

1 play, 4er, A-side

Simple action-selection game with an Egyptian theme. Players have sleds with space for up to 5 rocks (nice chunky blocks in player colors). Each round, a random set of boats (1-4 spaces each) are available. On your turn, either load a rock from your sled to a boat, add up to 3 rocks to your sled, or sail a boat that has the minimum required number of blocks on it. The boat will dock at one of 5(?) locations, each of which uses the blocks in a different way; some award VP immediately, others at the end of the round or end of the game. The round ends after all the boats have sailed. The game ends after 6(?) rounds. After final scoring, most VP wins. 

There's some interesting jockeying for position the boats, since they always unload from front to back. But also, there's a bit of push-your-luck: load a boat and risk someone sailing it to the "wrong" port, or sail something yourself? Sail to where you want to go, or to deny someone a spot where they want to go? 

The basic game (A-side ports) was pretty good, but I think the B-side, which has more complicated scoring schemes, would be more fun.

Literally, you are pushing cubes (via a ship), getting points is usually the goal of Euros but this one really takes the cake as a "cube-pusher". And don't get me wrong, I am foremost a Euro-gamer and love my strategizing to gain the highest score, but "Imhotep" might have a little too much focus on the scoring and too little game play fun.
That being said, it was my first game and I played it online. I have the feeling playing it live might add a nice something when you are literally building obelisks and pyramids with your cubes. So, we'll see, I am willing to give it a few more plays and there is chance I might get caught up in figuring out the best strategies but I won't hold my breath, for now it lacks the special for me.

This game was a surprise hit for me at Dice Tower Con 2016. It is relatively light but still has interesting and meaningful decisions without a lot of unnecessary complexity.

Overall I really liked this game a lot.

I enjoyed my play of this.  It is kind of dry, but I felt it was pretty clever.  You often want to do all three main actions, but the tension of only being able to do one is really nice.  For a family game, my choices felt especially interesting and sometimes brutal.  I'm not sure the modular board setup really adds that much, but it is nice to have.  It is probably a little dry for my kids' tastes, but I enjoyed it.  I could see it having fairly limited appeal from a replay standpoint.

tl;dr: it's a medium weight euro!

This is as "German style" as they come: 2-4 players, short rules, a nice mix of strategy and luck, nice artwork, nice components, some strategy but still family friendly. And why not, isn't that the kind of game that made us fall in love with this hobby? If not, you're probably reading the wrong person's opinion :)
In any case: the choices to make on your turn are limited but not easy. What boat do I load? Or do I land somewhere? Or do I replenish my quarry now so I can set myself up for a good move later? That kind of stuff. it all works very well and the different ways of scoring the different boards adds a nice layer of different strategies to explore.
Not the deepest game but still fulfilling.

Really enjoyed how easy this was to learn and set up.  I like that the main boards where you "dock" the boats have two sides for varied play.  I've only played this two player, but found it to be great with two because there isn't a "variant," you actually play the game.  Yes, some of the scoring is slightly altered for two, but you still go through the same motions as you would with 3-4, so it scales well with two.  Sure, it may not quite be as exciting, but you can still foil your opponents plans, so there is interaction (and your choices affect each other).  Great game!  Oh, and the components are nice and thick, and the cubes are large cubes.

Rarely am I so underwhelmed by such a well-received game. Nominated for the Spiel, I had high hopes for Imhotep that took a tumble downward each time I learned more about the game mechanics, and eventually when I had a chance to play it.

The game is simple enough to learn, with a set of rules that allows you to get up and playing quickly. All you really need to know is that, on your turn, you place a block, take more blocks, move a boat, or (if you have one) play a card. All the rest comes down to scoring mechanics -- and this is where the game falls down. The scoring mechanisms are, well, very boring. Cards get you points, either immediately for short-term gain, or at the end of the game for a better pay-out. The other scoring "stations" get you points. You get more points if you time your shipments correctly, sure, but there's not much to it. Your blocks slot into squares, and you get points. That's it!

The real game is in the timing, and in everyone's willingness (and ability) to pay attention to everyone else's plans. If you know what you're doing, you can interfere with the other players by shipping their blocks to the wrong station, or shipping them earlier than expected. But even this leads to disappointing interaction. The game suffers from severe left-right binding problems, where you might get a windfall if the person to your right isn't paying attention. It also creates a dynamic where someone will have to "take one for the team" by wasting a turn to hose someone about to score big. But if no one else is willing to give up their turn to do so, there really isn't much game.

In the end, what little interaction there is comes down to whether or not the other people are paying attention. The rest of the game is a lackluster collection of point stations. I'll pass.

I can see why a lot of people would like Imhotep.  It has a neat mechanic where you put your cubes onto ships and then the ships move to one of 5 different locations that each score points differently.  It's interesting because any player can use there action to sail any ship, so if I put all my cubes on a ship, someone else might send it to a useless location.

However, all of the locations are fairly balanced.  So, it almost didn't seem worth spending an action to sail the ships.  I tried to always spend my action placing cubes and getting more cubes, and I didn't really care where they ended up because they would score points one way or the other.  I ended up dominating the game, so hopefully the strategy is deeper than that.  Either way, I'm not dying to play again.

A wonderful, beautiful thematic abstract. Love the chunky wooden pieces, and the art. I've had multiple plays of this game and yet still haven't even tried the many of the 'B' modular set ups, because there is so much 'content' even without it. And by that I mean, every play I love trying to master the game, and outwit my opponents. I like it with two player or up to four, and how imperative timing is. Working out how you can put your opponent in a bind and limit their choices, avoiding giving them an opening to destroy your plans, blocking the port they want to go to and maximizing the efficiency of all available options - I just love this game.

I'm not a fan of abstract games, but Imhotep is a cut above for that genre. The game moves quickly and each choice a player makes is significant. Again, a bit more dry and simple than I usually want in my games, but Imhotep works well and should really appeal to those who like their games simple, abstract and quick.

RATING: 4
I enjoyed the first few minutes of this game. Basically you are moving blocks onto ships and then shipping the blocks to build structures in ancient Egypt. 
The problem is that anyone can send off a ship as soon as it has reached it's minimum load. What? no control whatsoever. Basically this game plays itself. I was pretty disappointed. I could be talked into trying it again but as near as I can tell the only strategy is to load as many blocks on as many ships until the end then find out who won.

I don't usually go for games this simple, but there's a niche for them... you're generally never going to talk your aunt or grandpa into playing a game with like elves and such in it (unless your family is way cooler than mine). This game is short, sweet, simple, and inoffensive to casual players/non gamers, but still manages to be pretty fun for my snooty hardcore gamer sensibilities. The game involves some interesting manipulation/predictive elements... I'd compare it to a chess-master thinking many turns ahead, but you almost can't at the same time, because every move every other player makes leaves you needing to re-adjust, re-plan, and re-act... In that sense, it's almost more like Dominoes. At any rate, the turn mechanics make the game fun and novel. Some stores charge a modestly low fee for this, really consider it if your collection has room for something approachable... I'd definitely take this over Ticket to Ride in a hot minute, and it's a lot fresher than Catan for me (and like most people).

Very good game. This game combines two elements that I'm seeing more often these days.

First is the "one action" mechanic. Similar to Splendor, Barony, and a host of other games, the tension comes from trying to slowly build up to something one action at a time. 

The second major element is the variable scoring opportunities. This is similar to Medieval Academy where you have ways to score points both immediately and at the end of the round/game.

It's a good combination and the game tends to move fast, probably never taking more than 45 minutes.

The epitome of simple to learn, difficult to master. There's no hidden information (with the exceptions of the future boat layout and the B-side market, which are secret from all players), and there really aren't that many choices you can make on a given turn, yet deciding your next move is agonizing. Game fits the theme perfectly. When one game ends I immediately want to play another. I can't think of a single criticism (besides that it is best with 3 or 4 players, wish it was just as good with 2, but that is hardly the game's fault), it's just about perfect!

Harmless and quick game with easy to explain rules, but nothing really super interesting about it.

It feels almost more like someone took an abstract game and added some mini games to turn it into a Euro.

Its best traits are the play time, the light rule set and the chunky cubes, its also inherently a close game so it helps make games feel tight.

That said the game doesn't do anything ground breaking or exceptionally gripping, but it doesn't do anything wrong either.

This game is simple on the surface, with only 4 (mostly just 3) actions to choose from. The depth of the game comes in the form of a push-your-luck element with the choice between placing another cube or moving a ship. If you decide to place another cube, someone else might move a ship with your cubes on it to a location you didn't want to go to.

Lots of replayability. Almost feels like a wargame.

RATING: 7
Imhotep is a game about getting tones, loading your stones onto boats, and trying to send boats to scoring areas in a way that helps you and hurts your opponents.

You have a supply shed that can hold 5 stones. As actions you can take 3 stones into your shed, put 1 stone on a boat, or sail a boat (if it has met it's minimum stone requirement) to a scoring area. The scoring areas all score points in different ways.

There's a couple of things that make the game very interesting. First, while boats don't have to be loaded right to left, they do have to be unloaded that way. So there's a dance to try and get your stones in the correct position for the appropriate scoring area. Secondly, anyone can send any boat anywhere. If your opponents have loaded a boat in a way that will score a ton of points in the burial chamber, you can beat them to the punch and send it to the temple, where they'll get a pittance. And when it comes time to load a boat, you have to think through whether someone else will send it to the wrong place, whether the other people with stones on it will send it somewhere you want it to go, and how important it is to partner with someone else. There's a lot of thinky stuff going on here, especially for a game that's pretty quick.

About [thing=191862][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=191862][/thing] is an area control/influence game in which players take stones, load them to ships and sent these out to monuments, in order to build (influence) them.

[thing=191862][/thing] has pretty straightforward options for the players actions - only the three mentioned - but they, coupled with positioning, timming and what the others do (usually to thwart your plans) add a good amount of depth to the gameplay. And this is done with a fine pacing: just one action done by turn keeps the game going and the downtime small, even with some thought being given to everything being done - it isn't a surprise that the community put it as better with 4, and, second, with 3 players.

The production value is quite good: the tiles are sturdy, the art is fine enough, and, oh dear, what about those huge cubes? They didn't need to be that big, but, by god, kudos to whoever decided that, well, [i]they should be[/i]. Replay value isn't through the roof, yet is still there: all monuments have an A and a B side that can be mixed and matched, and also the random order of cards also adds more to the variety.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The game lasts for 6 rounds, and at the start of each, a card is revealed and shows which ships will be available for the round. On each turn the players have three options of actions and can do one of them:
- Take 2 stones (a player can have up to 5);
- Add 1 stone to a ship (choosing between empty spaces to place it, if there are more than one);
- Send one ship to a monument (respecting the minimum amount of stones a ship must have in order to be sent out).

Stones are put in monuments in the order they are in the ship - for most places nd moments, the position matter a lot. Points in some monuments are given immediately, while others score at the end of each round or at the end of the game. There are four types of cards that can be taken from the Market when a ship gets there: red cards have an immediated effect; blue cards are kept for later use; green cards scores at the end of the game due to the amount of stones in a given monument; and purple cards are Statues, and the player scores it at the end of the game considering the amount of Statues she has.

At the end of the sixth round, the game is over. End game scoring will happen. The player with the most points will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- When and where to put a stone. This is relevant not only considering the size of the ship, the amount of stones required for it to ship, what other pieces are already there, but also the place in the ship it will occupy can make a huge difference;
- Where to sent a ship. This works both to use a ship in the best possible way for yourself, or in the worst way to affect your opponents;
- When to take stones. This might be done out of necessity (you are out of stones), to stall and try to buy more time, or simply because you don't want to sent a ship nor can add a stone to one;
- What card to take. This is done less often, but still have big importance, as all cards are good and can have an effect in the outcome of the game;

Overall, the decisions tend to be very clear cut, and all have consequences in the game, as the timming aspects in all of them matter a lot, and what could be awesome if done one round sooner, now can be very bad. Being able to seize opportunities, as well as making the right choices, is key to winning.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Excellent production value;
- Great amount of decisions in a short frame of playing time;
- Has a good level of interaction, but it usually doesn't come as agressive or too mean;
- While is more tatical, a bigger strategy can have its place;
- Easy to teach and to play, but offers some depth;
- Fast paced with small downtime;
- Almost no luck (only in the draw of cards for the Market) - players and their choices decide the outcome.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Mostly is an abstract game - the theme does very little;
- Box is way bigger than it needed to be;
- Allows for some portion of bashing and screwing the others.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like having the most reliable quarry works and the most rushed ship capitain in the whole Nile. Egypt wasn't bult in a day, people, could you care to wait for just a little while? And he is already gone.

[thing=191862][/thing] hits many positive notes: it is clean, lean and a little mean - not enough to cause much trouble, due to its short playing time and more laid back nature, but in an amount to put it above the multiplayer solitaire, as there are disputes in scoring, for the places in the ships and the movement of them. [thing=191862][/thing] is the type of game that can found a place both for family nights as well as with the gaming crowd - easy to explain, quick to play, choices matter, little luck. Everyone around here liked it, and I'm with everyone: recommended.

very cool game where you place your stones on a limited number of boats (randomly drawn each round) to get the most victory points. 
You can collect stones, place stones on boats or set sails with any boat to any of the five available spots. As soon as one spot is occupied, the stones are placed on that spot and it is not available anymore for the round.
There are a lot of spots such as get cards (actions, victory points), get instant points, end scoring points etc.)
You can never be sure about points because everyone can destroy your plan in that he sets sails on a port with the boat with your stones. That is quite fun and frustrating :) 
But if you don't like that, it's no game for you. Otherwise clearly recommended.

Cool big blocks are loaded onto boats and then shipped to one of the harbors, where they are used to either build a pyramid, tomb, obelisk or something I forgot, but will deliver a special bonus card. The rules are simple and most tension is the uncertainty whether your blocks will be shipped to the place you want them to be, because everyone can sail the boats.

Imhotep is a nice family weight eurogame with lots of different decisions to be made during each player's turn. The object of the game is to gain the most points by loading stones into boats and then moving each boat to one of several different locations depending on your goal.  There can be a strong "take that" element of the game because on a player's turn they may move another player's boat in order to prevent him from achieving his goal. Super fun, easy to teach and short 30-45 minute play time make this a good game for our household!!!

This game was neat... smooth play that's quick to learn and play.  It's hard to explain why it fell flat though, the points are so tight and close, almost everything you do will just give you 1-3 points.  The frustrating thing is mostly how much other people can screw you by simply driving a boat, and your plans, into a different port.  The game itself was fine... it's an okay game.

A seasoned gamer could practically start playing this without a rules explanation- that's how simple this game is. Due to its repetitive nature Imhotep isn't a filler you'd play several times in a row, but as an opener on game day while waiting for others to arrive it's a solid choice, not least because there is virtually no setup. If I didn't already have several goto gateway games I might consider buying this.

I see why people like this and I can't say it's a bad game, but it does an awful lot of things that rub me the wrong way. I suppose it is one of those games like Carcassonne or Splendor that you can either play nice and casually with one partner or mean and cutthroat with another, and it will work either way.

There is a lot of passing the buck in regards to preventing big scores and wasting moves to sabotage the timing of other players. These are all things I normally enjoy, but for some reason Imhotep felt tedious to me. I think maybe it's the strictly limited one action per turn. I guess maybe falling victim to your opponent's leverage feels worse when it corrupts your only action, versus only having to partially submit to it. I also don't like having to refill my quarry every couple of turns. I think the intent is for that to prevent someone from getting too much tempo control, since a passing turn is baked right into the turn structure for everyone. When one of those resupply actions happens after being leveraged into other more inefficient actions two turns in a row, it starts to feel like the game is playing you rather than the other way around. It can get frustrating quickly. That might just be the super competitive take, but since that is how we tend to play it seems to happen quite a lot.

Family block moving game to be the greatest builder in Egypt. Procure blocks to fill a sled. Load the blocks from filled sleds to varying sized cargo ships. Deliver loaded ships to ports to place blocks at the Bizarre for benefits, majority of burial chamber or build wonders. The trick of this otherwise basic game play is the timing and maneuvering with the other Egyptian builders to land the best point opportunities.

Rating 8-9/10 depending. (I will say I know of no '10s' yet and am not a devotee towards abstract games or even moderately chromed-abstract games, probably the opposite, so this is a big compliment. * However the chromed abstract in its moderate level here does strongly appeal and why I picked it up and will continue to play!)

Do I recommend this game = "yes." Best game i have personally bought and played --- so far --- in the contemporary abstract/euro spectrum - and disclaimer i have not been attracted to much for either cost, interest or mainly limited exposure reasons, i guess.

---- original review ----
Very simple game to setup/play and as strategic as chess. For two-players who will make optimal and correct decisions each turn, it will be anybody's game down to the final two rounds and a couple points using the default "A-sides." Using a couple of the B-sides will likely change this (big positive in design) making things more open to luck or even more fated circumstance, allowing younger players and non-geniuses some breathing space. FANTASTIC efficient game design. Again very much like chess and a vast improvement beyond the minimal limitations of chess. Overall incredible amount of depth and replayability given the A and B-side boards, quality components. The only "knock" (pun intended) is that while the 3D building elements are also great, there is always the possibility of a spoiled sport knocking over the monolith or moving the game pieces (monolith goes crashing into burial chamber, etc) with a swift, accident brush. (Not a big deal but true, the trade-off for cool component building!) Otherwise untested with multiplayer of 3-4 players, as I just got the game and played twice, but it is apparent the games would be less intense or chess-like with the fuller capacity and no doubt brilliant providing even more replayable variation. INSTANT CLASSIC. Game time can vary: 30-90minutes. [Note: If interested I will be writing a more fleshed out 'review' with thoughts and variability on the design structure and factors of playability via the game page > reviews]

This game is just about meaty enough to headline on game night, but plays in the time of a filler.  It really occupies an under-represented category: short games that are highly engaging.

Beautiful Game. Even when your opponents take away your ship, you still get points of some kind. The game is so simple, yet so tactical. This should have beat Codenames for the spiel de jahres in 2016, hands down. Your options are: take three cubes (or up to however many you can fit with a max of five), put one cube on one ship, move a ship to a location (if it has the minimum required cubes on it), or play a blue card. There are five different locations- the market where you can get cards that do all sorts of goodies, I forget the second one, but it's a wall that you get benefits from every round, the third is a pyramid (or pyramids all the boards are double sided), the fourth is a sarcophagus, and the fifth is an obelisk. The difference in ways to score points as well as how thickly the theme is integrated into this game make it truly amazing.

Nice game. I found the system was fresh and interesting. There is a lot of denial in this game, which is often a negative thing in my circle, however in this one you always get something one way or another even if you didn't get to put your brick on the right building. I did not like the reverse side of the buildings as much as the original ones, and would always want to stick to the latter. Otherwise very nice filler.

Great components and plenty of replayability. There are at least five viable strategies in this game, and each way can lead to victory if executed well. Imhotep shines with four, but I've played some great games with two and three.

Quick and interesting... this game relies more on your opponents decisions to provide randomness than the little bit of card drawing.  That means there can be a lot of kingmaking, especially from players that aren't good at readying the board position/options.  However if you like regularly figuring out the balance between moves that most benefit you and least benefit your opponents this can be very enjoyable.

Better than Karuba. (Nominated for SdJ same year.)

Clever game but the randomness bothers me, even though it's a reasonably light game. For some reason, getting screwed over by not being able to place the cube(s) you really want to place annoys me more than in other games with similar mechanisms.

Clever, very abstract, a bit mathy.  Love the B-sides, love that this plays in 45min.

Should hit the table more than it does.

Jó szórakozás volt, ötletes játék, egyszerű kis kockapakolgatás, de mégis határozottan hangulatos. A tematika ugyan csak minimálisan érződik, de ez pont elég, hogy érezzük a kő elemek súlyát, így máris bele tudjuk élni magunkat a témába. A játék minimálisan kiszúrós, de nem direktbe, és egy-egy ilyen lépésnél csurranhat nekünk is valami, nem tudunk nagyon a rossz oldalon állni. Mindezek mellett elég könnyed, de kifejezetten családinak nem mondanám, a semi-gamerek is találnak benne kihívást. Viszonylag gyorsan lemegy egy parti, így azért agyongondolkodni sem kell.

I've rated Imhotep a 6.5 for now.  Unfortunately, I've only played 2 player games.  I need to play more to get a better feel for it and the rating may (probably) go up!

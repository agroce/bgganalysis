A succesful effort to simulate at division level the whole WW1. The game rules are very easy and let players concentrate on strategic matters, even if the unit scale let think to an operational approach.
All chrome is put in random event chits that give flavour to the game. The chits activate also some important events, avoiding the additional burden to keep track of preconditions.
Strange as it can be in a 1400 counter and 3 maps game, GWiE flows fast and can be really completed in a weekend.

RATING: N/A
Looks cool, great Mark Simonich presentation, and I like the fact that all Ted Raicer's WWI games share something of a common look.

But given this is an upgrade/reprint of a game that's been around a while, the amount of counter eratta is somewhat shocking. An entire new half-sheet was printed after the originals were delivered when it was realized there were corrections needed, but there is still significant eratta beyone that, and some of the eratta counters have eratta! Good grief. GMT's productions have been somewhat slipshod a little bit too often. GWiE is a very big game, so it's understandable how errors creep in. But this is a little much, and I sometimes wonder if it's a conspiricy to sell copies of C3I, which I usually buy just to get eratta counters.

RATING: 5
Solo-ed a few months of this and something felt off. Perhaps it was almost too boilerplate hex-and-counter to really be showing me WW1.

I'm hopeful that one or both of Balance of Powers (Compass) and La Grande Guerre (AWE) hit more of a sweet spot for me than TGWiE, although I think I'll give this another shot at some point.

Some aspects of this game appeal strongly: the overall concept, which prevents players from using hindsight to make "obvious" changes to history; the use of chits to drive the development of the war; the simple rules that ought to make a divisional scale game of this magnitude playable. But there are just too many flaws in play for this to be a genuinely decent game. The supply rules are execrable, the changes in the CRT (based on the number of defending divisions) are too abrupt, and the pace and focus of operations bears no resemblance to history.

A easily playable monster game that has a nice feature in that has both sides always busy on one front or the other as well as a clean entrenchment mechanism.  Unfortunately there are several detractors such as weather that doesn't really affect logistics, a combat system that doesn't 'feel' WW1, and the armies are rather generic in their flavor.  Terrain has some strange affects based on weather as well.  Overall an ok game but their are a number of much better games out to cover WW1.

Got a complete play of this great game under my belt this past summer. My opponent and I were pleasantly surprised at how tense the gameplay becomes at times. There are many strategic options for players to explore and the events phase helps keep things unpredictable. Anything can happen - we ended up with a Central Powers victory in Sept. 1917.

On the down side, while the basic foundation of the rules is fairly straightforward, there is a ton of chrome to digest and recall. The first few turns will require almost constant referencing of the rules. Many special conditions and exceptions will come into play, so players will likely find that they have played certain elements incorrectly, sometimes many turns into the game - we did, despite being veteran wargamers.

I played this under the old XTR version and bought the new Deluxe version and gave it another spin.  There are a number of rules that are essentially broken thanks to the supply rule, which is simply bizzare.  So this rating is for the game out of the box.  With house rules or in the unlikely event that there is an official modification, I'd rate the game an 8.

initial rating - errata is disappointing, and the promise of a 'playable monster' seems optimistic; looks like it would take as long as WiF with less strategic paths and more fiddly (stacks of 6).  player hints would be nice esp. for initial German and French set-up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Still not played but after I read the rules I think the game is too much scripted (gallipoli landing is a chit event) and have too much special rules about individual units or hexes, unrealistic restrictions and rules that activates or deactivates over the course of the game with no sense.As an example, a paragraf of rule 17.21: Until 1917 only italian units can operate in italian front. No more than 6 italian units can operate out of Italy until Austro-Hungary fall. After that, all italian units over 6 can only operate on the east front. Italian units can never operate on the Near East Map.

Actualization:
After the first play I don't like the game. All chrome is lost because you have a lot of units, most of them equal, do dozens of attacks all of them very similar and got a ton of units destroyed and rebuild every turn. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice components, Simplified rules compared to Der Weltkrieg series. Units die too quickly however.

RATING: 7
Good: Operational/Strategic - WWI - Easy/Medium
 
Positive:
-Very easy to play. Intuitive non complex rules
-Nice event chits!
-You can customize: either you choose to play the Near East only for shorter games or only Europe for a semi monster. For the real stuff you can set up all!
-Good scenrio's
-Good replay value due to dynamics on various fronts (4 in total) with various scenario's and events.
-Good quality maps / counters /rules etc. 
-Very clear rules. They have a rule summary in the playbook! 40 pages seem a lot but honestly the core system is very easy and intuitive. 

On the down side:
-Counter density: it is divisional level but this game was imo far beiter of with Corps; the map on the Western Front is far too overcrowded without much impact on gameplay. Things get real messy as up to six (!) units may stack, plus Tanks, plus HQ.......
A Corps system with army organization the style of POG and Pursuit would have made things a lot easier. This is my BIGGEST gripe with the game.
-A real pitty about some grave errors on the maps and with units. There is errata to fix but still. 
-Game has different scales for Eastern & Western Front. Logic but not sure how big the impact is on gameplay. Somehow feels a bit odd. 

The last few years my interest in WW I is groing and groing. 6 years back I did not care for it but since Paths of Glory it showed that a WW I strategic game is more stabile than many WW II games on this scale. Overal,TGWIE: Deluxe is the ultimate strategic WW I game around. 

Very playable with comprehensive  mechanisms that work fine. I must say for 78 Euro, you simply can't expect more. The theatres of war play all like seperate games are interlinked. Accessible monster, high replay value and great theme execution.
Draw backs are the map errors and different scales as well as the major counter clutter on the Western front and these issues prevent from a higher rating.

WW I very playable monster.

RATING: 8
Oops. I just ordered this game in blurry moment.
Well, I might as well have 1 epic WW1 game, as it is my most loved era for wargames.

Hoping the Errata won't be to bad.

Update: Errata is fine, although you will need to check every counter, as some where still mis labeled (follow the set-up in the living playbook and you'll be fine). Map errata is a bit more trouble some, since I don't feel like putting stickers on the map, but the A's for Antwerp & R's for Rouen are easily memorized for play.

Still having trouble wrapping my mind around the NO-ZoC of this game, I do like the concept. The supply rules hinder fast action (as it should), but before I noticed this I lost many RU-units because of OOS.
I didn't get to finish my first game (went to May-1915), but I consider it a learning experience.

Conclusion (for now): Good Game, Events bring in a new dimension, Strategic turns work Fluent within the system, but not a game for everyone.

I like what I see in the box.  The maps, counters, playing aids, and instructions are easy to read (my requirement, with forty-nine year old eyes, etc).  Naturally, now that I have a copy, friends are popping up out of nowhere to play.  That's cool.  My good fortune is that I have a table in a room where I can leave the maps and counters undisturbed for as long as necessary.

RATING: 9
One of the better games ever designed.  Unfortunately the GMT edition didn't do it justice.

There are errata counters in the game.  You need another sheet from GMT in addition to that.  And there are some more errata counters in C3I magazine!  

The 2009 living rules file, published more than 2 years after the game's release, do not contain all the errata and contain obvious errors related to this.

For these reasons, I'm downgrading the published product to an 9 until the living rules are fixed properly.  

The base design is a clear 10, however.

Purchased 11/21/2014. Monster game with the full scenario requiring 3 maps to play. Hope to play 11/24 - 11/26 as I am on vacation.

Update: It took far longer to punch, clip and organize the counters than I anticipated. I also had to wait for GMT to send me the corrected counter sheet and map correction pack. I have the game setup now and with 19 days of vacation coming up, I should be able to start. I may even get another table so I can play the full campaign with all three maps.

Simple movement and combat mechanics, but a whole lot to the game beyond this.  A huge amount of replayability to this game by event chits, wherein events that occured now occur randomly!  Besides replayability, this also adds a huge amount of realism, as like the real commanders, you don't know when something unforseen is going to happen.  Taking this still further, there are prewar events which you can use, to change things around before the start of the game.  Each player draws three of these pre-war event chits, and has to choose to use at least one of them, two if they want.  A game with a lot of depth to it!

Ein schon etwas älteres (2007) Ted Raicer-Spiel, das den gesamten Ersten Weltkrieg oder Teilfronten (Westen, Osten, Naher Osten mit jeweils eigener Karte) simulieren möchte. Eigentlich ein Monster-Game (das Full Scenario umfaßt ca. 1500 Counter), allerdings ist der Regelumfang (zumal für Raicers Verhältnisse) überschaubar, die Kämpfe entsprechen mit ihrer Abnutzungsmechanik der Realität und – allen Ernstes – es gibt quasi keine Downtime: Wenn im Westen der Mittelmächte-Spieler die Initiative hat, zieht er seine Truppen zuerst; gleichzeitig hat dann aber der Alliierten-Spieler die Initiative im Osten und kann seine Truppen dort bewegen. Es gibt noch andere WWI-Monster auf meiner Wunschliste, aber dieses Spiel scheint bislang Lern-/Zeitaufwand und Spaß (zumindest für mich) perfekt auszubalancieren. Einziger Schwachpunkt: Auch der Aufbau nur eines Teilszenarios erfordert ein wenig Zeit. Vorteil: Ergibt sich die Gelegenheit, kann das Spiel zu dritt, viert oder sogar fünft gespielt werden.

RATING: 7
This is overall a pretty solid attempt at simulating the Great War. But I have a few issues, without which the game would be perfect(or at least close).
1. There is no representation of railways, roads, or any infrastructure of any kind. Its lack of inclusion of this is perplexing noting their strategic importance during the war. 
2. The resolution of combat. Most units have a single step, and as such are annihilated in order to satisfy combat results. There is no simulation of retreat and there is rarely a reduced side to which a unit can flip. I can't stress enough how irritating and unrealistic this is. 
3. The British. These limey bastards have by far the strongest units in the game until the Storm-troops and Americans come on the board later on. Now I understand this as a mechanic of the early game given the quality of the Troops in the British Expeditionary force. But as far as the game is concerned, the entire commonwealth is made up of elite troops for the entire game. There is a drop-off in quality with some units that enter the game in 1915 and 1916 due to mass conscription and limited training as there was in real history, but the elite units make up a disproportionate share of the British army for the entirety of the game.     
4. Reinforcements. This issue is somewhat intertwined with the combat resolution problem. It's rather odd how meaningless casualties seem to be in this game. Each nation receives a certain amount of points to allocate toward reinforcements during strategic turns, which generally allows most nations to completely replace all the divisions lost in the previous operational turns. This, coupled with the scheduled reinforcements, creates a horrible stalemate on all fronts, not just in the west. My suggestion would be, coupled with the addition of steps and retreat functions to units, to give each nation a finite amount of steps at the game's outset (representing the recruitable population) with which to repair damaged units. 

It's overall pretty solid but these really ground my gears. 

 (The version I bought contained the corrected counters so I didn't experience errata based problems.)

This game, whatever the pro's/cons of its details, appears strategic in scale but is at best operational in scope.  That is, its mapboard covers all of the Euro-Middle Eastern theaters, but operations are restricted to the operational level of war, and strategy is restricted to that which the belligerents actually adopted.  I was shocked not to find Holland or Denmark -- so much for naval flanking maneuvers.  In fact, the maps are all operational level in scale (local vice continental); there is simply one for every area in which the historical strategists elected to campaign.  Worst of all -- there are no navies!!  No options for serious alternative strategies.  Yet that is the whole gaming challenge in solving the problem of indecisive warfighting in WWI: finding an alternative strategy radical and bold enough to overcome the deadlock.  By and large that required continental alternatives and large-scale amphibious warfare, competently executed.  This game locks players into strategies known to be inadequate.  I now have no choice but to shell out the exorbitant cost for Decision Games' Storm of Steel.

It's a good game with nice graphic. The games of GMT are always great product and Ted Raicer is a great designer. The sistem of play is simply and fun with the events.I don't like the organization of the rules; is not simply to find a rule and sometime is not clear. For me is necessary a index. Furthermore a lot of errors in the units, for example in the strategic turn H of GWiNE are listed, in the Counter manifest, like reinforcement, a number of british division; At this turn three others british division had in the counter the entry in turn H, but in the counter manifest are not mentioned. Three useless counter?

Great components, great scale (division, month-long turns, grand strategic, big maps, 1500 counters).  Main game rules are pretty easy but there are lots of special rules to keep track of.  I really wanted to like this game a LOT but in my experience, it appears to not handle the Western Front well in the campaign game (may be OK in the scenarios).  France and Britain can maintain a non-stop offensive against Germany and cause Germany's collapse by 1917 at the latest, barring a Russian disaster in the East.  Disappointing because it is so close to being a game I can love.

Te gusta tirar dados como un poseso? Te gustan los monstruos y los héroes típicos de Dungeons?
Chorra juego filler, sin mucho secreto, pero engancha lo suyo xD
Tiene gran variedad de héroes con muchos poderes distintos que es lo que le da un poco más de gracia y rejugabilidad al juego. Recomendable con pocos jugadores.

Decent, light dice game.  My main problem was it was too good to be so short/light, but it was too luck-y to be longer.  I think it escaped the [b]Quarriors[/b] curse (too luck-y for its long length), but it will stay in the light filler realm.  Good components and a nice, small box.

A press-your-luck dungeon-delving dice-rolling romp!  If any of those terms annoy you, skip this.  Otherwise, play on!  Best played non-competitive and/or against the class' high score(s) since not all classes/characters are created equally, not by a long shot.  Also, it's dice, there's luck, you will win or lose by luck of the rolls - deal with it.  Lots of fun!

By the way, there's a [u][url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/13116354]variant[/url][/u] I strongly recommend.  It's how I prefer to play now.

1st play: Simple fantasy based push-your-luck dice roller.  Easy to teach and one of the few games that you can push your luck and actually win.  Played solo and from what the reviews say, playing more than 2 players just increases downtime for no benefit.  Will try with more on the next play and see how it goes over with the kids.

2nd play: I've explored the game pretty fully after 2 plays.  It's best with 2 as you egg each other into pushing their luck too far.  The character powers are wildly different in power level.. But it's not too hard to know when you should stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is not a bad game, far from it, and it's theme is ok, it is a simple game that is easy to explain and fast to play, but don't expect a deep game and don't expect it will continue fast after you put too many players. The lack of interaction is a problem, too, this kind of thematic game could be more interactive with players helping each other rather than only looking for the dice results of your opponent without doing nothing.

Simple (some might say simplistic) little game that hits a lot of fun buttons at the same time. Dice look OK, cards are meh (not a fan of the art), but the whole package is cute and very well done. My only disappointments are the typos in the rulebook and reference books (how hard can it be to proof those little things?) and I hope the box won't disintegrate (it's a flimsy thing that should have been made of plastic).
My hi-score, if you're curious, is a cool 50 (Battle Mage), followed by 40 (Guild Master).

RATING: 8
This is a fast and easy game that to the contrary of the manual is best played solo to two players. It's very simple and is not a game for a player looking heavy depth, theme, or interaction. 

I have played several games solo and with a friend and as long both players are enthusiastic to play, it can be great fun. If anyone is not then the lack of theme and exciting choices in early phases of a turn will crash the game to a bore.

I have had several moments where I was 50/50 about pushing my luck to continue or retire my turn, but its not super frequent. You'll mostly know when to stop or go on after your first play through or even first turn.

The greatest push moments have occurred when the second player is behind the first player in points on the third turn. Something that I feel is kind of a flaw.

The game feels kind of rough which is to be expected since its the first version. I expect that feedback from the community will elevate the game in future editions should the developers pursue it.

Fresh alternative to other dice games in my collection. Has more depth than Zombie Dice/Cthulhu Dice I would say it ranks on the strategy Vs. Luck scale near Risk Express - there are certainly interesting choices to make each turn and has a great press your luck mechanic (Beware the Dragon!) all while not being overly complicated and frustrating like Elder Sign Omens.

Silly dice-chucking fun. It's really a bit of an abstract game but it lets you play a sort of dungeon crawl in about 20-30 minutes. Two players is best because then the other person gets to laugh maniacally as they roll 4 dragons for you to fight. Plus this game comes with the best quality dice we have found in any game thus far.

No thank you.  The dice can basically be broken down into 'bad' and 'good' sides, and victory is almost solely decided by how many 'good' faces you roll.  Hard pass.

Kickstarter supporter. The delivered game looks geeky. The game box is a trick-box which tries to bite you, very thematical. Also intersting colored dice. And several Kickstarter addons, like the oversized round counter 10 sided die and special role cards, like the Undead Viking are fine. 
Played the game several times solitair.
Missing long term motivation to continue to play.

Not a lot to this one, but it's fun and fast and honestly makes a lot of sense. Basically taps into a player's love of dice rolling/Yahtzee and the most generic dungeon crawling possible, but the addition of the character cards gives it a little more spice. Easy to teach, fun to bring out once in awhile.

Roll some custom dice, use them to deal with the dice rolled by a player representing the dungeon. Roll again to go further in or withdraw with your current loot. Most points after three(?) rounds wins.

I approached Dungeon Roll with low expectations, and it completely matched what I expected.
I am in love with a clever, simple, bare bone push-your-luck game like Can't Stop, and that game's elegance and sobriety is absolutely lacking in Dungeon Roll.
Players have three rounds of dice-rolling dungeon exploration, that feel quite samey and don't need any meaningful decision.
I suspect it plays better with fewer players, but I doubt it doesn't overstay its welcome even with 2 players.

I Kickstarted this one and am glad of it, it can sound like more than it is, but it is very up front at being a Push your luck dice game, which suits me just fine. It is a very engaging solo game if not overly deep, and has proven fun with two players, I have not played it with more than two. However since my KS copy arrived I have more than a couple dozen plays under my belt solo and have enjoyed them all.. I will show others this one and it has a solid spot in my between game light filler game section. Theme, artwork and components alone are all well enough done to warrant the score, the choices you can set up for yourself are entertaining to say the least  and I like that about a dice game, Bring on the deeper but still quick to play and very fun dice games, I am all for it!

12/23/13-
over 2 dozen plays on this one both solo and two player with an adult AND one with a child, who got it during set up and loved it and acquitted himself very well! it has earned its 8. as I await the winter promo, here is to hoping that there are more well themed promos out there to come! fun little dice rolling game, not taking itself too seriously and trying to be something it is not, i.e. some sort of die rolling rpg, its not that, and I am glad of it. I will have to get a more sturdy box for it since I play it so much, I can see that lid popping right off eventually!

RATING: 8
For a push-your-luck (PYL) dice game, I think this is one of the much more enjoyable ones I've played so far.  After a couple of plays, I really like the different dangers you and your hero can get into in PYL situations; ie. encountering the powerful Dragon, or running risk of rolling too many different monsters, or not getting a scroll, etc.

Downtime can definitely be a drag.  I've only played this as a 2P game.  However, I look forward to purchasing an additional base set or more dice expansions (if they happen) to deepen the gameplay.  And this can certainly be played in some sort of campaign format.

What I really enjoyed about this game IS the simplicity.  Many have panned this.  However, I think this is the very charm that the game aims for and succeeds at achieving.  My gf, whom easily gets confused by my deeper, fantasy-set, RPG miniatures board games, latched on to this game immediately.  I have a group that is a mix of non-players, casuals and veterans.  And I'm very excited to introduce this game to them; as I feel it will strike a nice chord with everyone.

I feel this game is also quite expandable, pending on how much you or your group want to get out of it.  It can be just a simple warm-up/wind-down dice game, as it's intended.  Or you can really make it as deep as possible with add-ons and creative content.  So don't take the base game for what it's initially worth, think about the possibilities of what you can do with it!

Played with:  Dungeon Roll (Kickstarter Exclusive Edition) w/ Expansion Pack #1 (Heroes) & added KS exclusives (added dice, Guild Leader, Play Cards, etc).

I have to give this guy a 8 for what it is:  A really fun, added-depth, PYL dice game.  And the value is great.  Much more so than Zombie Dice or anything else.

Such a great filler game. It can be pulled out anywhere, easily transportable, and played in fifteen minutes. It is also very easy to teach. And it is at its best as a solo experience, and it is always nice to have a solo game that is fun, quick and transportable.

RATING: 7
In the end, there is not much to this game.  Even though it is a press-your-luck game, the press your luck decisions in it are almost always obvious.  And, with only 3 rounds, one bust will pretty much lose the game for you.

I would probably give it lower than a 7, but my 7 yro son loves it.  And I would agree--as a cool themed kid-to-teen game, it is pretty good.

Really nice production values, and a theme I like, but nothing else going for it.  There is ZERO player interaction.  Essentially you roll the dice and "spend" them to cancel the black dice.  If you're efficient, you can re-roll just the black dice for more points, but if you fail to mitigate them all you gain nothing and your turn is over.  You get 3 turns.  Everyone sits around and yawns or finds other things to do while you take your turn.  Works ok solo, but I'd rather play a board game app or something than sit alone and roll dice.  This joins A Game of Thrones as the only games I'm sorry I bought.

RATING: 7
Dungeon Roll is a slightly thematic dungeon crawl that plays like a filler but takes way too long for such a little game: in the end the whole game is simply waiting and watching what your opponents do.

Anyway, it gets more enjoyable whenever a little storytelling is added, that is, when both the likely scene each roll creates and its resolution through a player’s choices are described in the typical fantasy fashion.

It’s a real pity there’s no way you can mess with the other players in game.

Only played solo so far. The theme and lots of characters saves it a bit, but I'm not super enthused about the game play so far. I wasn't enthused by the rules, either, but for $15 shipped, it was too hard to pass up. I cant see playing this with more than 2, though. Too much downtime. Totally a solo experience.

The game has potential, but suffers from bad ruleset, everything costs one die, and your characters differ only if you roll more than one of the same enemy... which may very well never happen, this eliminates most of the games choices.

Just when I thought Cutthroat Caverns was the best distillation of the Dungeon Crawl, here comes Dungeon Roll to break it down even further. Fun choices with dice optimization as you push your luck to get the loot.

I think to get the most out of it, you have to have some "long time" with real dungeon-crawl games. Otherwise, it could come across as too dry.

Another simple but clever d6 dice game. but it's basically a filler game that goes on for far too long.  You have only 3 turns and need to do so much with so few dice that it just become painful, especially the down time between turns.  Also, there's not much you can do to mitigate the randomness of dice rolls and treasure pulls.  Overall, I prefer speedier or meatier filler games than Dungeon Roll.

I was actually more dissapointed then positively surprised after first 2p game. The game is super simple, it takes 10 minutes to understand everything. Only thing You have to do "exploring" dungeons is to use dice with symbols to solve the problems like fighting with monsters or dragon, gathering treasure or drinking potions. It is 100% random, push Your luck type, small game. I have to play it more to figure out what to think about it.

*It has a 1p mode that is most likely the best.

I rated this game a 7 for what it is. If you expect too much of this game, then you will likely rate it lower. My daughter,4, and I play this game fairly often. Obviously I do all the figuring out and she just rolls her dice, but still, a lot of fun that I expect to only get better as she gets older and begins to actually understand the game more. I find it a bit too difficult to get beyond the 6th level of the dungeon and the luck factor (with any dice rolling game) is the primary driver behind how far you can go. I'm more of a card game person, but I still give this a decent rating for what it is and what my expectations are/were.

While I was initially very enamored with this game, it has lost a lot of its luster over time. I very rarely play this game with other people anymore. Instead, for me, it's just a fun away to while away some solo time. Dungeon Roll has the benefit of being portable, quick, and easy and that keeps me playing.

This is the first and only "press your luck" game that I've found is worth playing.  My rating is based on the game for what it attempts to be.  Maybe it's the theme or the cards that give a player a unique power that make this feel different to me.   There's not much to think about, but it still feels fun.  Best played solo, I think.  Junk with more than two.

I'd just like to start off by saying that the box and the dice for this game are fantastic!

That being said... It's a dice game and in my mind dice games are never going to be at the top of my list. However this game is enjoyable and there are enough non-dice mechanics to balance out the luck aspect. Combat is very fluid and gets two people involved at a time. My biggest complaint about the game so far is that if your playing in a group with more then three people you'd have alot of downtime. It's an easy enough problem to solve though as I'll probably just end up buying a second copy at some point.

RATING: 6
Some rulebook issues with the first edition of the game (Aug 2013). After much forum-hunting, cursing, and researching, I figured it all out. 

It's a fun little game that desperately needs an expansion or variant to allow player interaction. Right now, it's boring to watch 3 other people take turns that have ZERO impact on you. Plus, there's no way to reign in a runaway leader. So when someone gets lucky on the first round, the next two round are much less exciting. Player interaction and some "take that" elements will notably improve the experience all-around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's a "push your luck" game without an actual push your luck element.  Your basic decision is when to stop going deeper in the dungeon, but in 99% of turns it appears to be very obvious whether or not you can survive another level.

There is a lot of downtime.  How deep you can descend into the dungeon depends almost entirely on what is rolled on the black dice.  Players who get a few turns with multiple chests and potions will simply be able to descend farther than the other players.  No decisions involved.

Bad.  Very bad.

Dungeon Roll is what it claims to be - a quick, nice-looking, easy-to-play dice game that does a good job of melding the theme (dungeon delving) with the mechanics (press-your-luck dice rolling).

It's not a lot of fun, though. Some fun, yes, but not a lot. The decisions just aren't that interesting, and you have nothing to do when it's not your turn aside from chat with the other players.

I can see pulling this out from time to time when I'm looking for a light filler game and the group is in the mood for something dungeony. But it's not one I'm eagerly looking to play.

I wouldn't play this game with more than 2. It shouldn't be market as up to 4 players. But with 1 or 2, it's a fun filler that actually offers very cool decisions (and does not play itself, as some people say). You always have options with the scrolls, treasures, and your character ability. Combo those up well, and you could more than just a village hero.

I was one of those folks that kickstarted Dungeon Roll, seeing the heavy and effective promotion, the $15 price tag, and thought "Eh. What the heck."

Turns out it's a decent little dice filler. Not bad solo! Certainly better than a solo game of Roll Through the Ages. But I'm not convinced it's very enjoyable with multiple players. With four, I simply can't imagine sitting there watching one player puzzle through multiple turns while another person occasionally chucks the dungeon dice. I like my fillers fast paced, and this one simply didn't grab me.

Surprisingly enjoyable. I use the word "surprisingly" because it's a dice game after all, and rolling dice can only be fun for so and so long time - depending on how varying and deep the gameplay is.

A job well done by Chris, this truly is a charming game.

I want to like this game. All the parts of it are great. The dice, the basic idea, the different heroes... But it is just way too random, and it has no player interaction. I think with just a minor addition to the rules somewhere this game could be something, and I'll probably end up playing some variant since I do love the components, but out of the box it's just a toy, and gets boring once you see how much it all just comes down to luck.

The winter characters add a little interaction, but still not really any decisions to make.

I anxiously awaited Dungeon Roll's arrival, eating up reviews before it came. The reviews were definitely mixed,but I liked the theme and this would be my first introduction to a push-your-luck style game.

Based upon my first two plays and the expectations and reviews I have read, I am pleased with Dungeon Roll and excited to play some more. There were a surprising amount of decisions to be made for a light game, and enough opportunities to change your outcome that I feel it even has a light tactical experience.

It is a pleasant light experience that has some thoughtful decisions to offer. I also like the addition of achievements and the scoring system, as it really promotes trying out new Heroes and trying to beat your previous score.

RATING: 4
Exceedingly luck dependent. I know this is a push-your-luck game, but I want to have some options besides the obvious when advancing through the levels. Rolling the dice once and then being unable to do anything with them unless you have a scroll kind of hampers the fun.

I received this as a gift. I don't know what I'm going to do with it. It plays solo, so it can be used as a diversion when I'm ill and can't concentrate nearly enough to play 1P games of Caverna.

Upping the rating to a 4. The game is more bearable with the heroes. I'd even rate it a 5 if played solo (to me there is no reason to play this multiplayer). There are many other better solo games, but this the quickest to set up by far.

RATING: 3
Poorly edited rulebook doesn't help the fact the game itself is fairly uninteresting and requires almost no thought to play.  Decision points either have almost no real possible repercussions, or the odds are so wildly against you, it doesn't feel like a real decision.  House rules might help, but for a game this lightweight anyway, why bother?

I love this game so much! 
This has become my go-to game for lunchtimes with my partner. It plays great with just the two, one rolling their party, and the other rolling for the dungeon. The variety of roles (which include unique powers) make it enjoyable and different every game. And who doesn't love taking their heroes and slaying the dragon! And bonus, it fits in a tiny box that takes up minimal space.

There's a running joke amongst my gaming friends about this game whenever one of us is selling a game—"I'll trade you Dungeon Roll for it." This game is just not great. Not much meat to these bones. I like many light, filler games. Just not this one—too simple and uninteresting and flat-out boring for people waiting for their turn. The components are decent—it just needs a game built around them.

While this game is a fun time killer, it doesn't offer enough in the way of strategy. It's a push your luck game with a fun theme and nice art. There's a host of characters that add to replayability. My biggest problem is that it doesn't feel any different with different amounts of players. It's just X player solitaire with a long wait in between turns.

Why does this not have more dice?  I get that dice are expensive, but you really should include enough to play the game properly - if you are on level 7 or 8 of the dungeon and have a couple dragons in the box, then you better have a good memory...

RATING: 6
As others have said, a basic push-your-luck dice game.  If I were rating it solely on the joy of playing with my four-year old son and three-year old daughter, it would be higher.  The color coordination of the dice is very intuitive for them and it has worked well as a gateway game- they ask to play it constantly.

RATING: 5
A fantasy take on push-your-luck with some tactical possibilities. Can be played alone or up to four players. Two players are the most fun, as the "passive" player takes over the roll of the dungeon master!

Illustrations are not very good and the character on the "leveld up" side looks the same as the beginning character. 
Dices are very well made on the other hand, but the cardboard tokens could be better.

Dungeon Roll completely exceeded my expectations. The components all look great, the game is fun and easy to teach, and it really is an ideal "what can we fit in 15 minutes" game. I enjoy it solo but have had the most fun with it as a 2p game. It's not the most complex game in the world, but there are plenty of decisions to make, and they do affect your score. DR is easily one of my most positive Kickstarter experiences.

The game is a fine filler weight time passer.  Like Castle Ravenloft, I wish the character upgrades were better, or there were more of them.  More than that, I wish going deeper into the dungeon was worth more of a differential in points than just one.  By not making it worth giving up treasure tokens or taking big risks to press on, they made the game all about playing it safe.  Thankfully, it's easy to home rule a fix, but I despair having to do that time and again.  Sigh.

At its core it's a basic push-your-luck game. But the heroes and their special abilities propel it past mediocrity to greatness for this dungeon crawl fanatic. It gives me exactly the type of mystery-risk-reward I want out of a dungeon game, and in such a tiny package. Near perfection.

I recommend not playing with more than two people unless the third person is OK with a lot of downtime between turns.

Interesting dice throwing game of dungeon exploration. 
You get a random character with special passive ability and an ultimate ability and start delving with your company of 7 white dice while dungeon lord starts with 1 dungeon black die. With each passed level of dungeon, hero will thin down his pool of white dice while dungeon lord will increase his pool of black dice.
Lots and lots of luck and minor tactical thinking involved. And there is a bunch of different two sided hero characters. Other side is more powerful version of a hero which is flipped to when level is gained.
Fast and easy. Ideal for 2 players and not bad solo.

*Kickstarter Edition*

I didn't know what to make of this game at first.  My first several plays through were ho-hum.  There's absolutely no player interaction here, and I'm not speaking in hyperbole.  Your opponents' actions will not affect yours.  The game is pretty repetitive.  You go through the same process three times and you watch everyone else go through the process three times.  No interaction plus repetition may make three and four player games boring depending on how you cope with down time.

The victory point chips have different values on each side, and if you're someone like me who fiddles with pieces, they can get accidentally flipped.  Even non-fiddly players thought the design of the chips was clumsy.  The rule book isn't formatted that well, and there are more typos than I feel is acceptable, especially for a game that had 20,000 copies printed.  All the same, Tastry Minstrel is probably more unhappy about it than I am.  I can't imagine how frustrating that would be.  

All that being said, after several plays, I really started getting into the game.  Each hero requires you to think about the dice a little differently.  You create a little engine for your hero based on their abilities and if you do a good job, and the dice are somewhat in your favor, you can have a lot of fun pressing your luck.  I enjoy the puzzly nature of the combat resolution - deciding which dice are best used now and which dice are best used later. And lastly, I really like how treasures combo with each other and with hero abilities.

I think there are some really cool ideas here that could be used to make a knock out game.  For one reason or another, this game falls short of the bar but is still enjoyable for a light two player game.

Yikes. You occassionally get something interesting happening where you have to decide to use your character ability. But that seemed to be once out of your three delves.

This dice game is fun for the first few times that you play it and it is a challenge to beat your score, but ultimately it is a 15 minute filler for you alone or with a small group.  There really isn't much of a challenge except for choosing how to use your heroes against the villains and try to delve deeper into the dungeon.  It's not bad, but it won't be the first game I turn to when looking for a filler game as there are some better dice-based fillers out there.

I'm sure I should give this less, but it was a lot more fun than I thought (maybe as I was told it was like zombie dice) - matching up symbols/colours to enemies and working out when to stop. I was beaten as everyone else had more treasure rolled up. Still it was good fun.

TRADED IT! (for Grifters)

The game works as a dice chucker. The theme is sprayed on and the various characters just augment the bas rules and are not highly thematic, nor is the "level up" mechanic since it just basically occurs while you play.

The treasure chips are what should really make the game exciting, but sadly they just amount to pre-rolled dice most of the time, bringing us back to a vanilla dice chucker.

Can take a while with four players, if people take the game too seriously.  A relatively harmless and quick playing dungeon delving dice game.  It's amusing, assuming you like dungeon themed games. Much improved with the variants posted here on BGG.

Quick game for solitaire, but each game starts to feel similar after 10+ plays.  Opener more than main headliner.

12-22-17  Realized I was playing the potion die face wrong as well as the leveling up of the adventurers.  Am enjoying the game a bit more than before.  Bumped to a 7 for now.

RATING: 6
Pros: It's a quickly played, well-made, press-your-luck dice rolling game. The downtime between turns is convenient for playing during lunch with friends/coworkers. Bring it out for casual play or as a gateway game for those whose comfort zone it fits.

Cons: The downtime between turns means it is not an engaging experience for multiple players. I'm sure someone could home-rule a better multi-player variant.

Overall: I'm not going to play it with as much interest or competitive fervor as many other games, but I'm still glad to have this sort of option in my collection.

In Dungeon Roll the player's goal is to collect the most experience points by defeating monsters, battling the dragon, and amassing treasure. Each player selects a Hero avatar, such as a Mercenary, Half-Goblin, or Enchantress, which provides them with unique powers. Then players take turns being the Adventurer, who boldly enters the dungeon seeking glory.

The Adventurer assembles their party by rolling seven Party Dice, while another player serves as the Dungeon Lord and rolls a number of Dungeon Dice based on how far the Adventurer has progressed through the dungeon. The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.

All this fighting in the dungeon is certain to attract the attention of the boss: The Dragon!

When three or more Dragon faces appear on the Dungeon Dice, the Adventurer must battle the Dragon. Defeating the dragon is a team effort, requiring three different companion types. After three rounds, the players add up their experience points and retire to the inn to celebrate their exploits and to plan their next foray into the next deadly dungeon!

If you look at it as a dungeon crawler, then you will be disappointed.

This is a push-your-luck dice game with a dungeon crawler theme. The theme is not just pasted on, but it's rather light and it remains at its core a dice game that is mostly based on luck. Interestingly, it's not so much about what you roll, but about what the other guy rolls for you.

If you take it for what it is, then this might be a fun filler game for you (if you don't mind that there's zero player interaction).

I guess I liken this to playing solitaire (i.e. Klondike). It's a totally random experience and while you have some choices, your control feels very limited. Solo you really don't want to push your luck until the last dive or abandon your run as soon as you do fail, so it's a little anti-climactic. 

It is more fun as a two-player game where the push your luck element is much more enjoyable due to trash talk.  But it still suffers in that if you push your luck in your first dive and fail, your opponent can play it safe all of theirs and likely win.

Still, it's an easy game to play and my spouse likes it so solo I give it a 5 but multiplayer a 6.

I have to say I dislike playing this game alone. Alone I feel no accomplishment when I go through the dungeons to either die or return to the dungeon for another night.

There are a couple of nice ideas in Dungeon Roll but all of the thematic sauce cannot really conceal that there are hardly any interesting decisions in this push-your-luck dice fest. Most of the time it's fairly obvious what to do. In addition, the variance introduced by the dice is pretty high (yes, even for a dice game) and what really kills it is the excessive downtime, especially with more players.

"This is an amusing solo filler diversion.  Haven't played with more than 1, but I don't think it would be much fun given it is essentially multiplayer solitaire. As a solitaire game, I like the large number of different heroes, as it does change the strategies required (although I would think as some are better than others, it could make the 2 or more player game unfair)Still, I really like the dice, the box is cute and a nice thematic touch to get the treasure out. Key strategy is to get to 5XP on first delve. I am happy with this Kickstarter as it doesn't claim to be the deepest of games, and delivers what is promised (rating 7). UPDATE: As a two player game, this is not as enjoyable. Seems more mechanical, and the last player can push their luck if behind, so it seems a tad unfair. So, whilst a solo diversion, would not play again as multi-player, so rating drop from 7 to 6 (Dec 2013). UPDATE:  ... and then I suddenly realised, this game is just missing something. It's too mechanical. It's a 21st century version of shut the box, no strategy, little tactic requirements, and there just are better solo games to play (rating decrease from 6 to 5) (Jan 2014). UPDATE I think I'm keeping this solely for the cute box (Rating 5.321 Jan 17)
High Scores: Crusader (29), Occultist (24), Enchantress (27). Knight (22), Mercenary (23). "

Not a bad little push your luck game with a dungeon delving theme, but not a lot of interesting decisions to make, and lasts a little too long to make for a really good filler.

The lack of interaction between players makes this game a bit of a snoozer. The components, the push your luck dice aspect and the overlaying fantasy theme are all very nice. Dungeon Roll even has some well written rules and has a n unique scoring guide for solo games. The game just misses where it counts the most, it's just not very fun.

I want to like this game! However, after several plays, I don't see this one hitting the table anytime soon.

Nice dice with good iconography and use of color for the characters and monsters in the dungeon. The artwork on the character cards is just ok and the rulebook isn't clear at all which is a shame. (Definitely watch the video which explains the rules of the game)

The game is a light diversion and I always like pressing my luck. This game will get old pretty quickly. I wish they'd spent more time on the rules though rather than doing a rush job to get this ready in time for a convention. Kickstarted.

I loved this the first several times I played it. It's a very good, press-you-luck dungeon crawl simulation using nothing but cool-colored unique dice. But it's VERY THIN when it comes to strategy and is 90 percent luck. Okay, 99 percent. 
Bring this out as a filler when you're setting up another game and it will be a hit. I think it's best for 2 or 3 players, but it will really drag for 4.

Should really be viewed as a solo game. The more i played it, the more i liked it. You have to understand that you are going into it in an attempt to beat your old high score. That is the purpose. You arent coming away with a sense of defeating a dragon or anything. Still, it was better than I thought. Bought it on a whim, didnt have fun at first but adjusted my perspective on it and then it became a keeper.

Meh...  It's not a bad game, but it's a push your luck dice roller that doesn't give anyone anything to do when it's not their turn.  Might be ok with only a few players, but at larger player counts, laws of averages take over and your decisions matter less than ever.

Would be a lot more fun with shorter turns, or some way to screw with other players, or something.

Dungeon Roll is a light dice game, and yet another entry into the roll-three-times genre. And yet, it manages to feel rather different than many of these, which tend to focus on "making sets" with your dice faces. Instead, Dungeon Roll uses two sets of dice, one representing the evil monsters and one representing your heroes. Almost any die face can be used to kill any monster, but certain faces can do so more efficiently. With judicious use of the many re-rolls available (for both sets of dice), players will push their luck in terms of how efficient they dare to try to be instead of simply going for some long-shot combination. This is enough of a difference from typical games of this ilk that deserves a place on almost any gamer's shelf. 

In addition to this basic structure, it includes a tons of character cards, which grant an exclusive special power to each player. This gives a strategic direction, as well as (usually) another way to mitigate the outliers of bad rolls. The fast play and interesting powers lead to lots of "one-more-game" feeling, since you want to try them all out. 

Scoring is mostly open, but the hidden treasures also grant some secrecy so that the game doesn't give the last player the advantage of knowing exactly how many points they need. This is a problem that surprisingly few games of this type realize needs to be addressed, and it is handled quite well here.  These treasures can also grant more special powers, but of course at the cost of giving up the points granted by the treasure. This too creates interesting decisions. 

This is a game with broad appeal and yet enough distinctives that it really feels like something new and different. Not an easy task with such a small design space. I see this one becoming one of the classic filler games.

Eh.... it was ok but I don't really understand why this game got so much hype.  The characters were clearly unbalanced in an annoying way.  The pushyourluckness worked ok but it was too fiddly for that mechanic.  It falls well short of the great streamlined PYL fillers like Can't Stop and Cheeky Monkey.  I don't regret playing but I won't be searching it out again either.

An interesting press-your-luck game.  On one hand, the strategy is generally pretty obvious.  On the other, it's just plain fun to play either side of the dice.  Although there's a little down time in a game with more than 2 players, it's rarely more than a couple minutes.  Having so many heroes to choose from helps spice it up beyond a game as stupidly simple as Can't Stop.  

Some house rules may improve it, such as treasures only being worth 0.5 XP instead of 1 XP to promote using them to get further down the dungeon.  As it stands now, it is better to take a chest than to save a hero to make it down a level.  Maybe an exponential XP scale would help.

Amazing little game! Small dice games are where it's at. Even the box is utilized! You take everything out and put back the treasure tokens to draw out of. You basically push your luck digging deeper and deeper into the dungeon with your dice. How many levels of XP can you get? Lots of fun. Short, simple, easy to learn / teach.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable with 3 players, solo is so far ok to see how far you cang et but without the competition it seems bland. After a few plays there are situations where one player just falls behind massively and cant recover, maybe due to the balance between heroes or just the dice gods. More plays needed to decide

Once you slog through the muddy rulebook and finally figure out what you are supposed to be doing, it's a very fun game!

Fast paced game that seems best played with two players.

After some back and forth, I decided to get it. I am still waiting for it to arrive to Italy (so I preordered it), and will be using the AWSOME DR Level Tracker, to immerse a little more into the game.

Looking forward to playing it with custom dice (I have tried the "naked dice" version, but it was too abstract).

For now, it is a 6,5. Lets see when I get the full game, what the score turns into.

Dec.13th 2013: After many plays, I think this is definitely a 6.2. Easy and quick.

Got this in a trade and realized its the Kickstarter version! Its really nice having the few extra things that came along with it as it will lend a bit more longevity to the game. A nice little solo/filler type game. Rules are super easy to go through and the player aids sum everything up neatly. You can barely call it a multi-player game though as its really just solitaire. Just the same its fun and fast and will very likely stay in my game collection forever.

Dungeon Roll works fine as quick luck-pushing game for two or three. It's far from perfect, but it delivers some thrills in a small package.

Initial rating: 6.0 (October 2016)

Dungeon Roll was an unknown to me. I have heard about it, but I didn’t know anything about it. My playing system said we had to play it this past week so we did, and I was pleasantly surprised by it.

The rules are easy to teach but harder to learn from the rulebook. You can teach it under 4 minutes. Playtime is around 20 minutes.

The game components are very well done, the dice are gorgeous and the art is very good. The game comes in a treasure like box that its cool looking. The cards are big and when you sleeve them they don´t fix into the box again, a huge minus for me.

The theme is ok.

There is lot of luck and chaos in the game, but that’s part of the fun in this case, besides, the game plays rather quickly so I don’t mind about that. The decisions aren’t hard by any rate, you need to use your dice in the best possible way and that’s very obvious, but still there is some fun in the game.

Each player will play 3 times delving into the dungeon and then the games ends.

Bottom line, Dungeon Roll is an ok dice game but it isn’t a push your luck game (you either have the dice you need or you don´t), it is perfect for the family or to introduce non-gamers to our beloved hobby. It is definitively too light for my tastes, but I could play again if requested. I will sell my copy of the game ASAP, but it was better than expected.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 3
Dungeon Roll is a simple dice game that is best played solo or with another player. In the game, you roll a set of party dice and delve deep into the dark dungeons to face off against increasingly difficult dungeon dice. The game plays quick, is easy to learn and is almost entirely dependent on luck. Make of that what you will. I know I did.

First I thought this was my kind of Yatchy. BUT this is so much more. How ever can one build such deep theme from a "simple" dice game about crawling to dungeons I don't know. I love it. Very quick very easy. Only down side is that even though it plays with 1 to 4 players (you could probably go to infinite players) but there's downtime from 3 players up. So I have to say that this game plays best as Solo or Dual. Great great game!

Roll seven dice. Then let the opponent roll a progressively larger number of dice for each level to try and take the treasures. A decent dice game that relies heavily on luck… but it's really two players ONLY: everyone else will sit around bored.

BIG MINUS: advertised with the wrong number of players, often not as enjoyable as it may look

The 4 player is totally unworthy because you will expend half of the time of the game waiting the other players play the game. 2 players should be normal but this game has so many random factors and luck involved that you actually don't have any choice at all.

Solitaire possible. *

This game works as a solo game or a 2-player game with the each player rolling the enemy dice during the other player's turn. 

This filler with a small footprint becomes more fun as I get familiar with the strategy of using the treasures.


* I have upgraded my rating to an 8 based on how often I play this game, especially solo.

RATING: 5
A fun, fast pick-up game. The 3 and 4 player "game" is a complete joke (like claiming that Solitaire is multiplayer because the second player can just wait until the first player is done and then take the deck for their turn). The game also seems a little lacking in the meaningful decisions department and seems to mostly play itself. It's unclear if it's going to stand up to long-term play. UPDATE: Dropping this from 7 to a 6.5. Simply doesn't have legs. UPDATE: Dropping from 6.5 to 5. It doesn't hold up at all.

I thought this was terrible. There are no meaningful decisions, and no interesting ones. With most dice rolls it's obvious what you should do. It was like Yahtzee, with monsters, and without the fun. This surprised me given the quality of other Tasty Minstrel games. I was hoping for a nice filler. It was disappointing. For me this was a small step above a roll-and-move game like Snakes & Ladders.

The dice: fantastic.

The game: blech.

Well when it arrived it was smaller than I had imagined for some reason. Its small size is a plus though, doesn't take up much room for the number of plays it will get. Yes it just a push your luck game, but its still easy to play and there is enough fun there to give back. 7 plays in the first 3 days says it all.

It's  Sept. 2013 and this game  is new and seems to be on a lot of gamers' radar.

It's okay but it's really just a dull and boring solitare dice-rolling game (and I'm one that usually tolerates dull and boring rather well).  There's nothing exciting about this especially when it's not your turn and you have nothing to do but sit and watch others (or not) roll the dice (similar to other dice-rollers but this one just seems more boring).  And the game feature whereby the next player in turn order rolls your dungeon dice for you really only seems like an attempt to force others to be "involved" in the game when it isn't their turn.

When it IS your turn the game play is okay with the different "things" that defeat various "monsters" and may earn you "treasures" which are quite useful later in the game.  But this  part of the game just isn't good enough to make the whole thing worthwhile.

I debated giving this a three rating but decided it wasn't "bad" just dull and boring.

Right now I enjoy the game, but am not entirely sure if it's worth keeping. Pushing your luck may be one of the main mechanisms, but I rarely feel compelled to do so. When you're on level six of the dungeon and have two party dice, is it worth risking everything for one additional point?  

Hardly.

With so many excellent dice games already in the collection, is merely "okay" good enough?

The game is as expected very light and random. This is actually what made me buy it. I thought it would be a nice "dungeon" game to use as an introductory game for younger kids and a good Christmas gift. It may still be but not now, not yet. The rules are very confusing and incomplete. There is an errata-faq out already which is almost as long as the original rules. I cannot give this to someone and expect them to find the errata and look at every instructional video on bgg in order to play.

Surprisingly hard to grasp the details (the rule book is good but succinct) but very entertaining and not nearly as formidable as it seems once you're in the swing.

Cool little press-your-luck, dice-rolling game. It's an exciting game with some good strategy, in correlation to your character's ability. Reaching into the treasure chest box is always fun, too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game has really high-quality dice. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it. 

The cool mimic box started to fall apart after opening it a few times while getting treasures. The back flap of paper started peeling. In addition, all the cards are  extremely thin cardboard and feel no thicker than two pieces of paper. 

The heroes do not add much to this game, sadly. I constantly found myself ignoring their skills and just rolling the dice while delving. When I remembered the hero cards' attributes they maybe helped me take out one die. Since the game is completely random and dependent on dice rolls, there are times when your delve will not have a chance to use any of the heroes' skill options. That totally sucks. 

Lastly, I felt completely bored while others had their delves. There's nothing to do. In other games, you're usually actively thinking about your next move, but since there is no next move for the other player except to roll the dungeon dice, your mind wanders. I really wish I hadn't backed this on Kickstarter. Luckily, I sold it (but I lost some money in the process).

The Adventurer assembles their party by rolling seven Party Dice, while another player serves as the Dungeon Lord and rolls a number of Dungeon Dice based on how far the Adventurer has progressed through the dungeon. The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.

Easy to pick up rules (although I did watch Radho's runthrough before purchasing, that might have helped quite a bit.) Quick playing with interesting combos/decisions.

Rated 8 after one two-player play, one solo. Increased rating to 9 after a further 5 plays. Very enjoyable, quick, game.

Edit 22/8/2016: 30 plays in, the game is much improved by the Active Dungeon Lord variant described here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1020669/active-dungeon-lord-buffed-scrolls-thematic-potion

I love the packaging design, everything fits well and the quality of the dice is excellent. Illustration is good, character card is clearly layout, the book that described all the characters is very neat and the rulebook is okay. I added two small ziplock bags to hold each type of the tokens to keep things ultra organized.

So far tried solo with three of the characters. Lots of fun so far. looking forward to play this with more people.

Would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a dungeon delve light dice game.

Played 3 solo games in a row.  I'm not good at rolling dice, apparently. This game will probably be similar to roll through the ages for me.  I'll play for a while, figure out an optimal game plan, get a high score or two, and then put it away for long periods of time.  I think the kids will like this, though, so it may see some decent table time.

after a video review

Looks interesting. Small and simple with a good choice of decisions for a dice game.

After playing

The game is interesting, the mechanics is cool, but I think I would have preferred an a bigger game using the same core mechanics.

Yes, you can level up your character once, but you do not feel like you are building up your character or your party. I would have made the party build up between quest much more detailed where more strategic decisions could be made to survive the next encounter entry.

Also, the play 3 turn and count score does not have any climax. Instead, I would have made people power-up their party until one of the player succeed level 10 to end the game. Now that would have been much more interesting and created an end game climax.

But I bet that it could not that hard to add as an expansion or homemade variant. 

UPDATE:

I tested some variants, and designed one where the Dungeon master have actually choices to make and the dynamic is much better. But the game is longer, and more than 3 players should be too long. But keeps more player active at the same time.

When I saw Dungeon Roll at it's first GenCon I thought it looked like something that I would probably like. A risk management game about dungeon diving that has variable player powers and lots and lots of dice rolling. I decided to check it out at this year's GenCon and I wasn't disappointed. Sure, its random and chaotic, but that is what makes it fun. This game occupies a gaming space that is exactly where I am currently at in my gaming life. A nice light filler of rolling dice and screaming when you your champions are triumphant over the dragon. So grab your dice and lets go into the dungeon and roll some dice!

Another good-looking dice filler from TMG (the ones behind Martian Dice). This one has more strategy than most of other dice games which makes it more interesting but, being a "multi-player solitaire" (as most of the dice games), it can end up being a bit too serious for a filler.

4 players feels a bit too long, and some Heroes seem to be more powerful than others... We'll have to keep playing to find out!

I'm a fan of goofy little push-your-luck dice games. I didn't back this on Kickstarter because I don't back much of anything on KS (and didn't see any reason for it to require KS, but that's another story), but it's definitely something I looked at. Turns out, it's a fun little game with some great looking dice. The people who say there's no interaction are right, and I wouldn't play it with more than 2 because there's just nothing to do when it's not your turn, but it's not a bad little diversion in an attractive package. Won't set the world on fire, but not bad.

A dice game where you roll dice to defeat monsters.  Another player plays the DM and the rolls rotate.  You are trying to overcome traps, defeat monsters, etc.  Eventually if you roll 3 dragons, the boss dragon shows up.  

I liked the game.  But I played 2 players and some people have said the down time can be very tedious with higher player counts.  I did not see this as an issue, because I often will get involved in other players turns and watching the outcomes.  It is an ok game.

High quality dice, nice enough cards.  Double sided xp tokens are a minor quibble but work just fine. 
Ultimately it is all I hoped for. A quick, portable, fun dice game with a fun theme.  Would benefit from some player interaction.

I like dice fillers. Martian Dice and Zombie Dice are two I would rate favorably. I appreciate that Dungeon Roll wants to be a fantasy-themed, dice filler. The problem is that it is too complex and too long to be in the filler category. That puts it in the short game category. Even as a short game, I have criticisms... long down time, unbalanced characters, and mechanics that aren't well thought out.

Great game. Really simple once you've played it a bit (really, really simple) and amazingly quick to burn through the 3 rounds. Solo is surely best, or as a pair having a bit of fun. But I really like it - and have only played my games using random picks of the heroes. All fits in the lovely little chest box too. I've got the Kickstarter edition.

RATING: 7
Decent light push-your-luck dice game. Good cards, great dice (some of the most crisp and consistent engraving/printing I've seen), well-printed textured thick cardstock tokens, and a box that everyone emphasizes is shaped like a treasure chest. I'm going to tell you something ELSE about this chest: all the components take up only about 1/3 of its space (room for expansions?), so this's one of the few games where you won't spend 5 minutes micromanaging the contents of the box to make things fit.

Now, on to the game! Past, go away. You're not here anymore.
Dungeon Roll conveys that RPG-like feel of having several options that are all either no-brainers or really situation-specific, requiring particular Heroes and die rolls to pull off. It does this in a way that, despite being really simple, shows its depth in practice. 
Take for example your typical dungeon crawler: on any given floor, there's probably some chests or treasure laying about, but also probably some bad monsters. Sacrificing a Hero die to get a chest/potion is like actually crossing dungeon tiles, fighting dungeon monsters, taking dungeon damage, and losing one of your Heroes in the process. They're the same functional equivalent, except no they're not, this paragraph is stupid. Let's try again.

The heroes and different die faces allow a decent variety of strategy for such a short, casual game. The tokens mostly just represent points or more fighters, which works for this game, but I'd like to see a proper RPG's story play out. Still, the use of tactics in this game is unique and I haven't seen another game like it. Worth picking up if you want a quick'n'easy RPG experience for any number of players.

ADDENDUM: Having acquired more of this game and given it much more thought, it now gets a 7. It allows probability calculations (and Hero selection) to benefit you quite well and so I don't call it a game of luck.

I bought Dungeon Roll with the hope that it would be my go-to solo game.  I thought the Dungeons and Dragons theme would be a fun one to mess around with.  The game had some other good things going for it: special character abilities, leveling up, custom dice, and nice artwork.  All good stuff!

After a few games it became clear that the replayability just wasn't there.  Even with different character cards to give you various special abilities you're essentially just rolling dice over and over again to see what happens.  If that wasn't bad enough, good or bad, what happens isn't really that interesting.

RATING: 6
Good fun for 1 to 2 players, but the lack of other player interaction can drag with more players. Excellent production quality with beautifully made dice to make a simple, but satisfying dungeon delving luck-based dice game.

The biggest issue is the little-to-no suitable incentive to push further into the dungeon - would suggest checking the variants available by other users, and give this game a few playthroughs before you decide to buy it.

I realise it's flaws, but I've found ways around it. I still play it, and have zero regrets buying it.

RATING: 6
Mostly "push your luck" but strangely not many real choices and even with all the stuff to add theme, it seems bland. I have the KS mimic box but no other cool things. 

It plays quick, and randomness kills. Overall fine production and good stuff for what it is. But I have more fun with Can't Stop vs this and more theme with D-Day Dice. At least its cheap.

It misses the mark slightly. It's just not chaotic enough and strategic enough. Prefer zombie dice over this. Nothing in this game gives me the same rush that I get when I see those shotgun dice!

It feels like a solitaire game... To be an exciting multiplayer dungeon crawl it would need backstabbing and other interesting forms of interaction.

I don't hate the game, its just not good enough to make it to the table often.

Another fun, quick, filler game.  The heroes add a bit more depth than you'd find in your average push your luck game.  Yeah, we're looking at you Zombie/Martian Dice.  Don't let the BGG hype get you all revved up and just take the game for what it is, a light, fast, filler.  Oh, and one piece of advice...WARNING! WARNING! This is only a 2 player game.  Do not play it with more people or they will be bored to death watching you stretch out a short game into an hour long ordeal.

Along the same lines as Martian Dice and Zombie Dice, but more complex (in terms of components and setup) without the benefit of added depth, and it feels like there's very little real meaningful decision making.  There are constant decisions, but they're almost all fairly obvious so there's no real room for clever strategy.  I can't imagine how boring it would be to play this as a three or four player game.  Mildly enjoyable as a solo game and it's appealing to my kids.  If you want a good, quick solo or multi-player dice game, go with Skyline instead.

I can't recommend this with more than two players. Downtime is simply not something you should have in a game like this.

But with that caveat, I like this game for what it is: quick, simple to teach, simple to learn, fun dice roller with a neat theme. Roll some dice, kill some monsters, fight the dragon, collect your treasure, compare your scores.

With two people, it's just the right level of engagement for a light, thematic, dicefest that requires a bit of skill in managing your party but can be enjoyed on a very basic, shouty, funny, push-your-luck level.

This is what a thematic filler should be, really.

What really urk'd me to give this game such a bad rating is seeing A copy in a link from BGG @ "Boards & Bits" for less then the MSRP of the Kickstarter. With free shipping at that. This doesn't seem right. Yes, I kickstarted this to help get a game started and into production. No, I had no intentions on paying more then I would at other retail outlets then directly with Tasty Minstrels. I understand they had problems getting the game out, and I understand that they wanted to bring it to GenCon to help promote their company. But I do not understand how they can lower the price below what should've been the best deal available. Obviously production cost wasn't as much as first advertised. I Doubt very much my rating will change. Ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The theme is good, the components look great, but that's really the only positive.  I would barely call it a game, there are almost no decisions to make.  If you can go further or not is usually very obvious so you just leave and take you components.  Any other players really serve no purpose as you could just sit and play the game by yourself.  Got it, played it a few times with my wife to try it out and I doubt it will ever come off the shelf again.

Awesome dungeon delve game that my son particularly enjoys. In fact he's tried to teach it to friends and at age 6 it hasn't gone over too well. There's actually quite a lot going on so although the young-uns can play they do need a bit of guidance. 

There's a ton of luck involved but at the same time quite a few decisions, tons of combos and cool characters to explore.

I'd love to rate this higher but as the game is today you really don't do anything at all when it's not your turn except root for or heckle the other players. Perhaps the future will bring some player interaction.

For a game with 14 dice I found it very innovative and challenging. You get better at it as you play it, and the different characters add a nice touch of variety and replayability (not to mention room for expansions). It might be a multiplayer solitaire but I certainly have a lot of fun with it!

Dungeon Roll is a fun little (literally) press-your-luck dice rolling game that after a few plays, can be played in about 15 minutes. The point is to delve as far into the dungeon as possible, using Party Dice (Mages, Clerics, Fighters, Thieves, Champions and Scrolls) to assist you along the way. You also have a Hero card that has an ability that can be used at any time, as well as a One-time use ability that can be used once per round (three times total per game). Each level of the dungeon, you have to fight more and more Dungeon Dice (Skeletons, Oozes, Goblins, Dragons, Potions and Treasure Chests).

Although it is a simplistic game, the fact that it can be played in 15 minutes and the fact that there are some random elements (which Hero are you going to pick and what treasure are you going to attain) that add some nice variety.

So far this has only been played two players. A good thing too as there’d be just far too much downtime if we were to play with three or more.

This game was promoted on KS as a ‘push your luck’ game  but really, the optimal path is so obvious a lot of the time that it is, in fact, a ‘luck’ game. That is, the player rolls the dice, and then will usually have their options decided for them by the circumstances of the game. There is a slight amount of decision making, but not much more than that.

On the upside, the components are nice and it’s not too involved.

I’d hesitate to call this a ‘dud’ but it is unlikely in the extreme that I’d have this as my first-choice game in most circumstances.

In Dungeon Roll begeben wir uns als mutige Helden in einen Dungeon, um reiche Beute zu machen. Dabei würfelt der aktive Spieler Würfel, um eine Heldenparty zu bestimmen.

Dungeon Roll ist ein kurzweiliges, witziges Spiel für Zwischendurch, was natürlich mit einem enormen Glücksfaktor versehen ist.

This game was a huge disappointment for me. There is simply not enough to it. You roll your hero dice, resolve them until you can anymore. Then come out of the dungeon and repeat. It's boring on your own and even worse with multiple players because of down time.

Right now 8.5 - and might move up.  I have a tendancy to over-rate games early (when I am still obsessed with them - and this one is definately in "obsessed" mode).  Will re-evaluate in a few weeks to see replayability.

I may also re-evaluate when I have the actual game (right now using a PnP version).  So far it seems REALLY good though.

One thing I find interesting is that their does seem to be a decent amount of "real" decisions for a dice game.  My "proof" to this point is somewhat anecdotal and limited, but I and my eldest son win most of the time.  The younger son rarely wins.  This seems to indicate (Again, in limited plays) - that to some degree, that strategy does indeed effect outcome.

Essayé à 2.


Un jeu de stop ou encore ou on doit atteindre le plus haut niveau (8). Les dés blancs combattent les dés noirs.  On lance tous les blancs, puis 3 dés noirs, s'il y a des dragons on les met de  côté (à 3 il faut le combattre) (niveau 1,2 ou 3) on résout le combat et on décide si on continue ou pas. si on s’arrête on prend autant de points d'expérience que le niveau atteint. Si on échoue on ne gagne rien. Le tour suivant on recommence au niveau 1.
Le jeu se déroule en 3 tours.

Essayé sans les cartes.
Facile mais zéro interaction avec les autres joueurs. J'aime beaucoup les dés gravés et le format de la boite. Cependant cela ne sera pas un achat.

Not a bad filler game.  Nothing to write home about either.  It plays quick and has some enjoyable unique powers.  However, I tend to play more conservatively in general, so press your luck games tend to fall a little flatter with me.  If you like push your luck games and want a nice filler you may want to give this a look.

A very light game (which I knew when I KS'ed it), not much player interaction, the characters don't seem all that diffrent, but for the price and amount of stuff it isn't a bad alternative filler to play while waiting for the rest of gaming group to arrive. When the expansions come out, will consider based on price.

My rating is based on the kind of game: A quick dungeon delve filler, to pull out 15 minutes before dinner or similar situations. Gives his best as a solo game.

Some people says there is no strategy in this game. Here is my strategy, after about 30 plays:

1st delve: must get 5 XP to level up, maximize treasures
2nd delve: maximize treasures
3rd delve: maximize dungeon level

I always play trying to go as deep as I can, not just for the final score. I like depth!

Also there is some tactics in each dungeon level.

Hey strategy and tactics are about 25% and 75% is luck, but this is what the game is: SAVE THE VILLAGE AT ANY COST!

This is a pretty decent solitaire game. The components are nice and the dice feel solid. The rule book suffers a bit due to its small size. Although the game is marketed as 1 or more players, it really doesn't work as anything other a single player game. Although if you feel the need to have you friends roll the dungeon dice for you while they wait for their next turn...go ahead.

RATING: 6
An okay game that suffers from a few minor issues. Fist, it was marketed as a "push your luck" style game, but your chances of surviving the next level, and therefore your decision to advance farther in any given delve, is fairly obvious. The far more interesting choices in the game come from how to use your adventuring party, your items, and your special powers. The character powers are extremely varied, so much so that certain characters have obvious advantages over others. Another problem is the downtime when playing a multiplayer game. The player rolling the dungeon dice has no agency in the round and thus even that roll feels pretty empty. 

All of these shortcomings added together has convinced me to treat Dungeon Roll as a light solo (or two player) adventure game. This addresses all the problems above. Rather than being frustrated by the imbalanced character powers, I am now trying to figure out the best strategies with each. While I have seen some disparaging comments about the powers elsewhere, I do feel like different characters have to approach the dungeon delve in subtly different ways. Even still, the game is in no way spectacular, but as a solo game it is a decent filler if I have a few minutes to kill in the afternoon.

RATING: 7
Don't expect much from this game, but it is a nicely replayable filler-weight game. The number of characters makes the replayability much higher. But the randomness of the game mechanics is a turn-off for some (and one of our players thinks that the Alchemist is an auto-win character--not sure of that myself).

Fast filler that attempts more than it delivers. Still, It is a good filler for a couple of games once in a while, especially for RGP or D&D fans.

90% of the rolls finish at lvl 4-7. Items make more differences.

Waiting times times between turns are long. Not to be played by more than 3 players!! Even 3 are too many.

Items are worth more as points (they are worth the same as dungeoneering for 1 full level, and usually you need more tan 1 item to complete a level) -> Maybe this not great for the game balance (or maybe it is, I need more games to decide).

Characters seem unbalanced (some of them).

If you fail one delve, 99% you will lose the game, that means you can lose the game on the first 2 minutes and then having to "endure" the rest of the game...

Very simple, light (very light) game, a standard push your luck kind of dice game, that tries to be nothing more than it is. If you approach it as that, then you are in for some fun.

Enough variety in the gameplay via the different characters to warrant replays, at least for me.

I doubt the game works well with more than 2 players, and I even prefer to play the game solo to beat my own top-scores.

Deduct 1 from my rating when not using the variants for potions and scrolls (potions does not require use of a party die & lets you resurrect a die (not a die with scroll on it) from the graveyard when used & scrolls can re-roll any active dice but include themselves in the re-roll instead of going to the graveyard).

RATING: 6
It takes the Fistful Of Penguins model (have three turns, score as much as you can in each turn) and warps it a bit. Instead of purely rolling and manipulating your dice, you roll once at the start of your turn and then try and match off against dice rolled by an opponent, being 1 die, then 2 dice, then 3 and so on, stopping when you reckon you won't be able to match off against the next lot of dice, and then scoring VP's equal to how many turns you lasted. By matching off against treasure rolls, you can pull treasure out of the chest, which are worth 1 or 2 VP each, or can be used to effectively create a spare die to get you out of a jam. Anyway, there's not much cleverness you can bring and the decisions on what dice to use to match off are pretty straight-forward. There's little manipulation or re-rolling assessment. You get what you can get, stop when it's unlikely you'll be able to get thru the next round, score points. Hope that over your three turns the dice were kind enough to match nicely and that you were lucky enough to pull out lots of good treasures. There's lots of pure downtime between turns, luck over-dominates and there's not enough interesting decision points when you do get to have your turn.

"Dice filler that has too much downtime with higher player counts. Best solo or 2p."

What I like:
- Clever dice mechanisms
- Heroes give good variety

What I don't like:
- Waiting for someone to complete a delve can be a bit dull
- Numbers on the level D10 are really hard to read
- I would have preferred a normal size/shape box

I like games with low interaction, and I like dice fillers. DR runs long for a filler (50 minutes for my first 2p game), and the downtime between turns is a bummer. 

There are definitely decisions to be made, mostly about how to use your treasure.

Based on one play: Although this is basically just a dice rolling game, the theme and the fact that another player rolls the monster dice does add some fun to the game. One player rolls his party dice and then another player rolls the monsters based on the level (1 die for level 1, 2 dice for level 2, etc). The active player must go through as many dungeon levels as possible with his initial party. Not much thought to it, but it was fairly fun to play.

RATING: 1
One of the worst filler "games" I have ever played.  With solo play or 2 player, the pain is lessened because it can be over rather quickly.  But with 3 or 4 players, you will spend quite a bit of time playing with your smart phone.  IMO, games of this weight should either be designed so that turns are quick or present some sort of device where players remain involved when it is not their turn.  This game fails on both of these. And rolling the dungeon dice when it is another player's turn does not count as interaction.  If I am rolling your dungeon dice, I could not care less what is rolled.

A press-your-luck dice game with nice components and smooth game play. Rolling the dungeon dice gives something for a second player to do during the active player's turn.

It seems like they wanted a push-your-luck design with decisions like, "Do you enter the fifth floor of the dungeon? You might not be able to defeat five monsters!" But it ends up just being a mathematical certainty that there's no combination of symbols which would end in victory, so each player just goes as far as they can go, and then they stop when they're forced to stop.

This game either needs more chaos, or more interesting decisions.

RATING: 6
(5+ plays)  I had a lot of fun playing this one for the first time.  It's an active push your luck game with lots of small decisions with unclear consequences.  The simple mechanisms of characters fighting monsters, quaffing potions to power up, and looting the dungeon blended in the theme far better than I expected.

One negative is that it is rarely a difficult choice of when to quit rolling and take your experience.  Since the game play is so much fun, I'll hope that a future expansion helps to work out this kink.

Another problem is that the symbology could be greatly simplified.  For example, there is a die face that represents a thief, and a treasure token that represents a thief, and can be used the same way - but they are different symbols.  Why?  It's just another thing to explain over and over again for no understandable reason.  I am already thinking of ways to replace the tokens in the game.

The Hero character powers are the crux of the game, and combining that with the usable treasures you collect during the game are the drivers.  The heroes are generally either a Hare (bad dice rolls are worse, good dice rolls are great) or Tortoise, (any dice rolls can be made just a little better).  The wild dice rolls are more fun, but you can be out of contention easily that way.

Just got Dungeon Roll and have to say im not impressed. I am rating this game on just a few solo plays "thats what I got it for" And there is simply No Solo game there. This could have been avoided if I read the rules more clearly before I purchased,but even if I played with a small group I cant see the game being that much better if Any.
That being said I cant be that upset with the game because of the price,You get cool dice,Nice cards with great art work and the box is a Functioning Treasure Chest!
If your looking for a press your luck Dice game I dont think it gets much better than Zombie Dice but I will say if you want to try out Dungeon Roll you have Nothing to lose as I think the Components alone are worth the money,And if you dont like the game play you can probably come up with a better way to play using what you get inside that cool Treasure Chest!

This is really just a solo push-your-luck game. (Having another player roll the majority of your dice for you so you can call it multi-player is just dumb.) Multiple players can then go sequentially and compare scores. The dice/components are really nice, but there are just much better push-your-luck games. There is an unofficial rules variant in the games forums that does make it slightly more interesting.

Pretty light game (although I think there are decisions to be taken along the way contrary to some other opinions) but I like the theme and the large number of heroes (17 with the KS release) makes it very replayable. I find that tracking our own statistics adds to our enjoyment of the game, even after many plays... 
Quick playtime (fewer players the better - most plays actually solo atm) so it's easy to get a few games in...

18/09/2013: Received KS purchase. 

21/09/2013: Best filler game in my collection.  Plays quick and easily with games completed in less than 10 minutes once I get the hang of the gameplay. 

Would have been a "10" if not for the multiplayer solitaire aspect which would indicate more downtime as the number of players increases in a game. Haven't played this with others, though I would envision that the game ought to be kept to a maximum of 2 players per game to ensure that the gameplay experience is smooth for everyone.

Minden játékos kap egy szerepet, amihez kalandozókat toboroz össze kockadobással. Velük kell legyőzni különböző szörnyeket vagy magát a sárkányt. Közben minél több győzelmi pontot kell összeszedni.
Nem egy bonyolult, kockáztatós kockajáték, ahol elég nagy szerepe van a szerencsének. Nem érdemes egyszerre túl sokan játszani.

RATING: 5.6
Simple and quick push your luck game.

You get an exploration party of 7 dice.  You decide how many levels of the dungeon you want to take on.  First level of the dungeon is one die, 2nd level in 2 dice, 3rd level is 3 dice, etc...

For push your luck, I prefer Zombie Dice or Can't Stop.

By the way, did anyone else think that the 10 sided die is confusing.  The "dot" is supposed to indicate which side is up (so you can tell a 6 from a 9....it just doesn't seem quite right on that die.

I also created a variant for this game:  https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1381172/beware-dragon-variant-dungeon-roll

RATING: 6.5
I've really enjoyed this game. It's a simple push your luck style dice game. You start off with a fist full of dice while the "dungeon" has only one. While your dice are worn down by attrition, the dungeon's dice only grow in power. Also, you have a character that can level up (once) and you get loot. Fist fulls of dice + random loot. That about sums up the game. The dice themselves are also very, very nice, and the game comes in a neat treasure chest box.

Dungeon Roll is light and fun and makes for a good, quick filler/transition game on some of our game nights. While it can support a large number of players, it plays best with 2 and is okay with 3. 4+ means you always play something else. Only two players have anything to do at a time, and individual turns run just long enough to let the extra players get bored. 2 is perfect though, especially for use as a filler between games. I've even enjoyed playing this game solitaire a few times trying for high scores.

MSRP is $20, but I've seen it hit the 50% off bin at Barnes & Nobles a few times (which is where I got my copy). For the quality of the contents and fun of the game, I think it's worth it, even at the $20 price.

Good quick game.  Minor thinking required.  It will be a welcome break from the longer extensive games.  I don't recommend more than two players. According to the instructions, two people play while the others just sit and watch.  doesn't make sense.  Just keep it to two players.  I also don't understand why you would make something that requires you to roll up to 10 dice, but then don't give you ten dice.  Either way, minor problems, still a good game.

This is just a great solo push your luck dice game and might even for me replace roll through the ages as my go to solo dice game.

Only a two-player or solo game. It takes way too long with more players and the downtime is painful. I think the cards and tokens add a bit thinking to this simple game but in the end they don't make this more of a game, rather just add additional playing time and slow it down.

6.5 After initial play and not knowing about the game before hand.

First off, this is really only a 2 player game, 1 person dice questing, the other person , rolling for the monsters.  Having said that, its quick and fun.
With different starting abilities / character's to choose from, it has variety to increase replay value. Time will tell, as to whether the game itself does.
For me, it has a feel similar to King of Tokyo, another quick push your luck dice game.  Every dice you roll has a use, perhaps not the one you were looking for, but a use all the same.  Additionally, you can mitigate your luck somewhat by using the special powers on the character card.
After each level completed, you choose whether to continue to quest, or decide whether your party has been battered enough by the DM (Dice Master).

Way more fun than I had expected, my gaming buddies and I have played this for hours at a time while chilling at our favorite bar. Games are fun and can be ended quickly if needed, and it doesn't take up too much table space. The dice and card art are well designed, and none of the Heroes feel unbalanced.

The game is a fun luck pushing mechanic that certainly relies on luck, as most die games will, but not so much that you don't feel like you have zero control of a situation. It's a fun mix of luck and strategy, and easily worth it's $15.

Light dice game. Excellent production. The price point is quite inviting. I like to play it and the more I play the more I enjoy it. There is a variety of characters that make each game feel a little different. I think that the amount of decision making feels just about right for this short game. I have only ever played solo or with one other player. More than that and it might feel long. And, the costumer support is impressive.


I suspect I am the worst Dungeon Roll player. I find the game a lot of fun and very interesting. I am still not sure when it is the best time to open treasure chests. It just seems a waste to spend a die just to open one treasure chest early in the delve/game but sometimes it seems to help. It is not always obvious to me when it is the best time to use some of the ultimate abilities. Depending on the combination of treasures that I have, I find sometimes hard to figure out if I am likely to squeeze another point by going just one more level into the dungeon or if I will net negatively if I do so. I also enjoy the art and the production quite a bit.

Exceptionally fun light dungeon crawler. The addition of getting to be the dungeon master for the other players is a fun distraction when it's not your turn. Theme is tired, but variety of characters, treasures, and outcomes feels very fresh. Probably one of the better filler games I've played.

10.30.13 I found the game lacking any real merits. I like dice, solo games, and dungeon theme, so I should love it. There is just no much of a game here and to me this is the poster child of problems with Kickstarter. The backers put money in so rate it high, when in reality, this game would probably never seen much in the way of sales. A lifeless filler in which I can find so many other better games in the same time frame.

Pretty fun, light dice game, with an engaging theme and good components... but extremely luck heavy- even for a dice game. Extreme luck would be one thing, but it compounds it with not having very many interesting choices... most of the time. This game fluctuates between obvious decisions (most of the time) and clever dice manipulation with almost a puzzle solving element to it. The more treasure you have, the more choices you have, and the more fun this game becomes. I really wish there were more treasure involved and more often in this game.

The first two dungeon levels are pretty worthless- no choices really, they just take up time, and are basically about randomly whittling down your party... I could stand starting the dungeon at a higher level, because the game really only starts to get interesting around the third level.

Two players, and this game is pretty manageable. Three, and downtime becomes an issue. Four players, and this game really drags. Not good for what is essentially a filler. I've created some cards to use with a simultaneous play variant found in the forums. This really helps reduce the downtime, but is kind of fiddly. 

There is a press your luck element in this game, but usually it's pretty obvious when you are done. Out of the 10+ games I've played, I've only struggled with deciding whether to go on or not twice (out of 30+).

A reasonably well balanced press-your-luck solo game.  Very low on choices and only has replay value from the array of heroes.  Too bad there aren't a few more choices in the game, as that would make it really shine.  As is, I enjoyed a short series of solo games, but now I'm definitely done with it.

Also, while the variety of heroes helps add a little replay value, they are terribly balanced.  But, luck is also high, so maybe you won't notice...

It has some fun elements to it, but in the end I'd rather play other games with the Yahtzee mechanism.

Thoughts:
- Its simplicity and quick gameplay makes it great for a warm-up or inbetween game.  
- While there is some strategy involved in to do with dice rolls, when to use character abilities, and whether or not to press on to the next level, it is still driven by the luck of the roll.  The strategy plays out in what you choose to do with what you get.

Dungeon Roll is a simple competitive push-your-luck dice game.

One of best things about Dungeon Roll is the speed of the game.  An entire game can be played in under 15 minutes.  That makes this game great for short time frames.

Dungeon Roll is purely a dice game. Dice represent the active player and other dice represent the dungeon he is exploring.

Each turn the player rolls his dice. He then uses those dice to adventure as far into the dungeon as possible. Once a die is used it can not be re-used.

The opposing player acts as the dungeon and rolls dungeon dice each round equal to the current level of the dungeon the player is on. This way the dungeon gets progressively harder the further the player adventures.

Three runs through the dungeon and the game ends. The player that explored the furtherest wins.

A single use activated character ability helps the player each turn.

Dungeon Roll truly is very simple. It uses only a single mechanic and has minimal components. The game is easy to learn and fast to play.

The theme is entirely pasted to the game. This push-your-luck system could be used with almost any theme.

As push-your-luck dice game go, this one is slightly on the complex side, residing under more serious games like Ra Dice or Roll through the Ages, and above something like Zombie Dice. It's still purely tactical and retains the 'I push my luck, then you go' mechanic, but the choices are a bit harder as there are more combinations to choose from. The game takes longer to teach than Martian Dice from the same publisher and the turns are longer also increasing downtime, which diminish the main advantages of games of this type: quick to learn, quick to play and quick turn changes. For this reason, for a filler in groups without previous knowledge of the game, I would pick Martian Dice first. On the second hand, if you are into this type of games, and are likely to play with same people, the increased complexity may become an advantage and downtime is likely to decrease. Various special powers drawn at the beginning of the game increase replayability, making it possibly one of the longer lived dice games.

Push your luck dungeon dice game.  Not much on the theme really, other than the dice and a character card.  The treasures are an interesting twist, use them during the game to help out, or save them for VP at the end of the game.  Kinda fun solo, but better with 2 or 3 people.

Bought this game for a business trip since it could be played solo or with a small group quickly. I hoped my daughter would like it more since it was competitive but not direct conflict.

I haven't really played many dice rolling games, so i can't really guage this game against anything...but we all had a great time playing a quick game and plan to play more. 


After a few more plays, I did have to lower my score just a bit. It's still very fun, but we found that it stalled a bit with more players. Still, it's entertaining for a quick pick up and play game with a couple of people.

For what this game is, I can't think of a better light game.  Once you get good at it, you and a friend or 2 can blaze through several dungeon delves in no time, have some interesting decisions, push some luck, hopefully get a couple really lucky rolls and tally up your scores in the end.  There's no better light dungeon crawl game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice little push-your-luck dice roller with a cool dungeon theme (including unique characters and powers, leveling up). Probably better with fewer players -- most people are just sitting around waiting for their turn; even the Dungeon Lord has very little to do. Fortunately, turns are reasonably quick, but this is probably best with just 2 (or one?). 

Decent, but I prefer games where I can do more (like coming up with combos in To Court the King). Here, you're just allocating dice with no real dice manipulation, other than what your character's special power may bring into play. Most decisions seem pretty simple, and you're just playing the odds as to whether or not proceed deeper into the dungeon. 

Still, with so many characters to try, I'll end up playing this more (maybe solo) and the rating could change a bit.

--- Summary ---
Setup: place all treasure tokens in the game box

Game Play: 3 rounds.
Each round (player turn = Delve):
1. Current player (Adventurer) rolls all 7 adventure dice and untaps character card (becomes tapped if you use your Ultimate ability)
2. Dungeon Lord (player to left) rolls n dungeon dice (n starts at 1). Any dragons rolled are placed on Dragon Lair card.
NOTE: For steps 3-5:
- All dice spent in go to the Graveyard immediately
- THEN, apply their effect
3. Monster Phase: Adventurer spends dice killing all monsters (if cannot, end your turn immediately)
- a fighter (green) can kill ANY NUMBER goblins (green)
- a cleric (gray) can kill ANY NUMBER skeletons (gray)
- a magic user (blue) can kill ANY NUMBER slime (blue)
- a thief, and any of the above, can kill ONE of anything
- a champion (lime) can kill ANY NUMBER of ONE type of monster
4. Loot Phase:
- a thief or a champion may open ANY NUMBER of chests
- any other character may open ONE chest
- draw one random treasure token/chest from the game box
- ANY die may be used to drink ANY NUMBER of potions; for each potion used, return a die from graveyard and choose its facing
5. Dragon Phase: if 3+ dragons on Dragon Lair card, you either:
- fight the dragon: 
... spend 3 dice, each a different type of adventurer
... all dragon dice removed from Dragon Treasure Card
... earn 1XP and 1 random treasure token (from game box)
OR
- end your turn immediately
6. Regroup: Either
- end your turn. If n = 10, you MUST end turn. Earn n XP. If you have reached minimum XP shown on character card, may level up (flip card to level 2 side)
OR
- go deeper in the dungeon: n=n+1; Dungeon Lord retrieves all dice except dragons; go to 2

Treasures
- when earned, draw randomly from game box
- when spent, return to game box
- unspent tokens are worth XP at end of game

End of Turn
Pass ALL Dungeon and Adventurer dice left.

End of Game
After 3 rounds, earn additional XP:
- 1XP / remaining treasure token
- additional 1XP / remaining Town Portal
- additional 2XP / PAIR of dragon scales
Most XP wins! Tiebreaker = fewer treasure tokens.

RATING: 7
This is a lot better than most other press-your-luck dice  games like Zombie Dice and Martian Dice.

The game is played by rolling 7 "hero" dice then rolling a number of "dungeon" dice equal to the dungeon level starting at level one and increasing by one each round.  The different hero dice are used to conquer the results of the dungeon dice.  The further you go the more experience (this game's points) you receive.

It is still a pretty simple press-your-luck dice game but to fill a few minutes this is, like I said, a better option than most because the decisions actually feel a lot more important than whether to just go again or not.  Plus each player plays a hero with certain special powers giving it some variety.

Definitly one of the better "throw dice and push your luck" kind of games. There are actually 2 players throwing dice, 3rd/4th player simply has to watch (very high downtime if the adventure goes well). Wouldn't play with 4 or even more. Best is 2 or 1.

Wonderful little small-box push-your-luck game with absolutely gorgeous dice.  Variable player powers, interesting choices, solitaire play.  The only thing that lowers it is that it is completely solitaire even with multiple players, and a 3-4 people, to downtime makes it a bit boring.  Excellent 2-player fodder, though, and super portable to boot.

[Tasty Minstrel Games 2013 edition] {Dungeon; dice-rolling; optimal solo} Dungeon Roll is a mediocre dice filler.  Decisions are limited, subject to luck.  There is lack of player interaction.  The abilities of Heroes are obviously unbalanced -seems the designer wants to create more booster packs.

Nevertheless, this is an ok solo game.

It's mostly mindless die rolling. It was cute at first, but the lack of any decision or tension, long downtime, and poorly balanced characters dragged down our opinion fast. We played with a simultaneous play variant that makes the game a lot faster and fairer, but we'd really need another set of dice for it to work well, and even with that the game is still too dull to bother with. It's a die-rolling game that has almost no die-rolling, and almost nothing going on other than rolling dice.

RATING: 6
Really great game.  Always willing to play -- a different game every time. No more than 3 players or people get bored. This is really a 1 or 2 player game.  We've added a house rule to let each non-hero player reroll 1 die before the hero gets his/her turn.  Keeps people engaged, also adds a little dramatic affect. UPDATE: I find myself grabbing this game and playing solo whether someone else wants to play or not.

Also has great fan-made expansion material under files.

If you take all of the push your luck out of Can't Stop, tack on a theme which is just as thin and bump the price up then you have Dungeon Roll. In a four player game, there was never a decision or debate about whether to stop. Either you had enough dice or you didn't. Just terrible.

RATING: 3
I've played this a few times now. It is a fairly fun solo game.  I like to play it, and it's neat seeing how some characters can handle the dungeons as opposed to others, but because of the dice, it's all just luck, and having the character be able to adapt to that luck.

Not much in the way of decision making.

But this game is not good multiplayer.  I would probably never pull it out again in that case.  Seeing how another player luckily got to level 7 because of favorable dice rolls, and then you can only get to level 4 because you've fought through the hordes doesn't translate into any level of skill or even fun ability to taunt your fellow gamers, doesn't make it all that compelling.

That and it's horrible with downtime, you basically are watching someone play the game for half, 2/3, or 3/4 of the game rather than having any input at all.

The games tend to play out similarly every time. You can only make it so far into the dungeon and the amount of points you get tends to even out (you spend a treasure to go one extra level into the dungeon, then you have essentially lost a point in order to gain a point).

The different characters and the treasures offer enough variety for a couple of plays, but that's about it.

It seems that this isn't a well-loved game on bgg or among serious gamers elsewhere, but I like it. I mainly play it solo and it's good, dumb fun. It doesn't take a ton of time and is a decent filler game. Lots of dice chucking, a bunch of luck, but there are still some decisions to be made. Sure, it's not deep or complex; but do all games need to be?

Not a whole lot to this game. Really just roll your dice and score up your points. Do it 3 times and be done. 

If you like this game to begin with it will play just fine 2 players as well. It's really just a solitary delve into the dungeon so adding a 2nd player isn't bad but any more and people will be sitting doing nothing waiting for their turns. Best probably as a 1 or 2 player game.

Dungeon Roll is a game that my son got for his birthday. I had sorta seen something about this game, but never really paid it much attention.

It's a quick filler game which is all about rolling dice and pressing your luck. The dungeon theme actually works fairly well. The game isn't terribly deep by any stretch of the imagination, but there are some decisions to be made. But make no mistake, you will feel the luck of the dice in this game.

This game is great for what it is, a light family-friendly filler game that you can play quickly. If they had tried to make this game more than what it is, or if it took much longer, then it would have fallen flat, but it's quick enough that it works perfectly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can say that I went with some dread to play this one: most of what I read around here about it wasn't good - too much downtime, too few decisions. But, after playing, I like it!

Sure, it is a push your luck type of game, since you can't know what the dungeon dice will turn up, but you do have some control over your destiny, and you also make some choices that do have impact in the game. [thing=138788][/thing] is quite light, and can be teached and played by basically anyone, and, since there is a good deal of luck inserted in the gameplay, you can play to the max of your abilities even when facing newbies or non-gamers. You might have a small advantage by knowing the flow of the game, however this won't guaranteed your victory. And, maybe because I do like to mess with other players when they are playing, I didn't fell the downtime as an issue - but, it is indeed faster to play with three.

Also, for my surprise, everyone that played liked the game - so we went to play three times in the night. The decisions aren't hard - basically is what best die or dice to use against the dungeon dice rolled, usually pondering what to save for the next levels of the dungeon, and when to use the abilities of the Hero character, and, of course, sometimes it won't matter (like, you saved a fighter, a cleric and a rogue, only for in the dungeon dice appear three oozes), but it is part of the game, and makes a thematic sense, since your party are exploring, and can't really predict what lies ahead.

A full game, even with four players, took us around 20-25 minutes, which is great for repeated plays. The bits of the game enhance the experience: the dice are really well made, the art on the cards are nice and even though I wish the treasure tokens were bigger, they do the job just fine - for the price that I paid, I can't ask for more than what I got.

So, somewhat surprisingly, [thing=138788][/thing] turned out to be a good addition to my collection (I was considering selling it even before I played it, and now I know it would be a mistake), since I enjoy push you luck kind of games and also portable and fast fillers.

The most fun per cubic inch of any game I own, I think--and possibly most fun per minute of gameplay. I can't imagine turning down a game of Dungeon Roll, because it won't take long and it will be entertaining. The 3yo loves it, the wife enjoys it and I've enjoyed playing it with up to 3 players. Not sure if the lack of in-game interaction would make 4 players drag a bit, but with 3 it seemed fine.

Really a 1-2 player game because there is nothing to do during an opponent's turn and gameplay never effects other player turns.  Dungeon Roll is extremely random as the mechanics are almost entirely based on rolled dice.  The components are stelar, the dice divine, and the Mimic box is an awesome piece.  Special props to a Kickstarter game with a $15K goal generating 250K.  Overall I might give DR a score of 5 purely for game play but the components sell it at a higher rating.

Pretty awful. No reason to care about other players' turns, nothing to do or think about on other players' turns. What's the point of making a player roll the dungeon dice if they can't make any decisions? Should have been a co-op or pure solo game or something--it might be decent that way. As it comes in the box, it's garbage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First, I have to get something off my chest: this game has too much downtime with four players. In fact, I would not play this game with more than two players since there is a fair amount of waiting between turns and there really is zero interaction between players. 

That said, this game sure has potential as a two player or solo affair. I actually detest solo gaming as I find it a boring exercise. This is especially true for games that feature lots of dice (qwixx, mosaix, Einstein, Roll Through the Ages, etc). After a few solo attempts, I usually decide that it is just not worth my time. 
However, there is something different about DR. The various hero abilities makes the game ever slightly different each time I played it. This makes the game a winner thus far. The KS version comes with 17 heroes. So, it will take a while to go through the entire deck a few times. I suspect that the game will get old quickly once I cycle through all the abilities. Still, that should take a while. 

The other aspect of the game that feels unique is that the game arc is slightly different depending on the composition of the party. It is good that you only roll all the party dice once. Sure, there is a huge dose of luck involved, but it forces you to adapt and make the best of the situation. This concept is different from many other dice game where you are allow to reroll dice a handful of times. For example, in roll through the ages, I feel compelled to increase my population to get more dice each and every game I play. The gameplay arc feels very samey and gets boring really quickly.

Still, this is a dice fest which I fully expect to get bored after some plays. 

It will be interesting to see if TMG comes up with more expansions. If they are smart, they will not only come out with more characters, but also alter some game play elements to make it a co-op game or increase player interactions. Merely coming out with more characters won't cut it for me.

If you're like me and you like to upgrade your games out of the box: The cards are very large and do not fit in standard TCG game sleeves, so I give each player a hard top loader (like the kind you ship cards in) to put their hero card in. The cardboard experience counters can easily be replaced with glass beads or mini D6.

I realized halfway through rules explanation that I'd played this game before -- back in November 2012 when it was still a prototype. I even still have some notes regarding suggestions I made at the time!

I disliked it at the time; the published version is certainly an improvement, but I still find it to be solidly lacking. What I find most interesting is that most of my major complaints with the prototype were actually addressed - just not as much as I would've hoped. The biggest remaining issue is the downtime; I realize this is also an issue in beloved games like Can't Stop, but it's certainly not a good thing.

The original was excessively random, new version is slightly less so (but still very swingy). Your ability to push your luck was extremely limited, and now it's still limited but you have at least a few options. Relatedly, you had little room for finesse and the dungeon progression curve met a very sharp end point - this is again slightly improved. The original had no sense of progression, and now you have accumulated treasures and a level-up.

So I guess it's nice to see that the published version is clearly improved and my feedback was assumedly taken to heart -- I just wish it was further polished to make it 'more' and offer more interesting decisions to players.

Bad filler.  There's a thin layer of chrome on here, but if you scratch very hard, it's a dice game where you manipulate symbols to match other symbols.  Snore.  Characters don't help much, as they're either almost irrelevant or overpowered.  Downtime gets terrible as soon as there are more than 3 people playing.  Push your luck is done much better in other games, and the theme here is so non-unique that it hurts.

RATING: 5
(Aug 2013 after 1 3p game) - Good set of rules, lots of custom dice and a little bit of a step up in complexity from the other TMG dice rollers (Zombie Dice, MArtian Dice, etc).

This game will have broad and great appeal to a lot of gamers and the "D&D" crowd based on theme.

Downside to me - this game works best as a solo game since there is so much waiting around for other players to finish their dungeon crawl (rolls).  There is currently no interaction among players so I don't think I would play again with more than 2 unless we really needed dice rolling 30 minute filler. 

For me - I would rather play a number of 30 minute card games instead, but I am not a huge fan of dice.   

The box is pretty neat - a treasure chest.

This is a clever enough push-your-luck dice game with a cute theme, but it's not without its issues.  When playing four-players, the downtime can be pretty severe (no joke:  I was having a conversation with another guy not in the game when I didn't have to do anything, and it didn't affect my game at all), and then there's the whole randomness of the dice thing that can be a huge swing in or against one player's favor.  I can see why this is voted best with two, since it means that the players are always engaged, but I imagine that the randomness can have a larger effect in that case.  I mean, I'm not going to turn down a chance to play it, but I wonder if this is another game that's going to fall victim to TMG's hype engine.

This was pitched as a push your luck game, but the only time that really comes up is when you decide whether or not to advance another level in the dungeon. You only roll the dice once and you do that at the start of your turn, so the decision to push on is usually fairly obvious.

That nit-pick aside, I think Dungeon Roll does provide a nice puzzle solving diversion. Again, some choices are obvious...but the character powers do provide players with the ability to make some clever plays.

It's not even close to being able to carry a significant portion of game night, but as a warm-up/closer I think it works great, especially considering the low price tag.

Sehr netter Dungeon-Crawler als Würfelspiel. Hoher Glücksfaktor aber auch noch genug Knobelpotential. Wenn der Dungeon-Meister mal wieder echt fies würfelt, kommt man nicht besonders tief ins Gewölbe.

Very few meaningful decisions. Score is determined by what is rolled on the black (enemy) dice.

RATING: 4
It's a box full of fun custom dice with a few dungeon-y things thrown in for good measure. Is it deep? Nope. Is it fun? Somewhat, but it's fun enough for the play length and the depth expected.

Good game, and it's fun, but it feels like multiplayer solitaire.

RATING: 7
Dungeon dice, press-you-luck, pass-the-time filler. Solitaire or take turns. Roll one set of hero dice and descend up to 10 levels of progressively larger pools of encounter dice that can result in combinations of loot, potions, monsters, or the dragon. Choose which heroes are used to best eliminate certain types of encounters (e.g. wizards take out all slime dice).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quick and easy filler for 1-3 players. You can play with more, but unless you are drinking/socializing, it start to add a lot of down times for the players not currently rolling dice. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Simple. good fun as a 2-player.  Nice game for sitting and chatting while playing casually.  Not good as a "serious" game or with more people, as downtime is significant and there really is nothing to do while you wait.

Good for what it is.

Quick, fun press your luck dice game that has a lot more depth than zombie dice.  Different hero specialties provides a ton of replayability.

RATING: 8
A unique experience that has you pour the game rules around your pre-set mould of 7 starting dice instead of re-rolling your hand to get nearer to what you want.

If the rules had a well-written paragraph or two with in-game examples of potion and scroll use it would help, as TMG were hamstrung by booklet size and opted for a rigid rule writing style employing unusual phrases like: "chests and potions are better than monsters" without expanding upon. 

As proved by the infamous rushed Dice Tower review, I'm sure many gamers are getting rules wrong from the outset - a nice FAQ and in-game examples can save so-oo much hassle and misinterpretation and far better in the box than lost on a bgg rules forum.

2014 update:
My son still requests this fast dice game due to its simple nature, even though we lost a hero die and now use the blood spattered extra die in the std game. Gonna run with the buffed scrolls and thematic potions as I feel this will improve the game further still.

RATING: 5
An amusing diversion, and hey - the family likes it.  The character powers are a nice touch, as they pose different challenges each game and differentiate the players from one another.

But it's disappointing when a single play-through reveals numerous flaws:

- [i]Dungeon Roll[/i] suffers from Runebound-itis, in that (a) there's nothing to do during an opponent's turn (unless you happen to be the Dungeon Lord, and then you're mildly involved), and (b) individual player turns take too long.  Avoid playing with four at all costs or half the table will be bored senseless.  Even a three-player game pushes the limit if one of those players is prone to extended analysis.

- Treasures rarely get used, as they're too valuable to spend (1 VP each).  Having treasures worth 1/2 VP each would have been a better idea.

- Players who get lucky and earn 5 XP on their first turn have a significant advantage, as they can immediately level up and use their Level 2 super powers twice during the game (i.e., during rounds 2 and 3).

- 90% of the time potions are used to fetch champions because they're strictly better than all other party members.  (They only reason not to do so is if three different party members are needed to defeat a dragon.)  Champions should have been given a combat-only role, and therefore disallowed from opening chests and quaffing potions - which even makes thematic sense.

- A player who craps out on even a single delve is unlikely to win, as they'll be too far behind in points to compete with the players who don't go bust.

- The printed rules needed better playtesting.  E.g., Why isn't rolling for party members one of the phases in a player turn?  There are also the usual grammatical and structural errors (it's/its, missing pages, funky organization) that are typical of Kickstarter rulebooks, all of which could have been easily avoided.

Finally, like any KS game, [i]Dungeon Roll[/i] has its share of enthusiastic supporters who will defend the game in its flawed simplicity and excuse the printing and editing errors.  Those people are wrong and should be forced to play a six-player game as punishment.

I have only played this solo.

I was looking for a cheap dice chucking adventure and I think I found it. I was a little confused with the instructions at first and actually turned to BGG for help. One of the creators actually helped me out and helped it make sense to me. You have to appreciate someone like that doing something cool like that.

Anyway, I really kind of enjoy it. It filled that niche I was dealing with. It has a natural feel of adventure and progression. It does talk about getting to lvl-10 during your delve, but I do not see that happening. I have only gotten as high as 5, but it will be fun to see how close to 10 I can get.

Quite fun to play. Glad I own.

Fun filler game. Theme fits for what it is. Components are all top notch; plus the box looks great. Not something I can play more than a handful of times per sitting. No real big decisions to make nor a ton of strategy.

I AM proud to say I cleared Dungeon Level 10 on my 5th playthrough though! I had some epic dice rolls. =)

Great little game, plays quick, has enough depth to remain interesting and has set number of rounds. With each player getting a different 'character' card with special abilities and powers there's all kinds of replay value in the sense that the game will play and feel a bit different depending on which character you play.

It's a good game to begin a gaming night. However, it sometimes suffers from a case of analysis paralysis the deeper into the dungeon a player goes. But the core concept is sound and it's scaled pretty well for three to four players.

Cute little filler.  Plays quickly.  Characters clearly are not balanced, but since the game only lasts about 15 minutes that's not a big deal.  Multiplayer solitare for the most part.

So I haven't had a chance to play it with others yet, so I've just been playing with myse- playing solo.

Game is super simple.. not something for when you want an involved game, more for when you've got a bit of time to kill. Great to take to school, work, IHOP for a quick jaunt in to the dungeon.

I could see it being a bit of an issue for 4 players with one player getting bored while waiting for his/her turn. I think it's absolute best for 2 players.

I'm personally tempted to buy a 2nd copy sometime soon and start working on some house rules for delving far far deeper in to the dungeon. ;)

This game just is missing great mechanics and the feel of fun.  Once in awhile you can get a group together that makes this one fun.  Cheap price and it has ok value, but you may want to save that money and buy a game you know you'll get more play out of.

Initial Impression: I wasn't very excited about this card/party game. I find the Spaghetti Western theme to be the most compelling thing about the game. Games are very random and there doesn't seem to be any choices to make. It seems that this game is best played with more people, but if I had a large group I would prefer to play Bang.

2007-12: received this from my Secret Santa.  Hmm... the production values of Cheapass Games have always steered me away from even looking at the games to see if there is anything there of real gameplaying value, but now that I own one, do I read the rules of this dicefest or put 'er up for trade?  Do people actually trade for Cheapass games or is that just an inane act of futility?

There is not a whole lot to this game but it is fairly fun to play. You are a bit actor at the Deadwood Studios, the worst B movie studio in America. You try to get a part in as many movies as possible to make as much money as possible over a four day period. You are trying to score the best parts in the scenes or get a part as an extra. You get paid when the shot is done and you hope it will not take too long so you can go grab another part in a different scene. If you get a part as an extra you do not get paid as much but you get paid more often so it can benefit you if the scene runs long. You can also visit the casting office and use your experience to get better roles. Just don't let anyone steal a scene because then you will not get the best parts. Not great but not bad either and you cannot go wrong with the price.

I can still just read the cards and laugh. How can you not find "Man who falls off roof" funny?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As a dice based game, this didn't entirely suck.  Sure, you were limited in what you could do on any given turn.  And overall it was really just a longer luck-fest that didn't have much of an arc.  But I have a soft spot in my skull for games about filmmaking, and I had a good time here getting into character.  I won't be rushing out to play again, but at the moment I'd be fine playing if someone put it in front of me.

Silly art and flavor text, decent quality in the new color edition, and just enough social element for a good light game. Main gripe is that it runs a bit too long if you play all four rounds.

Dice rolling bore-fest. I was an extra on a crappy horror film when I was a teen, being paid next to nothing and working looooong hours and had more fun than this game.

The game has interesting mechanics, although there are a couple of balance issues which make tactics a bit tricky.

I really like the game setting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Tighter and improved version of the original. Most of the balance issues have been fixed, but the whimsy of the setting and gameplay is unchanged.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It boils down to one thing:  rolling a d6 and trying to hit a target value.   Successes are marked on the board.  Failures either give you nothing (in a high risk/reward space) or a consolation prize (in a low risk space).  And you do that for 90 minutes, which is about 60 minutes too long.   On the other hand, it is a funny game (in the flavor text), and feels a lot like a MAD Magazine segment.  The comedy will have to carry it for a while, because the game play grows repetitive quite quickly.

RATING: 7
It's not big, it's not clever, but it's FUN! We just played this as a filler while waiting for the other player to arrive and despite some initial misgivings, everyone was very much into the game by the time we finished. As always, the Cheapass sense of humour enhances the fun factor. NOTE: We were playing this at 9am after having finished a six-hour game at 2am the night before - if a game can raise a smile at that point in time, it scores well in my book!

Cheapass games, play as a 2-bit actor and aspire to being a 6-bit actor! Love starring in movies like "Cheese Triumphant!, Scene 3: That's Not Milk!" in the acclaimed role of "Falls Off Roof". The mechanics are very simple, so if you can't get your enjoyment from the flavor text then this might not be a game for you. Like many cheapass games, the humor helps this along.

Too much randomness: You need to be lucky to walk in the direction of movies that are a good fit for your rank, and then be lucky in the dice throwing once you have got there. There is also little player interaction, and what there is tends to work out in favour of the player doing better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kinda boring in many ways, especially as it drags on for while, but it's an entertaining theme so makes up for it with groups that like to imagine that they are bit actors playing bit parts in low-budget movies. The gameplay is fairly basic, so it's easy to learn, and yet you still have some meaningfull options to make. A good light game. Have yet to play with large groups, but apparently that's an option.

* Kickstarted! *

Choose a role and roll to see if you get the part. It sounds incredibly simple, but getting the higher rewards requires you to spend your way upwards… and that can cost you at the end. This is a wonderful game for all ages who's entertainment level is based on how much your players want to get involved.

BIG PLUS: learn in minutes, for all ages, can be intensely fun
MINUS: needs a expansion to change up challenges after a while

I am a bit surprised people rate this game so high. The game is almost totally based on luck. The amount of die rolling is ridiculous. The game lasts way too long for what it is.

I think you really need 4 or more to appreciate this game. Played it as a 2 and a 3 player once and was underwhelmed.

Played the prettier edition, and it's been so long that I'd forgotten I'd ever played it before. This game is a chore. All the text needs to be twice as large as it is, everything's blah and brown, and there's way too much bookeeping for not much game -- and so many dead, dull turns.

Re-rated from a 4 to a 3.

I really enjoyed this game and I think it would be a lot of fun with many different ages and types of people.  As long as you get into the roles you're playing and really ham it up.  Not sure what the replayability is as It's possible the roles, especially the ones built into the game can get old but, it's probably a good intro game or if someone is not a gamer but likes westerns they'd probably enjoy it.

Created PnP version

Should be a quick filler game, it isn't. It takes usually over an hour to play and is full of monotonous rolling. Most players who are interested in gaining top level (5 stars) usually get there by the end of the second round and there is no further challenge. Those who don't bother often end up winning anyway. Lacks purpose, challenge, and strategy. 

I only made this because I quite like games with a sense of humour. The art and presentation are good. Don't think this will stand a chance of being played with my main game group though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Probably not the worst game in my collection, but definitely not one of my favorites.  Choices are minimal, and progress is determined by single dice rolls; effectively making it about as complicated as playing a game of "each of us rolls a die and whoever's is the highest wins."  The premise is novel (working as an actor on a Hollywood backlot production of a Western movie), and there is some fun to be had delivering the lines for each character, but the game mechanics are fairly pedestrian and uninspired.  I purchased this game for $10, and didn't feel like I'd been robbed, necessarily (the components are workable, and seem to be of acceptable quality), but for the MSRP of $40, I would completely avoid.  
Cheepass Games should stick to being cheap, mindless fun instead of expensive, mindless "fun."

One of my favourite Cheapass games, play as a 2-bit actor and aspire to being a 6-bit actor!  The best part of the game is starring in movies like "Cheese Triumphant!, Scene 3: That's Not Milk!" in the acclaimed role of "Falls Off Roof".  The mechanics are very simple, so if you can't get your enjoyment from the flavour text then this might not be a game for you.

OK, I get the concept. The game looks cheap because they want to reduce costs, and it was really cheap to buy. But please put an actual game into the box. There may be more to it than we discovered, so I gave it the benefit of doubt and rated it a 3 instead of 2.

it seems to be more or less mindless dice rolling until someone mercifully ends the game and you can count your money. With so many great dice games available today, you can really get much better games even if you have to invest as much as 10 EUR/ USD instead of wasting 3 EUR/ USD to a boring Cheapass experience.

This was a highly anticipated game for me.  The theme was very intriguing to me.  However the monotonous die rolling and rolling and rolling (sorry must have channeled a bit of Limp Bizcit there...they suck almost as bad as this game does.) Seriously this should have been a good game.  Great idea, I love the mechanic of the sliding card on the board but it needed to be worked out a bit more before releasing.  A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!

Hands down the best traditional board game I have played.  Loved it.  You basically are on the lot of a hollywood studio and you try to get picked up for all these different "movies" that come along.  Movement and "bidding" both hold strategic value.  A very good game for a cheap price!

The world's worst "hack" actors gather on the set of the latest western from Deadwood Studios. All the special roles are up for grabs, "Man falling off roof", "Crying Woman", "Stagecoach Driver" and "Dead Man". Yes they're all available and, if you're good enough (ie. you progress up the "hack-levels" represented by the changing numbers on your character's die), you may even get to play that complicated character part "Rear-end of Horse"! The higher budget the scene that you're in has, the more takes needed to wrap it up, but the more money you'll get for your part at the end of it. So do you take that "big role", or just the small parts (in the hope that your dollar a take salary builds up)?

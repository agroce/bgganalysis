Nice game.  Played it a lot in my teens.
Over here, it reminds people of old-folks and their "whist drives", but it needn't be like that.  It's an elegant and simple game with lots of subtlety.  It's good to play as partner whist and all against all.  Both are lots of fun, though the former is more challenging.

RATING: N/A
For a traditional game I quite enjoyed it but it's not really the sort of thing to play on game night

2nd attempt we played Contract/Nomination Whist and that was even better, worthy of competing with much more modern (derivative) trick taking games.

This is a good, basic card game, useful for teaching more involved trick-taking games like Hearts or Bridge.  If I want to teach people one of those games, I'll usually introduce it by teaching them this first.  It's fun - but a bit random, especially if you play with the "Dog" and "Blind Dog" rules.

RATING: 5
A lot like Spades, but without the interesting bidding mechanism (unless you play with variants) or the sandbags that keep me coming back to Spades. Essentially this means the game is very luck based in comparison, but it still is an easy way to teach people the basics of trick taking without the stress of having to bid (hence, easier to play with a partner whom you don't know), so I play it every once in a while.

That said, when we play this, it is always with the idea of using as a stepping-stone game to bid-based trick taking or other more modern variations. For that purpose, it is very useful though, we generally just play to 10 or 15 points in those cases.

I am likely over-rating this slightly based simply on my fondness for this game because of how often it was mentioned in some of the great 19th century Russian literature.

RATING: 4
I was recently introduced to Whist, and upon playing discovered that I knew a lot of elements of the game from play in my youth without knowing I was doing Whist or a variant thereof. The versions I played involved getting an ever larger number of cards and playing with and without trump; and a version in which the full suit of cards is used, but requires the use of 2 bidding rounds. Whist in all its incarnations is a fairly simple cardgame without much hassle, nor requiring much strategic thought, although you can employ a few nice tactics. Not a game I would do on a regular basis, but if I'd be bored stiff from waiting at an airport terminal or a train station, this would be the game I'd play to pass the time.

We play a homebrew variant of Bid Whist with a kitty and my rating is for this variant only. The idea is very similar to actual bid whist, yet includes a kitty and removes the possibility of a contract that reverses the card ranking.

Deal 12 cards to 4 players in two partnerships, saving the remaining 4 as a kitty. Bidder contracts book (5 tricks) plus bid. Bidding proceeds clockwise from left of dealer. Bids must be larger than the previous bidder or passed. Dealer may steal the bid for the same amount. Legal bids include 3 (signal bid only), 4, 5, 6, 7 (contracting all of the tricks -> 5 + 7 = 12). Dealer must make minimum legal bid (4) if no such bid has yet been made. 3 bid signals strong power and may not be used to make a valid contract.

Winning bidder takes kitty into hand and discards 4 cards back down to a hand of 12. Dealer names trump and leads to the first trick (not required to be trump). Play proceeds clockwise with trick winner leading to the next. Must be void to trump.

Made contract scores amount of contract plus any over tricks. Set contract scores amount of contract to opponents plus 1 for any additional tricks above 6.

This variant is a very strong 4 player partnership trick taking game with trump. We consider it an alternative to bridge that plays with significantly simplified bidding and less visible information during play as there is no dummy hand. If you've ever wanted to learn bridge but were afraid of it or disliked it for some reason, this whist variant is a great substitute.

If you have any questions about how to play this, GM me.

I've played tons of this, with several different groups. 
We played it as part of a series of 8 traditional card games. When each player's turn comes, he/she has to choose one of the 8 games to be played in that round (according to the cards dealt to him/her). Once chosen he/she can no longer choose the same game again. Therefore with 6 players a total of 48 rounds are played. 8 rounds of each game for each player. Great for all kinds of groups.

2015-08-10 : Variant " Kleurenwieze" - been playing this for 30 years and I'm still always willing to play it.

On my mother's side of the family it was some kind of tradition to spend New Year's Day together with my grandmother at her place. This was the early seventies so the one and only channel on the tv would always show the same thing every year : the ski jump at Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

To me and the other kids that was boring as hell, so we would watch our uncles play a local whist variant. My dad was really good at it and I felt proud sitting next to him - keeping my mouth shut about the cards he had - and learning the game by watching and listening.

They never let me join one of their legendary games, but I learned a lot by just watching them play for hours on end and later became really good at this and other card games as well.

RATING: 6
[4 plays]  Though very basic whist is nowhere in complexity compared to other favorite card games, it does give the feeling of being in a Jane Austen novel.  And this would make a great teaching stage for kids: the core of trumps and trick-taking, without the bidding element.  I'm very interested to learn some of the different, no doubt more elaborate varieties of whist.

Rating is for un-modded Bid Whist

Another good ole trick game with a lot of variations, really Plain Whist should be seperated from Bid Whist as its VERY different as far as card games go. 

Plain old Whist would probably rate a 4, its a vanilla trick game and as vanilla as can get, just too basic and boring and has been surpassed by many better games most notable Bridge of course but even some Whist variants which are much much better.

Minnesota seems pretty boring too with NO trump but I think there is more than one version of this, original version would also get a 4 from me, theres almost nothing to it other than a bid for normal or no trick play and no trick ONLY happens if every players bids for it which is seldom unfortunately. Other than that bid, just like plain ole Whist.  

Bid Whist is the game of choice and even this has many many variations. Bid Whist resembles Bridge a little in that bidding is similiar depending on which variant your playing. I think my perferred version is Bid Whist with a 4 card kitty and not a 6, 6 might make it a little too easy. I'd also like to see an option similiar to something in Minnesota where instead of "Downtown" you can play No Trump No Tricks and your team must get 6 or less, have always liked an option to play No Tricks in trick games. You could even do a round of Minnesota bidding before any other bidding to determine if it will be normal or no trick play. Not that keen on the scoring in normal Bid Whist or once around bidding, but it only needs a slight tweaks like the game goes to 15 or 21 and no doubling (similiar to 52 card Whist) but it really depends on which version you're playing. 

In actuality, Colour Whist (Kleurwiezen) might be the most interesting Whist (Bid Whist) variation out there albeit also the most complex; I've read the rules but haven't played yet, right now it looks like an 8 for me possibly 8.5. It has some excellent bidding options and mixes the game up nicely with solo play, short term partnerships that will usually change each hand, no trick hands and more. Its a shame this version seems to have gone completely under the radar and never really made it out of Belgium as it looks quite good.

Bridge, Spades, Tichu all surpass any versions of this  game IMO with or without some tweaks, though I think Kleurwiezen would not be far behind them depending on how its played.

Of all the games my closest friends play, this is the one.  Ours is a variation of whist where players are bidding to call trump.  The winner gets a 4 card kitty to swap cards from.

[2-4 players] A classic trick-taking card game. Good variations include: 
"German Whist", enjoyable for two players, although the drawing stage of the game can be slow. 
"BidWiz", a somewhat more challenging variation which requires players to bid on how many tricks they think they can win. 
"Knockout Whist" or "Trumps", a simplified version fun to play with children, to introduce them to trick-taking.

RATING: 5
Played bid Whist about 10 years ago. Read quite a bit about it in my bridge books, it is the mother of ALL trick-taking games if I remember. Definately the parent of Bridge, Spades, Pinochle, Euchre, Hearts, etc. More to think about than spades, very much like bridge without the lay-down. Considerable trash-talking and fast play in the group that taught me, and considered much more serious than spades.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Basic trick-taking game, easy to teach and play, and a good beginner game to lead into stronger ones like Spades, Euchre, and 500.

With all of the cards in play, there is little risk and card-counting is very important.  There is also no bidding, as it's based on the turn-up card.  Very vanilla vs other card games.

About as bare-bones as you can get for a trick-taking game.  Since there's no card-pass after the deal, and you can't "go for control" or "shoot the moon," a bad hand is just a bad hand.  Can be fun played as a Court Whist tournament, though.

[100's of games] with my older male relatives in hunting camps and other situations growing up. This can be fun if not taken too seriously. There is some angst when deciding whether to go black or red, and rarely will your hand make that an obvious choice.

I use Whist for logging Schmear games, which we play ten times more often than Whist, although I really enjoy Whist occasionally.

It's too bad this card game is so ignored and Bridge gets all the attention.  Kitty Bid Whist is the best variation IMO - bid for trump, highest bid gets the kitty and declares trump. 52 card deck, no Jokers.  Have played this for years and years.  Lots of bantering. Skill is required to win such as counting what cards have been played and signaling to your partner with the cards you play what you want them to do next.

Many of the lower than 6 ratings for Whist are about the most basic version of the game.  Shame this gets knocked down because it's being judged on its weakest variation.

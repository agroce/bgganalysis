Excellent game. Better than Tarawa, for the larger and more varied piece of real estate being fought over by Japanese and Americans.

Also, John Butterfield has clearly improved some of the AI rules in this game, making the Japanese "player" more intelligent than that at Tarawa.

But the victory conditions are just impossible...

RATING: 7
Whilst I am a huge fan of the series, I found this title a bit frustrating. As others have mentioned, winning is just not an option, which takes away some of the enjoyment in my opinion (it's a game, after all). Tarawa and Omaha are also tough to win, but here it seems that no matter what you do, you just can't succeed - too many Japanese, the terrain is also against you and not enough Americans to do the job. On the plus side, the game is easy to learn if you already have another title in the series and there is a second scenario, which I haven't played yet.

A step up from DDaT, with better quality components and clearer rules. As with the other games in the series I enjoy most of the game mechanics. However, victory conditions are bonkers, some design decisions are unfortunate and the rulebook could  be better. Still, in general, this game is better than DDaT (but not as good as DDaOB).

I have enjoyed all the other games in this system (including Jubilee) so looking forward to this big time.

This is another solid addition to the series but I feel like it is a bit more constrained and scripted.  Like it, but don't love it.

Not enjoying this as much as D-Day at Omaha, but perhaps that is because this is hard as nails. I am not much of a solo gamer but this one satisfies. I wish I had DDaOB but alas, I'll take what I can get. Please sir, many I have another...

Solitaire without dice kept me away from this for a long time. Given the good ratings I bought it a month ago and I LOVE it. Absolutely great system and the right historical flavor……………so I just bought Omaha and Tarawa as well………but first a couple of more Peleliu-games before embarking on these
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I own DD@Omaha, Tarawa, Peleliu and also EA: Ardennes.  Peleliu is the only one I wish I had not purchased.  It is just unwinnable.  It uses the same basic system introduced in Omaha Beach and Tarawa, but it does not feature the concept of depth markers that the previous two had.  The result is that you just get mowed down in no uncertain terms and the casualties make planning pointless.  It does not capture the feel of command tension that the others do.  It is just relentlessly punitive.

A great game, fun, ....only impossible to win: but every game is really interesting, and offers hours of pleasure, expecially if you get a better outcome than in the previous game!

Very enjoyable solo game from John Butterfield. One of the most fun, enjoyable games that I own. Can be brutal at times (it was historically), but challenges you to play again..and again. Played five times already and every time the game was tense and exciting. Great map and game mechanics make this one of my mot favorites games. Next to RAF 1940 this one is on top of my 5 games of all time...ok, maybe the top 10 (there are some great games out there!).

I do a lot of research and I love solo playing games and from what I have researched this game is probably one of the best solo games out there. I want to buy this game and I will comment further on whether it is what I expected to be any further comment.

UPDATED: Complicated but well worth the time in learning. Best solitaire game I've played

RATING: 9.5
Immensely enjoyable game. But just like its predecessor D-Day at Tarawa (DDaT), winning seems virtually impossible. It seems to me that victory conditions ask the player to do in 2 days what it took the Marines and Army almost 3 months to accomplish. The components (map, counters, and rulebook) are considerably better than DDaT. The system is mostly the same as DDaT but there are enough rule changes and differences that it doesn't seem like just a variant. Seems like it plays quicker than DDaT. This is a must buy if you like the subject. Completely worth my money and time, even though I'm more likely to win the lottery than this game.

Same system as DDAOB. 

August 2013 was first date, but in May the designer said it would be "later in 2014." 

Which apparently means February 2015. :p

Solid, smooth playing D-Day series entry. Very tough in parts (I lost). Better than Tarawa IMHO. A little bit apples-and-oranges but it doesn't quite beat out Omaha Beach for me as best in the series.

I'm not a wargamer but wanted to start learning by playing solitaire, so a friend of mine told me about the D-Day series.

This game is great !

Less than one month after buying it, I already played 5 games and still want to play it.

Love it.  Not much else to say.  Great mechanics bring out the theme.  Nothing better than sitting with a beer looking at the map and wondering what is coming at you next.  John Butterfield is a genius when is comes to game design.

[b]10: Outstanding game. One of my all-time personal favorites.[/b]
Series rating upped, from 8 to 10. This just hits the sweet spot the more I play the series. Tells such a moving and poignant story as your men fight, die, and hopefully take real estate.

There is a lot going on here, but it is worth it. Definitely download the flip book or other play aid detailing each step of the game. Those get you up and running pretty quickly with little head ache. 

Don't get attached to any one unit or hero, they will most likely die, but that's accurate, Peleliu was hell on the 1st Marine Division. 

Can't wait to receive and play the other two in the series.

Things are even more dynamic (for the enemy) and action points fewer (for you!) than before. Tight and tense, with 2 scenarios that play very differently and a hell of a terrain to care about, this is going to be my #1 D-Day so far. 

Just be sure to play with the errata/victory conditions.

A lot of wargames designed for solitaire play feel too repetitive and mechanical.  This isn't one of them. I was blown away by D-Day at Omaha Beach and I'm impressed with Peleliu as well except this seems impossible to win due to the victory conditions. This series is innovative and fun. The initial beach landings are intense and each little victory feels so hard earned.

A John Butterfield-designed solitaire game is a must-buy for me. The components, rules and gameplay are all improved from the Omaha Beach game and it takes a little less time to play.

The bad part (and why I do not rate it a 10) are the victory conditions which seem to make it next to impossible to win with the Americans. Admittedly, I haven't played it enough to draw any conclusions yet but in the games I have played, I have not even come close to winning a game. Perhaps I just haven't figured out a winning strategy yet. Fortunately, this game is enjoyable enough to make me want to play it more to find the winning strategy!

RATING: 7
It has appeal & conceptually it's a winner, with good ideas in the card driven AI system paired to the map in a way that appeals & works well, but I'm getting a disconnect with historicity (capturing & securing so much in hours/days, the attrition disparity between forces) and seeing some awkward mechanics like garrison placement & barrage constraints. Add in the grind & impossibility of the longer campaign game & it feels like a set of problems I'm uncertain resolve well. I will enjoy another swing & it may be some house rules make it satisfying or I get something I missed, I can't tell yet; but I suspect the problem really is in what's being modeled just doesn't translate so well into a game. 

A first impression after a full play, provisional rating (the landing scenario through hour 12 using the new errata, which was a very near win).

Fantastic session with good end notes here:

Found  it to be too much in work vs fun ratio because of the rules. Because of mistakes had to print out the latest rulebook, then errata, then flipbook. Quite a bit of a pain to run the game. Still worth trying though because of intensity of the subject.

A solo Butterfield game.
I guess I do not have to add much.
Yeah, perhaps that I already own his previous two D-Day titles.
It is not a "must have" just because I have not been able to play Tarawa yet, so this would take even longer to get to the table...

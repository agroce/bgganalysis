Once you get your head around the badly written, unindexed rules this is a very exciting game, and Bomb Alley/Regia Marina is probably one of the most fun because everything is so close that contact comes swiftly and brutally.

At start I found this series interesting then, while they added new games, my interest decreased, when it came out this game I've given it an in deep study and remained disgusted for many aspects.
To explain it I will state just one fact: they invented a flight group for the Italian carrier. With invented I mean that they made it with no historical search on which planes would have been used on it. They declared that in it there would have been one type of plane, the Breda Ba.201, that never went forward from being a mare prototype, that was NEVER considered as a carrier plane. If this is the search level of the company, it is better to avoid this series.

Pretty good game.  Lots of strategy and deception.  I really really like the feel of the game.  A buttload of scenarios (though admittedly, many are unbalanced, but still, what's the point of fighting fair?) At Home, not with me at Uni.

I have this game and all of the other games from their Second World War at Sea series and I love all of them. They are long games -- eight to twenty hours depending on whether you actually play through the whole thing or not. I love the strategic map with the fog-of-war and the tactical battles.

Played a few solo games, wanting to play more, and soon. A friend has just purchased "Midway" too.
5 March. PLayed 1 game (2 players, me as GM). Worked OK, a few errors. Played first Operational scenario. Brits threw towel in after getting MULLERED by Italians. Game should have gone on, still winnable for brits...
UPDATE: Played 25/5/06,Downgraded from 9 purely due to time and record keeping - whilst I am more than happy to play this, I usually cant.

Having played a few of this series, I feel they work real well as 3 player games - 1 rules/record keeper guy, lets the other 2 worry about the game. Without the Big map it degenerates into a rather dull dice rolling fest, but with the scenarios it is excellent.

Planned to do a scenario but opponent was delayed so we just did a cruiser action (Matapn). TBH it got repetitive and was (as with most naval games) a dice rolling fest. Meh.

Interesting topic.  Fascinating to see what would have happened had the Italian Navy not been caught in port and actually had enough fuel to sortie on a regular basis.  Played several of the early scenarios (before the Luftwaffe) and was impressed with the Italian capability and the terrible British planes.

Feels right. Combat is a protracted dice fest, but in a good way. Really feel like you are commanding an operation. Crying out for PC version as it takes up a huge amount of space.

Arguably the best of the SWWAS family of naval games.  This has 50 scenarios focusing on the battle for control of the Mediterranean Sea.  If you like this game, then you should also check out Second World War at Sea: SOPAC, Second World War at Sea: Bismarck, Second World War at Sea: Leyte Gulf, Second World War at Sea: Midway, etc.

Bought this and Black Sea Fleets. Packed all the counters into two Chessex trays and put them in the box. What a universe of possibilities! Sadly I have no-one to play the game with and the battle scenarios are a bit limited (though I could invent my own). If you own this and you live in London, give me a shout.

Very good strategical mechanism, spoiled by poor tactical resolution rules. Also, sometime a bit lengthy.
Great context anyway.

RATING: 6.5
Good SWWAS product. Very good components, interesting operational situation, intelligent twists to base system (air allotment for instance). Like all xxWAS Series games, operational rules are great and tactical rules sucks (in my opinion). This game would deserve a straightforward Flat Top like tactical rule to speed up play (and because tactical action is air-surface most of the time, anyway).
Also, great scenarios can become fiddly.

A lot of fun. It is a real pleasure to try and duplicate the British victories against the Italians. With a more competent handling of the Italian Navy than was the case historically the British are in serious trouble.

Good stuff.  For World War Two naval buffs: required!  Even includes the German F1282 helicopter for ASW missions.  Has Italian, British, French, Vichy French, Polish, Romanian, Greek, Russian and German units.  Favorite scenario is Matapan.  Haven't seen a decent game in this Theater covering this topic on this scale since the Italian publication from IES: "Mare Nostrum" and the "Fronte Mare" series published back in 1983.  This series has a feel very similar to Avalon Hill's old Bismarck game.  Well done.

This is the best game of the series,and as far as I'm concern the best wargame I've ever played;its naval war in a bath tub(the Med.);you get a ,bang,bang action almost every turn and tons of scenarios.We've done away with AP tac system and use our own,with the help of assited computer program "Shipbase 3",this does all our book keeping for all our Tac combat and damages;this program has everything,gunnery,torp,mines,aircraft attacks,and subs.So if your a Naval nut like I am,this game is a must in your collection(then go get Shipbase 3,it will flower out your naval combat,beyond you wildest dreams).

SWWAS carries the Great War at Sea series into WWII. Air power and aircraft carriers displace dreadnoughts as the prime weapons of naval power. This game is set in the Mediterranean, where the Italian and British navies vie for control. The same great graphics for the double size ship counters, and now for the aircraft as well. Combines a strategic game where players move their fleets around in a theater, with a tactical game used when vessels or aircraft make contact. Easy to learn rules and fun to play: similar to naval miniatures but with much simplified combat and maneuvering systems. Much simpler and less detailed search and combat system than 'Harpoon' or COA's Admiralty series. It's still possible to have a big gun duel, but more likely you'll have to contend with those pesky airplanes before you do.

RATING: 5
Scenarios on this game look awesome. Game flow feels little flimsy at times. I do consider including number of rules from Dreadnoughts (damage control, better part of valor and smokescreens) to make tactical system bit more fluent and to prevent players to fight till the bitter end.

Aerial operations are remarkably ineffective in some scenarios - regardless of quantity of A/C included, and record keeping is really tough at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game. Lots of scenarios and ships and planes...  Some of the scenarios are not balanced and a bit simple in terms of how the Italians can respond to the Royal Navy, ie they do not take into account fuel shortages, delays, reticence of the Supermarina, etc.

Great flavour though and a real slice of history. Recommended in the long run.

All the scenarios, all the counters.  I mean, really, ALL the counters!  This game ships with a simply obscene number of counters (such that game setup can actually be something of a pain).  The scenarios are also very interesting - unlike many other games in the series, where battles or scenarios had to be hypothesized, the Italian navy and Air Force in WW2 in the Med was VERY active - having regularly sortied to counter 'every British move'.  Historically, of course, they faired pretty poorly - but they did TRY, and try OFTEN - and that makes for a LOT of interesting scenarios for wargamers to play through and "try to do better".  I believe this title currently has the most scenarios of any of APL's GWaS/SWWaS games.  Only real mark against it is the simple size - with 420 counters, setting  up scenarios (even when well sorted) can be...trying.

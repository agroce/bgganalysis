The first thing to know about Super Dungeon Explore is that it doesn't involve much exploring. This game is a hack'n'slash fantasy game set in a dungeon. If not for the miniatures, I don't think I'd be keeping it. In fact, I don't think I would have bought it. But I love my case full of painted Super Dungeon Explore miniatures (and at this point, they fill a pretty massive miniatures carry-case). I have spent many many hours lovingly bringing these characters to life. I have all the expansions/promos and will continue to be a completionist where this game is concerned. To be fair, I have played this game a lot more than many other titles in my collection, and it is usually a lot of wild, unbalanced fun, although it can drag a bit.

Quick to learn (once you decipher the rulebook!) and speedy game play makes this a great dungeon crawler for casual gamers or those breaking into the ranks with still enough strategy and teamwork for those with more experience. Really interesting game system they've come up with and I really can't wait to see some expansions or quest related add-ons. Game looks beautiful too! Needs a better organized rulebook and some rules to be clarified.

My guilty pleasure. I've thrown far too much money at this and own almost everything for it. Everybody has to have one, right?

I love this game. It's cute, it's quick*, it's just what I want from a dungeon crawling board game: Run in, bash monsters, collect treasure then face the dragon in a fight to the death.

Tons of special abilities makes for lots of replayability and lots of different tactical options. The dice system is fantastic and easy to understand, looting feels satisfying and you always have the pressure of going for more treasure or pushing further before the clock runs out*

Components are beautifully produced. This game is a life time project of painting for me and I never get enough finished before the next batch appears on kickstarter!

The downsides: First edition is incredibly fiddly with too much book-keeping. Second edition is far far too long (four hours) and promotes stalling tactics. However...

*This game is best experienced under a fan variant (google search 'lootimeter mode'). It reintroduces the timer from first edition but without the book keeping and greatly speeds up the game making for a quick and dirty dungeon crawler. Unlike Descent or similar, the timer does not cause an automatic game over, rather it simply brings out the dungeon boss early when you might not be prepared.

Tepid dice-chucker with a couple of clever ideas. My friend described this as light-hearted and the alarm bells started ringing in my head. That's code for poorly designed and balanced.

Cute Dungeon Crawl. The one against all mechanic can be savage, and the loot-a-meter is a bit of a pain in first edition. Great minis that can entice those often uninterested in other popular dungeon crawls out there.

RATING: 5
A game I cannot stop confusing with Arcadia Quest. I'll just jump right in to the points:

+ This game certainly has a cute aesthetic (which doesn't really get me) on all the cards and minis, and looks sharp in the area of visual design. Regardless of my personal tastes, I can't deny it achieved the goal the designers intended.

+ The component quality is nice.

+ Fun for the intro game: Roll up with some heroes and slay baddies. Fight a big one. Loot. Nothing complicated.

+ Large number of heroes for subsequent plays, decent number of unique villain deck experiences.

- Low replayability due to the simplistic design nature of the boards. They're not very modular, too big each, and too few of them. Major downside to the game.

- Rules are pretty bog-standard for dungeon crawlers. Nothing really innovative being done here except giving it an arcade theme.

- Too random to ultimately be enjoyable, even as a light relaxation game. The custom dice help with this but breed problems of hero supremacy.

Who is this for? People who want to play Arcade Gauntlet Legends but slowly, manually, only once or twice, and with chibi art.

This game is fun to play as the heroes, but a bit of a nightmare to run as Consul as there is a lot to remember especially when playing with a variety of spawn points.  The game is also far too drawn out with 5 heroes - 3 is definitely the sweet spot.  Production values are top notch but ... I dunno ... I would just rather play Descent!

I own a lot of SDE components now.  I bought my original copy off of the Cranky Lawyer when he was selling it on the Garagehammer forums.  Having owned it now for several years (probably since 2012), I have not played it once.  All of the figures are built, but few are painted.  I'm hoping the SDE:Legends ruleset will make this a more attractive game to play.  Also hoping to introduce my kids to games through this at some point.  (2-12-18)

Reasons for my low score after only 1 game: it took me 5 days to get around to playing it, I lost the game, plus gluing all those pieces together was annoying, rulebook needs work (to be fair there is an updated pdf available) 
note to anyone planning on painting you probably want to use epoxy putty to hold the miniatures together as glue leaves a lot of gaps that you have to putty anyway.
Also, don't glue them to their bases, use blue-tack until you're done painting.

UPDATE 8/12/2013: I have now had the misfortune of playing a 6 player game.  I still love SDE, but 6 hours of the same game is just too much for me.  I understand that with an experienced group that is probably much shorter.  I just don't get to play it enough for that to ever happen.  No more 6 player games for me, thanks.  I'd say a 4 player game is the right size to enjoy all that this game has to offer and still be able to play other stuff.  Because of the higher complexity, longer setup time, and one against many game play, this game will never rate as high with my gaming friends as Zombicide.  I love the theme.  I love getting into battle and trying out the special abilities in new and powerful combos, but there is only so much time that I can keep a gamer group and myself interested in one game in a night.

UPDATE 4/27/2013: Ha!  I slaughtered them again with Starfire.  Wow!  This is such a fun game.  I fear the next game will be my downfall.  Even when I advise them of the consequences of not destroying the spawn points before Starfire comes into play, they still go after the minions.  It must be too much fun to destroy piles of minions with their special attacks.  Then Starfire spawned in and trapped them in a narrow hallway.  There is just no fighting the mighty dragon when she has two activations per round.  Plus, this group didn't take a healer.  Combine that with not being aggressive enough with the spawn points and they just didn't have a chance when the boss fight came.  Love this game.  Everyone talks about wanting to get a copy of their own after a full playthrough.

UPDATE 4/8/2013: I took my Super Dungeon Explore (SDE) to an all guys board gaming party recently.  We had 4 players, counting me.  This made for a perfect 16-bit game.  Because I am relatively new at it, I still have to look things up now and then and setup takes me a while.  But once we really got going and everyone started to fully grasp the overall concept, it got VERY fun.  Most of the guys I played with were asking me where to pick up a copy.  So far, every step of the way it has been a great game.  I have not tried playing on the hero team yet, but I am just fine with being the bad guy.  This group didn't quite realize how important it was to destroy the spawn points until it was too late.  Having that extra activation with Starfire is devastating to the heroes.  Once the boss spawned in, I killed a hero each round (starting with their healer, of course).  It was actually pretty close in the end.  They cornered me with the dwarven warrior and each time they rolled a potion they would immediately give it to the deeproot scout and use it to give an extra action point to the dwarf.  Overtime was what saved my butt and ultimately ended the game for them.  And you can bet I went straight for that scout on my next activation after realizing how OP that combo could be :)

UPDATE 3/25/2013: I played an 8bit game with my 5.5 year old son.  With no mini bosses or a dungeon boss, the game is in favor of the heroes.  I admit I gave him extra rolls and told him what he should do most of the time.  I almost killed one of his heroes near the end, but I have heavy doubts that his paladin would have gone down with the nice loot he had and his healer abilities.  When it was over, he wanted to play again.  It was good fun with a kid who would otherwise rather be playing my XBOX360.

I've played one complete game with a friend playing three heroes and me as the Consul. I am still confused on many of the rules, but overall I was left wanting to do it again. I'm certain I learned a lot while stumbling through my first real game. Now I will have a more active understanding while reading the instruction manual for the third time. I really like the game and I am very interested in painting my miniatures.

I was impressed by the minis and artwork. The game play is like the old arcade game Gauntlet. You're running around a dungeon destroying spawn locations using unique characters with a few simple skills. If the game had a bit more meat it might substitute for a game of Ravenloft/WOA.

I really enjoyed painting the chibi minis but gameplay is honestly kind of boring.  Doesn't work well with larger player counts as players have to wait too long to take their turns and lose interest.  Also due to the co-operative nature of the game one player tends to take over as leader and decide the strategy for everyone on their team.

RATING: 8.5
The game as it ships is a 7.5, with clarifying rules quick reference and other content from BGG, an easy 8.5.

This game fills a thematic niche (8/16-bit anime/early Japanese RPG style) which is what drew me to it. I'm a sucker: It's cute. I drew flak for bringing some models to paint night, the other guys I work with at my LGS aren't such suckers for cute like me!

Component quality is my biggest issue, and I hope it will be remedied within future print runs. You will want to sleeve these cards, laminate or (I hope not) replace board tiles, and models will need to be filed if you care about them. I've seen worse, and it doesn't make the game unplayable, but I'd love to see better.

Play-wise, it's fantastic. The game incorporates one of my favorite mechanics, a 'timer' (in the form of the Adventure Tracker) which prevents the game from going too long. As another commenter stated, you WILL want an aggressive DM/Consul, but if you're playing that role, aren't you aggressive anyway? ;)

I have no complaints about number of models or keeping track of them. To me, it seems no more intensive than a typical strat. 

Tl;dr: Component quality makes me :( , but otherwise a fantastic game and one I would very easily recommend. My group cannot WAIT to replay this.

Game took longer to play (3X) then suggested on the box for the learning game.  

First impression, that the rules will need to be firmed up a bit, not sure if it is me or the rulebook that was in remiss.

Seems a bit slow and random for such a long game, however, captures the feel of the old Gauntlet computer game to a tee, and I spent many hours of my youth playing that game.

Miniatures are nice, but be warned that the box took forever to piece together.  

Excited for a couple of future plays to see exactly where this fits into my collection.

Super Dungeon Explore is great fun *with the right players*. I would love to rate this one higher, but the fact remains that having fun while playing SDE depends on two crucial factors:

1. An absolutely RUTHLESS dungeon master
2. A balanced team of heroes

Any variations that do not include both these elements will likely lend mediocre results.

I really liked the overall concept of this game, but it requires a LOT of assembly (which may be fun for some, but not all).  It also takes a lot of deciphering to really understand the rules.  The rule book is not entirely clear on a number of key pieces of gameplay.

The biggest problem I found with the game is I felt the person playing as the monsters has a huge disadvantage to the heroes.  It is very, very hard to damage the heroes enough to kill them, due to the ease of gaining potions and healing.

I only played half of this, but I got what I needed to know out of it at least.  While the concept is easy to explain, it all boils down to tons and tons of fiddly rules about abilities and damage and what each little skill descriptor means...  I'm glad that my first session ended early, but only because the game was going to take forever.  A new game, now that I know a lot of the details, would likely go at a decent pace and not be bogged down by constant questions about things.

To describe it, I'd probably have to say...  Dungeons and Dragons without a plot, and where the DM will try as hard as possible to kill you.

Simplified dungeon delver.  Had an anime theme, giving it more personality.  Combat used lots of dice (attacker and defender rolled) and bonus cards were gained from killing monsters and opening chests.

A fun game with amazing components (especially the miniatures, aside from being a little difficult to assemble these all look fantastic). 

I love a lot of the mechanics of this game, it really feels like you're playing a board game version of a classic computer game, especially when you're hitting enemies and potions and health are popping out of them.

I only have one real criticism which is that the balance doesn't feel like it's quite right, it's easy for either the heroes or the consul player to become overly powerful and there are few tactics to combat this situation which can make the end game feel a little one-sided and anti-climatic.

Admittedly this hasn't seen a lot of plays, but after my wife painted the miniatures, I was really dissapointed by the gameplay.

The only way we found for the players to be successful was to leverage some rather 'cheap' tactics with the paladin, which made for an extremely boring game for that person. 

Demoed this at GenCon 2014, was extremely disappointed that nearly everything we saw in our demo was not in the box.

I would like a second set of minifigs for putting a decent paint on. I assembled the ones I have quick and dirty to hit the table; no cleanup, no green stuff, just a tub of glue and an eagerness to play. I'll end up giving them a quick, basic paintjob. I want another set so I can properly clean, prepaint, assemble, seam-fill, and final paint...these figs deserve it!

1st Edition, 2nd printing.

NOTE: Only issue with it so far (Day 1) is that the track tile is warped, fairly significantly...flat on the table, 2 opposite edges lift about ½" - 3/4" off the table. I assume this is due to it be printed on a single side; the double-sided map tiles do not show the same issue so far. I may try to mist the backside of the tile with water/alcohol/fabric softener mix to counteract the wet-printing.

RATING: 4
Interesting if incredibly simple dungeon crawl game.  No real depth to the game play as turns are very very straight forward however the ability to use your potion outside of your turn is really nice but the usefulness of these potions varies considerably.

The combat is simply a case of rolling more hits than your opponents so more dice usually wins. The ability for anyone to heal if a hit is obtained and a heart rolled is very nice and means the game flows very well however this abundance of healing means the smaller monsters feel largely irrelevant, in fact the whole wound system feels irrelevant until the boss turns up and several hits are piled upon a player in a turn. Even when mobbed by smaller monsters they rarely hit and if they do only inflict a single wound which is likely healed by the players next attack.

I don't know why they chose to go with terms such as 8-bit and 16-bit, but the loot-o-meter mechanic works quite nicely.

I am slightly disappointed that no effort was put into providing flavor text of theme for the dungeon crawl... just why am I trying to hack this dragon to bits?

Miniatures are ok and kinda cute I guess but I am not a fan of the anime style and so the find the head of the player character grotesquely oversized.

Overall I did enjoy and I am itching for another game as I suspect there is more to this than 'kick in the door and see what happens' gameplay

After a second play there is in fact NOTHING more here than kick in the door and see what happens. Very dissappointed.

RATING: 4
The miniatures are truly marvelous and I heard several say they must buy the game because they HAVE to paint them (despite the $90 price tag).  Too bad the rest of the components are so cheap--the instructions are on thin paper which ripped in two places before the first game was over.  The cards too are of poor stock and need sleeving.

Some were put off by the extensive assembly required.  The pieces should be super glued as well.

It was described to me as a light Dungeon Crawl game, and it seems very much like Descent to me--a team of players against one player who runs the monsters (heroes vs consul).  The first game lasted long too--6 hours, but that did entail 7 players (yes, it played with 7) and learning the game. 

It is a pretty smooth little game, but one problem I saw was with the Consul keeping track of which minions have been activated.  After each player goes, the Consul activates minions, but a minion can be activated only once in a round.  In the rule book we saw no reference to how to note which ones had moved.  Often ALL the minions were on the board and sometimes the rounds took a long time, especially when checking rules.  I suggested a minion be laid down once activated, but the miniature enthusiasts said that destroyed the ambiance of the game, and was too fiddly.  The current Consul said he remembered, but I never remembered and sometimes doubted which had or had not moved.

There was tremendous down time--often due to rule reading.  For me, this is a worn out theme that I have played online forever--easy to kill little minions, harder to kill mini-bosses, and the final big boss.  Also this  game depends heavily on dice--another personal strike against it.  I sold my last dungeon crawl game and I have no interest in playing them again.

It will be about 70 hours of painting the 54 figs when all is said and done. I was worried the game would not have good depth to be worthwhile, but my fears were needless. The characters have a number of really strong, interesting combos and a surprising amount of variation for such a simple ruleset. This game can almost be a ten.

I have played as hero and as consul, and I am happy to say that both are really enjoyable. Also, it is very easy to teach a new player how to be consul or hero, so there is not a trap of having to be the bad guy every game if you own it. This is a huge plus. I saw someone call this "Gauntlet: the Board Game," and I would say after 4 games, that this is pretty much spot on.

complaints (none are game breaking):
1. Warping board. It's obnoxious how badly the meter tracking board warps (it's the only really notable one, probably because it has art on only one side).
2. BattleFoam excessories/compatibility - neither of the two Battle Foam setups will allow room for the boards (the one that fits in the SDE box is the fault of SodaPop not making a big enough box. The Battlefoam case is just... baffling - it holds the expansion figs, but not the boards? IT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS GAME. $80.00 to not store everything?
3. (this is minor) I have the 2nd printing which is a massive improvement over the original rulebook, but the rules are still highly confusing until you play a game or two and then reread the rules (and see how simple it really is).

RATING: 7
Dungeon hack n' slash reminiscent of the Gauntlet arcade game, with cute anime-style heroes and monsters (something my young daughter very much enjoys).  Suprisingly challenging, and simple yet interesting dice mechanics are a refreshing twist to the standard dungeon crawlers out there (i.e. potions and hearts may fly out of monsters when you hit them!), and the power and loot meters are a clever way to move the game along.  The special ability and area effect rules were a little confusing at first, but it may have been my misinterpretation of the rules (which in my defense were not very well organized as others have stated). For better or worse, it truly is like playing a video game on a table!  There is definitely enough here to tempt me to buy the expansions.  Recommend using some counters to keep track of monster/hero activations.

Warning: Be prepared to spend a 3-4 hours with super glue before playing this game!

I bought this mostly for the minis since I've been dabbling in painting as of late. The anime style was unique (sometimes you need a break from painting the ever so serious Warhammer minis...)

The minis weren't difficult to assemble (except the Dragon...BELIEVE EVERY BAD THING YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT ONE!!) but the process was tedious.

The quality of the minis was also a bit of a let down. They are nowhere near as detailed as what modern Warhammer models are. Still, they are very nice to look at and should be a joy to paint.

The CARDS are the thinnest, crappiest card stock I've ever seen in a boxed game like this! Terrible...sleeves are a MUST!

I'll review the game whenever I get around to playing it. :)

Just wasn't what I was expecting when I opened the box, I'm not a bit mini's guy, but love the style of the Soda Pop Mini's so I thought here would be a fun game I could play.  Now I have (at the rate I work) 12+ hours of assembly (probably a month in real time) before I can play the bloody game.

Just didn't realize I was buying a watered down mini's game instead of a board game.

It feels a lot like 'Doom: The Boardgame' or 'Descent: Journeys in the Dark', but all the fiddliness has been ditched in favor of straight forward 'kill monsters, get loot'. Really, both the ones I mention boil down to that too, they just dress it up with more convulted maps and 'darker' minis. This one plays faster, and I see it making it on to the table more often than it's predecessors.

Update: As we play it more, and become more knowledgable about the various model's traits and abilities, the more I like this game. There's far more depth than in either of the two I mentioned above, but far less fiddliness at the same time.

The rulebook is terrible beyond belief, with errata, glaring omissions and so hard to understand that a game with a rules complexity not that high compared to say, Pandemic. My first play was simply a broken version of the game and my second, while far better, I'm sure has lots of pitfalls too. This has never happened to me, and I haven't had any problems with say, Car Wars, which is the most complex game I own besides W40K.


The JRPG influence is overstated, this is Gauntlet with character abilities and different potions, a much better infleunce in many regards. I can see the game getting quite tight and brain-burning once we get the rules right, hope it delivers what it promises.

Very fun video game style dungeon crawler. The minis are very cool and the mechanics really fun. The board should really be a bit bigger - even the smaller minis tend to get stuck on each other when there are lots of minis in the same area, due to the number arms/weapons/wings/shields that stick out so far they're actually in a different space than the mini. The dice are very nice and roll very well and the gameplay has a lot of fun back and forth.

Mine. Adquirido a Yera. Pendiente de pintar!!!
Tambien Ray al final consiguio agenciarselo (despues de intentar comprarme el mio varias veces :D)

Lo mejor de este juego es como clava la ambientacion de videojuego RPG japones, con una estetica anime muy cuidada y un sistema de potenciamiento de los heroes muy facil de utilizar por los jugadores. 

flojea en falta de versatilidad segun el numero de jugadores, al juego basico le falta campaña y al cabo de algunas partidas se hace repetitivo (como los juegos en los que se inspira, por otra parte xD)

es un buen juego, pero le falta un poco de "trabajo en los sotanos" para ser magnifico.

RATING: 3
The rulebook is really hard to follow, and our first two plays were pretty bad because we couldn't follow what they were saying.  However once we figured it out it was a pretty simple game.  The thing I like the most is that after a game or two, anybody could play the bad guys.

Also the game takes a looooong time to play.

Update:
It's been a while since we pulled this out.  The game feels like it's wildly unbalanced in the DMs favor.  As a player it's always an uphill struggle just to stay alive.  Not in a fun way either.

Update:
Sold the game.  But since have played it with someone who owns all the expansions.  Still tough, there were times when the DM had to pull punches to keep a player in the game.  Don't regret selling it.

Decent dungeon crawler.
I don't like dungeon crawlers because they feel like effeciency puzzles. But this one i can enjoy to some degree, because it's relatively simple & plays quick.
Art and minitures are good. The advancement of the "timer" not so. The timer advances whenever characters or monsters loose HPs. That means killing monsters will actually thwart your strategy. That does not really feel thematic.

And since the number of monsters is limited by the actual ammount of models, good players will devise various plans of how not to kill but immobilize or weaken mosters in order to keep the useless model on the map. A bit anti-thematic.

But other than that, quite a good translation of a MMORPG.

Cute anime characters, 16bit inspired theme, fast and loose game play.  This game lives up to the "Super" in the title.  Uses a dice pool system for attack and defense that is clean and efficient.  Loot is earned by inflicting a certain number of wounds in a given round.  This focuses the attention on combat instead of avoiding enemies while running for the nearest chest.  Each character has exactly one slot for any given type of equipment (weapon, armor, item, relic) which makes calculating stat boosts quick and seamless.  No unnecessary or complex rules mean that you can learn the system and get playing much faster.

A really fun game. It has simple rules, but there is plenty of choices. It has a very different feel then other dungeun crawlers like DD: Legend of Drizzt and Descent. The theme was original at the time I got it. The theme is very fun to paint and build terrain with. Any miniature fan will love to collect and work with it. Very unique to paint, and my kids and I have had a lot of fun building terrain for it. This is not my favorite board game, but it is one of my favorite miniature games. IF you enjoy painting and building miniatures I would highly recommend this, if you are just into board games, then this is just an OKAY game and you may want to spend your money else where.

RATING: 6
First edition base game, same with Roxor and Von Drakk. It's not a bad game but the groups seem to prefer others. The chibi look is interesting. great art and component quality. The only time the game starts to drag is towards the end of the player's turns and the DM has to activate all the leftover dudes (who are dying like a freaking holocaust throughout every game BTW). 
I think the game could've used a MOBA-style play variant (maybe there's one out there, IDK).
Probably going to trade it off as it doesn't get much play lately (I'm currently awaiting Star Saga and I think I'd rather have Dungeon Saga instead of other dungeoncrawls, sort of consolidate into one system, if that makes sense?).

RATING: 7
Don't be fooled, this is not a game that supports 6 players.  It's much more designed as a two player game.  With one playing as a group of heroes, and the other playing as the hoards of enemies.

Too many players and the game bogs way down, hero players end up with long stretches of time with nothing to do, and when their turn does finally come around it's over in minutes.

However with 2 or 3 players this game can shine.  I has all the makings of a fun little dungeon crawl.  The base game doesn't have a ton of variety.  With only a handful of different monsters, one mini-boss, and one boss.  It has a good number of heroes and it does feel like a complete game.

Also be warned, this game requires a lot of prep time to assemble.  All the mini's do NOT come assembled, and they are also unpainted.  If you're not into the miniature hobby aspect of the game, I cannot recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Despite the 'explore' in its name, this game is not a dungeon crawler (exploration and adventuring).  It feels more to me like a dungeon conquest game (tactical battlefield).

The main selling point to me at the time of purchase was the chibi (Super Deformed characters in Japanese art-style) characters in a fantasy setting.  A few characters defied this art-style mold, but too few to be an objection (although the number seem to grow with the expansions); I cannot say the same for the new version, Forgotten King.

I would need more plays to lay down a more definitive opinion of the mechanics.

RATING: 8
9 if you like miniatures and competition, 7 if not.

Miniatures.  Great detail, 45mins for me and a friend to build, great to paint.  Bad if you're not into it.

Gameplay.  Once you get the rules squared (takes a bit, new online manual / 2nd print is much better) my competitive friends find this game a blast.  Both sides always seem at the brink of victory or disaster.  All choices end up mattering later on and nefarious human AI keeps things intense, or less so if you have a charitable Consul playing, say, children.  Also, strategies vary based on boards used and character selection for re-playability. Expansions inbound Fall 2012.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (October 2012)

As the game owner was very negative about the game (we almost didn’t play this) I had very little hopes for it, furthermore, I just bought and read the Mage Wars Rulebook so I was ready to be disappointed by SDE, however I really liked it. Perhaps it was because I was expecting very little of the game but, to me, Super Dungeon Explore is a light tactical gem and the miniatures make me want to buy it :).

The components are superb, the miniatures very well done, the art (although Chibi is not my preference) is great and the boards are also of good quality and fun to play with. The cards are very thin (at least in the Spanish version), the only negative of the production values :S. They need to be sleeved at once. The mechanics are really simple but they work well together, I didn´t feel any downtime playing this. Also as the game is so simple, there is space for it in a collection with similar but heavier games.

It appears I like this kind of game (I think I also WILL like Summoner Wars and Mage Wars but I have not played them, only read the rules), the game is somewhat simple, but that is a strong point if you want to play this with casual gamers. But I DO want to play it again soon. Also the game has a fair share of luck, but you can manage it with treasures and loot. 

As the miniatures come disassembled you have to glue them together, I huge minus for me, but my girlfriend can help me with this. Also it appears the Spanish rulebook is a mess, I will read the English rules this week. That was one reason my friend was so turned down on the game.

All things considered, a good game made great due to its awesome miniatures :D.

After more plays, I continue to love SDE. For me it is superior to Krosmaster Arena because: (1) I love games in which a player (the Consul) is against the rest. (2) It feels very tense when the Consul has many minions to throw at the lone heroes. Also, it isn’t as light as I thought :D, it has lots of interesting decisions and every game has been very fun.

The rules are a mess but I think they released a better rulebook. I still have not read the rules of the game (too many games to learn). I want to play as the Consul next. 

One of 2011`s favorites.

I have a poor win record as the heroes (it's usually me versus a friend, 2 or 3 heroes). I want more dungeon tiles, but I like the game a lot. I'm glad the expansions come pre-glued, especially since I'll never paint my minis.

RATING: 7
Quite a lengthy game, and it's basically an RPG on a board. Lots of elements that reminded me of World of Warcraft, actually. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as many of the rules felt intuitive to me (being an avid RPG fan). The others I was playing with seemed a little lukewarm to the rules, as they do seem a tad forced in some ways. 

All in all, if you like RPGs or WoW, I'd say give it a shot.

RATING: 6
Don't be fooled, this is not a light dungeon crawler by any means. Don't expect something brain-dead like D&D board games. Heroes will die if they don't play as a team. There are plenty of opportunities for smart tactical AND strategic plays.

Alternating plays between the heroes and the monsters reduces the downtime for the consul player by a LOT compared to Descent. It makes the game more "fluid" or real-time, as heroes and monsters can react to one another.

Now, one of the problems with the game is that it doesn't play as nicely as it should. There's a lot of bookkeeping to do, keeping track of activations of a huge number of figures, and remembering which special abilities have been triggered. There's definitely room for improvement there to reduce the drag.

This is probably my new favorite game, it takes descent/doom throws in some cute anime style chibi characters and shortens the game down to 90min or less! (5-6 player game 120min)
The game play is fast and fun, several mechanics from it's forfathers have been fixed and revamped to make the game the best of its kind ( Unless you are a super serious role play kinda group )

  The figures come UN-ASSEMBLED* so have some glue ready to stick them together before you can play.  And if you want to paint them, be ready to spend at least 1 week painting before you get to play the game.

Don't be fooled: not a dungeoncrawler. However, I went in not expecting a dungeoncrawl and had a very good time. It's simple and fast, but has enough depth so nobody gets bored when the game nears the end. 
I'm not a miniatures gamer, so the task of assembling all those miniatures was a bit daunting at first. It didn't take too long though, about an hour or two. Once assembled, the miniatures look gorgeous! The tokens are nice, sturdy and easy to read and the dice feel quite heavy and are beautifully translucent.
Bad points: the boards warped almost immediately and the cards are very thin and feel flimsy. Might be the first game I'll sleeve.

Sold. It almost never hit the table, wasn't a big hit in the group. Also, solo Arcade mode isn't all that good.
Replaced with Arcadia Quest: Inferno, which is more simple and streamlined.

Played once, 5p.  Rating is a composite of how much I want to play (fun) and how good I think the game is.  There are some significant problems with the game as a STRATEGY game; very luck based, in that you roll dice to hit and defend, as well as draw from 2 decks of cards.  There are some ambiguities in the rules as well, especially where abilities are concerned.  However, the figures are super awesome, and the game is pretty fun, even if sometime, there aren't too many strategic options.  Game length could be a problem for some.

This is the dungeon devling game for me. A seriously easy and fun game to play that looks just amazing. I can't say that anything in the game is all that unique but it is put together in a really great package, and just looks aweomse to boot. The price tag may be steep, but I definitely think it is well worth that price, if not the discounted price you can find with some shopping. You get a shit ton of miniatures, and a good number of other components as well.

If you've never assembled mini's before, you're in for a real challenge. Once you've got everything ready to go though, it's a really fun game full of charm and change. It's fun to play as the good guys and the bad and it makes a very valiant effort to bring hack-and-slash video gameplay to the tabletop. Also, We've come to find it make the game a little more interesting to set up some kind of story and role-play a bit to add some structure. I can be a little difficult to keep track of all of the figures during play though, as the board can become quite cluttered.

     Miniatures are awesome!
     ANGRY BEAR!

Cons:
     Rules are disorganized. (Important rules all over the place and not in correct place. E.G. Magic attacks use Will for attacking and Missile attacks use Dex...)
     Quality of the Cards is low. As someone who works in the printing industry, using 100# cover for playing cards is just mind boggling...
     Quality of Tokens are poor. The mounting of the label stock to the Chip Board stock was poor and the registering between the front and back is atrocious (IMHO, I would have rejected the job if I was the person receiving it.)
     The amount of Mold Lines on the minis themselves is absurd.

I like game a lot for the cool fantasy heroes and dungeon theme. It's got a very colorful and exciting presentation with a lot of variety.

RATING: 7
Frustratingly hard to get the rules down pat, due to a bloody awful rulebook. Great game system which feels like it's missing something; the sub-boss, Rex, is too feeble and the Paladin is too powerful. It's very enjoyable, but can sometimes feel too hard for the 'Consul' to win. I'm eagerly awaiting the next release, which changes up the rules significantly, while taking all existing content into the new version.

(edit) 1.6 rules are much clearer and the game is quite intuitive. Main issue is that as the Consul you play a game of 'loot denial' rather than try to trash the heroes.

It just arrived and it is glorious!

It plays more like a video game then a miniature game and that is great. The way heroes can share potions, drops, and loot keeps the game fast and free. I love the creative combos things like the teleport potion allow. 

The adventure tracker does a great job of moving the story forward and changing up the threat level as the game goes on. The loot tracker does a great job of rewarding aggressive play and well planned attacks. The loot system is elegant and enjoyably overpowered.

My only real complaint is that the depth and strategy of the games is hard too see at first because of how poorly the rulebook introduces and organizes the games key concepts.

Looking forward to more official and fan made expansions and scenarios.

Update - still love the look of this game but tokens make it cumbersome... Mice and mystics has replaced this.

Not sure how balanced the game is yet. It definitely takes some experience to learn what to do and what not to do. The bad guys are 2-1 so with, with the only hero win coming in our initial 8-bit game.

Eventually chalked this up on the list of failed dungeon crawlers. Too many bits, too many fiddly little rules, too much looking stuff up, too much micromanagement. I dunno. The dungeon crawling experience is best 1) in video game form or 2) in D&D for me.

Has initiative instead of forced turn order. I like the boss mechanism where he leaves 1/2 way through leaving minions. There is plenty of opportunity for healing for the party and replayability seems to be pretty good. Heroes have the advantage, leaving the DM to go all out. Bosses are strong- goes down to the wire.

Lots of expansions, too!

The tempo of the game is weird. It mostly feels like a game where the DM tries to soak out all the player's potions, and the players are trying to get potions. I found this mechanic very unsatisfying on my first play, but will likely give it a second try.

I never thought I would rate a game this low.  The minis in this game are outstanding, the game play is boring.  We played for 4+ hours and did not finish (properly).  

The game play resolved into these 2 repetitive steps.

1) Move your guy and roll attack dice(bad guy usually gets killed), and sometimes you get a health, or potion which can be used on a future attack.  Or a special card which really isn't that special, since after about half the game is done you've already acquired all the special cards you need.

2) Dungeon Master moves his bad guys and rolls attack dice, or re-spawns a lot of bad guys.

Very little decision making, just a bunch of dice chucking.  I'd probably be OK with this for an hour or two, but 4+ hours with no proper ending.  Not happy!

I love dungeon crawling and I've held out on buying a board game version 'til I saw this one last year. It's a bit expensive and finally was able to get my hands on one this week.

I knew there were a billion pieces to put together, but I underestimated how exhausting dealing with them would be. I'm in the process of finding the best route for painting them and moving on.

The game seems to be solid. I like the arcade-y feel of it and love the loot and treasure to be gained. Combat is also cool and the dice are great to use. Wonderfully crafted!

I wish the other components were as well. Cards are fine, tokens are fine, but the boards are awful. I want something sturdy for the size of tiles in the game. These are thin cardboard that easily curls. The progression tile is very thin and spins on the table when placed face up. Obviously of poor quality.

The box itself opens like a box of Twinkies. There is no lift-off lid, it opens with two side flaps stuck inside the box. A pain to deal with. The entire box was folded together like one of those long white cardboard boxes for Magic cards. You know, the kind you buy flat, then have to construct yourself.

Aside from the miniatures, there's not a whole lot of components. Tokens, dice, giant tiles and cards. That's it. They're housed fine, but partitions for minis would have been nice. No problem, though.

For the price paid, I think I should have received a higher quality product. It all seems a bit cheap to me, but I own games with incredible components and packaging, so I've got certain biases!

All in all, it's a cool game with lots of fun to be had in painting the minis if that's your cup of tea.

Super fun dungeon crawl game. Super fast - no plot or other baggage to weigh it down; just set up and slay your way to victory or death. The cute characters are great. They're nicely varied so that although each has a defined role, they also have some nice strategy choices.

Might become a little repetitive as the consul has limited choices - though I'm sure the expansions will solve that.

RATING: 6.5
SDE is a fun and well paced dungeon crawler.  It's not mechanic intensive like Descent or games like that, but it seems to bring enough to the table to keep it interesting.

The game oozes theme, but if you don't like the old fashion JRPG's, like the first 6 Final Fantasys or things of that sort then this is probably not for you.

I'm no miniatures fan, but this exceeded my pretty low expectations. I have to concede that the figures are pretty neat, and warping humourless dungeon-crawling into a low-brow computer genre is definitely the way to go. But there must be a combat game which doesn't require you to use dice for battle? Surely?

As a colourful, dice-rolling, miniatures game, this is great. The video-game-based theme is clever and cute. Can't take it too seriously ... goes on too long for me; I wish it was shorter for the lighter feel it has. It's basically just a battle game - NOT a RPG at all.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: A nice and light dungeon crawler. The Dark Consul (dungeon master) spawns creatures at spawn points and basically it is a hack and slash. There are a lot of tokens to make effects, but most are not used based on the characters or mission selected, so you can play a light mission or a heavier one. One issue is that some characters seem stronger and more useful then others and once dead, your basically out of the game, which would leave players just watching. Worth a try if you want a lighter version of Descent.

I gave this a 7 due to my lack of actually playing this game. The first print you had to assemble all of the pieces which was "cool" at first. It just led me to want them painted. Some things I with would happen with the game is possibly creating a story mode and adding more dungeon tiles. Other than that, the base game is great to get you started.

It is a little fun game. IMHO, the overlord has a lot of power, we have yet to win a game of this. I have considered getting the large expansion for the cooperative stuff, but I will see if I can gather that from published rules and then determine if it warrants the expansion. We did paint all the minis of the base game, and we think that is plenty, but I may consider the large expansion or even perhaps a good set on sale for a decent price.

Does a great job replicating the hack and slash videogame genre. Doesn't feel like a pen and paper rpg in anyway, but with a plethora of status effects, skills, and other special abilities there is a lot of fun to be had.

This is a cute minis combat game, where one player takes the monsters and each other player gets a single hero. The game plays fairly quickly and has a low setup time compared to other games in this genre. There is no plot to speak of, this is strictly hero characters kill monsters and eliminate spawn points then fight boss. The cuteness of the minis helps to give the game some flavor. We had a fun time, but the hero players got completely squashed. I'm excited to play this again, although it has some tough table-time competition from Descent 1&2, Level 7, Myth and Earth Reborn.

Cool mini's, to be sure.  And the game is pretty quick playing and streamlined.  But, and this is a big but, there are better games that are slightly heavier and have some kind of campaign mode that carries from game to game.  I like that.  This is a one-off and done kind of thing, which has its place and fan base, but I'm not really into it.  
I'll play if it is requested, but it isn't often, so...take that for what you will.

I have a lot of mixed feelings about this game. The components are beautiful and once you have the rules down the game is actually pretty streamlined for a dungeon crawler, however, the rulebook is horribly organized and sometimes the simplicity of the game is it's greatest fault. Just about everything in the game comes down to the roll of the dice. Heroes don't have much health, but potions and hearts are in constant supply. The main strategy here- don't let the Consul/GM gang up on one player. Overall- it's the kind of light-hearted fun you'd expect from a game with a chibi anime theme.

01-10-2015. Rated after 2 more plays. Meh, meh, meh. I played Arcade and Classic SDE now. Both are the same mindless grind, Mini's, artwork, equipment system is all very cool. But fundamentally I keep on thinking why am I doing this. The game is simply not fun for me. It's ok.. it's a grind. and that annnoys me. The complete lack of story is a severe downside for me. All in all, SDE is a disappointment for me. Sad.

13-07-2014. Rated after 2 plays VS mode. Tactical minis game in which you try to defend your spawnpoints with a hero and assortment of spawning monsters. Heros are vastly overpowered compared to the monsters, so why these are part of the game I do not know. So who is quickest to attack likely will win, because spawn points are weak and your hero neigh impossible to defeat. 

Great artwork, theme and minis. Unfortunately the game just fell flat for me.

Furious game where you roll dice and beat 'em up, rinse and repeat x infinity. No need for questions. Design is simple, which dismayed me at first -- the dungeon rooms are simply designed (like in console RPGs), no coordinative action for the heroes? -- but after the game started, I decided I was too good for stinkin' rules and wanted to beat 'em up too. There is just enough design to provide structure without getting in the way.

The mini-boss and Consul thing evokes Cave Evil's great awakening.

The figures are so uniquely cute, pity I probably won't buy this because of the required assembly. 

I got bogged down by keyword overload for first game, but I suspect I'll like this more once I become comfortable with them. Beating minions up for loot is like a push-the-pedal reward system; you can't get enough. Japanese arcade music not included; put on any generic one for a trip down nostalgia.

Fun hack-and-slash game. There's quite a bit of strategy for both sides, with Heroes experimenting with what makes up a balanced team, and the Consul in setting up monster formations. The kobolds are particularly fun to play as they need to move in packs, but fall prey to area attacks by heroes. I do wish they included one more set of monsters so that the Consul has more toys at his disposal. The drawback is that the rulebook is poorly laid out and vaguely worded at times.

The one word I think with this game is "balance". If there's one thing they did right, it's that once the super-glue sets on the miniatures, you're going to be playing a game that is an all-out war. The consul (bad guys) has to fight tooth and nail to make sure the heroes don't just wipe a swath of death through his troops, and the heroes have to balance killing the baddies (gets them loot, risks spawning the boss when they're too weak) and stopping the monster spawns (makes the boss weaker in the end, risks being overwhelmed by minions). Miniatures look great, artwork is second to none. My big beef is that the rulebook is miserably organized. If they organized the rulebook, this would have made this a lot easier to learn. Once learned, it is both well-constructed parts and well-designed gameplay!

I'm hesitant to actually call this a great game based on the gameplay alone, because really it seems mostly about how much loot the heroes can get by the time the boss comes out, and the pace at which you must kill spawning points is very unforgiving, which leads to a feeling of "one strategy for each side." Keeping track of aura effects and such is pretty fiddly, and the movement tactics could probably stand to be more interestingm

But the game is fun, and the components are amazing (the figures at least; the cards and boards leave something to be desired). Add that to the nostalgia factor with the SNES inspiration, and I'm head over heels for this game. More scenarios would be cool (read: there aren't any), but I really like the variety in characters and abilities.

[hr]Cleaned up rules and decisive balance changes where needed (like with the Smoke ability), errata, etc. help the game and I like to see developers who take an active role in "aftercare" rather than abandoning designs that could use refinement and moving onto a new game to market. 

Also, there are even rules for a 2 player "battle arena" mode now, where players control a team of monsters, spawn points, and a hero (goal to wipe out opposing hero or spawns). Sounds sweet.

Design rating increased.

[hr]Now that I've had a chance to try it, Arena mode feels a bit tacked on, which it actually is, so yeah. But seems like there's a decent amount of tactical depth to it that changes up the way the game is played.

Once I got past the vague and poorly structured rulebook, I found a fantastic old school dungeon crawl with plenty of charm and room for creativity. You won't find a choice of scenarios or boss options (yet) but the scope for home brew scenarios, dungeons and bosses appeals greatly to me. The combat system is simple but ingenius and characters and monsters have enough interesting powers to really add depth and flavour. Contrary to what I'm seeing people write, after a few games, my play group and I continue to find SDE challenging for the heroes. I'm a little concerned that the game seems to reward 'zerg' strategies but this hasn't hampered the replayability yet.

This game is a sort of Diablo clone in board game form.  One player controls the monsters, Descent-style, while each of the other players controls a hero.  The heroes goal is to kill wave after wave of monster, collecting better and better loot, and finally trying to destroy the monster spawning points and boss monster.  The monster-controlling player is simply trying to kill all the heroes.

The game is clearly emulating video games.  The monster levels are represented by "bit" values, i.e. 8-bit and 16-bit monsters.  The movement and action points value icons on the heroes are a D-pad and controller button.  This is all pretty neat and the artwork is attractive with a fun chibi/anime style.

The miniatures themselves are also attractive but A PAIN IN THE ASS.  The smallest monsters in this game come in 6 individual pieces that you have to snip apart and glue together.  If you're not good with your hands at all like me this is so much more trouble than it is worth.  Just to play the game you have to spend literally hours assembling the 52 miniatures in this game not to mention the more time it will take you to clean excess glue off of the models so they don't look completely horrible.  Tip to miniatures game designers, "some assembly required" is not what most board gamers want!

Past that this game is only okay.  I would play it and enjoy myself but this kind of gameplay I could get better out of playing a video game.  I would certainly get more variety in monsters and loot out of a video game.  The base game only comes with one boss and 2 different categories of monsters, this is especially skimpy.  The loot is also a bit boring, with many pieces just giving stat bonuses and a kind of bland effect like causing a certain debuff when attacking.

The one spot I will say there is good variety is in the heroes.  There are 8 different heroes, all with different stats, abilities, and potion effects and they all play very differently.  However what it comes down to is the gameplay itself just isn't very interesting.  Not even the game boards provide any kind of variety or variability.  Some are big rooms, some are four small rooms, you just walk around these boards killing the same monsters over and over again, picking up some bland loot, destroying spawn points, and killing the same boss over and over again.

This game is just completely replaced by Descent and similar games.  In these games there is a larger variety of monsters, a story to roleplay through, and most importantly (and the thing the video games this game tries to emulate also do) there is progression.

This game is a one-shot every time you play which I guess provides some value in that it sets up and plays a lot faster than a game like Descent and also can be played with whoever is gathered around without worrying about the same party being available.  I just would rather go through the trouble of scheduling and setting up a game of Descent than play this.

Tiene todo el aspecto d ser un video juego en la mesa :)

Lo q le falta al ravenloft lo tiene el SDE. Un Dungeon Crawl muy ágil, rápido y con la sensación real de peligro.

Muy recomendable si quieres pasar un buen rato.

Eso si tiene diez mil contadores competamente inútiles y tienes q montar las miniaturas antes de poder jugar (y prepárate pq tiene bastante trabajo este montaje, sobre todo si quieres q acaben con un buen aspecto)

I can't describe properly, or even justify why I love this game so much. I have pretty much every character released to date, short of only King Starfire, and otherwise miss only the official playmat for Arena mode. The miniatures are full of character and full of references to many 1980's video games that certainly appeal to me. 

The game itself is evolving with 2.0 rules about to officially come out with the release of Forgotten King, and having tried the new rules in their beta format, there is no going back to the old, fiddly rules. Can't wait for the new hero and villain cards to complement those new rules. This evolution is what makes me rate the game with a solid 9. It can take a while for a game to be done (depending on the players, I'd say between 30 and 60 minutes per hero, so a 4-hero game could take you a few hours), but time does fly by when playing. Definatly a gamer's game, as casual gamers might find it too heavy, too long and too complex. It can become a slog though, and Arcade games are definately too easy. As for Classic, things are swingy and uneven. Still good, but need a bit of work.

This is, however, a very interesting Gauntlet-type dungeon crawler, with an all-coop mode (Arcade), a 2-player PvP mode (Arena, which is a very tactical and shorter game in its own right), and the classic heroes vs. Consul mode (Classic). And the variety calls for home ruling ("Ok, let's try a Pvp game, 3 heroes a side, with proximity-triggered monsters, 2 resurrects per player").

Looooove this game!

EDIT (2017-04-10) : With Legends coming (eventually) had the chance to try the revised Classic and Arcade. They had the minis, they now have solid rules. And the revised Arena is a blast.

RATING: 4
(tl;dr: cute miniatures. OK with two players; avoid playing with 6 unless you want to waste 3+ hours on a light game -- rules-heavy for its weight, but light -- with some serious problems.)

Cute dungeon-crawl deliberately modeled on 8/16-bit JRPGs -- chibi mage, chibi paladin, chibi rogue et chibi al battle minions until the miniboss and, finally, the big boss. The inspiration is absolutely unmistakeable, and the small touches are delightful: halfway through each boss fight, for one example, the boss flees to another room and regains some of its lost abilities, just like every multi-stage boss you've ever faced in a Final Fantasy or even a Super Mario.

Mechanically it works less well. The game model is one of many easy-to-defeat grunts and one or two difficult bosses, which would work well in a fully automated co-op. Because one player has to control the bad guys, they are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the heroes until the boss or miniboss can spawn -- indeed, the main purpose of the grunts seems to be to delay the heroes' killing spawn points and collecting treasure until the big guns can spawn. Depending on the heroes chosen or loot acquired, there are also a few bizarrely broken rules, like the fact that bosses are unable to heal themselves of serious status effects. Hitting a boss with weakness or immobility (or even setting it on fire) has an enormously powerful persistent effect.

As a storytelling experience it also leaves something to be desired -- there isn't much scope for treating it like an RPG. All that's left is a sort of dull simulation of a much better computer gaming experience. I'm not philosophically against dungeon crawls but this one just isn't very fun.

After the first game, with three, I thought it might be better with the full complement of six. I was wrong. The box says 120 minutes; I think it deserves about 60. Various reports here put the real play time at three to five hours. It's agonizingly slow downtime hell and I will never play it again.

Ratings history: 5 -> 4 (for 2-3 player game). With six players I rate it a 2.

Great theme play.  Game is easy to learn and play.  Game play is not challenging, but still fun.  The heroes have interesting powers.  Components are fair - the board tiles were very warped and have drab and confusing artwork, the plastic figures (newer versions include assembled figures) are very nice, thick cardboard playing pieces, and somewhat durable cards with cartoonish artwork.  Game time is about 1.5 hours which feels right.

Not the most expensive game I own, but definitely in the top ten.  I like dungeon crawlers and modular boards so this was an inevitable purchase I suppose.  Given the price point I'm a bit dismayed at the D.I.Y. nature of the figures.  They are very high quality though, and my wife (who paints much, much better than I do) is itching to have a crack at them.  Disappointed that this isn't playable right out of the box, but I'm looking forward to playing it.

Really fun minis game using modular tile board - basically a video game translated into a minis game. It works perfectly well with 2 players. The minis are cute and pretty high quality. Note: the pieces do arrive in bags unassembled! My partner looks forward to gluing and painting them, but we're easily able to play with them half-assembled right out of the box. I freakin' love this game, even though it seems to take more time than advertised. 

Unfortunately, the rulebook isn't great for first-time players (e.g., occasionally uses undefined terms, no index/table of contents, the at-a-glance guide is weak). It suffers a little from 1st edition blues, too; our copy was totally missing one bag of minis, but after contacting them, they replaced the missing packet very fast.

RATING: 6
The minis are cute, though a pain to assemble.
Straightforward video game style skirmish/dungeon crawl. Plays well, though a little too long for what it is. The rulebook is a mess, and some rules seem to be missing completely.
I like how the heroes work; they've got decent variety, and the acquisition of loot and potions works well.
Monsters could use a bit more variety; they have almost no ranged attacks as is. I think there are too many spawns, which is part of the reason the game takes too long. Playing with some variant rules to improve that.

I just love this game. It's a fast, streamlined, super dungeon "romp" (there really isn't any "exploring").

To me, this game takes too long to play and is overdone for what it is.  There are similar hack-n'-slash-type games out there that are as much fun and don't require an entire evening to play.  This game's bubble-gum fantasy theme isn't to my taste.  It's a bit like a tabletop version of the old Gauntlet arcade game that someone keeps pumping quarters into.

Great theme and components.  The one game I've played took over 6 hours and the first 5 hours were just stalling and gathering loot until the boss showed up.  So, that left a sour taste in my mouth.  Hopefully games normally only take 2 to 3 hours.

This is interesting, but it seems heavily skewed in favor of the Consul/overlord. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's very easy to swing one way or the other very early. The rules aren't as clear as they should be, and I'm not entirely sure that we ever played this correctly.

I really wanted to like this game, and while there is a good game in there, it wasn't quite right for our group. Off it goes in trade. I still would like to try this with a group that feels that the Heroes are overpowered, just to see how things play out.

Game plays similar to Zombicide. Was enjoyable but also a little long and tiresome. In the later stages of the game there is very little to differentiate the turns aside from the ever growing threat of new bosses. Still the beginning of the game is a lot of fun and finding loot for your character and trading with other makes it worth playing. The board itself and the models are fantastic and the ability to add extras purchased outside of the starter makes for a pretty unique game experience that changes.

Rating after one play with two. Our first game with three heroes took us about 4 hours to finish (including setup and explanation), so a bit longer than expected. But it was fun! The game is more action oriented and less of a typical dungeon crawl than Warhammer Quest or Descent. It actually plays more like Space Hulk mixed with the video game Gauntlet (if that makes any sense). That earns it a spot in my collection. Cannot wait to see what the announced expansions have to offer! Too bad the rulebook and the quality of the components are both a bit disappointing. And that the great artwork on the box and character cards is not carried over to the unremarkable game boards.

Too many plays to go back and count.  This is a great game to play with a group of friends.  It may take a bit of time to set up, but it plays smoothly and with the addition of a new expansion now and then [or Legends!] there are too many possible ways to play.  Games will never go the same way and with the new update, no one has to be the bad guy... Not that it isn't fun too!

The miniatures are nice [though personally I miss the assembled models], though they can be a little hard to paint some of the pre-assembled ones.  The older map tiles don't mix with the new Forgotten King tiles unless you trim, but the miniatures cross over just fine, if a little dated in design.

Rules are unclear, miniatures are a royal pain to assemble and then are prone to breaking, rest of the components feel cheap.  Gameplay is good, up there with the better dungeon crawls I've played, but characters don't seem well-balanced, and hole-filled rulebook means that you'll have to house-rule out a lot of inconsistencies.  By and large, this game smacks of not enough playtesting.  This one needs to go back into development in order to take it from good-but-flawed to excellent.

UPDATE: Played once and sold. The underlying game is deathly boring. Doubtless brill for miniatures peeps.

Will doubtless get scored higher once I've painted the pieces. I won't play it a second time until I've painted them. The pieces are cute.

The first game was fun: a capture-the-flag skirmish where the enemies kept on coming. It's potentially a great game, but the pieces come unassembled and unpainted. The pieces took three hours to assemble.

What's more, it's designed to be expanded so there is limited replay in the base game. With a large choice of easy-to-assemble units, this would be a clear 9 or 10.

RATING: 4
A video game a la Gauntlet inspired boardgame which plays like a mix of Last Night On Earth and Mage Knight. A bit complex at first with many different hero and monster special abilities to learn. Very long first game with 5 newbies, but it should be much faster with repeated plays and if at least one player knows the rules well.

Rating should go up with repeated plays (presuming significantly smoother and shorter playing time). However, I am very unlikely to play it enough (or again at all) with a regular group to get to that point.

Just too relentless and linear for me I'm afraid. I know it's a representation of a Japanese console, but had me quickly yawning. Much prefer mission-based similar games like the D&D offerings.

Really fun, somewhat fiddly.  Disappointed that you have to assemble and paint the minis.  Seriously considering buying this.  Hummed the theme song to the old 8=bit Legend of Zelda the whole time.
Update: Bought a 2nd hand copy already assembled (unpainted). Played, enjoyed :)

The minis are have to be assembled before you can play. So they sit in a box.

Not yet played.

Straightforward but fun. Rulebook does have some kinks.
Should make a decent reference sheet and include some "Moved" counters.

I love the concept of the game and the cool minis / art work. It would probably work with more of a family / lighter setting. With the right crowd I think the game could be a lot more fun. I really didn't enjoy my game as the Console or my game as the Druid. It just didn't seem like the heroes could possibly lose to be honest. To many ways for them to heal / transfer items or damage it seemed to me.

My wife enjoyed painting the minis, but the gameplay is rather long.

We've only played small games, and I do take it pretty easy on my daughter as the Consul, but she really likes it.  I will up the challenge over time as she becomes more skilled.

Clever idea, "Gauntlet" the video game translated to a board game. Uses the Overlord mechanic (1 vs many) to strong effect. Poorly written rulebook keeps this from having a higher score.

Had high expectations for this one and was let down on the first game. Great looking miniatures though.

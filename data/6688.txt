An excellent 3 player game. Perhaps the best game for three players? The name is the highest score that is possible and 9 is the theme of the game - nine tricks played over nine rounds, with 9 cards used each round to forecast the bid.

This game is still a bit frustrating, but it's a good, fun frustration. Having to bid with cards out of your hand and having nine cards completely out of the hand both make things more complicated and more fun. A gem of a game I can see myself playing quite a bit.

Tempting to give it a 9 just to keep the theme going.

An outstanding trick-taking game in which the bonuses obtained from hitting your trick bid on the nose seem to be far more important than taking tricks. Only played it with 3 and I expect I will only play it with 3, as your hand-size is big enough to give you enough information to base valid strategies on, and yet has just enough cards removed from people's hands into the bidding declarations to surprise you with unexpected gaps in suit-sequences. It does force you to think hard about alternative options just in case crucial cards have disappeared from the suit-order. At the same time, just by forcing you to use cards from your hand to create the trick bid target, the declaration phase be a headache in itself, as it is frequently quite obvious what trick number you could make, if only you had a remaining trio that would let you declare that. A juicy bit of headology is involved, as you will simultaneously be securing your own tricks, whilst figuring out what trick target other people are playing to, and trying to come up with card play that scuppers their best-laid plans. It's great that you set your own target depending on the cards you were dealt. It is almost immaterial if you pick up a poor or great trick hand, you simply set your target accordingly, and the bonus for getting is right is worth the same to all. However, since the getting-the-trick-target-right bonus varies, depending on the amount of players that managed to do just that, you do need a bit of luck to get maximum points. A confident and skilful player can aim for an even bigger bonus (or penalty) by making an open declaration, something that creates dynamics all of its own.

So simple that it is amazing that decisions can be so hard, and without any gimmicks or rules that are added simply to spice it up. Trick taking at its best, public domain, and for three people at that. It probably deserves a 9, but I just can't put down the extra half-a-point, and still have a fighting chance of taking all 9 tricks.

I'm getting close to say it's flawless, but it looks like the points for tricks taken are so insignificant compared to the impact of bonuses on the score, that I think I would prefer it if these weren't set so that with an ideal hand you could score it in one turn, but that they were more set at levels that didn't enable disproportionately extravagant score totals that can blow equally competent play with more typical cards totally out of the water.

Well, this sure beats 3-player Hearts as a 3-player trick-taking game.  It utilizes a bidding system based on one's cards and a trump suit that's determined by the number of people who made their bids in the previous round.  I found it *very* difficult to make bids in this game, as it has a different feel from 4-player trick-taking games; there just isn't the right number of cards out there per person!  Also, bidding can be a little tricksy if you get a lopsided deal or if your strategy, desired bid, and the trump suit don't align...

This is on my shortlist of top 3-player trick-taking games.

Actually, it's pretty clever and I like the way the suits match numbers.  But I'm rating the game as written and the weight of the make & reveal progression at 30/60/90 points is way too heavy.  Cut the bonuses at least in half and I'd play again.

Easy, fun trick taking game for three. I'd love to do better at these trick taking games, I just need a lot more experience in the genre. 

With more plays this game falls lower on my trick taking ladder. I don't like the reveal/declare system, the reward is too great.

RATING: 5
If you like trick-taking games, you must try this one - and you only need a regular deck of cards. You play with a subset of cards and do the traditional bidding for tricks before you play. The catch here - and fun of the game - is that you must play 3 cards each turn to set your bid. So you need to evaluate your hand considering which cards you won't have after spending to set your bid. Pretty clever and a good change of pace from Tichu.

RATING: 7
Interesting take on trick taking. Some things were incredibly welcome here, others felt odd (especially for a trick-taker of its age). Pluses included the bidding with cards such that you could never fully card count (i.e., 3 cards out per player) and do hand management before the trick taking began (e.g., dump trick to hit a low trick bid). Negatives for me included the hidden bid, with 3 players there wasn't enough time to come to deduce (or card-count) enough to get an idea of how to respond or foil plans: I would have preferred if bids were open (and that, in turn, the revealed hand were 30 points instead of 60). Also, the way of picking trump seemed artificial (as it was picked before you even received your hand). Still, a good classic trick-taker.

There just aren't very many 3-player-only games out there. I learned this just to have a 3p traditional card game in my back pocket for those times when the situation arises. It is pretty simple to explain. The way you use cards from your hand to place your bid is nifty and something I hadn't personally come across before. Sometimes you're presented with tough choices -- "I need the Ace of Clubs to make my bid, but I need to use a Club to place the bid" -- and sometimes all the bid cards totally screw with the distribution. (One hand 2 of the players uses 6 cards of one suit to place their bids, leaving only cards in play and it was the trump suit.)

Not my favorite game of all time fills its purpose perfectly.

I'd like the try Clumond one day just for comparison.

RATING: 9
Comfortably the best of David Parlett's original card games, Ninety-Nine is a wonderfully simple yet fiendishly difficult trick taker where you have to discard part of your hand to bid the number of tricks you intend to take. It sounds easy, but getting the right discards to match your bid without weakening your hand is very subtle. It's also ingenious in that there are no 'good' or 'bad' hands, the bulk of the scoring rewards correct bidding. Just occasionally you can be screwed by not having the necessary cards for what you want to bid (there's only one way to bid 0/1/8 or 9), but most systems break down at extremes anyway. Play 9 hands and use prior bid success to determine trump suit for the next hand. Designed for 3 (and is quite possibly the best card game for 3 that's playable with a standard deck), but adapts well for 4. Reasonable for 2 or 5.

1st played 1/3/08. This 3 player game can be taught in a few minutes for those savvy trick-taking players. Object is to get the most pts in 9 rounds. You play with a standard deck of cards and use 6 though ace, plus a joker. Dealer passes out 9 cards to each and the last card is trumps, unless it happens to be the joker or a 9. In that case there is no trumps. If the joker isn't up, then it's value/suit/number is the same as the face up card. Each player secretly chooses how many tricks he will take in the 9 rounds. You do this by taking three cards from your hand and place face down. Diamonds=0, Spades=1, Hearts=2, and Clubs=3 tricks respectively. So placing 3 Clubs down means you will take all tricks. You can also elect to expose your bid for an additional 30 pts by placing your cards face up, or an additional 60 pts by placing your hand face up as well. Player to the left leads out (can be trump) and it's standard trick taking. At the end, everyone reveals their bid and count your score. 1pt for each trick you take. If 1 makes bid, they get 30pts. If 2 make bid, they each get 20. If all 3 make the bid, each get 10 pts. I'd strongly recommend this to those who enjoy trick-taking games, especially since you can play with a standard deck of cards.

RATING: 6.5
Very excellent trick taking game for 3 players.  I don't have the declaration scoring rules memorized, so we just play without them.

The greatest part of this game is trying to figure out your bid.  Generally you have multiple legitimate bids you can make with your hand.  Occasionally, you get completely hosed, but it's not *that* common.

I highly recommend it!

Jun08: Finally tried it with just keeping all cards in hand and playing only 9 tricks.  The last 3 in your hand becomes your bid.  Became a real fun brain burn and screw fest.  I'll definitely try it this way more!

RATING: 8
Note my ratng is for the 2 or 3 player game, not tried other numbers and suspect they are NOT as good and also it would have to be compared with Spades, Bridge and many other games at those numbers where it wouldn't fare as well. 

This game borrowed HEAVILY from Spades, really I consider it to be a 2 or 3 player version which is great because I love Spades.  Also, the 2 player game is REALLY REALLY good, for a 2 player trick game and for a game which has a "dummy" in it. The thing is, it feels like 2 player Bridge because you get to control the dummy play when you have the lead exactly how you do in Bridge and this really adds to the depth and strategy in the game. 

The scoring is out of proportion IMO (and allows more runaway) and doesn't reward trick taking enough, especially for the 2 player and I am only so-so on bidding for tricks with the cards out of hand, it makes decisions harder but limits your control and creativity. Also having the trump decided by who won how many contracts is dumb and just a pain to track, I suspect this was done so as not to copy Spades TOO much (though combined with the bidding it is both interesting and annoying at the same time). Honestly probably better off making the trump spades or Hearts the whole game, simpler and doesn't give the first player an advantage in Round one. 

Other than that it is your standard trick taking game essentially with the difference of the "Declare" and "Reveal" rules (which I think was a off-shoot of the Blind and DoubleBlind in Spades, though it works differently it is kind of doing the same thing, giving you some risk/reward to shoot for). I like these rules but the scoring is set too high for it. 

[u]TIDBIT[/u] - Here is how I have tweaked the scoring for 2 and 3 player games for now. 

3 Player - tricks worth 3 each. Declare = 25, Reveal = 50

2 Player - tricks worth 2 each. Declare = 15. Contracts 10 if all make it, 15 if two make it, 20 if only one. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] - With my 2 player scoring above this is probably my favourite 2 player trick taking game by a BIG margin potentially (Haggis best 2 player climbing game), I'd rate it 8.5 or 9. Played a few games and they all came down to the wire. We made a rule that "Declarations" are declared simultaneously by giving a thumbs up or down on the count of 3 (this or done by left of dealer first, more tension and fun in simultaneous). There is great tension in the game, lots of control and flexibility with a Dummy players control and its fun. I still don't like the bidding with cards, again while your decisions can be tough it also can ruin a hand and force you to do something you don't want to, its just a "little" off, more thought on this. Playing to 120 might be a good option for a longer game (rather than 100), it potentially is not needed but depends on how aggressive/risky players play. Edit - Hmm I see there are different rules for endgame, one says 100, one says play 9 hands. For the 2 player, I think playing 6 might be best. 

An underrated and overlooked game, at least for 2 players (Only played 3 once so far, more play needed but because of the Dummy [oddly enough] I suspect 2 player to be far superior to 3 due to the added depth/strategic element)

Interesting that you take cards out of your hand to bid. Which leads to the situation, "if I take this card out of my hand to bid, my hand won't be strong enough, but if I use a lesser card to bid, my hand will be too strong for the corresponding bid."

Most balanced three player game I've played.  Also one of the best trick taking games I've played.  

Throwing cards to make your bid is a clever mechanism.  I especially love tossing high diamonds if their trump and their all I've got.  Makes a bid of zero and makes winners out of the other player's losers.  

Interesting elements with the declare and reveal bids, where it may be in your interests to throw your bid in order to defeat the declarer.  

All in all, a very good trick taking game, where you have to be very nimble to make your bid while trying to throw as many wrenches at your opponents as possible.

RATING: 9.5
Rated after 2 3-player games (I have no great urge to try it with other numbers of players).

An excellent trick-taking game, nearly the equal of Sticheln, my favourite trick-taking game, and Cribbage, my favourite traditional deck of cards game, but with the added benefit that it uses a (stripped) traditional card deck.

The bidding mechanic is the heart of the game, and brilliantly elegant and agonizing. Also, the big rewards for making your bid maintain tension throughout a hand (unless you blow it very early, which is unusual). Not as deep as Bridge (which I don't play) or, I suspect, Spades (again, I haven't played), but 99 isn't a partnership game, and is very accessible to new players.

There's no reason not to at least give it a try.

UPDATE: this is more than just a very good trick taking game. It is an excellent middleweight gamer's game, close to, but not quite the equal of Ra or Torres.

I'll be playing this for a long time to come.

UPDATE: played with four (at someone else's recommendation), and I was pleasantly surprised. While not a classic, like it is with three, it is still very good, if a bit lighter and more chaotic. Definitely worth playing.

UPDATE: My group has settled into a comfortable groove with this, where we have to think enough to be engaged, but not so much that it gets in the way of relaxing. It is our most played game, and I don't see that changing any time soon. 9.5 with a bullet.

This is an outstanding card game. It plays like whist but for a precise bid with bonuses. The mechanism of remove cards from your hand to designate the bid makes the game. There's a variant where you keep the bid in your hand until there are only three cards left in everyone's hand. That gives everyone the opportunity to change their bid but must resist the urge to play the cards set aside.

The evaluation/bidding trade-offs are delicious.

Suggestions: Cut to reveal the trump suit before the first deal. (No-trump favors the opening player too much.) Don't introduce premium bids to new players until they're comfortable with the rest -- they'll be too conservative to try them anyway. Check Parlett's website for some good tactical considerations.

An excellent 3 player trick taking game. So far I've just played this as a 3 player but I can see it being a great game for 4 or 5 as well.. and there is also a variant for 2 which sounds interesting. Anyway... for 3 players this is a brilliant little game. Definitely very simple to teach and learn but yet with a good amount to think about on each hand. 

Having to name the number of tricks you will take with cards from your hands often leads to some tough decisions which will effect how you play out your hands. Sometimes you just don't quite have the cards you'd like to make the exact bid you think you can achieve but you must make the best with what you have. A very nice balancing mechanism that rewards not being too greedy yet you have to know when to stick out your neck and go for the extra premium points when your hand looks like a lock to hit your exact bid. Even though I've only started playing this game I can see a fair bit of scope for strategic play with experienced players.

Excellent thoughtful gameplay in a quick playing and easy to explain game makes this a definite winner in my opinion.

One of the best trick-taking games ever designed. 

* Versatile: The designer offers variants for 2-5 players

* Surprising amount of control: Like other trick-taking games in which you have to win the exact number of tricks you bid, there are no "bad" hands, simply hands that are harder to evaluate than others.

In Ninety-Nine, each player receives 12 cards but only plays nine of them to tricks. The other three cards are "discarded" before the round. This allows you to eliminate high/low cards or create void suits in your hand to make it easier to achieve your bid.

* Many additional and unexpected levels of strategy: The three cards you discard represent your bid (the number of tricks you want to win). This makes it especially tricky to discard those three cards. In addition, having cards out-of-play makes it more challenging for those card-counters; you can never be sure whether a card will appear during a round.

* Very easy to learn: Unlike other skillful trick-taking games like Skat, Jass, and the modern classic Mu, Ninety-Nine has very rules, a straightforward scoring system, and no unusual "chrome" (like reordering the ranks of cards).

Even though Ninety-Nine is deep yet elegantly simple, it is unfairly overlooked by so many other bland card games in the current Euro-market.

====================

Update: Jan 2011:

Some BGG comments suggest the bonuses are overvalued. Try playing with the option in which a game is 100 points and the overall winner is the first to win three games. This is what we discovered by playing with this variation:

* We found that it's much easier than you expect to achieve your bid despite declaring or revealing. So you don't need a "perfect" hand to declare. So what ends up happening is eldest hand declares quite often since he has the advantage of the lead.

* Suppose the dealer has about 50 points. If he declares and succeeds, he'll most likely win the game. He however does not have an incentive to reveal; he doesn't need that many points, and thus doesn't need to take the risk. Consequently, Eldest hand and middle hand are compelled to declare to prevent dealer from declaring!

I think the large bonuses are essential to making Ninety-Nine exciting. It forces players to take bigger risks. It makes the game move faster as this enables a player to win a game in at most 3 hands. In addition, the big bonuses give a huge incentive for the non-declaring/revealing players to form a temporary alliance, which infuses the game with even more challenges: as a defender of the declarer/revealer, do you try achieve your goal or do you ditch your goal and try to defeat the delcarer/revealer?

As for the many variations David Parlett offers in his Web site:

* When playing with beginners, we use the "original" variant in which you add a joker to the deck, and the extra card determines the trump suit. After, we would use David Parlett's preferred variation ...

* Parlett prefers the no-joker options in which the number of players succeeding determines the trump suit for the next round (no players, diamonds; one player, spades; two players, hearts; and three players, clubs). Once players have figured out how to bid accurately, it reduces the number of times diamonds and clubs are trump. We found that having diamonds as trump isn't as challenging (it's quite easy to dump your diamonds and aim for a small number of tricks) and frustrating when it's clubs (because it's very hard to dump clubs; it commits you to win a lot of tricks). 

* Long Ninety-Nine, in which players are dealt 16 cards instead of 12, is a little bit more forgiving since you have more cards ... but of course it's longer.

* Ninety-Nine for five isn't that interesting

* Counterpoint is the point-trick variation of Ninety-Nine. I actually prefer it over Ninety-Nine, and it makes an excellent two player trick taking game.

A great trick-taking card game for 3 players!  Very enjoyable and highly recommended.

I'm entirely, completely, wholly terrible at this game and have never even come close to winning, much less a three digit score. But I love it, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better trick-taking game for three.

One of the best games playable with a traditional pack of cards, in my opinion. I almost called it a "traditional card game", but stopped myself, because it isn't - it's actually closer to a modern "designer" game in the sense that it actually was invented in the relatively recent past, by a specific designer whose name is still attached to it, and with all the advantages that that entails. It is obviously modelled on specific more "traditional" games, and with a unique "bidding" mechanic added which is where all of the interest comes from. Certainly anyone with an interest in traditional card games who hasn't yet given it a try really ought to, in my opinion.

This is about the best 3-person card game there is, IMO.

The best of the "precision" trick taking games where you attempt to bid exactly how many tricks you'll take.

The main innovation is the use of the suits of discarded cards, to determine how many tricks you bid.  This makes for an imbalance in the suits that makes for interesting strategies in play.

A decent card game for three.  The bidding decision is almost always agonizing, but sometimes there is no right answer.

Like Wizard or up the river but with blind bids making it more random and discarded kitty giving back some control but making deck very clumpy.  I didn't think it was as elegant as Wizard.  Played really well 3.

Hollandiában hallottam a játékról és már akkor megtetszett a szabály alapján. A Rikiki háromszemélyes változata azzal az óriási csavarral, hogy a jósolt ütésszámot adott kártyák lerakásával határozzuk meg. Fix 12 lapból 3 kártyát rakunk le és próbáljuk teljesíteni a megfelelő ütésszámot. Tényleg nagyon jó hármas játék a kártyázni szeretők számára, bátran ajánlom, engem megvett.

This great traditional card game combines old-fashioned trick taking with a brilliant bidding and betting system that creates difficult decisions and rewards risk-taking.  Excellent 3p game.

Fun, challenging game. We play using rules off of pagat.com. I've played 3, 4, and 2-player games (using the dummy hand for the 2-player). We're a family of Euchre players and everyone seems to enjoy the added challenge of bidding and then making exactly the bid number of tricks. Good game!

As a trick-taking fan, I like this one although it's not my favorite.

Really good with 3p. There are better games with 4. 

Plenty of strategy but also enough luck to keep things entertaining. The ability to show your bid for the chance at premium points is a great way to reduce the amount of sleeping cards which is one thing I don't really like. I do worry that the exact bid bonuses are too high but it's too soon to say that the designers got it wrong. Will bring it out again the next time I have 3 who want to play cards and that's pretty much the highest praise I can give a trick-taking game.

RATING: N/A
seems overly elaborate for what it is. For instance what is the pt. of basing trump suit on how many made their bid? its random anyhow, but this method prevents using No Trump as a possibility. Why award bonus pts when everyone makes their bid? Perhaps the bigger question is why didnt Parlett include Spades in his book on the history of card games when this game suggests he knew about it?

A solid reduced-standard-deck 'Oh Hell' variant in which cards are removed from your hand to define your bid.

There are parts of this that I really enjoy, but the premium on bidding exactly is frustrating.  This is definitely not a game of horse shoes or hand grenades, which apparently I might be better at than 99.

This is a great trick taking game, filling a nice niche for 3p card games.  I enjoy the decision to discard for bid vs. the need to keep a hand strong.

Bet on how many tricks you take. Not entirely countable, as cards are set aside for bids. Four player game with full deck was good, probably even better with three and short deck.

We played this a lot in the 1990's. Probably still my favourite card game of all time. I also think the 2 player version works okay with the dummy hand.

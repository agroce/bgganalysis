"The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts" and that's sort of how I view Daybreak and ONUW. Together, they are vastly better than either set by itself. While Daybreak isn't the set I'd reach for if I was just getting one, I see it as sort of essential to playing One Night.

In this game, more roles signify more variety in how you can play the game, and Daybreak comes with a lot of colorful choices. The artwork has the same flair as the original box, and this has 11 roles. You can even play this alone without the first box, but it's a lot more fun to combine them and gives it a lot more legs.

Initial Impression: There's lots of game packed into a small box here. I particularly like how the game has the ability to scale to large groups of people. Playing with the app enhances the experience with clear player instructions and a thematic soundtrack. My one beef with this party game is that I don't believe that players are given enough data to determine who is on which faction so in the end the game becomes more of a guessing game than anything else. It's a great ice-breaker or filler, but not much more.

This one will require more playings, if I can stomach the attempts.  "More variety" sounds like a good thing, but the two roles which add new mechanics (Sentinel, Curator) are not a lot of fun.  Both of them prove their existence or else their being exiled to the center with the presence of their unique tokens.  Evil players will have to jump on the claim if they're looking to hide, but then you're narrowing down the voting pool to one of two claimants.

Don't get me started on the Village Idiot.  That's a role that basically shouldn't exist.  [i]Ever[/i].

The additional wolf powers are interesting, in particular the Alpha Wolf.  Perhaps some of these roles start to make more sense with higher player counts; we rarely have a chance to play with more than six.  Basically, I don't see this set as being a required addition when the original is already so good on its own -- unless you've already played that one to death!

RATING: 7.6
Excellent expansion that consists of many game changing roles.  Very confusing if you throw too many new roles in and you will have to completely reshape your group's meta, but this expansion rocks if integrated in small doses.  The PI and Witch are two of my favorite roles in the game.

RATING: 7.9
By effectively doubling the diversity, I think this is all the "Werewolf" I'll ever need. The base game got a little systematic after a while. Seasoned villagers had a substantial advantage over the werewolves, and could almost always catch them. Perhaps my friends are simply not the accomplished liars this game requires.

Daybreak fixes this issue by providing multiple new avenues for effective deceit.

EDIT: Gets old after a while. I feel a need a few years off.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf has rapidly become one of my all time favorite party games, and has already replaced essentially every social deduction game in my heart.

Unfortunately so far this expansion has been a bit of let-down. Caveat: I HAVE NOT TRIED ALL THE ROLES YET, so we'll see how things play out with more mixing and matching. But I found myself disappointed by the new roles. Without further ado:

Good additions:

-The Witch is probably the best addition. Pretty similar to The Robber so I wouldn't say she's essential, but it can be a good lie for the Werewolves to tell, etc. I imagine we'll trade her out for The Robber about half the time.

-The bodyguard adds some fun chaos to the mix. It becomes exceptionally important to identify them when playing.

-The Mystic Wolf is pretty good.

Bad additions:

-The Village Idiot sounds funny on paper, but in practice it presents a problem: former werewolves have almost no incentive to not out themselves, thus pinpointing exactly where the new werewolves are. Perhaps if you play with enough of the other card-switching roles in this won't always be an issue, but we found instances where possibly-former werewolves had reason to be withholding extremely rare. On the flip side, without the revealer or insomniac it's possible for it to be too confusing (though this is just speculation on my part).

-The P.I., similar to the doppleganger, is confusing when they get switched around and we generally just found to be more of a hassle than anything.

Meh additions:

-The Revealer is fun, but probably only works with higher player counts. With 5-6, this would give away too much information.

-The Apprentice Seer feels like it only exists as a balancing mechanism. Werewolves winning all your games? Give the villagers both Seers. Villagers keep winning? Replace the Seer with their Apprentice. Useful, maybe, but not terribly exciting. Plus our group tends not to get hung up on which team is getting most of the wins tonight.

-The Sentinel and Curator are fine, but don't seem to add much.

All in all - it none of these roles really felt like they interacted with the heart of the game very much, and you still need, in my opinion, a bunch of the base roles for the game to even really work (troublemaker+tanner always feel like musts), so at most you're playing with a couple of these. Definitely a disappointment.

Some of the roles are CLUNKY, but most provide a really satisfying experience.  It can be kinda tricky to manage roles to give you the game experience you want, but experienced players should be able to figure it our relatively quickly.

As a side note, this is about as big as this game needs to get.  The beauty of ONUW is in the accessibility, so upping the complexity of the roles counters the biggest plus to getting people to play this game.  If I want a richer experience, I'll reach for resistance.  If I want to laugh at how it all plays out, I'll choose ONUW.

People who won't play Werewolf will play One Night. When you don't have enough people to play Werewolf, you can still play One Night. When you don't have enough time to play Werewolf, you can still play One Night. When people are too tired to play Werewolf, they can still play One Night. When people are in too sour a mood to play Werewolf, they will still be in the mood for One Night. One Night is superior to Werewolf. One Night is one of the best fillers. One Night is one of the best bluffing and social deduction games. It scales well. It can be set up to have just enough chaos or be nothing but chaos -- and both of those work.

The Daybreak expansion adds a bit too much chaos and randomness in the game for me if you play with the kitchen sink. But it is very good for adding just a couple roles from it to change up the original sets.

RATING: 7
Party game in which every player takes the role of a character, of which most have specific characteristics. Once the day breaks, everyone has to try and find out who are the werewolves, and the werewolves have to try and fend off all accusations and mislead the others. Roles can be switched before the day breaks, though. So in fact, you're not really sure who you are. Chaos and complot theories guaranteed.

Thank you Kickstarter!  My homeschool gaming family loves Daybreak!  We have fun mixing and matching characters now from this and the original game.  Some of the new characters add a lot of fun like the Alpha Wolf, Curator, Revealer, and Witch.  We play using the howling wolves soundtrack on the App.  This is a game the whole family plays, from six years up.  It is a great fast, quick game to play when you don't have time or desire to set up a more complicated game.

A lot of neat roles in this release and I will rate this the same as the original. Since it can be played as a base game, the below comments are relevant. It should be noted that I feel this set it a little more complex than the original.

Original game's comments:

This was my go-to quick social deduction game for 5 - 7 people. Unlike the Resistance I like that it has an app that takes care of the opening spiel as well as the fact that it has completely divergent play to BSG.  The great thing is that there is no player elimination (I'm looking at you Coup), the game only takes about 10 minutes, and comes with a variety of roles to keep things interesting.  

If I had to knock anything about the game, I would say that rustling sounds during the night phase can ruin things. The trading of roles is also annoying for a few reasons: Tiles are included to make picking up the roles easier, but being that they are tiles, if they get marked the game is ruined. You can sleeve the tiles, but then you have to be more wary of changing the orientation of roles when roles are swapped. Finally, trading is annoying because if people pay attention to where their role card is and it's in a different location when they wake up, they know their role has been swapped and have an advantage.

Don't let these minor issues scare you away from at least trying the game to see if it's right for you.

This game is a pretty nice casual game.  Its set up in a way that's very chaotic.  You're assigned a role, which only you know.  Everyone goes to "sleep" at "night", and they take turns carrying out their role.  Many of these roles actually cause other's roles to be change - but they don't get to know this.  Even after you wake up, you can't look at your card again to see if you've got the same role.  Then you all have five minutes to argue and figure out who the werewolves are.  Guess right, and the townspeople win.  Guess wrong, and the werewolves win - that is, those who are werewolves at the END of the game, after any role changing might have taken place.

Because its so chaotic and roles change and you don't know it, this is a game that doesn't feel very competitive.  You're just as happy losing as you are winning.

This expansion is great because it is adding many new characters with cool mechanics like the sleeping werewolf. In the other hand it is making the game even messier with characters like the village idiot. These characters are so powerful that they cut short any constructive discussion and deduction process.

I like it in conjunction with the original game, but not as a stand alone, and I'd play with the original first before bringing this into play. I need to give it a bit more plays before raising or lowering it, so give it a shot

I love One Night Ultimate Werewolf. It has been the most requested game to play in our social circle. 

The expansion adds about a dozen new roles, and most of them are pretty awesome. I recommend this expansion, and advise mixing the roles with the base game.

Better used as an expansion (mix and match the roles) than as a stand-alone game. Like the original One Night, this is great. You can use these roles to, among other things, fine tune the game (for example, Werewolves losing too often? The Mystic Wolf gives them a bit more power).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Maybe great for people who've played a LOT of the original, but at my level of experience (and interest), some roles (like the PI) are a rules disaster waiting to happen. Well, not waiting, it did happen, that's why I'm not going back to this for a while if ever.

I'm a big fan of the original One Night WW, so I was surprised that I didn't care for this one as much. The gameplay is essentially the same, but with different characters. One nice addition is specialty Wolves who have their own powers.

I think there were two reasons this one didn't go over well. First, it was probably a mistake to play with only Daybreak roles instead of just adding a few to the mix of the base game. Secondly, we played with only five players, and I think that is just barely not enough to really make the game shine.

RATING: 4
The game works remarkably better than its predecessor Werewolf. There is room for bluffing and deduction. The time limit (when using the app--which I highly recommend), creates a lot of tension.

There is a flaw in the game, however. And it is almost a fatal flaw. I'm docking the game 3 points because of it. The flaw: you have to swap cards on the table while everyone else has their eyes closed. Even when one's eyes are closed, you can still sense movement from your neighbors. This gives away your opponent's role. And this makes the game ultimately flawed. 

I do not see any way around this flaw either. The card swapping is integral to the game. Detecting movement from around the table is inevitable.

More of the same.. if you're really played the heck out of the base game, you find some new roles to spice up your game.
Some of the roles were pretty clever, some a bit wonky.. 

Has the pitfall of making a brilliant game more complex just for complexity sake.. make sure the return in fun pays of..

I really enjoy this as a quick filler party game - the more people the better. I would like to obtain regular "One Night..." and combine the two for more variety but so far I've enjoyed it as-is and even without the added complexity of roles. I especially like that in "One Night" there is no player elimination - your team either wins or loses and no one is left out. When I play with lots of non-gamers, they tend to have shorter attentions so if someone gets eliminated from a game, they tend to drift away. Not a problem with this fun deduction game.

There's so much randomness in this game, not my cup of tea. Maybe with more plays I'd get a better understanding of what to do etc, but after a few plays in a row there wasn't anything that jumped out at me as fun. Seemed like no one really knows whether they're good or bad so they don't know how to play.

The new roles actually help make the original game a bit more interesting and often more wacky. The unfortunate thing is that their added complexity causes them to be rarely played in the first few rounds for ease of teaching, so only subsequent plays (or experienced players) will allow you to use many of them. Worth the buy if you enjoy the original game.

My friends loved One Night Ultimate Werewolf, a great party game that is easy to teach to new players, I decided to get the Daybreak expansion as well to play up to 10 players and we had a blast at a party with 9 people, the mix of roles injects unexpected twists is every round and makes a stellar party game even better. Some Daybreak roles may seem a bit overpowered at first but after you play for a few rounds with some of the new characters everyone figures out how they can bluff with them in the game.

No game is complete without a few troublemaker claims and the occasional tanner claim. I’ve probably played 100+ rounds of this game and still enjoy it every time. It’s as much about reading people as it is sorting through claims. Occasionally, there are auto-wins/losses just because of the roles that are out, but that’s rare.

In One Night, there is a night phase during which people take their actions and a day phase where people are lynched. If a wolf is lynched, good wins; if not, evil wins. If a tanner is lynched, they are the only ones that win. There are a huge variety of good roles, but some of my favorites include troublemaker (switch two other peoples’ roles), robber (steal someone else’s role and look at it), curator (place a tile on someone else’s card that changes their role), and doppelganger (looks at another role and becomes it, taking the actions that they do). As you can tell, there is a lot of switching roles and moving things around, so you never really know if you are what you started out as, which is half of the fun.

Daybreak adds some semi-mandatory roles that I wouldn't want to play without.

Very glad the Kickstarter snuck some passive roles into the game (although I think most of them are KS-only for now, pending later promo pack release). A bunch more active roles is a great expansion for One Night, but I don't know that I'd like a game played with all active roles.

But hey, maybe I oughta try it before passing final judgment.

(Playable as a standalone game, but rated as an expansion -- standalone, it might drop to a 6 [vs ONUW's 10] on the basis of the complexity)

Good vacation of One Night.  It feels like the original leveled up with the additional roles.  Still trying to figure out the right formula of roles to include.  Gets a little bogged down in the setup depending on what roles your include and sometimes there's so much shifting with rules that it becomes pretty impossible for the villagers team to deduce.  Still recommend if you want to spice up your base copy of One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

I would not recommend this game as a stand alone expansion.  It requires understanding the core concept of the game first which is best introduced with the original One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

As an expansion to the original ONUW, this is a must have expansion.  This fixes the problem with the werewolves being on the weaker end of the spectrum (once your group begins to understand the game) and gives enough replay value to constantly shift the meta.

I understand that, these days, a game publisher's bread and cheese is made by expansions.  Still, this one feels like gilding the lily - too many superfluous roles.  Not a hindrance to the base game, but not much of a help either.

A fantastic expansion. Things get so much crazier with the new cards. Some of the curator tokens are hilarious, and cards like the Village Idiot ruin everything (in a fun way).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played with primarily Daybreak cards, and we mixed in very few cards of the original. This game was enjoyable, but I thought with so many roles, you get a bit too much information, especially with the witch and aura seer, as more players can corroborate each other in this. I also thought the Village idiot was too much randomness, a tad difficult to silently shift ALL cards, and it made the situation very difficult for many players as well.

I think this game isn't so great by itself as I believe we played with the recommended beginning and it wasnt as enjoyable as the original. The night phase was almost, almost agonizingly long.

Recommend this game only in little bits with the original ONUWW, but I do not recommend this by itself. This is great for variety with the original.

(5 plays) After playing many games of this game without the expansion, I got to play a few 9 player games with it.  Given some restraint on putting a lot of confusing roles in one game, it can add just enough to make it more fun for those of us that have played a lot of this game.  However, it can spiral out of control with a lot of players and choice of a lot of crazy roles.  It's a good expansion, but I would be more likely to enjoy the base game with a bunch of people I don't know - it's just less likely to have a poor combination of roles with the base game alone.

One night werewolf is a wonderful game, and any expansion that can breathe more life and new interesting effects into it is wonderful.   

That's exactly what this is.  A few new roles that keep the game fresh, interesting and totally confusing.

Problem is, at times it makes the game too confusing.

Some of the new characters are just so off the wall that I simply can't recommend using them in a game.

Not a bad little game, and certainly a fair bit of thought went into all the different roles. I do wonder if it improves with more plays, as people are more able to bluff, but am equally concerned that it might then be able to be easily deduced by expert players. Still, fun for the occasional time you would like to argue over a bunch of theories about what might have happened while everyone's eyes were closed.

RATING: 7
Not as good as the original, it does add some extra crazy roles but if you're combining both sets it makes it really hard to balance for Werewolves and Town. Also, I wish they had a vanilla werewolf in the set.  One version my friends and I really liked was picking all the most chaotic roles like Artificer and Village Idiot and putting them all in the same game and just watch the confusion.

Also artificer giving themselves a relic and then faking another is pretty funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
this is a decent social interaction/bluffing game. It's quick, a game usually take 10mins. This game was less enjoyable compare to other bluffing games such as coup because the players knows too little factual information, thus forcing the players to enter the negotiation blind. Then, when all is done, the final assigned roles are revealed and realize identities got switched or what not. People then laugh about the social blunder. This kind of bluffing game present to me as more of luck based than tactic based. A good example of tactic bluffing game would be Sheriff of Nottingham, where player knows exactly what's in the smuggled bag and tries to formulate the best way to trick the sheriff. Whether it is to bribe their way out, or tricking the sheriff using the bribe to investigate a bag of legal goods and making the sheriff pay the player money.

Ultimate werewolf is kept in my travel game bag for those nights with unexpected large groups.  It does have the mid game player elimination problem and Daybreak fixes that... but, the tradeoff is too great. I miss the dramatic build up of seeing whether the different groups can pull off a victory over a series of turns.  Add, Daybreak reducing player size to seven people and it is not compelling enough to add to my other player bluff-deduction-vote games.

First off, you need to know I don't even like Werewolf.  In fact, I loathe Werewolf.  2-hour+ games and player elimination makes for a horribly boring situation.  I was vehemently opposed to all variations of Werewolf.  Then I played ONUW and everything changed.  10-minute games, zero player elimination, and best of all, [u]everyone[/u] has a reason to lie.

Now the experience improves with this stand-alone expansion.  If only purchasing one ONUW game, this is the one to get! This game includes roles with unique powers that help to balance out the game. The original ONUW practically requires the use of the Robber and Troublemaker in every game to keep the teams balanced.  Daybreak keeps the chaos necessary to balance the teams but helps ensure that players with the powerful roles aren't the sole keepers of information.

One Night is not only Ultimate Werewolf, but also the ultimate filler game, the ultimate party game, and the ultimate deduction game.

A good addition for people that like ONUW as it adds more variety to the available roles. However, I wouldn't recommend using this with players new to ONUW as the roles are a tad more complex than those in regular ONUW.

Nice expansion, some new characters feel a bit strange at first.

My first session with these new roles fell a bit flat as it seems it will take a little trial and error to find good mixes of roles that make things interesting for everyone (too many peek cards are a bad idea if you like the bluffing aspects of the game).  Still, I find One Night Werewolf inherently fun and enjoyed even the flat sessions we had and I'm looking forward to exploring the new roles a lot more!

Look above! Some of the roles might not be as elegant as the ones in the original, but I am still giving a 10 because of the fun and laughter that occurs anytime this hits the table.

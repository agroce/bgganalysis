Had a lot of fun playing this game. Initially thought play would be more complicated than it was and thought the strategy and choice making would be easier. The game was a blast. Expect play time to go up for those who struggle with AP.

Two player game felt very epic and could have gone either way based on one or two decisions. Love the bidding and bluffing aspects and the great space theme. Will have to see how it plays with more people.

I enjoyed Farlight far more than I expected to.  I wasn't sure how the bidding for worker placement spaces would work.  It was great fun!  I also liked the limitations of adding parts to your ship and the way that resources are generated by some parts.  There is alot to like about Farlight.  It is not often that games exceed my expectations.  It's usually the other way around.

A good little ship-building game.  You build ships and then compete for medals, in a nice little blind bidding system. Can be a little rough if you stumble upon the same strategy as someone else, opening up someone not competing to a victory.

For 2-players, it readily turns into one person getting all the engine dice and monopolizing the mission cards.  It works much better as a 4-player game.  It's more of a filler game than anything else.  So far, this game is just below my threshold for a "7" rating.  Will that change? Time will tell.

Got this in a Math Trade. Kickstarter version

RATING: 7
This is solid bidding/bluffing game with a nice tight design, high player interaction, and a fun theme.  The four currencies of the game are easy to understand and the system works very well.  The game moves much faster than you might expect, so make sure you hit the ground running and plan for the fact the game will only go 4-5 rounds.  This game doesn't quite break into my upper echelon of bidding games, but I'd still happily play it any time.

Really like the artwork
Will be upgrading the blind-bidding tokens to wood
(even though the token board is suitably thick)
Our games have lasted about 5 or 6 rounds
Even plays well w 2.

I didn't enjoy this one as much as King's Forge. Lots of exceptions and edge cases, particularly due to the use of the zero bidding tile—e.g. it can only win with an astronaut token on it, except for missions. Someone in our group suggested that it would've simply been better to leave zero tiles out altogether, which I think would've lost a little bit of the bluffing flavor but significantly streamlined the game.

The theme is excellent, but in the end, the game was just too simplified for my taste.  The components were merely "Ok."  The biding mechanism was interesting, but not as rewarding or surprising at may seem at first glance.  I wanted to love it, but ended up selling it.

After 4 plays, this is definitely one of the better KS games Ive backed. Components are nice, I like the realistic spaceship artwork on the component cards and the Mission cards. I alwys enjoy bidding and this game features it as a core mechanic. I keep ending up with a "0" in hand; I must rremember to use it earlier.

The meat of the game is in the bidding and slimmed down "galaxy trucker" like assembling the ship.   teh space travel is just "for points".

FUN: somewhat like a less chaotic, but also less hilarious Galaxy Trucker.

UNIQUE: the tile-bidding isn’t earth-shattering, but it works quite well.

NEGATIVES: the 5 player game can run quite a bit longer while you have less control on the outcome.

Solid/tense bidding mechanic and intelligent design make this a decent game that's easy to teach and play. Artwork is fine but the theme doesn't add anything for me and isn't really linked to the mechanics (it just as easily could have been farms producing crops, etc.). It does effectively give the feeling of "building" a spaceship though, so it works. Would certainly play again.

Got the kickstarter version. I like games where I can make spaceships, and too many people don't like the dexterous nature of galaxy trucker. This is an excellent bidding and spaceship building game.

RATING: 7.5
Good mix of worker placement with blind auction.  It seemed like a good hybrid of Galaxy Trucker with Lancaster.  I liked the bluffing/figuring out what others are doing.  I liked the ship building aspect.  The rules were decent and the flow went quickly.  Played a six player game.

I wonder how it balances with fewer players.  Game was hard for teacher to explain.  Game flow is dependent on which ship tiles come up.

not for me, didn't help that we played with 5 and I was a bit tired, but bidding tends not to be my thing, and if there's too much random stuff, it's even worse.

I didn't go into this with high expectations but was surprisingly impressed. After playing a four player game (on Tabletopia) I came away wanting to play again. The bidding mechanic is interesting and combined with the puzzle of how you build your ship, and keeping an eye on what other players are going for, there can be some AP but a definite solid experience. I enjoyed the theme and felt it worked very well, although it does have a little bit of a "pasted on" feel. There is serious depth to the game and it's mostly deterministic.
High on strategy, low on chance, not overly complicated but with depth, and a decent gateway experience. Very enjoyable.
After playing at all player counts and numerous times, I raised my rating on this to an 8.5, it's really one of my favorites.

Farlight is another entry attempting to make a splash in the saturated sea of bidding and set collection games. In this game, you bid on spaceship parts that together form a resource engine of sorts, providing you greater opportunities to bid for more valuable point-scoring cards. I appreciate the mind-games that the blind-bidding allows, though this is not an original concept. I will concede that it felt rather pleasant to play, and thus it is much nicer than other auction games in this regard. By matching a hidden bid, you have the means to share in the winnings. 

Still, I prefer my auction games to have more teeth (Ra, Neue Heimat), or if not, more pure and play out much quicker (For Sale, Medici). Farlight will likely be forever underrated, but also very soon forgotten: a solid auction game which fails to set itself apart from its predecessors.

(+) The zero-value bid allows for some interesting plays
(+) The set-collection component adds another interesting layer of management to the game and provides an avenue for assessing the value of pieces.
(+) The game is highly interactive, as a result of the second positive point.

(-) For a game as repetitive as this, it runs a bit too long for my liking.
(-) I find the board and general aesthetics rather unappealing, or at best, bland.
(-) It just feels far too kind to the losers. There are ways to stymie another person's smart bid setup by sharing the winnings. There are ways to catch up on resources but you must "bid" for them, but even then, it is the least desirable and thus most predictable choice.

Kickstarted.  Really good game with blind bidding, tableau building via adding parts to your ship, and resource management, with the purpose of achieving mission to score points.  Easy to teach and simple to play but plenty of strategy and calculations while responding to what your opponents are doing.  I liked it more than I thought.

1 play, 4er

I normally hate blind bidding but it's not so annoying here:
- there's a consolation (albeit very small) if you lose
- it's done in rounds, so you have some information about who's bidding where
- there are enough options that you can usually get _something_, if not everything you want
In fact, the game was actually pretty fun! Of course, it helped that I had some good turns winning a bunch of auctions by coincidentally bidding just the right amount. There's not a lot new here (so it's simple to teach and play), but it's put together in a solid way. I doubt I'd choose this game to play but I'd be willing to if someone else did.

This is a blind-bidding set-collection sort of game, with some bluffing thrown into the mix. Each round, a bunch of components are randomly placed on auction. Players take turns placing face down bidding chips (0-5), possibly along with crew meeples to add to your bid. You can bid on the components, or some action or mission spaces. These get you come ship component, science chits, crew, and/or VP. Bids are placed 1 or 2 tiles at a time, so you can get some idea of who wants what (although they remain face down so you don't know exactly how much!). After everyone has bid, the bids are revealed and resolved (tiebreaker = turn order; losing bids earn 1 crew per tile). Players add the new components to their ship (sort of like Galaxy Truckers, but each tile has only 1 legal orientation). Then, in order, all players who bid on them may try to complete missions (3 random sets of cards drawn during setup, each group sorted by difficulty/VP value, only top most one available until completed and removed), in bid order (first to succeed earns more VP). 

The game ends at the end of the round when one of the major missions is complete, or when the components cannot be refilled. Most VP wins!

I very much enjoyed the hidden auction, especially the ability to bluff, as well as increase a bid using crew members.  We had some issues with the iconography on the ship components, but eventually figured things out. Both of us liked the ship construction following winning bids, as well as the race to get the right requirements to do missions.  However, my son had one round in which his plans were fully stymied because he was blocked from getting the crew members that he needed in order to integrate the auctioned parts that he won.  Having a turn in which you cannot accomplish any part of your plan because of a failure of one part of the plan is disenheartening.

I dont usally like Auction/Bidding games but this is really fun and works so well. You can never lose any resources when bidding so its always about the bluffing to get the best parts you need for your ship before any of the other players gets them.

This game is more of a race so its very important to plan and time all your actions. You can always see what "ingredients" you need to complete a mission so you first need to get the parts you need to win to get your ship ready. And its so satisfying when you flip the bidding tokens and see that your plan was successful and you just know that now its possible to get the missions! 

But what i love most about Farlight is the build step when you create your spaceship, you need to purchase the right parts and plan ahead or else the parts might not fit on the connectors on your ship. And also the artwork and graphic design is amazing! Really enjoyed this game :)

I quite enjoyed the tension and bidding aspects of this one. The board looks good, and you have lots of interesting decisions to mull over as the game evolves.

First play was only two players, but that had more close play than I thought. Second play was with four players, and there was a lot of fun opportunities for blocking, bluffing and getting in each other's way.

The combo of resource management, ship connections and bidding creates a satisfying mix, as you want to make progress but not leave the other player(s) unchecked.

Theme is light, but it works well enough. A couple of rules need clarifying, but nothing too problematic. Some AP, but it's not too bad.

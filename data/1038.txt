RATING: 6
Pure abstract game with nice components. To me, it feels like it would take a LOT of mental effort to learn and apply stategies for consistently winning. You can play a bunch of solitaire puzzles with the tiles, but it feels like the only way to solve them is to shift tiles around until you stumble over the solution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not really sure how solid this is as a multiplayer game, but as a single player puzzle it is okay.  For fans of connection games, this may be worth getting.  For others, it likely will sit on the shelf for an extended time.  A reasonable puzzle solver will have no trouble with the puzzles except for the most advanced.  As a game it feels like a multi-player puzzle and lacks any real sense of game play.  [GTI Code: APSL]

My parents own the copy of this I've played with so it's been quite a while since I played with the physical set.
I have played a few times online though, both against bots and actual people. I think I should see if my parents actually want their version and get it off them if they don't.

They've given it to me now, 'apparently' it was mine all along.

{1P: 6, 2P: 5, 3P: 4, 4P: ???}

[i]Tantrix[/i] sounds like something from the [i][url=http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Kama-Sutra-Unabridged-Translation/dp/0892814926]Kama Sutra[/url][/i].  Such a connection may have made the game more interesting.  I guess the best comparison I could make is to suggest that you think of it as an abstract, hexagonal version of [i][gameid=822][/i].

Each tile will have three lines on it, each one of a different color.  These lines will be straight, will bend 120°, or will be a corner of 60°.  When placing a tile into the puzzle, each of these lines has to match up with the lines from other tiles.  A finished game ends up looking more like a black plate of multi-colored spaghetti.

As a solitaire challenge, [i]Tantrix[/i] is decent.  Each tile has a number on the back.  The "Discovery Challenge" starts with the first three colors, each of which has a yellow number on its back.  Since the "3" is yellow, you must create a single loop of that color.  After completing this easy puzzle, you add the next tile, which has a red "4."  And so on.  As the number of tiles gets higher, the puzzles get more challenging.  It can be very frustrating to have found a candidate loop of the desired color, and then not be able to swap tiles so that all of the other colored lines are contiguous.

As a head-to-head game, [i]Tantrix[/i] is still very abstract.  Here, there are additional rules which must be followed in order to give the game the highest chance for completion.  The same color cannot lead into a hole from three different sides.  This rule makes sense because no single tile would be able to make all three connections.  You cannot create a hole which has four tiles on its borders.  This one is more insidious, as it allows one player to create "forced move" situations for her opponent.  With two players these rules are okay.  With three, they start becoming cumbersome.

[i]Tantrix[/i] is definitely a clever game, but ultimately it doesn't move me.  That result is slightly ironic, because it is very portable.  There are other challenges I have yet to explore, and apparently there's even an [url=http://www.tantrix.com/]online community[/url].  Perhaps these other resources can wriggle a better score for this game in the future.

I am no great fan of abstracts but this one was not bad. Nicely produced in bakelite with some very simple rules. My major concern was the mid-game, where we seemed to have about 5 forced moves for every one made by choice. I think, on the whole, I prefer Carcassone though.

I love this game.  I have two small sets of 10 at work and anytime I need a 5 - 15 minute break I'll play as far as I can get.  Focusing on this clears my head and takes a lot less time and energy than listening to all of the gossip.

Keeping for solo play... need to play this with the kids.

Juego de conectar piezas de colores creando circuitos. Tipo dominó,pero con más dimensiones. Nunca he llegado a jugar de verdad, tan solo lo conozco con jugadas simuladas por una demo que me hizo un encargado de una tienda en amorebieta. Tenía  buena pinta y creo que es buen juego. Lo dificil es encontrar con quien jugarlo. Tengo pocos aficionados a los abstractos en mi circulo.

Rating strictly as a series of puzzles; I haven't played with others.  Just looking at the rules, I think I'd rather stick with Trax or Kaliko.  I keep the Pocket Tantrix edition near the couch so I can monkey with it on a lap desk.  Its pieces are just the right size for that.

RATING: 5
Fairly complicated for its size, Tantrix is a hex-laying game with coloured lines, trying to make longer sections. It's not bad, it's just a little flat given that each turn is 'do everything you're forced to and then play one'. The strategic choices are low, but it always feels like the stronger player will win every single time.

Discovery solo puzzles start out easy and ramp up in difficulty quite steeply (particularly into the 30s and 40s).  As a competitive game, it suffers slightly in the "forced play" rules - unless both players are equally skilled, forced plays may be missed, creating problems.  With that caveat, though, definitely enjoyable.

RATING: 4.25
Physically beautiful game with wonderful tactile quality due to bakelite bits.  An even mix of luck and skill, but lacking interesting strategy decisions.  Many tile placements are required by the rules, and discretionary placements are generally easy to determine -- you don't often have to agonize over alternative courses of action.  Rating of 4.25 is a composite of my rating (4.5) and my wife's rating (4).

It's beautiful and neat — a worthy abstract, and one I think I'll keep. But the placement rules are a little wonky, and I simply can't get it to the table. It's too bad, though, because despite being horrible at it, and though games of it maybe go a little long, they're very satisfying. Played a good few times on the app, which of course manages for you what amounts to a legal play, which is handy.

Pas très fun...

... mais pas mauvais malgré tout.

"Tantrix" est un jeu un peu prise de tête. On a pas trop l'impression de s'amuser en y jouant, on retourne les tuiles pour les faire correspondre, on en sort parfois avec un léger mal de crâne. Mais malgré ces limites, j'arrive à le sortir de temps en temps, même avec des gens qui n'aiment pas jouer. La règle est vraiment simple dans ses bases, un bête jeu de placement, d'optimisation avec un peu de blocage au niveau des interactions. La version la plus simple consiste à uniquement placer les bonnes tuiles, celle au-dessus met en place ce blocage, cette anticipation à plusieurs coups d'avance, etc. Le mécanisme de "coup forcé" donne un peu de sel à la chose, on peut faire de bons enchaînements, parfois stoppés par une mauvaise pioche, mais apporte un peu de finesse à "Tantrix".

Le matériel est solide et de qualité, les couleurs un peu criardes permettent une bonne lecture de la chose. A noter aussi de nombreux modes de jeux, plus ou moins intéressants. Bref, un jeu abstrait pas désagréable, simple mais assez efficace, mais sans réel plaisir ludique et à consommer avec modération.

No strategy path can be sucessfully taken. The game is "automatic", since the luck present on taking tiles or filling gaps is far not a player decision. It is, however, a game with very nice components. I think the problem of the game is his age. We have now so many games much more interesting and competitive, without unbalanced factors.

NEW to my collection. I'd started with the classic 'Crazy Tantrix' version that I had gotten as a gift growing up. It was ok, but didn't light me up. I've revisted it as an adult and find it to be a nice solitare thing to put on my home desk and noodle with as I wait for the progress bars to hit 100%. I bought the full set recently because of that and will start playing it online. It's kind of like 'Metro' or 'Ta Yu', but the board is much more random as you build it in play. Good spatial thinking needed. I'm liking it a bit more now. Still to new to rate it. The 'Crazy Tantrix' version wasn't much ratings wise (maybe a 6--not to difficult, some challange, will play when in the mood), the full version might be higher in the long run.

I'm not really a fan of abstract games and I'm undecided about whether the forced play is a positive thing.  Undoubtedly, the game is deep, but I dislike both puzzle games and tile-laying games in general, so this one never had much of a chance with me.  Still, it has high quality pieces and is attractive.

This is a highly tactical game with very open placement and the ability to chain together forced moves.  Information is also open.  Combined, those characteristics can lead to very slow play among those who analyze the many possibilities open to them and their multi-step consequences.  The game is not fun enough to warrant extended downtime and length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Works well if you play the solitaire version (puzzle), but multiplayer version is more problematic: a lot of downtime, rules includes many restrictions which you need to follow AND it's hard to find the forced moves which you have must do. Multiplayer version needs the "computer" which shows the forced moves and that you follow the rules...

This comment is based purely on the variety of puzzles available with Tantrix as though I have spent many hours trying to solve them I have been unable to find the opportunity to play the game.  The mind-challenging puzzles, the joy at progressing through the levels, the number / variety of the puzzles and the elegance of the tiles make this a very enjoyable experience (a very good way for one person to spend their time if there is nothing on tv).  If you are fortunate your local retailer may sell the tiles for the Tantrix Discovery Puzzle on their own and this would give you an affordable taste of what the larger sets offer.

There's some clever tile placement you can do to force your opponents to extend your line, but this same forced play also really bogs down the game later on due to needing to check whenever you draw each tile if you can play in the unfilled forced spot.

Play with a recent 5 years old. 

First game:
* He needs a little help to find matching tiles when more than 2 sides
* Didn't like the "race" game type as he is not really into competition things. Yet by allowing myself to put tiles only if at least 2 sides were present, we ended up near a tie.
* He likes much more the strategy version of the game, Somehow he even managed to beat me on the line length! The kids did enjoy it and is willing to replay.

We bought this game on holiday and were fighting over whose turn it was to play the 'solitaire' version.  Unfortunately we lost one of the pieces and haven't got round to replacing it [although it looks like the website will replace it if we asked].  It's taken a back seat for now, but what we particularly liked was the option to play at different levels and/or play alone, the attractive playing pieces and the portability - a nice holiday game.

Each tile has three different coloured "ribbons", similar to Take It Easy, except that the ribbons come in all sorts of different combinations of straight, slight curve and tight curve across the hex. There are 4 colours, and each player is trying to create the longest 'ribbon' in their colour. Your score is your highest scoring ribbon, where a ribbon scores 1 point for each hex you've
managed to connect in your colour. If you manage to close a loop (say of 8 hexes), it scores double (eg 16).

You start by playing any tile (there's no board, just plonk it down) and other players build off that. The tricky thing is the forced moves aspect. All empty spaces that touch 3 played tiles must be filled by 1 of the 6 tiles in your hand if you can. After which you have your free play. There are some restrictions, like you can't surround a space with 4 tiles and can't play along a side which is awaiting a 'forced move' filling. After your free play, you check for 'forced move' spaces again which you must fill if you can. And in fact, filling a 'forced move' may create more 'forced move' spaces so you must fill them all if you can. You replenish after every tile played so there's continual checking of whether the new tile can be played or not.

Which makes for a game that has some tricky thinking involved. You need to observe what tiles everyone has and therefore work out the implications of a number of moves, who can fill potential 'forced move' spaces that you create
and will those fillings advance your scoring ribbon or someone elses. And with a heap of tiles out there with different colours and all sorts of patterns, you can sit there and think it all out forever to get the optimum move if you like. But then, to counter all this tricky thinking, comes the luck which can cruelly hose you. After each play, you replenish your hand. If you've created some forced moves that the next player will be able to fill to your advantage (a good tactic), its possible to pull out a tile which alas fits the 'forced move' space which must be played and which could be terrible for you.

The contrast between the thought required to create good plays, and the consequent largish downtime for other players, and the luck generated by the replenishment makes it an unsatisfactory experience all up. Interesting idea, but the balance between skill and luck is out of kilter. This becomes more evident with more players where it's impossible to plan between goes - and 'player luck' as to whose ribbons get extended by default and whose don't is quite high.

Because there are so many forced moves (some can be set up by you, but too many are really forced out of your control) and there's too much luck involved (when drawing tiles) for a game that demands such deep thinking.

 I went through the whole thing in under 30 mins. Enjoyable, but not worth the price. I'm not sure when I'll pull it out again. I have a half-baked idea of using it as a part of another game I might create someday.

RATING: 7
Placing tiles to form as long a line as possible in your color, earning double points if you close it into a loop.  The loop scoring sometimes creates a very interesting tough decision (Is my line big enough to close and probably win with its points?  Is my opponent's line small enough that I should close it and double its score?)  Very pleasing bakelite tiles, and it works well with 2, 3, or 4.  The extensive rulebook with solitaire and puzzles is a nice bonus.

(Got the mini-version as a present, great travel game for your backpack.) In comparison to Kaliko, it's faster because of many forced moves and a simpler overall aim, to pursuit just the line of your color. So it gets played more often...

Great travel game, my gf and I kept this in my car for awhile for use while waiting for food in restaurants and the like.  There's very little long-term strategy, but careful tile placement and observation of your opponent's tiles can let you rack up some impressively-long squiggles in a single turn.

Strips away the sweet simplicity of Trax and creates the constant exhaustive forced play to fill in spaces.  It works well in Trax as it you can see what you are getting into with a couple plays, with this you have to constantly double check all your tiles, rotating, rotating, rotating...

Then you get to play...

I don't have a big love for trax but this bogs the original game down. If you aren't a big fan of appropriation in Fresh Fish then this game will drive you batty.

So much work for little return.

Best left to online play where the computer does the work for you.

The perfect example of taking an interesting idea and trying to crowbar a game into it. It must have been obvious early on that an elegant set of rules would not work. The forced move "fix" is quite tedious.

I can't quite see what makes this an abstract strategy game.  Briefly each players turn consists of making a forced move - chosen move - forced move, picking out a tile to replace the one laid down every time.  The object is to create the biggest line (joined or not) of you nominated colour.  The trouble for me is that it is impossible to formulate a strategy.  I an not adverse to a bit of 'potluck' in a game, but playing this game is little more than an arduous attempt to waste time to me.
What a shame, as they are good quality and tactile playing tiles.

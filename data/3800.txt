Sort of like roborally, but you can really get screwed by the resources that randomly pop out near your opponents and nowhere near you.  kind of nice bits I guess.  Scoring can be brutal, as you can be way ahead but lose because you had the least of somthing you didn't realize.

Punishing game with cruel blocking opportunities and a harsh end-game scoring system where players are eliminated before final scoring occurs if they have the least of certain criteria (similar to Hab and Gut's scoring). I like all of this.

However, with everything on the board being calculable (by adding up point from buildings for each player) some players took a long time to take their turns, as they assessed their relative positions. It was very AP-inducing. The game dragged as a result.

RATING: 5.5
This game has a run-away loser problem - think the opposite of a run-away leader. If you get behind, you're sunk. At least, it felt that way to me. It's also a programming game - akin to Robo Rally - and I find I don't like having to think that way during a game. Especially so because other players can completely ruin your plan - and purely by accident, not strategy. As a result, this game is over burdened with far too much chaos. Not a game I'm anxious to play again.

Interesting game design combined with a poor graphic design. After getting used to the graphics, the game might be quite OK.

RATING: 7
A very interesting design.  It has the movement programming of something like Wings of War (I could say Robo Rally, but it's nowhere near as chaotic as that), the area majority of something like El Grande and the winning rules are a bit like Samurai (you need to be top in two things ideally).  There's even an element of Age of Steam - pick up goods and deliver them to where they are needed (where they come into the game can be random).

There is a lot to think about.  Luck does play a fairly big factor in that you can just be in the right place for when extra orders and goods come out.

The baseline is that I enjoyed this and found the artwork and pieces to be a delight.  Not sure how a 5/6 player expansion would work - I expect it would be too crazy in terms of planning.

It needs to be played quickly.  There are decisions to be made, but the idea, in the rules, of limiting turn programming to one minute is a good one.

Even though I lost badly in the only game of this I played, it's a fun game.  I like the area control mechanic as well as the scoring system.  Even the programming of the moves is palatable in this game.

Solid pick up and deliver game. The action programming is overall done well here, but I guess my biggest issue is still how slow everything can be to resolve. It doesn't seem like such simple actions should take very long, but having to go around the table 6 times or so for everybody to execute each single move they programmed can take awhile. My wife also didn't like getting eliminated so her yaks didn't count! But I thought that the scoring was actually a clever mechanic forcing you to diversify.

RATING: 8
A very interesting game design with mechanics that feel distinctive and fun.   In this game, in each of the 12 rounds, players secretly program six actions, then these programmed actions are carried out.  

The basic goal is to pick up goods on the board and deliver them to selective locations, with issues of timing coming into play.  On the downside, the board graphics, particularly the use of the black crevices, hurt the playability of this game...which reminds me of the problem with the otherwise excellent game Metropolys.  Board graphics can be important.

There's nothing quite like plotting your entire move, and then having it become worthless because the player ahead of you plotted the exact same move. With no way to change your plans once anything unexpected or undesired happens, the game becomes an overlong exercise in guesswork and frustration.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after one play.  Area control game with pretty plastic pieces.  Interesting mechanics and a fairly short game.  Programmed movement and trying to predict what others will do.  What keeps this one from being rated higher in my book is that it's a little on the dry side and while challanging, just didn't provoke a lot of table talk, and wasn't 'fun'.  Sort of the same feeling that Caylus provokes.  Just as a side note, the player screens could be a couple of inches wider.

Plays well with 3, but I think that it would play better with 4 due to more player interaction.

Really not my cup of tea.  Used the variant scoring (which I agree is much better than the original).  Difficult to predict what people would do,  so fairly chaotic during the game,  and then the player elimination was distasteful,  and made such a huge change to the political situation, that the game swung completely.  I didn't really feel there was much control available (at least at the amount of analysis that I am prepared to put into a game).

RATING: 6
A játék alapvetően tetszik, de annak tudatában kell nekiülni, hogy lutri a köbön:) Eketorp-ra (kicsit Shogun-ra) emlékeztet: mindenki egyszerre titkosan megtervezi előre a körét, majd felváltva végrehajtjuk a lépéseinket. Árukat kell megvenni és eladni, és 3 szempont szerint kell minél erősebbnek lennünk. A pontozás nagyon kicsit a Tigrisére (Geniáléra) hasonlít: aki az első szempont szerint a leggyengébb, az azonnal ki is esik (függetlenül attól, hogy a többi téren milyen erős), a jelzői lekerülnek a tábláról, így a többiek közti erőviszonyok még ilyenkor is megváltozhatnak. Ezután a 2. szempont szerinti leggyengébb esik ki, végül a 3. szempont dönt. Kicsit komolytalanná teszi a szememben a játékot, hogy az utolsó körben a legutolsó lépésem előtt (tehát 72 lépéses játékban a 71. lépés után) még szinte biztosnak tűnt, hogy én leszek az utolsó, de ekkor jött a nagy meglepetés, és végül első lettem. Úgy is fogalmazhatunk, hogy ha túl korán bebiztosítod az első 2 szempontot, akkor szinte törvényszerűen nem nyerheted meg, de 2. lehetsz simán, a győzelemhez meg nagyot kell kockáztatni. A játék külseje nem meggyőző, de a mechanizmus nagyon figyelemre méltó. Nagyon izgalmas játék!!
---
Túl vagyok egy ellentétes élményen is. Majdnem tuti 2. helyről lettem végül utolsó:) Nagyon ötletes a pontozás!!

Je plaatst stoepa's (religieuze macht), monniken (politieke macht) en verzamelt ringen (economische macht).  Het is echter een heel eigenaardige puntentelling: Diegene met het minste stoepa's is zowiezo laatste en valt af.  Daarna tellen de monniken.  Ook hier valt de laatste af...
Daardoor weet je niet goed hoe je je acties moet spreiden.

Played the advanced game with 6 and enjoyed it very much. A nice mix of being first to claim each temple, area majority and points building required a balanced strategy.

RATING: 5.5
2002, 3-4p, 60 min. Simult axn, programmed mvmt, area ctrl, pick-up-deliver, set coll.

An average or below average game involving pre-programmed movement (like RoboRally).  It is difficult to avoid setting up other players because you only get one action in a given city per turn.  The game also has racing, timing and luck elements since someone can beat you to a location and "steal" your cube/delivery... meaning that you wasted your actions or (gasp!) maybe an entire turn.  Therefore, following in the footsteps of other players can be great (you pick up more valuable goods cubes than they did) or terrible depending on the circumstances.  The winner is determined by a weird scheme involving area influence, set collection and process of elimination.  

For me, there is too much randomness in terms of which cubes and orders come out and where they come out (d20 roll).  I also found out that it's dangerous to get in an arms race for influence in a region because you cannot relocate influence markers once they have been placed on the board.  Lots of strategy mixed with lots of randomness makes for a mediocre game.

I am a little surprised that this game isn't generally rated higher.  

It's a very interesting mix of programming, luck in where deliveries will appear, and has an interesting elimination mechanic that makes 4+ player games very interesting.      The real strategy comes in trying to survive the elimination rounds, and makes the analysis and decision making in this game quite complex.

Although I have read many mentions about this game being a family game, filled with randomness, I think in the end this is a highly complex and analytical game.   The theme and board are also very nice.    

Still, although I rate this a 9, I don't actually feel like playing it that much.   It is a little long and is a brain burner, which I tend to shy away from since my brain burns enough on a regular basis.    So, this 9 rating is for quality of the game rather than my constant desire to play it.

Lots of fun!  I generally like pick up and deliver games, and this one didn't disappoint.  The three different scoring options make for difficult decisions when deciding what to score in, and the elimination process to determine the winner keeps things very tense.

Cons:
- too much randomness for my taste
- executing pre-programmed moves isn't that exciting and missing that elusive fun factor
- low player interaction
- endgame predictability - especially the last position could become well in advance crystal-clear
- the screens could have been better

Pros:
- original theme
- interesting Knizia-esque scoring mechanism 

Well, a clever design, but I don't think this will prove popular with either the family and gamer friends. I find there would have been better choices for the one slightly weightier recommendation by the SdJ jury. Can't see Himalaya winning the SdJ.

Too many moves that are locked into place on any given turn. If there had been 3 or 4 moves locked in then maybe it would work but 6 is too many - thus not allowing a person to reasonably react to someone else's moves before over-committing to any particular course of action. This results in very low flexibility and very low enjoyment (it also makes turn order more important than it probably should be). Even though I won the only game of this I played, I do not plan on ever playing this again.

"Allergic to Chaos" Variant

Himalaya is a cutely themed pick up and deliver game with programmed actions ala Robo Rally. Before each turn you choose what your wandering yak is going to do for its 6 actions secretly, reveal simultaneously, and then let 'em loose. The basic mechanic of the game is picking up cubes, with later people getting better stuff, and then cashing those cubes in to fill orders which can be used to gain influence in 3 different categories, the rub being that you can't be worst in the first or worst in the second, or you can't win.

In the version we played, the areas where future goods or orders will appear is known. Though I am not a huge fan of this game as is I must say that with the "normal" rules, where a D20 is used to dictate stuff placement, I would really, really dislike this game actively, and rate it way down near Dragon Delta. I dislike it enough with the current rules without adding another layer of uncertainty to the mix.

My most major gripe with this is how long it is. I think the game length as it stands is necessary for the game to develop properly, but it felt like I was doing the same thing every round, and I felt the game wore out its welcome about half-way through.

I was surprised by how much I liked this. I've always liked the idea of RoboRally more than actually playing it, mainly due to the tedium of executing the programs, and making sure that we don't screw anything up. Himalaya also has programming (8 stages I think), but with dirt simple options for each stage. Either move down one of three paths, indicated by color (all spaces have three routes of three different colors leading out of them), either pickup or spend goods there, or do nothing. Programming is much quicker, and for my tastes, just more fun. You can still screw up your program, either by oversight, or by someone else beating you to do something somewhere where you wanted do it, but when your plans go awry, rather than being dead, you're just a little screwed up. The scoring system is a bit wacky. First you eliminate last place with one system, then eliminate next to last with another system, then from the remaining players judge 1st by yet another system. Some people have accused it of a susceptibility of king-maker problems, and I guess I can see some logic in the arguments, but it doesn't bother me.

2006-08: a purchase made on my trip to Montreal.  Am finding that I really enjoy area majority games, so this one has got to hit the table some time soon!

2007-07: 2-2/3 plays later and we have a winner on our hands!  I like the move programming - trying to guess the other peoples' moves - and the variety of things you have to keep your eye in order to even get a chance to win the game.  It feels like a Knizia game how you essentially cannot neglect any of the three areas of influence.  Lots of yak goodness to be had!

Wow! Extremely interesting and enjoyable game. Great combination of different gameplay mechanisms: area control, simultaneous programmed movement, pick up and deliver, set collection.

Robo-rally like programming game in which mistakes or luck don't have too much impact. It's on the light side and the scoring mechanism makes sure it's tense for everyone until the end. The bits are colourful and cute but the screens to hide your stuff behind are crap.

Fun little game with the "pre-programmed moves" mechanic, but can be very frustrating when you are constantly guessing wrong which of two options to try to go for.  There isn't so much a runaway leader problem, except that when you do "guess wrong" you often end up in a horrible position for trying something else.

RATING: 7
Interesting mishmash of several tried-and-true mechanics (Roborally programmed movement, elimination scoring as Samurai, area majority).
Everything works together smoothly. Maybe a little bit too random in the replenishment phase.

On 1st play, we played a variant where the rings only could go on a house of matching size.  ie..rings with 3 colors could only go on large houses...rings with 2 colors, medium..etc.  I'm not sure whether that made a difference, but it seemed that the rings kept landing on the same house (since most rings are medium).  I'd like to play again with base rules to see if my rating will go up.  I don't see it rising above 7 though as the theme is thin...and the chaos high.

Finally got to play with base rules and game is much improved.  Upgrading from 6-->7.

RATING: 6
Players roam around Tibet, trading with towns and gaining influence from completing deliveries.  Players all pre-plan their turn in Robo-Rally fashion, plotting their six actions in advance.  Actions are either move, or "interact" (basically pick up cubes or deliver cubes at a town).  Delivering cubes allows you to place influence on the board in three spheres (political, religious and yaks!).  At the end of twelve turns, players get eliminated from the win if they are lacking in certain spheres of influence.  Fun game to play, almost a Big Mac with the lot in terms of mechanics.  You need to be a pretty astute player to see how it's going to play out once players get eliminated and pieces are removed.  I enjoyed the mechanics, but it's awfully frustrating as several crucial decisions come down to guessing which way another player will go.  Also, the way new cubes and delivery disks drop onto the board means players can get very lucky.  I suspect five players is not ideal for this, as planning becomes too chaotic.  Amazingly cute player pieces.  Intriguing.

RATING: 5
A classic case of some great stuff  bolted onto some bad stuff. One the one hand it is attractive, interesting, and not too difficult to play. It is the best game I've played that uses the 'program your turn and watch chaos ensue' mechanism. The problem is the poorly thought-out victory conditions ported over from Knizia' Samurai. Firstly, what do you do when you're down in stuppas and the dice dictate that new demand chits are placed on towns that already have stuppas? Or what do you if in down in advisors and the top two players both start making as many ties in advisors as possible? The giant hoseage factors in the poorly thought-out victory conditions make for some big ugly flaws in this gem.

RATING: 7
'Program' movement for 6 moves and act simultaneously. Gather resources and complete tasks with em to get temples, followers and yaks.

Scoring is best part, first one with least temples drops out then with least followers and finally one with most yaks win. So you need loads of yaks and not to be last on other two. Clever, though resource and task placement is quite random and luck factor is higher than Id prefer (but not too big)

I have a varying degree of fondness with this game. Although I love a lot of things about its gameplay, I actually become a bit bored during the last turns.

RATING: 7
When I first saw the board I couldn’t imagine why some people had said it was hard to see or read.  Later I realized that what I found slightly troublesome was not the board itself, which I found graphically pleasing, but the pieces.  Specifically, the stupa tokens (religious influence) and the delegate tokens (political influence) look a little bit too similar.  It’s easy to distinguish them individually, but harder to survey the board and see the religious or political standings at a glance without accidentally looking at the other kind of token too.  But this is a pretty mild annoyance.

Many of the comments on this game fell into the categories of "It’s like Roborally, so I love it!" or "It's like Roborally, so I hate it!"  I love Roborally, so I was looking forward to programming my yak.  And I did enjoy that part of the game--next time I just want to equip my yak with a laser to deal with other herders who show up in the wrong village and take my goods.  Hmm, maybe that could be an expansion...

I actually thought the programming in Himalaya was more like Space Alert than Roborally, in that you were reliant on resources on the board.  In Himalaya, you can program your yak to go to a town and pick up a cube, but then maybe when you play it out someone is ahead of you and you don’t get the cube you desired--much like Space Alert, where you can plan to go to a certain part of the ship and fire a weapon, but when you get there, maybe no one has refueled and that weapon has no ammunition, so you can’t fire.  I guess I see Himalaya as the middle of a continuum on this.  In Space Alert, you interact with resources on the board, which are affected by the actions of other players.  In Himalaya, you interact with resources on the board, but they’re more static--or rather, it’s one-sided; other players may deplete the resources you need, but they don’t add anything.  Everyone can see at the start of a programming turn what resources are out this turn and where they are, so then it just depends on who goes where first and grabs what.  Then in Roborally, on the other hand, you interact with fixed board elements wherever you go, but there are no resources that are replenished or depleted.  Hence the differences between Space Alert (a cooperative game), Himalaya (a thwarting game), and Roborally (a smiting game).  In Himalaya, you outmaneuver rival yaks by grabbing the stuff they wanted before they can get to it.  While this can be quite effective, it’s ultimately a bit indirect; Twonky would’ve just howitzered the rival yak into the nearest crevasse.  

This game is a bit like Samurai with its potential for multiple layers of tiebreaks, which is a bit annoying, but I enjoyed Himalaya anyway.  The scoring is actually Samurai-meets-Cleopatra; you eliminate the person with the least religious influence, then eliminate the person with the least political influence, then whoever has the most yaks wins.  In our game this was a tie, so we did have to go to the tiebreak, which was most political influence.  Another thing I noticed in reading up on this game was that something about it seemed to provoke everyone to constantly compare it to other games.  I’m not sure why, but I’m now doing it too; I just can’t help myself.  Yet I definitely didn’t feel that Himalaya had no personality or was just a mishmash of stuff from other games.  

I thought the programming tokens were pretty clever.  I agree, though, with those who wished there could be two player shields, or something, because once yours is full of goods, it’s a (very minor) pain moving it around to reveal or hide your programming.  What some of us did was to put our programming tokens in a stack and deal them off one by one, instead of exposing them all in a row.  That could also make things a bit more suspenseful.  

Overall, I liked the bits, production, and graphic design of this game.  The only thing I didn’t like was the flip side of the yak tokens, on which the yaks look like millipedes.  However, you pretty much never have to look at that side.  I also noticed that when you put your tea on the sack of tea behind the shield, it pretty much disappears (the jade is also a problem, but less so).  Or maybe that’s only an issue when playing in a dimly lit coffeehouse.  

Some strategic lessons I’ve learned: Initially I thought 3 delegates would probably be enough to lock down a region, because it makes more sense for others to go after less-contested regions than to spend mad numbers of their delegates battling for this one.  What I didn’t take into account, though, is that because of where the rings (opportunities to deliver goods and get delegates) randomly come out, you may not be able to put delegates in the regions you’d choose if you had a choice, and may find yourself in a situation where you might as well pile more delegates into an epic battle, because there’s nothing else you can do.  Also, it seems like a pretty  good idea to get stupas out early if you can, because later all the good stupa spots may be taken and the rings may keep falling on places that already have stupas, so you don’t get a chance to place new ones.  

The mechanism where you always have to take the least valuable cube in town is really quite clever, and is one of the things I like about the game.  It ensures that the fewer cubes left, the more valuable they are, so that makes people still want to bother going after them.  This prevents locations from "locking up" because they have a resource that no one ever goes to get.  Of course, this rule definitely creates a strong "clearly, I cannot choose the one in front of me" aspect in your interaction with other players.  Will the rival yak grab the tea, so I can then take the gold?  Or is he going to delay, hoping I’ll take the tea, so I should outwait him, force him to take the tea, and then get the gold?  Or is he anticipating that I’ll try to outwait him, so he’s going to... 

I’m looking forward to my next visit to the Himalayas!

A worthy contender for the 2005 Spiel prize. Nice mix of robo-rally "programming" element without the chaos--but also some randomness--combined with a clever scoring system makes for a very nice game.

RATING: 7.5
A really fun game that moves quickly and works well with high player counts (if you spring for the absurdly expensive expansion).  The brisk play and random elements work well together here.  There's really not much opportunity to play tactically because of the random placements of goods/orders, but the strategy is surprisingly satisfying because of the interesting winning conditions.

To me, this is an ideal gateway game, if you assume 'gateway' to mean a bridge to bring people into a deeper appreciation of the hobby.  Ticket to Ride is assuredly a better game for non-gamers, but it doesn't prep people for the dense choicemaking of bigger Eurogames.  Himalaya does that, and does it an appealing, attractive package with a quick play time.

Rating is for a 4-player game of Himalaya, the final scoring changes with 3 players so it might be better in that configuration. I always like the action programming mechanics, and it works OK in this game. Unfortunately, it's quite long given the fact that the weird scoring system makes sure that everything happens on the last move. Add that to the fact that there is a lot of randomness just before this last turn, and that your position depends a lot on the choices of your opponent, and you obtain an annoying result.

Himalaya seems to be a very modern game, seeing as it combines lots of different mechanisms and tries to form a coherent whole out of them. There's programming, pickup-and-delivery, area majorities, a good deal of bluffing and double-guessing, and a scoring system reminiscent of Knizia's best days.

Unlike with many modern games, the gameplay behind this hodgepodge of ingredients remains rather simple and straightforward. And despite a lot of chaos thanks to the simultaneous programming of moves and a good dose of luck due to the way goods and orders are coming out it rarely feels like it's totally out of your hands. The players' job here is clearly making order out of chaos.

Simultaneous action selection/pick up and deliver/area control game set in the world's most famed mountains.  This game is an amalgamation of many mechanisms that somehow marry into a cohesive game.  Complaints usually are based on the dice roll, but the expansion fixes this issue by adding card draws, so players can be more aware of the probability of where new goods will appear.  The simultaneous action selection allows for an interesting group think at the beginning of each round.  Himalaya may not be the heaviest, or most involved of games but for me it offers a wonderful balance of strategy and a little chaos.

Wow, this game can surely give you a few things to think about, but it sure is a LOT of fun. The game is really good on it's own, but when played with the varient rules, from it's expansion. Things are a little more balanced. I really like the Robo Rally like mechanic. Where players have to play their 6 actions in advance. Then taking turns to do the first action, then the second and so on. There's lots of different ways to score points, but there is an importance of priority, so as to be sure, that you are not eliminated, at the end of the game, when it comes time to tally the scores. A very well thought out and excellent game, that I think looks really nice too.

This is definitely a gamers game, that I can't recommend enough. Do note though, that you need at least 3 players to play the game, so this might not be a game for you, if you mainly play 2 player games.

Is it possible that Tilsit has finally published a good game?  Unless I'm hallucinating, yes it's possible, because Himalaya is loads of fun.  I would describe it as a more dynamic and more chaotic Samarkand with programmed movement and a multi-tiered elimination scoring system.  The simultaneous programmed movement forces you to predict your opponents' actions, and you must rely on memory and psychology to outwit them.  The three-tiered scoring system creates nervousness, making you feel like you always need to bolster one area or another.  All of this combines into a sort of magic elixir - a game that is tense and thought-provoking but exudes a light, social atmosphere.  Players who are bothered by a moderately high level of luck or unpredictability in their games should skip this one.  It's possible to luck into some golden scoring opportunities due to the way that new resources appear at random locations.  If you happen to be in the neighborhood, good things are bound to happen.  So this is not the sort of game in which the one who played best will always win.  But so what?  Not every game I plays needs to be some kind of grave brainwave battle.

I once played the original downloadable version, and I may say that the published version is better with an original new theme. It's an interesting game, but slightly too random in the draws of resources and contracts, which might appeal better to family-gamers. The scoring is a bit tricky to understand, but really unique, almost like Reiner Knizias scoring ideas. Confusing, but it worked well, although it probably requires a second game to be fully understood. I've made a playeraid to keep track of the current influence situaton of the game, which helped a lot, although the economic influence maybe should continue to be secret.

Only one play (with four), but I think I pretty much "got it." It's a fun game, and the "weeding out" victory conditions are neat (though they might seem less so if you're lagging behind), but there's a fair amount of dumb luck involved too. The luck factor didn't bother me too much because I was enjoying myself (and I was very lucky), but nevertheless it keeps me from saying "wow, what a knockout game." Also, it seems like Himalaya is really only going to be at its best with four; that's not a big deal to me, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be thinking about picking it up.

In this game you collect clerical and political influence as well as much as many yaks you can get. Imagine now a player that has most yaks, most political influence and is tie on clerical influence with another player. Tiebreaker is the amount of Stupas both built.
The player inferior in the clerical scoring now is last, doesn't matter how well he has done in the other categories. Strange, isn't it?
So the game itself is good but the scoring needs some house rules, otherwise you need a great amount of frustrating resistance.

First impressions:
This is an interesting combination of "pick up and delivery", area control and simultaneous action/ programming.

The randomness of all the basic elements appears to make any strategy hard to execute, and this could be a problem for players that have a similar taste as I do.

RATING: 6
A pretty neat game of delivering goods that has a bit of a Roborally feel to the programming of a turn. It is interesting in the scoring stage, since as each element is scored, the lowest player is eliminated from inclusion in the next element, which can be brutal. It's an interesting way to enforce balanced development. Additionally, the luck of the draw can play a big factor in a player's ability to compete and deliver goods. Overall, I found it just okay.

The Monday night group liked this game, but I was less impressed.  The scoreing means that if you lose out on placeing your religious markers early in the game you are out of the running and just making the motions.

Doesn't actually feel as random as it is and your best laid plans can be foiled.  It's fun to try and get inside the other players heads.  We play with a timer which speeds the game up and makes it an exciting experience.  Best played with 4.

I really enjoy 'programming' games.  The 'oh I really messed up moments can be very fun.  What makes this a bit interesting is that it's not just programming, it trading and area majority.  Plus, the mess ups, while give that 'oh my' feeling, don't give you the feeling of doom.

I'm a big fan. This is the best implementation of programmed movement I've ever seen, and I love the balance needed among the three ways to score. Only downside is that it's downright unplayable with less than 4 players. It's even better with 5-6 but sadly that requires a very hard-to-find expansion. Still, 4 player Himalaya is a mighty fine game.

[Initial Impression: 8]
Players move around the colorful and appealing board, making deals in villages to earn influence in 3 different realms.  Each player must plan out their route using 6 actions, then everyone simultaneously reveals (and must adhere to) their choices.  The game requires very careful planning (screw up one action and it can throw off your whole plan) and anticipation of what others are likely to do.  The scoring system is somewhat reminiscent of Samurai, meaning that it seems convoluted at first, but becomes more sensible and quite thematic with experience.  Basically, you can't neglect any type of influence to have a chance at winning.  Play with the advanced rules for a more flexible game with additional scoring opportunities and special abilities that can block opponents' routes.

RATING: 7.5
Himalaya was an earlier fine game from Régis Bonnessée, but a very different game overall.

1xd20 drives random goods placements, and order demand placements- so the game is random in that sense. Players pre-program their moves like Roborally, collect goods for delivery, reminiscent of Age of Steam, and they place tribal political influence in areas, like El Grande.

But these elements flow together to make a rather distinctive little game which seems to stay close and suspenseful.

I am starting Himalaya at a strong 7.25- got a couple of rules slightly wrong first game; I suspect the correct rules will only make the game tighter and more interesting.

Raised to a 7.5 after a 2nd play, including corrected rules and event tokens- this is a sharp tactical programming game, with elimination based on balanced advancement, goods delivery, and all sorts of scrumptious ideas that blend well together.

The one limitation is that lucky placement of goods/orders can make the game uneven outside of skill, so people who don't mind luck will find this one better than AoS/Steam fanatics.

Got to give this game a chance, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd like it, and I did.  I enjoy the chaos of planning your moves, but I enjoy the lack of downtime even more.  The moans and groans of when players compete for deals just makes the game.

I do think the game could use a few balancing tweaks.  The expansion mentions making the political and religious power for a given location complimentary instead of identical.  Also, I don't like the first elimination requirement being open information.  These issues are both easily addressed with variants of course.

Apr 08: I've got a few plays under my belt, but the shine is still there.  I've played with 4-6 players, and the chaos is just gravy.

RATING: 6.5
Ideal Players: 3-4

Description: Choose your route, collect goods, and take them to villages to complete missions.

Pro: Players must plan six moves ahead, then reveal their plans simultaneously. Points scored for the most of a good, forcing player interaction. The players with the least political and religious influence are not eligible to win. Roadblocks give players interesting ways to interfere with each other.

Con: Random placement of missions and spices can create an unbalanced board. It's easy for players to plan the same orders, and for one person to essentially waste six actions.

Really neat game, very pretty board and components, easy-to-grasp solid pick-up-and-deliver play. And yaks! I especially like the scoring, in which, at the end of the game, two players are eliminated from contention for scoring lowest in two categories. I wish more games would use that mechanic. My only complaints are that our 6-player game ran pretty long, and I've never been crazy about Robo Rally-style programmed movement. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Given the relatively simple rules, Himalaya is a suprisingly involved game. Players must engage in both short and medium-term planning. The theme is attractive and well-suited to the mechanics. My only doubt about Himalaya is that the chance factor in the placement of goods and orders may be too infuential for a game of this weight and length.

The most redeeming thing about this game is the really cool theme.  However, it goes on for at least 3 rounds too many.  Additionally, everything covered here was already interesting covered in Elfenland with less time.  While the little plastic Yaks are nearly worth the price of admission, I don't see any staying power to Himalya.

RATING: 6.5
I should like Himalaya more than I do after two plays. Perhaps my objection is that programming games are essentially blind bidding games, and I loathe blind bidding. It does seem to strongly reward the strategy of "be where everybody else isn't", which doesn't usually grab me. Still, I play it rarely enough that I probably won't turn down a game next time it's offered to me.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2013)

I was surprised by this game. The scoring system is very well designed and fun to play, I thought this was a Knizia game just from the scoring. I´m not particularly keen of the preprogramed movement mechanic (I hate Roborally and Wings of War), but Himalaya pulls it off nicely as I feel that I´m control and the chaos is minimized. You have to (try to) predict your opponents actions and that’s a lot of fun. Perhaps I’m worried about the moderate to high luck level in the game vs. game length. Sometimes you can get new scoring possibilities near you that no other player can take. I have to play more times to really see if this will be an issue for me.

Game components and art are adequate.

The theme is very boring (for me), but I appreciate the game. This is way better than Roborally.

For now, I would like to play again. Perhaps I will buy it but this is not a game I would like to play too often.

OK, I totally love this one at the moment. What a great every gamer game!

It's got bluff, psychology, reads, player interaction, simultaneous orders, programmed instructions, a 1 minute time limit per turn, and with the 5-6 player extension a chaos free version...very impressed. 

My buddy Burl told me about it...I wasn't sure, but I trusted his advice. Very good game!

Honestly, this works for almost everyone. Is it super deep? Nope. Is it fun, interactive, strategic, tactile, and allow for comebacks? Yep. 

I came back from a very brutal screw up for the first round.

It's a first blush rating, but I'm smitten at the moment. 

Thank God I got it when I did (and double luck on the expansion!). This would have been my family game of the year.

The winning conditions with 3 players boil down to "don't let anyone take both politics and religion, then have the most yaks."  Perhaps a house rule would help.

I have played with three and four players and I enjoyed the game more with four players. The winner is determined differently based on the number of players and I liked the way the four player game felt. I do like the pick up and deliver games and the programming mechanic of this game (similar to RoboRally) really forces you to think  about how other players can affect your turn. Turns move quickly though I do see that they can slow down if you have people that like to over analyse. The rules do state that you should have a 1 minute timer available and I would pull one out if there was a slow player at the table.

This is a well-designed game, and I really enjoyed it.  The game was easy to pick up, particularly as I had already played Robo Rally and so was used to the preset turns option.  There isn't too much interaction between the various players, aside from the pickup/ drop-off of materials; those locations are separated enough so that there's a bit of a trick to getting them in the right place and at the right time, but not too much to be trying to stop everyone the whole game.  I also like the game end, i.e. the serial elimination of a weak player, a la Ingenious

Himalaya is a French game and it shows. Player-induced chaos is all around. Also, if you don't like Robo Rally and the turmoil caused to your plans by other players' actions, stay away. 
While Himalaya at its core recycles the programming mechanism from Robo Rally, it does so in a great way and adds unique ideas making it stand out from the masses of boardgames even 10 years after its creation. It adds pickup-and-deliver, area majority and three kinds of victory points. Most notable: each kind of victory points is evaluated at game end one by one and the player with the least religious/political/economical VP's is eliminated before it comes to the next type of VP's. 
Contrary to contemporary mechanical monsters it manages to mix all these mechanisms while maintaining simplicity of gameplay and rules. My only small gripe is with the editing of Tilsit. It is not explicitly addressed within the rules if you are allowed to only partially score on delivery. The inverse scoring rule change that was proposed in the expansion seems to be considered as the much better scoring solution to avoid players being out of contention after three or four moves. The components, especially the dysfunctional player screens and the warped board, could be improved. Too bad, that the 5-6 player expansion can only be bought for a small fortune nowadays.

RATING: 7
The scoring in this game is what makes it interesting. Trying to balance religious, political, and economic influence all at the same time makes for an engaging game. I think that there is a lot of luck in being near the goods and contracts as they come out, and a mediocre amount of skill in determining how to choose your influence points. Ultimately, who doesn't enjoy moving a caravan of yaks around the Himalayas? Who wouldn't want to own the most yaks? Chicks dig guys with a lot of yaks. Good game, solid theme. 

Yakety-yak, don't talk back!

Plays fairly quickly and keeps you involved the entire time.  I can see how the randomness would bother some people, but to me it's all part of the fun - you just have to deal with it the best you can.  The programming is fun - I also like Maharaja - the waiting option allows for some fun double think and clever play.  The other mechanisms are fairly standard area majority fare, but the theme is original and fun.

RATING: 9
The best word I can use to describe this game is 'weird'. There's some preprogrammed actions, some area-control, move and deliver and the most intriguing scoring system I've ever seen in a game. I think I like it. 

The tension in the game slowly builds since its almost impossible to see who the winner is until the end (and even then it might surprise you). The frustration of failing to perform an action is alleviated by the bonus scoring rounds (which balances the game nicely). All in all, a solid, fun game which I'll probably be playing pretty often.

I always like pick up and deliver games.  I also like the simultaneous pre-programmed moves mechanic as implemented in this game.  It gives enough second guessing without making it totally random.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about the double elimination before the final scoring.  It is quite clever, but it makes the game quite chaotic in the envoys scoring when the player with the least stupas is eliminated.

I didn't know this until after I bought the game from Germany:  there are two multi-lingual editions.  The one I bought from Germany was French/German/Italian.  The one I wanted was French/English/Dutch.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I flubbed the elimination rules - I didn't realize that it was the number of pedestals your stupas are sitting on that matters, and not the number of stupas. So naturally I was eliminated. I have no objection to that, but it's a bit incongruous that a game that's filled with friendly screwage suddenly just kicks you out of school if you happen not to have done your homework one night. 

That said, it's a lot of fun when it's actually going on. The board is eyecatching, and it's almost exhilarating when you manage to get to a coveted jade or gold cube JUST before an opponent. (BIG OLD HINT for the n00bs, one I didn't pick up on for a while: you might want to make sure you end your turn on a space with multiple cubes as often as you can.)

I'd give it an 8, but I just can't abide the elimination. Couldn't they make this a veep game, and just say you lose five if you have the fewest stupas or delegates? Would that be too much to ask? Otherwise, it's really hard to know what to play for when you're in turn 10 of 12 with no chance of getting enough stupas or delegates to recover.

The pre-turn programming of Roborally meets the area influence of China & Samurai's bastard child.It's chaos and you can be greatly hindered or helped depending on the random replenishment of goods ands needs.  It was this latter bit that killed the game for me and the pre-turn programming just isn't as funny as it is in Roborally because even with 4 players, there's plenty of room on the map.  I'd rather just play the pure Roborally or Samurai.  There would be strategy if placement was initial like Samurai or atleast somewhat predictable/influencable like Maharaja:PBI.

I could write it off as a fun light game if it took only a half hour to play...but alas.

Himalaya - Tilsit version - 4 players (not the web-based one, it looks like there are some improvements to the rules and game setup). Anyway, the more I play it, the more I like it. The game has a nice blend of tactics, planning and luck. Make sure you are not the weakest in religion (otherwise you're out), not the weakest in politics (or again, you're out) and the strongest in economics (to win the game). Only one minor point: in the last turn of 12, it is very likely that everybody knows who will be the one without possibility to win due to a weak religious power.

[2008.Feb.19] The core concept of 'programming' your moves before you execute them is an interesting one (also seen in [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18]RoboRally[/url][/i]). In practice with multiple players, however, the resulting movement seems to introduce too much chaos during the crucial resource collection portion of each player's turn. Additionally, when new resources are put into play, their random selection means that some players may benefit simply by 'being in the right place, at the right time', while others do not. Unlike previously mentioned game (which is meant to be a light, beer-n-pretzels game), [i]Himalaya[/i], which was not designed to be a beer-n-pretzels game, was unfortunately a rather uninspired gaming experience.

It's familiar to RoboRally b/c it's main feature is programmed-movement, but IMO much better since it doesn't overlast it's welcome and is a lotta fun to play.  Himalaya has area influence and a somewhat similar scoring format to Reiner Knizia's "Samurai" - don't be last in scoring the influence for any of the 3 major categories (religious, political and economic influence).  First elimination is determined by whoever's lowest in stupa values (religious influence).  Then, political influence is determined.  From the remaining two players, the most in economic influence wins.  I always enjoy bringing this to the table and have introduced it to many who like it.

Fascinating game involving quite a few different game mechanics in one package.  From RoboRally-esque preprogram movement, pick up and deliver goods, area majority, etc.  The randomness in goods may turn some people off, but the game is an intriguing blend of mechanics with even some bluffing that comes into play in picking up goods and trying to figure out where people are headed as goods are picked up in a certain order.

A programming and pick-up and deliver mechanic in this game.  Gather resources and deliver to other locations which advance you on three different tracks.  The interesting mechanic is how end of game scoring works.  The tracks are randomized and the worst performer on any track is eliminated for the first scoring.  Only the remaining three score for the second track and another is eliminated.  The final track is between the remain two.  

This game only works with 4 players.  

It is reimplemented by Lords of Xidit and is much improved, with some new and clever mechanics.

Es un juego que se juega muy bien de 4 jugadores. Es interesante la forma de ganar... Es necesario conseguir un equilibrio constante, entre las delegaciones, que son el poder polÃ­Â­tico, las stepas que son el poder religioso, y los yaks, que son el poder econÃ³mico. 
La dimensiÃ³n que adquiere el juego con la expansiÃ³n de 5-6 jugadores es bÃ¡rbara. Le da mÃ¡s tensiÃ³n y dramatismo. Aunque no lo he jugado sino a penas un par de vez, cada vez que lo juego sube de nivel.

Simple rules. Still every game is different. Not so easy to win this game. Very original final count. Everybody has a chance to win till the last turn. Some luck is required to win, but it's such a joyful game. The theme, the scenery, its all very well done.

You can play this with 3 or 4 but the game only shines with 4.

A lot more fun than I had expected after reading the reviews here and perusing the rules.  After playing, however, I find it to be challenging and entertaining.  The fun of getting to a piece of gold or a high-scoring token one step ahead of another player only adds to the value.  Playtime with four is relatively short (an hour or so), if everyone knows the rules about action tokens well enough.  Glad I found this one.

Material of good quality except for the folding screen that is very unstable.  Good theme.

The mechanisms of play is a mix of programming, placement to have majorities, management of resource that is very pleasant to play.

Physical board smaller than expected.  
Bits are low to medium quality. 
My board is warped and doesn't lay flat.
Artwork overly cartoony.

But all of that is easily forgiven because the game is just so darned good.

I like the programming aspect and trying to outguess your opponents moves when coming in contact with them in villages. At first it's easy to get your programming messed up just by mistake so allow a little extra time for new players to get the zen of it. End game scoring is really funky. Very difficult to explain to someone who hasn't played the game before.

Tilsit edition. I love the plastic pieces, although they were a bit painful to break out. Love the people and box artwork, the board itself is not very inspiring. Still wrapping my mind around the concepts of guessing the best moves to choose (program). Scoring is a bit confusing. Needs more plays before final rating. Definitly seems a unique combination of mechanics.

En tant que chef d'une tribu des hauts plateaux himalayens (Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa ou Tamang), vous devez mener votre caravane de yacks de villages en villages, en empruntant les cols et les crêtes enneigées, afin de collecter puis de distribuer les Ressources nécessaires à la subsistance des populations locales.

En même temps, vous oeuvrez pour étendre l'influence de votre tribu sur les plans religieux, politique et économique. En effet, les Ressources collectées (sel, orge, thé, jade ou or) vous permettront de faire des offrandes aux monastères, d'envoyer des Délégations de votre tribu dans différentes régions ou encore de faire du troc pour acquérir de nouveaux yacks, augmenter votre cheptel et devenir ainsi le chef Caravanier le plus prospère de l'Himalaya.

Initial rating after 1 4-player session without the advanced rules: 

+ Fun & interactive. Feels fresh, even in 2013. Tense, we played with the suggested 1 minute timer, which makes it even more tense.

- The 'luck of the roll' (a 20-sided dice that decides which new villages get either resources or trade opportunities) seems to have quite a big influence.


Want to play it more to see whether you or the game has the biggest influence about who wins the game.

Nice game. I prefer the theme of this to the fantasy theme of Lords of Xidit. I suspect the ideal version is a mix of the 2 games - I prefer how some things are done in Himalaya and how some things are done in Xidit. 

There's a big heaping of luck in this game, but you can read and double bluff your opponents quite successfully. I much prefer the programming in this to the nonsense of Robo Rally.

Fantastic -- the best programmed moves game I've played.  Players program their moves to pick up commodities and deliver them to cities wanting those commodities.  When you deliver goods to cities you can spread your influence in 2 of 3 categories:  economic (expand your yak herd), religious (build a stupa in that city), political (send delegates to connecting towns).  Also, love the victory conditions: first whoever has the least amount of religious influence is eliminated; second, whoever has the least amount of political influence is eliminated; finally of those left whoever has the most economic influence is declared the winner.

2 points for the bits. Otherwise, too chaotic and random, plotting your move is good on one hand as you move through the round quickly but equally bad if you have an absent minded moment and accidentally set the wrong programme tile which may kill your game completely or if someone else's programme messes yours up. Too long for what is is. More tolerable if it had half the turns.Pasted on theme. Typical of so many Euros which rehash the same old mechanics.

Himalaya edition, by Tilsit.

Very Nice!  This is a medium-weight Euro-boardgame, with very pretty board and components.  It contains a nice mix of elements found in several other popular games: pick-up-and-deliver, contract fulfillment, area-influence, programmed actions, etc.  This sounds complicated, but it really isn't.  6 actions are programmed each round, but often the best move at certain stages will be obvious, which makes this a middle-weight, quick-playing game despite the stew of mechanisms.

I like it a lot so far!

Wow.  Completely derivative game... and a complete hoot.

Himalaya mashes up mechanics you've played before into something akin to Tigris and Euphrates as a racing game: you must balance out the yaks you need for the end-game with the political and religious points you need to score to even QUALIFY for the end-game.  Pickup-n-deliver train games WISH they had this kind of tension.  Only RoboRally creates more impact when something goes wrong with a player's programmed moves.

I'm not going to call it a masterpiece -- the placement of new resources and shipping points with a d20 makes for some chaotic, lopsided delivery routes, and the initial read on the board looks like that placement wasn't taken into account -- but it's a very solid race game that needs wider recognition.

Gioco semplice che però viene condizionato eccessivamente dal lancio dei dadi che determinano dove verranno messe le risorse ad ogni turno. Si tratta comunque di un gioco di intuito e programmazione simultanea. Il calcolo dei punteggi finali riprende il metodo 'Knizia', escudendo a turno i giocatori con meno maggioranze; anche questo calcolo, peraltro simpatico, potrebbe regalare la vittoria in modo casuale. La forte incidenza della fortuna mi fa quindi allontanare dal gioco che reputo non del tutto riuscito.

I have to confess that Himalaya wasn't all I'd hoped for. The pre-programming mechanic, I really like, but that has been totally subsumed by Colt Express. I also liked the idea of elimination-format scoring, but when I found myself explaining it as 'a bit Tigris & Euphrates', I realised it wasn't totally new either. The random dice roll does actually make sense, but the elimination format doesn't, and the whole thing should be four rounds shorter. Having said all that, I recognise it as a historically-influential game: it's such a shame it's dated so poorly.

Rating is based on play using the 'village cards' available for download from the official site.  This set of 20 cards replaces the die and drastically reduces the randomness of the game (which is otherwise its fatal flaw).  My rating of the game with die would be a 4 or 5.

My way of using the cards is to have a set of 4 face up and the rest in a stack.  We've never yet had more than 4 replenishments needed per round, so it worked out perfectly.  Still a little uncertainty about whether some of the numbers will be goods or an order, but it's manageable and lets you plan ahead.

Excellent effort by Tilsit.  I love the theme (but then I'm Buddhist), and the mechanics integrate well, especially the programmed movement.  Components are nice, but I can't get the screens to work properly.  Prefer the variants from Counter magazine #30 (reroll the die on placement hits and for 3-player, value the three sectors at 3, 2, and 1 points, splitting points for ties, then throw out lowest player, of remaining two most yaks wins).  Look for 5-6 player expansion in Feb. 2006.

Fiddly screens aside, this is an excellent game.  The randomness from the dice rolls weakens the game slightly, but is easily fixed and doesn't ruin the overall experience.

Really enjoyed this one.  The combination of mechanics is very unique.  There is a real-time programing like a Roborally however, you are programing pick ups and deliveries.  Once delivering, the decisions begin with which of the three influences to go for which has two different types of area control or wealth(yaks!).  There are also timing aspects that have to be accounted for with the rewards at rounds 4,8, and 12 with cube majority.  That can really throw an unexpected curve into this game.  So there is a lot to manage both tactically and strategically which interacts enjoyably with the outguess your opponent aspect of the programing. I just found the unique array of mechanic quite enjoyable.  On top of everything, the winning conditions were interesting even as a 3 player game as you really have to decide to go for it with winning two influences or just play defense to make sure no one has two and win with the most Yaks.  I can see how the 4 player  conditions make this even more intriguing with the player elimination at the end and I hope to have the opportunity to see how that plays out but as it is just a very enjoyable game that is pretty easy to just pick up and play but has lots of depth.

Merchants of Empire free web-based version. After puting everything together which was not a short time, it was okay. I bet with the new production values of a real game board etc this would rate high up on the scale, but as a put together game, it was really fiddly cuz of the heavy paper used to make it and taping and glueing, etc. And I never got those screens to stay upright.

I enjoy this whenever I play it...  right up till the end.  I actually marvel at the scoring setup in this game and love that the loser of the stuupa scoring is removed from the game, pieces and all...  But, the game seems so random at times, that it makes me wonder if I would like this mechanic in a less chaotic game, one in which i have more control over where I get to place my influence.  Overall, a fine game, and one I wont turn down... probably...

interesting mix of many different mechanics, but falls rather flat for several reasons:
a) far too random: what and where resources and contracts appear is completely random and can make or break any strategy.

c) artificial, silly theme.

Played the homemade Merchants version. It was okay. There's a fair amount of luck regarding where the resources and contracts are placed, and depending on where you are sitting your plans can get totally screwed up. This seems like a lot of work to put together, but I really like the theme and graphics more than the Himilayan version. The game also plays fairly quickly once people know what they're doing.

Himalaya -- Played once; four-player.  

Reminder to self:  collect resources without spending them on yaks in the first third of the year.  At the end of the fourth month, you get yaks for resource majorities [b]without having to spend resources[/b].  (So pay attention to what resources people are collecting, and spend those, while keeping others to garner some majorities.)  Once they've earned you some yaks, any retained resources can be spent to balance your standing in the religious, political or economic arenas.

Progamming your moves isn't as tight, nor as potentially disastrous, as in Roborally.  For example, if someone takes the resource you hoped for, you may still get something, which may be of use later.  The manner for determining the winner at the end of the game requires very balanced play.  Considering how poorly I played, I was surprisingly impressed with this design.  While the theme is not particulary integral to the game mechanics, it is at least different from the glut of medieval merchant themes of recent years -- and the artwork both pleases the eye and contributes to ease of play.

Implementation suggestion:  I think there should be two privacy screens per player.  A small one to hide resources and loot, and a long one to hide action tokens.  This way, when you reveal your actions, you don't have to mess with your other hidden items.

Mintha fogták volna a Roborally és a Valdora szabálykönyvét és összegyúrták volna, ez volt az első gondolatom a Himalaya szabályát hallgatva. Persze tudom, hogy a Valdora jóval későbbi játék, így talán az "építkezett" ebből a játékból. Szóval fölvesz és kiszállít típusú játék a Himalaya, amit megbolondít egy titokban lerakott cselekvési terv és az egyféle pontozást egy három részre osztottal variálták meg. Azon kívül, hogy az áruk kiszállításakor gazdasági pontokat kaphatunk, választhatunk területfoglalást és templomépítést. Így a játék végén játékosszámtól függő érdekes pontozást talált ki a szerző. A játék gyors, de a véletlenszerűen felkerülő áruk és kiszállítási célok szerintem erősen szerencsefüggővé teszik. Amivel még gondom volt a tábla, lehetett volna átláthatóbbra készíteni. Abszolút nem rossz játék a Himalaya, de ha káoszra vágyok és partyjátékra inkább játszom Roborallyt, ha pedig családi felvesz és kiszállítós játékra, akkor inkább Valdorát.

I figured I would like this game, but I'm still a bit surprised how much I like it.  

Programmed games can come away feeling heavily chaotic, most are silly and light but Himalaya really has some depth to it.  There are a number of significant decisions that are rewarded by good play and a healthy dose of double think.  The game favors the most clever players.  Often in deeper games with simultaneous movement/action selection I feel like you make your plans and throw them into the meat grinder to see what comes out (Maharaja), but I never felt I was out of control in Himalaya.

That said there is an overwhelming amount of blind luck in where and what goods and orders come out.

The art is beautiful and the pieces are lovely.  Everything is utilitarianly designed for clarity (with the minor exception of the orange for brown blocks). The only thing that the game desperately needs is a player aid for victory conditions.

Well worth tracking down.

Robo Rally meets pick up and deliver game.  It plays very well and runs smooth, but there's such a huge luck element to where things end up that it makes it a bit hard to plan.  It also gives you that terrible feeling of making a great plan for a turn and then realizing right in the middle that you can't change it so your turn is pretty much wasted.  But, if you feel like a game with some chaos, it's a great fun option!

RATING: 7
Played two 4p games.
Programming with yaks!  Each player leads their caravaneer down icy paths between villages to either collect goods from villages or fulfill orders.  There is a simultaneous action reveal of the next 6 moves by players, comprising either moving, dealing, or resting.  When picking up goods, a player must take the least valuable good in the village.  When an order is filled, the player gets a chance to place markers to vie for majorities in three categories: economic, political, or religious.  In the 4p game, the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, followed by the one with the least political, and then the least economic influence.  So it's important to be diversified.  

Addition to religious influence is a race, since only one religious marker (stupa) by any player can be placed in any village.  Adding to political influence introduces a spatial aspect to the game, since you must fulfill orders on different parts of the board to contribute to majorities in different regions.  Economic influence is straightforward, and the more difficult orders you fill (usually requiring gold), the more influence you have.
Thoughts:
Players undervalue gold at their peril, as it not only gets the most yaks (economic), it also enables you to fill the most difficult orders, providing access for political and religious influence peddling.  The second guessing aspect of the programming is fun but can lead to disaster, or at least a lot of groaning.  One thing I disliked was that it was easy to tell 3/4 of the way through that you would be eliminated first or second, and there didn't seem to be any way to avoid it.  That said, I've only played it twice, so an experienced group may forestall certain knowledge of that endstate until the last round or two.

Rate based on one play, not sure it will go up or down on subsequent plays. The replacing of resources is quite (too?) random, making extensive planning superfluous. That may not a bad thing, but the game sure has a deeper "sense" to it.

RATING: 9
Definitely underappreciated.  This is a very interesting game - a bit of area control in trying to get your pieces to the regions, as well as a nice programming element, as you must set up your moves in advance.   The endgame scoring is quite sweet, as you knock out a couple of players that didn't have enough influence.

RATING: 5
The board shows villages in the Himalayas, connected by different colored routes (3 types). Each village has a shrine of varying influence (1, 2 or 3). The routes divide the board into several regions. Each town is numbered 1-20; a d20 is used to randomly select towns at the start of each round. 5 towns get randomly chosen resources (5 types) and 5 get discs. The discs require various combinations of resources to complete. Players have 6 square order tokens, that show the 3 route types on 3 sides, and an ACTION symbol on the 4th. Each round, after making sure at least 5 towns have discs and 5 have resources, players secretly (behind a screen) program their turn using their order tokens (the side facing the board is the order they are issuing). Then, everyone reveals the orders and take turns executing them. A route order moves your token along that route, out of the current city. An action symbol either gives you a resource (if there are any) - you get the least valuable one - or allows you to complete the disc (if any is present). Completing a disc allows you to do 2 of 3 things: (1) place a shupa on the shrine in that town, if there is not one already there; (2) place as many monks in the surrounding regions as the strength of the shrine; (3) add the disc to your score pile; they are worth 3-9 yaks (if you don't choose #3, the disc goes back to the bag and can be drawn later). There are additional scorings after rounds 4, 8, and 12, and the game ends after round 12. The winner is determined by elimination: first eliminate the player with the least religious influence (= lowest sum of shrine strengths). Next, eliminate the person with the least political influence (= sum of regions controlled by their monks, where control = majority). Note that "eliminate" means to remove ALL their pieces from the board, so majorities can change in surprising ways if you miscounted. Finally, the player with the most yaks (economic influence) wins the game.

It's an interesting game, but somewhat tedious. Once the orders are in, there is no more thought - you just play the orders out (this would be a great game for play-by-web). You're trying to guess where others are going so that you can time your arrival and get the action you want before they get there and take it instead; all of that thought happens when you are programming your turn. Also, you are constantly counting majorities to try to make sure you are not the least in anything; the board design makes that a bit difficult. Finally, the end seems strange: with 2 players being eliminated, the board changes dramatically and it felt a little random (even though it would have been completely predictable if you took the time to count everything).

RATING: 6
I like the way all players secretly determine their moves and reveal simultaneously.  I also like how the areas to pursue can change from round to round.  It plays rather quickly that way and mixes some strategy with alternating bursts of laughter and groans.  The scoring is a bit convoluted but still alright.  I would rate it a little higher except that it's somewhat difficult to tell who's winning the religion points and which places are worth 1,2, or three points, at least for me.

Great mechanics and theme (love the programming and interaction it brings) but ultimately the game has many problems.
The game is bit scripted at the beginning where it's a race to put your stupa down on monasteries. That means a player can quickly know is eliminated from the game.
Random distribution of resources and contracts adds unnecessary luck to the game.
At 12 rounds, the game is a bit too long (especially if your last in religious influence). The last few turns feels like grinding.
Political scoring too often ends up in tie, meaning only economics scoring manners.
The game has been reimplemanted as Lords of Xidit which corrects most of the problem of the original from what I can gather.

I'm not going to yak on too long here - this is a fun game that combines simultaneous action selection with route planning with pick-up-and-deliver with area control mechanisms (do those little sherpas ever rest? - get it - "Everest") to construct a well-functioning Frankengame.  The components are lovely too, especially the wee Caravan Chiefs and the Envoys.  If it has any flaws (and what game doesn't?) it's that the game really needs exactly 4 players to work well, those stupid Stupas are too small and don't stand out enough on the board, and in order to create the optimal play experience, the game itself requires some rules alterations... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72396/squashs-himalaya-variants ...based upon the base game's advanced rules, the optional rules from the expansion, the excellent variant rules from BGG user Isamoor, and my own little variant tweaks.

RATING: 7
[Tilsit 'Himalaya' 2004 edition] {Clan; programming, area-majority, dice-rolling, resource management; optimal 4p} {7 with card variant, 7 with advanced rules} Himalaya is an integration of resource management and area-majority with the element of programming.  It has a unique scoring system, somehow reminiscent of T&E's. Though players continually make decisions in Himalaya, it is more suitable for families because it is too chaotic for hardcore gamers.

Himalaya has a strong theme - civilization in Himalaya region to build economic, religious and political powers. Unlike other German games, the figures are not made of wooden pieces. There are interesting plastic miniatures of Caravan Chief, Stupas and Envoys. Most of the components are nicely made except the board, which is somewhat childish and is just a sticker on a board.

Himalaya is highly dynamic because of the simultaneous programming and random allocation of orders and goods.  Players need to carefully calculate their power in each dimension of economic, political and religions lest they were eliminated. Thus, players need to take the awards strategically in order to keep oneself in the winning path.

It would be nice to use cards instead of dice in assigning goods and orders so that players can have better planning.  When using dice, it's difficult to form a good strategy because one would never know which cities would have goods or order in next few steps. However, this kind of control is not necessary for general plays.

The advanced rules increase the interaction between players and provide more tactical decisions. The new variant of reversing Stupa value is very good. It increases the fun and tactical depth of the game. However, I don't quite like the new inventory check variant. It somehow discourages players to make orders.

This is an excellent attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Expansion] The expansion is comparatively expensive - it's nearly 50% of the price of the basic box. It seems that Himalaya becomes more chaotic and competitive (is it better?) with more people. The 5-6 player expansion can be considered if you are after high player interaction. But if you need something strategic, the expansion can be skipped.

I really want to love this game. The theme is appealing, the bits are great, the concept is sound, but... luck of the draw is so overwhelming that it really detracts from my enjoyment. A huge supply order can suddenly appear right next to a player giving them valuable points for no effort whatsoever. This game must be played with the deck of cards player aid instead of the publisher-provided d20.

Nice programming style game where players plan out a series of moves in secret and then all execute them concurrently (similar to Robo Ralley in that respect).  It's also an area-control game with Knizia-like scoring elements.  Players try to secure a majority of points in 3 categories.  The winner is the player with the most points in the third category who isn't the player with the least points in the first two.  It's a good game but there's a bit too much chaos and randomness for me to consider it a truly great game.  Happy to play.  Don't need to own.

Single game (4-player; setup using goods/order sequencing from expansion). Pickup & deliver with programmed movement. Probably the most convoluted end-game scoring in the world.

It is fun to program your movement and run around picking stuff up and dropping it off.  We played with the cards from the publishers website instead of the dice.  I like the cards.  I'm not sure about the victory conditions for 3 players, but I'm not sure what to do about them.  Yaks seem strong because yaks are one of the majorities you need and also the winner in a tie breaker.  The twelve turns went pretty quickly.  Looking forward to playing again. 2007/12/05

As the description says, this game borrows several different mechanics from other famous games, and combines them IMO very cleverly and succesfully. It reminds me of Samurai (influence control) and Dragonland (movement between several locations, several resources to choose in each). Like Dragonland it gets slightly "random" because of the sheer amount of things to keep track of, but unlike Dragonland this doesn't annoy me, maybe because there clearly is less randomization (no dice, no hidden resources). Good.

A very good mix of strategy and fun, lots of things going on. Watch the board, anticipate, be quick and don't make obvious choices...

Excruciating (in a good way) programming game.  With five, there's a very good chance that you'll be competing with someone along your path each turn - but there's too many permutations to quite figure out where and when.  As the player count drops, this is easier to predict, and sometimes you're left alone to work in a corner of the board.  I haven't played yet with 4, but wonder if that may be a sweet spot - leaving in the tension, but removing some of the chaotic feeling.

Holy yak, there's a lot going on in this one.  I often don't feel comfortable assigning a rating after just a single play, but after 1 play with 4 players this one gets a 7.  When you add the movement programming (at which I do not seem to excel) to BOTH the pick-up & deliver AND area control (plus whatever other mechanics I'm missing) there's a lot of unpredictability in how your moves will play out.  The need to hedge your bets against what you think your opponent might do reminds me, in a way, of Acquire, but that game's leaner mechanics inject a level of tension into the chaos that felt lacking from Himalaya.  I felt more "played," I guess--but maybe that's because I suck at the movement programming part!  I'd try it again.

this game should be more known/played. the components are nice looking, the theme is interesting and the gameplay flows unusually smooth. also, it's a tatic game that still holds some strategy, and a quite deep game that doesn't feel "heavy" during play.

RATING: 10
A very solid game with that is a lot of fun.  I can see the chaos being a problem for some people so if you don't like that steer clear but for the rest of you fun loving gamers out there check this game out.  With the multiple elimination rounds, programming, pick-up/drop-off mechanics and yet still wanting to retain the goods this game offers a lot to think about in a fun light theme. Well done. 

UPDATE: After playing this one for a couple years solid I always look forward to grabbing it and getting it on the table. Never turn it down and love to teach it to new players. Great game.

This was pretty fun pick up and deliver stuff.  I'd definitely like to play it again--with all the stuff going on it was kind of hard to get a handle on what to be shooting for.

Excellent game. Great components, simple rules, fats and fun. The shinning star in this game is that it has an objective to be maximized (money) with two constraints (religion and political influence). It takes real balance and constant vigilance to be successful! YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE RULES IN THE EXPANSION. You do not need to buy the expansion but you have to play with the rules that come with it. The expansion actually make this game a real 10!

Outstanding game by a smaller publisher.  This seems to be the one game my game group keeps playing year in and year out for years, and everyone new to the game always enjoys it too.  The only issue is the production value, some of the colors can be hard to distinguish.  The board, delivery tokens and screens could be improved graphically and functionally.  It would love to see Himalaya updated and published again.

I like a lot of what the game does, but there is just too much randomness - it is entirely possible to spend half the game unable to fulfill any orders no matter what actions you take, simply because of how things come out. Possibly some of the expansion changes would help, but I wasn't moved enough to try them.

RATING: 7
Even though I am pretty disappointed by the quality of its components (the flimsy player screens, the warping board, the cut-them-yourself figurines), this is quite a fun game and still very original in 2011. Gameplay is a bit chaotic and you definitely need some luck to win, but the combination of a majority game, programmed movement and pick up & deliver makes for a very refreshing experience. There is a good chance that I will like the game even better with the advanced rules, which seem to make the game a little bit more tactical. All in all nothing stellar, but a game I am glad to own because of its originality.

I have played once with 4 players.  I thought it was an interesting game.  I would probably give it a 7, but I don't like the final scoring.  I'm not crazy about the elimination scoring in High Society, but that is a fast game and it effectively adds to the tension.  This game isn't long, but it is too long for it to be fun to be eliminated outright regardless of how well you are doing in other categories.  Also be careful not to let the programmed actions take too long because it could really drag the game down.

Tilsit version. I like the mechanics of the game - programmed pick-up-and-deliver, a variety of different majorities to shoot for.  I feel I ought to like the clever victory conditions, but in both games I've played I finished feeling dissatisfied. It's more important to avoid being last in any type of majority than to be first, which is more suble than just gunning for leadership, but not as much fun.  You have only a few opportunities to negate anyone's plans, but perfect information (assuming you have a perfect memory of what goes behind that player shield) of everyone's progress towards those majorities, so observation rather than action is the key.  An ok game, but imho not deserving of its SdJ nomination.

The production is absolutely gorgeous. I really like the idea of having to "pre-program" your moves in secret, trying to outwit and second-guess your opponents. It makes for some pretty comical situations when orders clash! I also enjoy the idea of needing to balance one's points. The risk of elimination at the end is always tense. I can't say enough about this wonderful game!

This was not what I was expecting, but I think I like that.  This is one of those games where there's not necessarily anything new, but there is a lot of ideas taken from other games.  This game combines those ideas seamlessly and lets them work together rather than against each other.  The simultaneous movement is neat, and works well with the market mechanic. The biggest criticism that I have with this game is that there seems to be a significant amount of luck, but the game is short enough that it isn't a big problem, but more of a minor nitpick.  For families or light Euro gamers, this is a good choice.

Fast pick up and deliver game with a Roborally programming element. You program six moves each turn, which are things like Walk on Dirt path, Walk on Stone Path, Deal with town, Walk on Ice path, etc. Dealing is either picking up a goods cube from the board, or delivering cubes to fulfil the contract there. Then, you decide to take "points" in two of three scoring categories. 

Final scoring is a bit complicated, in that you have to do well in all three categories to win, as the lowest person in certain categories gets eliminated from winning.

Great combination of a pickup and deliver "train" game and an area control game a la China / Web Of Power with some simultaneous programming of actions a la RoboRally, too. Very interesting and hard multi-level scoring trade-off a la Steam's income~points choice but on four levels. Significantly better with 4 players.

A decent game but very unforgiving. Like roborally except you get hosed worse by screwing up your orders. I'm also concerend about the fact that one player is always last on every scoring round.

I'm a bit on the fence about this one after one play [4 players]. I felt the game was ALMOST too long for its own good but thankfully it moved along quickly due to the fact that most decisions are pretty obvious... but is that really a good thing? I feel this game is in a catch22 with me: if it reveals itself to be more interesting it will probably be too long for how much blind luck is involved. If it doesn't, I'm not sure it will be able to hold my interest for more than a couple plays.  For now I can say I enjoyed the cleverness of the mechanisms and had a pleasant if forgettable time playing. Where the rating will go after a couple plays I have no idea,...

Each player is the chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe trying to extend his tribe's influence in the religious, political and economic spheres. The goal is to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya; inspired by various classics: Elfenland for the movement rules, Tigris & Euphrates for the multiple influence scores and the victory conditions, El Grande/San Marco for the regional influences, RoboRally for the simultaneous turn "programming"; Category: Political, Medieval, Economic;  Mechanics: Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Pick-up and Deliver

Played several times (with 4 players). A nice game with clever mechanisms (including the way the winner is determined) and interesting gameplay.

I personally think it's a brilliant approach to the old pick up and deliver mechanic by melding it with simultaneous action selection.  Not as chaotic as RoboRally simply because you know the order of the resolution each round, so the randomness is controlled and you can actually plan your moves up to a point.  The competition for the three different sphere of influences is also a stroke of genius, the only flaw is that in most situations the type of actions one would choose after fulfilling an order is often already decided for you, especially if a stupa has been built at that site and/or if you ran out of delegations to deploy.

Another thing I didn't care for is the inventory phases that take place every four turns.  I think it's meant to be a catch up mechanism for people that have been unlucky in completing orders.  However, if goods are supposed to be hidden information, why do you then force people to reveal them with such an implementation?

Lastly, I don't like the change in the winning condition for 3-players.  If economic is the tie-breaker, then you give the person who wins that influence an automatic advantage as long as he can keep someone else from controlling the other two.  Which, as a matter of fact, makes the game susceptible to kingmaking.

Even so, I sort of regret selling Himalaya without trying it out first.  I quite enjoyed it and definitely can see its appeal.

Sitnaltax:"If you want programmed movement, play RoboRally. If you want area control, play El Grande. If you want to wander around a graph of lines and nodes, play Elfenland. If you want intricate mechanics with subtle interactions, play Puerto Rico.
If all four of those games are getting old for you and you want to try something different, play Himalaya"
Great game even if the others aren't getting old for "you"
Not every game is able to achieve this quite good mixture.
Screens and their colours are not well produced.

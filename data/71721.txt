Solo: 8/10. Less luck than some people seem to think. Exciting dice rolling and a good challenge.

Multi: 6/10. At most. Just takes too long. But I really don't like cooperative games. Anyway, would have sold this after first try if it were'nt for the fun solo play.

|Good game ,will play it a lot as you can play solo or with upto 6 players.
The layout looks hard to get yer head around at first but you soon get into it.
It realy get the other player to think out what the plan for the round is .

Some good ideas there, like it, it gets you in very quckly,

First impression was wierd because a lot of everything was new however after playing it 3 times the game started to shine. Important: Dont give up after the first play 

It is so awsome when you shorten a level by blowing a gas container up to SPACE, he he, and you are able to go to the next leve right away. It is simly ROCKING awsome.

Although sometimes it could feel a bit of repetative, the genestealer sudden groupings make it heart beating exciting and thrilling. Also the event cards spice up everything :)
Definetly repetative in a sense of repeatedly loading a flamethrower, he he, and not in a sense of boringness.

Also if you win, although being a short game, you do have a great sense of acievement. Almoust as similar feeling as in Ghost Stories.  

One draw back is that in this game you will be constantly rearranging terrain cards and travelling is boring sometimes

RATING: 7
I tend to enjoy any decent game that can be played solo, and Space Hulk was no exception. It's a fast moving, tactical game that scales in difficulty as the game progresses. It is a little too luck based, in my opinion (a bad streak of dice rolls can crush your winning odds), but it never gets dull. It's a good game, overall, but with low replayability and having to deal with luck, I can't give this game a super high rating.

I really, really like this game.  After playing it the first time, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  The theme is incredibly rich and comes through in the gameplay.  Every decision is important and each of your marines matter.  Rock solid game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A clever card implementation of Space Hulk, that manages to capture the claustrophobic and brooding atmosphere of the original miniature game surprisingly well.. and to turn the originally duel-type game into a co-op with up to six players! It even works wonderfully as a solitaire! It's extremely portable and lots of fun to play (although fiendishly hard to beat, like the original!). I'm impressed.

Frankly, I'm not sure how I feel about this game yet.  I do love the difficulty.  Not sure I really like the rules/setup though, and shifting formation/travelling just seems complicated and annoying and breaks the tension.  That being said, I did enjoy my last two plays much more though, so maybe as I get more used to it my impression will improve.  Will hold off on a rating till I have more plays under my belt.

RATING: 8.5
Quick and fast game, which I usually play solo.
The games captures the theme very well (if you have space hulk, you'll recognise all the characters), plays quick and is difficult enough. There's a good amount of randomness, but planning your moves as best as you can is still very important.
All the space marines team are interesting, except for the green team, which I don't like very much.
The expansions add a good amount of variety, but that isn't really needed at the moment, I just bought them because of the expiring license.

RATING: 7
This game really retains the feel of the full board game version of Space Hulk (3rd edition) but in the form of a card game. The thing I like about this most is the ability to play solo, it does that really well. It also plays with 3+ good as well. Overall the game is fairly difficult, but I like that as it'll keep me coming back for more... I have yet to win a game...

 Played once. Lost in 15 minutes after spending an hour setting it up. Need to play again.

6/5/13 - Solo play. I watched a few videos first and it helped a great deal. I was able to win on my first try with Grey/Yellow/Purple. I didn't realize you traveled when you emptied a ping stack or that you should lay out the order cards and use the tokens. Night and day difference it made in the end. Adjusted score upward.

Struggled with this game. I really don't like the dice rolling. I get using support tokens and collecting them but just didn't do it for me. I changed the rule to 'if you roll a zero nothing happens'. I enjoyed it slightly more. Too much luck involved. 
If the fighting wasn't resolved by using only one dice I would probably love this game though as the theme is awesome and concept is great.

Difficult to get my head around the rules on this one at first. A claustrophobic feeling all the way, tough to win but if you like Warhammer 40k and you can't be bothered to break open its large sibbling then this will be a satisfying alternative that takes a lot less space and leaves you pretty much with the same feeling (damn you tyrannids!).

Very good, solo or cooperative. Just about the right difficulty, and the game can be punishing if you push your luck too far.

Particularly the rules for combat are simple and sweet, much like Space Hulk. I do wish there was a map-based element since the locations are a bit abstract, but it keeps the length and weight down!

Occupies a weird niche in my house:  it only gets played by me and my 7-year-old collaborating as a single-player.   Otherwise, it seems overly complex and somewhat tedious as you add more players.   As young as he is, my kid totally "gets" the game and loves suggesting ways to play each turn.  

We need more time with the expansions, but I'm not sure they add enough to the game.

There aren't many games that scale just as well with 6 players as they do with 1.  Largely tactical with a cool theme and just enough randomness on the attack roles to keep things unpredictable.  The game is good value for money and small enough to easily carry to gaming sessions.  My only real criticism is that a couple of the expansion should have been included in the base set for more variety.  Another great solo game and excellent co-op.  Surprised this isn't rated higher on BGG.

RATING: 6
Bumping this from 7 to 8 after the second game.  Now that we're playing correctly, the game is really cool.  It has neat mechanics, and it's perfect for a lunch game, since it supports 1-6 players and can be played in an hour.  The manual is complete, but is put together oddly.  As a result, it is difficult to learn the game from the manual.

Update: Kicking this one down to a 6 since it never hits the table any more.  Nobody seems to want to deal with the near-hopelessness.  Also, the manual sucks hard enough that it is really tough to deal with rules questions when they come up.

RATING: 7
Death Angel is a difficult game. You'll find yourself losing more often than not, which can be frustrating when playing alone. When playing with others, however, you have someone to share in that panicked tension that this games replicates so well. You know you won't win as often as you lose, but it makes the game exciting, scary, and all the more enjoyable when you finally grasp victory. Solitaire mode works surprisingly well, but failure only serves to frustrate when playing alone.

It captures much the same feel of Space Hulk. It seems to have more balance toward the player (i.e. while it's balanced against the Space Marines, the balance seems to be closer to 50:50 than in the original board game). Fast paced, easy to carry, even if some of the rules are a tiny bit fiddly.

So much game, theme, tension and replay value in such a small box with a very reasonable setup and play time - that's quite unique. Just the right amount of luck to keep things interesting while, once you have a basic understanding of the Combat Teams and tactics available to you, still being fair most of the time. A very good Co-Op and one of the best solitaire games available. Excellent.

This is a good game, but in my opinion it's been surpassed by more elegant solo (and co-op) games in recent years. Sylvion is a great parallel. SHDA just has a ton of random luck, with a lot of your Marines' lives, and your games, hinging on 50/50 rolls. Experience and smart play will reduce those rolls or let you reroll them, but they're still there, and you never get more dice to roll like most dice-based co-ops. It takes up a large amount of table space and playtime compared to the box size, the rulebook is atrocious, one of FFG's worst, and the actual gameplay is just not as compelling for me as most of my other solos. I've given it to a friend indefinitely at this point.

Good game, I liked the good abstration the cards can give in this game, I didn't play the Board Game edition, but I supose the card edition speed the game a little bit, very challenging and even the lucky influencing the game all the time, you can make really good strategy in a lot of ways using the different abilities of the teams.

Feels quite similar to Ghost Stories, but in a faster, kore compact package. The luck can be a bit frustrating. A couple of good rolls can clear out all the gene stealers. A couple of bad rolls can see your marines decimated. I didn't feel like I had much control over the outcome.

Also, it has a terrible rulebook. It had virtually no structure; it's essentially a bullet pointed list of rules in no particular order.

I enjoy controlling Dudes on a Map with dice rolling. Like Summoner Wars. This is Lord of the Rings LCG lite. Spend 5 minutes planning your turn, and then watch it crash and burn.

Pro: Co-op. Shrinking board state.
Con: Components too small. Not sure if anyone would want to play this.

Happy to have found a reasonably cheap second hand copy of this on facebook. From a solo or 2P point of view, it's more puzzly than I anticipated, it has a slight chess feel when you have to decide on your actions. You get the feeling that there is probably a definite correct choice and that you're not making it! But the theme and sense of movement and action is strong enough that it balances the strategic puzzle side quite nicely. For its quick setup and comic book aesthetic I can see myself playing this a lot over the years to come.

Plays well with 1, 2 or 3 players.  Tense moments.  Sometimes you're overwhelmed in battle, but most times the end game is extremely close.  The luck of the dice represents the chaos and luck on a battlefield, but you definitely benefit from good strategy.

RATING: 8
Very good! The main problems with the game are the logistics around running through the characters in ascending numeric order (only a factor if you play with more than 2) and that the rulebook is quite dense and strangely structured. It's almost impossible to look up a rule since nothing ever seems to be where you would expect it to be.

How well you do is going to be highly influenced by random effects, but the game zips along fast enough that it's not a large issue and there's a pretty reasonable amount of luck mitigation even if it's something which shrinks over the course of the game rather than grows.

It's certainly an interesting game, though not really a great one - it's a hard co-op that doesn't have any fine-tuning levers (which is a strike against it) and a huge reliance on live-or-die dice rolls.  The mechanics kind of suck, to be honest: you're piling Genestealer enemies up against your row of Space Marines and trying to roll skulls to kill them off before they roll big numbers against you.  But there are a pile of player factions with sometimes very interesting abilities, and the card-based action selection mechanism works well.  It's solidly alright+.

A very difficult game that makes you fight for your wins. At first I didn't like the way your marines can instantly die. After several games I realized that since every turn is a life or death decision, I am fully engaged in every decision and victory becomes truly victorious. Still, at the end of the day I'd rather play something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Death Angel is fast-paced and action packed.  The engine that runs the Genestealers is challenging enough.  

Which is all just as well because there isn't a whole lot going on in terms of decision-making here.  It's a game of tactical combat that boils down to which of two ways my marines face, a choice of one of two actions per turn and lots of die rolls.  There's no variation in the enemy either; just hoards of them.

Production quality is fine.  The art is disappointing.  Compared to the same company's dark, sinister Doom, Death Angel looks like a cartoon intended for young boys.

People brag about how hard this game is to win... honestly I think it's a bit too much. I like the reflex mechanic though, which prevents the common co-op problem of the most knowledgeable player running the entire show.

I have some expansions for this that would go along with any trade.

Amazing little co-op design - just wish it were harder, that the expansion content were easier to get hold of now it's going out of print, and that the theme was more my style. That variable player powers come as synergistic supplements to base actions shared by all - and fire at different times - adds an enormous amount of character to each team with very little complexity. I also infinitely prefer this game's system of movement to Dungeon crawlers like Descent, in which space is rarely important for reasons other than proximity and consequently contributes very little to base game play. A more complex, thematically richer version of this base design would blow me away, and I'm hoping that due to the quiet success/critical reception of this one post FFG and GW's split FFG might do exactly this.

Wow! This is an amazingly evocative card game. Really captures the feel and tension of the board game, but with cooperative play. Awesome!! 
(Considering the setup and take-down time, I think I like it better than the Space Hulk board game.) Also plays great as a solo game!

Great components, mechanics and theme make for one big game in a small package.

This is one of the few games Richard Ham has talked us into that we didn't like. Again no rating because a full play through never happened. We set it up, tried to to play but kept having to refer back to the rules. Unfortunately that never helped as the rules are net well written by any sense of the word. You just couldn't follow what was happening by following the rules. Thunk! Onto the trade pile.

I'm not quite familiar with Space Hulk universe nor fan of its art style, which might just be an issue. Gameplay is quite tense once you got into it but after some time off, it felt a bit fiddly, which stopped me to come back.

Excellent solo and/or cooperative gameplay, feels too random and difficult at the beginning till you start to understand the deep strategy involved and all the options available. Usually the games are epic, tense and exciting, even when you lose. Not a 10 because with more than 3 players can be a bit frustrating (if both of your marines die, you are out of the game till it ends) Worth every penny - and the cards are top quality.

May 2015 (after the first 5-10 plays):
The game requires quite some space for what it is. Not exactly my type of theme and the artwork discourages me from playing while my kid is awake and around. It is almost completely luck dependent and feels unbalanced (33% chances of having your Space Marine slayed by a single Genestealer, 50% by two and 66% by three).
Not my cup of tea, but somehow I am still reaching for it. Perhaps I am hoping one could develop a strategy/tactic to mitigate some of the luck? I can see some potential, but is it worth developing skills in a card game I do not even care about? Ah, what the hell, let me check if I can manage frustration and changing priorities one more time!

Nice, nasty representation of the Space Hulk theme through a tight card game. Variable setups based on player count, and important facing and formation mechanics simulate the swarms of Genestealers rushing at the players' Space Marines. Dark, sometimes hopeless, and tactical, it does share some positioning and other rules with some of FFG's other, later games. Awesome.

RATING: 5.997
Death Angel definitely is not the type of game that I normally get into, but it is a really fun game for solo play. Many solo games feel very puzzley, but the randomness in this game (dice rolling, random rooms, and the event cards) allows for interesting tactical decisions with no guarantee of success. I definitely wouldn't want to play this game all the time because of the large amount of luck, but it stays in my solo-game rotation because it offers something unique in my collection.

Update: I love the tension of the game. I am typically on the edge of my seat, but I ended up getting rid of it because it just had too much luck for me to enjoy on a regular basis.

The game succeeds in its goal: a simple fast paced encounter in space warhammer40k-themed. Mechanics work well. For perfection, I wished for some more complexity though. Particularly the monster cards have virtually no info on them. They could have some abilities, even simple ones. Also a 1-2 more types of dice and mechanics to go with them would really bring the game close to a perfect 10.

This is a cooperative ameritrash: the theme is strong, there's dice rolling, and you can't really plan a strategy (it's somehow tactical, anyway).
The impression is that sometimes dice and cards work agaisnt the players, and they can't do nothing to avoid defeat. Some other times fate is favorable. Moreover, with more players the game is probably easier: anyway, playing with less marines is very hard if you don't have one (or both) the heavy weapons.
In conclusion, it's a nice quick game if you don't expect too much strategy and want to have a gaming experience.

I actually like this game more than I thought I would; which is especially noteworthy considering that I'm usually luke-warm on this type of sci-fi. I like it much more at $10 than at $15-$20, but either way you get a solid little game inside this box. A popular choice for solo play, it's great for travel or those nights when you're too lazy or tired to commit to something larger. You get to manipulate cards, tokens, and a die, with minimal setup and a reasonable yet satisfying game length. The rules can seem a bit bewildering at first if you've never seen it played, but once you play it, their simplicity becomes evident and referencing the rule book always yields the desired clarification. Sufficiently engaging and very convenient, Death Angel earns its small spot on your shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: This card game really captures the essence of the Space Hulk board game. One word that sums up my impression would be "brutal". When the die roll goes the wrong way, especially early in the game, it can cause a domino effect as your squad gets wiped out. There are strategies to mitigate the die rolls but will reveal themselves only in repeated plays. I'm not there yet.

10 Plays: I've only managed to win once. The taste of victory was sweet. I've been playing with random squad assignments, which I think may be adding to the difficulty. Still, I'm enjoying myself and would love to play this cooperatively a bit more.

This game is very engaging, but it is so frustratingly difficult to be fun. 
Rulebook is not written very well, so it is easy to miss some details, so I had to read the FAQ on the forum. 

Now I am pretty sure I didn't do any major rule mistakes, but still Space marines are too easily slained. 
Even with just one Genestealer, there is 1/3 chance for the space marine to be slained. 
It also doesn't have any way to adjust the difficulty. 

At least, I'm getting better slightly each time, but I couldn't pass even the half on the third try - lost on 5th location out of 10.

Random: The game

I see a lot of people comparing it to a puzzle, but what kind of puzzles relies so heavily on dice rolls? You also draw a card each turn to add more luck factor on that luck factor.

So the turn order is: 
1: Chose your action (you have two choice, no kidding...)
2: Execute your action. This often involves rolling a d6 (starting at 0, to 6) )with a 50% success rate
3: Monsters attack. Roll the die (maybe you'll be able to re-roll one or two times if you fail, depending on other players actions): 0-1 = fail... Higher might mean a fail too, depending on the enemies... Failing = you lose one of your two characters.
4: Draw a random event card that may ruin your game

Halfway through the game, one or two players probably got kicked out of the game because some die rolls killed them. They're now having fun playing on a videogame or something, you wish you were, too.

1 hour playing time.

You can't ask many more things to add to this.
... Except that after 7 plays One still don't stand a chance to even make it to the final mob fights.

Played a few times more again and the event seeding is not repeated when you do the travelling, which makes the game more balanced. Upped to an 8. Edited in 2013: 9 !

I consider a good solitary game where at least 1 in 4 or 5 you win.

It is very scale-able in terms of difficulty. This game has a lot of things going for it.

I have ever only played this solo. I like the claustrophobic nature of this. Every move each marine makes seems like it could make or break your mission. Playing solo (so, with open information for each marine) makes the game much more puzzle like, which I enjoy. The brutality of those die rolls though, that can get brutal. I have had games where I have rolled 8 misses on 8 consecutive die rolls. This is potential trade bait for me as I start whittling down my collection.

Have added a rating after my first two plays, one solo one three player. The game moves at a nice pace, and the tension it creates is very real. it is an enjoyable experience. Time will tell on the POD content, but if FFG lives up to the promise of a good healthy dose of it, this this system will truly shine. Make no mistake its a stellar system, with depth, ease of learning, and simply brutal fun in spades. The framework is more than laid, once more flesh is out there do yourself a favor, and pick this one up! Yes the rating will be revisited, but for now, it needed to be listed.

Fun and intense card game that reminds me of Gears of War, minus the figures. You can tell Corey Konieczka has designed both games. Shame it doesn't have a campaign instead of random set-ups from game to game. Also, I find it easy to forget rules and make mistakes as you play.

Fantastic thematic card game I picked up on a whim. Initially had intended to buy LotR Card Game (but it was out of stock at my FLGS). Glad it was out of stock, as this game will surely provide many hours of tense game play.  Purchased primarily for solo play, but will surely play just as well with multiple players.

Have bought all expansions.  Great value for the price.

01/30/14 - Increased rating (9.25).  After getting the game back out after an extended hiatus, I played it for 4 hours straight...and wanted to keep going.  But you eventually have to eat.

Rating has dropped, although I still love the game.  Quite a few other games now surpass this for the go-to game of choice, but I still pull this one out every now and again.  Love the expansions, and have more than gotten my money's worth on my purchase.

I have only ever played Space Hulk: Death Angel solo.  That was the main reason I bought it, however I discovered that I'm not too much on solo board gaming; I would prefer to play a video game or read a book instead.  That being said, the game mechanics are solid and the action is tense.  One day I will play this game as a co-op.  I think boardgaming is much more enjoyable as a shared experience.  Besides the fact that I'm a gamer (in all forms), I think it's mostly the social aspect that draws me to board gaming.

I've improved my rating since I first posted it. This game seems to get better with subsequent plays, and it is my Space Hulk game of choice for reproducing a fairly detailed game enviroment in a small amount of space. It's a small table cooperative game that also has a great solo play mode. One thing though... the game is HARD to beat!

Good solo/coop cardgame. It boils space hulk down to the bare essentials and captures the spirit of that game amazingly well. The fact that it does so with a few cards and at a fraction of the costs is a big bonus. Game is hard to win and a bad die roll at the wrong moment can be devestating. Planning and communication are the prerequisites to survive. Cards are of fair quality but I would recommend sleeving if you plan to play a lot.

I've played solo a few times.  It does a good job of having the cramped feeling of investigating a derelict space ship overrun by monsters.
The rules aren't too complex.  The action cards add a nice variety of actions.  The location and event cards keep the game feeling fresh with each play.  The fact that you can't perform the same action twice in a row keeps the game from being purely tactical.

I've done two coop games: 2 player and 3 player.  The 3 player was long and seemed 'easy'.  The 2 player was shorter (about 45 minutes) and semeed 'hard'.

The game is very luck driven.  And the '30 minutes' is a lie.  Its a 1 hour game.

I got a 5 player game in.  Still luck driven, but the 'shared experience' of playing the game makes it quite fun.  If you are looking for a game to win/lose then this won't cut it.  If you are looking for an enjoyable way to spend an hour with some friends then it may work for you.

This simplified, abstracted version of the famous board game is tense, atmospheric, and (at times) epic.  Fantasy Flight did an amazing job at capturing the feel of the old game.  Just an all-round fantastic co-op experience.  Honestly, though, after double and triple checking that our group was following the rather obtuse rulebook correctly, the game could be a little more difficult.  Don't get me wrong, it has its absolutely brutal moments, but those are the exception, especially in games with larger groups of people.

I just got this in an auction, and I haven't decided if I really like it that much or not.  I've played a few times, but keep getting my butt kicked solo.  I've played 2p once, and got killed there too.  It keeps me coming back (for now) but if the win percentage doesn't go up, I might just BBQ this and kill all those stupid genestealers in one shot!

RATING: 7.5
In this dice driven card game, you take control over 6 Space Marines from different orders with different specialties. You embark on a mission to fight your way through the narrow spaced corridors of a xeno-infested space hulk. 

The game is actually easy to learn, although I had some troubles getting into it. Once you are acclimatized to the artificial atmosphere, the game runs quite smoothly though. Your Marines can each take one action during your turn. This means you either shift your position in the formation (move), engage some of the xenos (attack) or support your allies. After that it’s the Xenos turn. That part is handled by the game itself.

In the end it is all about managing the phalanx of Astartes: Decimate the enemy, diminish risks and planning headings. One or two bad dice rolls however may lead to a gruesome dead of your squad all too early.

We all know that in the grim darkness of the far future there is only war... and despair. 
No seriously, I would not recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a good time – you won’t find it. Unless you – like me – are looking for a brutal, ceramite hard challenge.
Because if you happen to beat the game, you are entitled to perform your best victory-dance.

I'm going to give this the same rating as Red November as it is about the same game only very different.  I thought the mechanics and against-the-game engine was better in this, but it was much less cute.  The graphic design is actually pretty lousy with all dozen card types looking very similar in their dark overproduction.

It also seamed a little long.  We quit in what was probably less than half-way through, with two marines killed and 3 locations left.

Don't know what I was thinking when I grabbed this, even at a bargain price.  Should have looked at the designer's name and ran.  The man overcomplicates shit for no reason.  Ther rules make the game seem like some kind of supercomplicated abstraction instead of the carnage fest that Space Hulk should be.  I'll eventaully try it out, but I am not at all enthused.

RATING: 3
Not bad for a solo game, if I'm not craving something heavy. 

Quick set up, it's challenging and it flows well. The theme also comes through, the swarms of genestealers are really well drawn, so it's pretty unnerving as you slowly get surrounded by them.

Unsure if it's something I'd bring out for bigger groups though. I could see it being kind of cool to coordinate actions with one other person...But with 4+, I cant imagine it being that exciting since you'd only have a pick from three abilities

But regardless, seems worth the low price-tag
----

Played a few more times - excitement on the game has certainly dulled because of how easy it is to die at times. Definitely wouldn't bring it out at a game night but it's still fine if I don't want want to commit a lot of time to a game solo

----

Traded it away.

Eventually just had no desire to play it vs other solo games that require more engagement from the player. Finally brought it out for two player play as well...Did not go over well

Ok, so I am no big fan of the Warhammer universe or Ameritrash, and so-so on co-ops.

All that said, this is not a bad game - FF seldom put a foot wrong and this is a perfectly competent, tough co-op with fairly straightforward gameplay and enough variety to make for good replayability.

I am not a big fan of the dice-rolling combat but it would not stop me playing again.

I never played Warhammer 40.000’s tabletop wargame and neither did any of the Space Hulk boardgames: I’m a fan of the setting’s fluff though and I also GM a Dark Heresy RPG group. So when I finally had the chance to try out Death Angel didn’t let this opportunity slip: and I did well, for it’s a great strategy game, despite being just a card game with some die rolls.

What it really excels in though is atmosphere: Death Angel perfectly recreates the feeling of a boarding party entering an enemy-infested ship, facing constant dangers and struggling to succeed in their most holy task. Outnumbered but never outwitted let alone outgone, the characters (being the Emperor’s finest) have plenty of space for individual sacrifices, last stands and a wide array of «let’s push our way and go out of here quickly» situations, which make for a good narrative and an even deeper thematic immersion.

Playing Death Angel is such a rewarding experience that I’m confident my rating will raise even further soon.

Likes:
   - Probably the most thematic card game available
   - Very cool artwork and graphic design on the cards
   - The engine that runs the game is very original and elegant

Dislikes:
   - Runs longer than it probably should
   - The decisions to be made are pretty obvious most of the time.
   - Since its not scenario driven, can feel a bit "Samey" after a few plays (expansions obviously help this a bit).

Notes:
   - The original box is a joke, and if you want to fit this game with any of the expansions + sleeve the cards, time to find a different box.
   - One thing i noticed is that the game play becomes much more interesting if you have previously played the Space Hulk miniatures game

Кооперативная карточная игра от Fantasy Flight Games и Кори Коничка.

События игры проходят во вселенной Warhammer 40k, на "корабле-призраке", вернувшемся в пространство из варпа.

Про Космодесант, зачищающий отсеки корабля от Генокрадов.

В основе заманчивая механика, подстёгивающая с одной стороны обсуждения планов и координацию действий, а с другой - самостоятельность решений. Реализовано тем, что все приказы раздаются картами, а те игроки держат втайне друг от друга. Даже те, что разыгрываются на текущий ход.

Выйдет этим летом.

This is the type of coop where the louder players can run the show and the quieter guys don't really play their own turns. That's not good.

Terribly written rules, too many components that don't add to the game, obscene length, intensely high luck factor.  Why would you need a special die to determine randomness in a CARD GAME?  I could swear there's some other thing they could have used to determine random outcomes, maybe something that they already have in the box... why, they could even have a couple hundred in the box!  This is quite possibly the Ameritrashiest card game in existence.

RATING: 8
This is one my favorite solo games and hits the table more than any other of that category. I feel there are much better co-ops available, but really this shines best as a solo experience which is a rare thing. Ghost Stories might make for a good comparison. While gamers I respect love Ghost Stories, though, I do not; it seems like a puzzle which  presents situations which might be resolvable though it's not clear when they are or not. Death Angel is a difficult game to win and there are puzzle elements, but the theme coheres to the experience much more satisfyingly in my opinion. The puzzle elements in Death Angel really do smack of tactical decisions. The strategic decisions really do present you with choices to attempt risky gambits or try to open a couple more doors, hoping there aren't swarms waiting for you on the other side. It's no small thing to have pulled this off in a solo game that is so simple and brief.

Don't let the warnings of the bad rulebook scare you off. It isn't great, but it, combined with perhaps checking a couple of rules on BGG, is manageable. Once you have your first game completed, you'll never end up having to look at it again anyway as the game really is so easy to play. Death Angel is a real gem for solo play.

Update: It's down to an eight for two reasons. The evil of the game I find is better done with Ghost Stories and the quick solo play is better done with Friday. Still, it's definitely a keeper an one I look forward to playing when I want a little more theme and a short solo game.

Initial rating, need to play it more.

Wow, this gives the feel of Space Hulk (from the marines perspective) without all the setup - and painting :)

It's tactical - you have to mostly decide what problem needs sorting now, or what you can best do given your terminators position in the line. But that's fine, its a short card game, and when I play Space Hulk it feels just as tactical when playing the marines.

I really like the unknown exploration feel of moving through the locations and the effects introduced with the event cards.

Overall, like it, alot

Very nice little game.
To me it gave perfect sense of being in a claustrophobic space ship surrounded with alie..err.. genestealers :)

I love the dice mechanism for combat: tough it can sometimes kill your marines very fast, it can also happen that your last space marine kills a lot of genestealers and claim victory :) .. 

It is much easier to play with more marines, but it's a bit hard when all people don't quite get mechanisms of a game, so they do crappy moves which makes your team lose.. so it's a bit hard not to try to tell them what's the best move they can do.
Since move+activate can mess up other marines actions, it's a bit hard to play without telling other players what you want to do..

In the end I think this game has very nice mechanic which could be almost an abstract..

Otro juego descubierto gracias a Marc.
Se trata de un juego de cartas ambientado en el mundo de Warhammer 40.000. Es puramente colaborativo. Cada jugador controla uno o varios equipos de marines espaciales, que deben recorrer pasillos de una nave hasta llegar al destino final. Durante su trayecto, deben hacer frente a los alienígenas que salen por todas partes. En su turno, cada jugador debe escoger una acción para cada equipo. Hay tres acciones disponibles: mover y activar, apoyar, o atacar. 
Es un juego de cartas completamente diferente a lo uno puede estar acostumbrado. LAs cartas actúan como si fueran figurillas. El juego te mantiene en tensión, porque los Genestealers no dejan de aparecer. Además, es bastante rápido.

Fun little co-op game with a good amount of theme. The different squads have some nice variation and you grow attached to certain members of the squad. The moments where you pull off something incredible are high-five moments and when something disastrous happens you want to bury your face in your hands. Combat is devastating!

There are a fair amount of decisions and lots of teamwork. The mechanics are simple yet work well and for what it is (and how inexpensive it is) it is a pretty good game! Plus it can play 1-6 players so that's pretty sweet.

I really enjoyed my only play (all space marines were killed by two progenie leaders in the last room) as there were some truly epic/hilarious moments. The designer has surprisingly managed to recreate the tension of the original Space Hulk. Unfortunately, most of the eurogamers I play with do not appreciate Ameritrash games as much as I do, and as a result this game will hardly hit the table.

A great co-op, one where you can (and need to) actually talk about what to do as a group to succeed. You also need to take as it's pretty difficult and there is a lot of luck involved, which makes it exciting.

Also very thematic: the space marines fighting through a narrow corridor, being attacked from all sides, only a few survive to make it to the control panel giving them a chance to blow the whole thing up before being overwhelmed...

Only the rule book is abysmal.

I like this game, but I don't think I'll ever win it, and it's not as likely to hit that table as something similar with bits.  If it was a board game I'd play it more.

Not *quite* as good as the full out game (obviously) but this is still very fun. At first I thought I'd be frustrated by so many things coming down to a single 50/50 die roll but it actually works really well and keeps the tension up. There is a lot of game in this small box.

The real reason I don't like this game much is the EXTREME DIFFICULTY of winning this game. Some people love this about the game (and about Robinson Crusoe and Ghost Stories). If you like that in a game, this one is small and portable and full of theme. But be prepared to lose ... a lot ... really I mean it a REAL LOT.

Challenging and fun. This is not the sort of game I would seek out, but I picked it up from a clearance sale, and I really like it. It's the first co-op I own that I actually play solo with satisfaction. I've won two of my first ten games (one of which was solo, and the other 3-player with 3 combat teams and Void Lock 1).

UPDATE after 33 plays: This game has no right to be so much fun. I now have the first three expansions, and the thing has gotten me to read a bunch of WH40K fiction.

This little game doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves. I've played this dozens upon dozens of times with non-gamer friends at work on breaks or between shifts and almost every time there are cheers or anguished moans. Once in a while the tension is so high that it sets the tone for the entire rest of the workday. 

This isn't one to try to judge too seriously. This is a travel sized kinda Space Hulky experience that can be set up and played and put away again in fifteen to twenty minutes. That something like this exists and manages to deliver excitement with any degree of regularity is pretty awesome. It shouldn't be held to the standards of bigbox games.

Very fun, challenging co-op. The theme does nothing for me, but the game play is stressful and exciting. I like how the game changes as you begin to lose marines: on one hand, the game becomes much harder because you have more aliens per character to deal with, but the smaller number of marines means that they're easier to maneuver and control. It's awesome when you're able to pull off a narrow victory after losing an entire team earlier in the game. 

Despite the BGG stats, I'm not as crazy about the solo game, just because I find three teams to be too much to manage by myself. The two-player game is great, because you have just enough control over your own men for it to not be overwhelming/confusing, but coordinating the timing and actions with the other player is a real challenge. I don't think I'd like this with more than three people, however, especially with the elimination aspect.

RATING: 7
Good co-op game.  The rules are simple and the action is quick.  The first few plays are enjoyable but after a while it gets somewhat boring seeing the same cards come up.  It is a small card game, so I guess that is to be expected.  Obviously expansion decks would help with this.  

Another criticism I have is that it often feels like the game is "on rails".  The best decision for the group is usually somewhat easy to figure out, so it feels like you are just going through the motions of playing the game.  I suppose that applies to all co-op games to some extent, but it feels more pronounced to me in Death Angel - possibly because it is such a small, compact game with simple rules...there aren't that many decisions to make or unique tactical situations that arise.

Uses cards to feel like a boardgame.  I'm not hot about the theme, but the mechanics work well together and make reasonable abstractions for sake of component simplicity.

Quick game for people that love the theme of Warhammer 40k.  The challenge level is high, and the corresponding frustration.  But it is a Space Hulk game, so you control a small, elite team of individuals against a swarm of bad guys in a derelict spaceship.

RATING: 5
Space Hulk: Death Angel is a cooperative card-based game set in the heavily themed Warhamer universe. As someone who doesn’t play a lot of co-ops, who doesn’t enjoy many card games, and who generally despises science fiction themes, this was certainly not a well-made match. Despite my initial skepticism, I was pleasantly surprised by the game itself. 

One of the primary problems of co-operative games is that they tend to result in obvious decisions. Players approach those games as a bugger-like hive mind and view individual turns as interchangeable tools to advance the common good. Well-known complaints, such as that of the overbearing leader, are really just manifestations of this problem. Death Angel manages to do away with much of that difficulty by introducing both player elimination and simultaneous, secret action selection. Of course, those mechanics introduce their own problems. But giving players incentives to act in divergent self-interests and asking restoring the significance of the individual turn through simultaneous individual decisions is a neat innovation. 

The actual gameplay is procedural, fiddly, and about as far from thematic as games get. Still, it packs a decent number of semi-tough decisions into a short, panic-filled game. The game seemed perfectly designed to allow us to just scrape by until the final moments, when it overwhelmed us with swarms of some sort of death-eating science monsters. Or something. It was all black and purple splotches to me.

I love and hate this game, an oxymorn.  The game is a fusion of modern elegance and dated mechanics.  

The game has no difficulty setting like other Pandemic or Lord of the Rings.  There a steep strategy learning curve, more like a wall where most people will win out sheer luck.  However once you read the great strategy guide, Death Angel Complete Guide by Nano (Friman), the game is too easy.  The guide in bgg files section.

The AI, the script that controls the environment and the Genestealers are modern and so clever, yet there is player elimination like an Ameritrash from the 80's, is baffling.      

How bitter sweet...

This would be a great thirty minute game. The limited choices, the way you can play with just a general idea of what the other player is doing (always played two player), the special abilities, the instinct cards that force a player to make a decision without consulting the other.

Unfortunately, the game is so fiddly (moving aliens, setting up the rooms, moving the cards around every turn, it just takes sooo long) that unless we die in the first couple of rooms, it goes on for over an hour. And it's not good enough to sustain an hour of play.

Not horrible and my rating might go up if it played in anything close to the 30 minutes stated on the box. The rules didn't help much. Answers to questions were not easy to find. I am not a fan of GW / W40K, nor of co-operative games. The face left / face right simplicity of the decisions didn't evoke an 'Aliens' type of theme for me. Maybe I just don't have the imagination to be able to enjoy card games when they attempt to represent maps.

This is a fast, brutal, and very tense card game for 1-6 players. Very thematic, and the artwork on the cards is great. 

My only major gripe is that the rulebook is very poorly laid out considering how easy it is to play the game.

A smaller issue is the replayability factor. Yes, there are POD expansions available through Fantasy Flight's website, but unless you're really into the core mechanic of the game (aliens spawn around/beside you, you shoot them, rinse, repeat) they're not likely to add much replay value.

I like the tension here and the theme is actually quite impactful. Your "brothers" can die at any time, which makes me feel like we are really on a suicide mission.

The cards work well with each other and I like how locations can provide you meaningful and tough decisions (i.e. chance sacrificing one of your few guys to maybe help a desperate situation).

I still need to play this non-solo - not sure how it will work with more players.

Holy crap, what a blast. Played two in a row. First was a solo game that I won with ONE marine left. Pretty sure he bought it moments after I reached my goal--he was surrounded. 
Second game was a miserable ass kicking, playing coop with my nephew. He's a Warhammer 40K fan. He loved it.
Third game was a win played with my old MTG buddy. He also loved it. 
It's great having a badass solo game that other people can easily pick up. Plus, the theme really pulls you in.

A game that turned out to be a lot more fun than I had anticipated! What I really like about Death Angel is that even though the game is pretty hard, I rarely feel as if the game itself is at fault - giving me bad luck or overwhelming odds. Even IF I end up having all my Space Marines killed and not being able to fulfill the mission, I still always have a lot of fun TRYING to beat the game and feel the urge to give it another go and prove to myself that I CAN do it!

I bought it because I wanted something to remind me of the old DOOM computer game.  I'm not disappointed.

This will have the same problems that plague a lot of co-op games - they can be very easy or very hard, though very easy is a relative term.  The rules are rather lengthy, but intuitive once you get in the flow of the game.  There is some risk management in which action you are leaving for subsequent turns, and which marines you put in the most perilous positions.  The decision space could be larger (since there are only two actions available after the first turn for each team), but the game accomplished what it sets out to do.  I will eschew larger dungeon crawls in favor of this little gem for the small footprint of the box alone.

I only play this solo. Love the theme and artwork as always when it comes to the 40k universe. I think the theme comes through quite good even though this is just a card game. Somewhat unforgiving difficulty level, but I don´t mind the challenge personally, genestealers are meant to be badass. The rulebook was not that good, I think the different game concepts was presented in a somewhat messy order and I had some trouble following the gameplay procedures on my first read through. After playing the game it all made sense however.

Whew this is a brutal game. I keep coming back to it despite my abysmal win percentage. I wish it had some mechanic for defense or that it took more than one hit to kill your marines. But it doesn't. As such, an early roll of bad luck can kill a game in a hurry. Also, the marine combos have widely varying degrees of value. Some marine pairs are close to worthless (at least in solo games), while others are "must haves" - that is, if you choose your marines rather than drawing the marine pairs randomly as per the rulebook.

Overall, a good game if you can set your expectations (regarding a win percentage) very very low.

Originally bought it as a step up from "Munchkin" for me and my three sons to play. Slightly too complex and "serious" for them yet...however, what a great solo game - I have played it every night for about a week now, managed 1 win out of 5 - tense setting (as I remember the board game from years ago), great components, fun is a "go-down-fighting" way. 

I agree the rulebook could be laid out a little better, and can see that without the expansions it may become repetitive in the future - a few more varied terrain or end-game cards wouldn't have gone astray. But for now, this is a solid, excellent, and addictive tactical solo card game - a keeper.

Only one play with many interruptions, so grain o salt here, but it doesn't look like this one is for me.  The simple co-ops just don't feel at all worth it.  Don't know if this is any reflection of the game or just my preferences.  Seems put together nicely, and I'll definitely give it another couple of tries, but c'mon ... one occasional six-sided die roll?!
Seems like DA might be "8" as a solo game and "4" otherwise.  I give it a "6".  Yay!

March 2014 - finally played solo. Like it more now. Just needed a different mindset when approaching it. 

December 2015 - frustrating. 

May 2016 - distills the boardgame without losing the tension. very replayable, especially with the four expansions. perfect 10. was an idiot for blasting DA years ago.

Pretty good game although my first game ran a bit longer than I would have expected. Repeated plays will hopefully be a bit faster.

I am not a big fan of Warhammer 40K universe but the theme suits the game well. (rating +1) The 4 player game (8 marines) feels right: a squad of space marines rushing through a space hulk exterminating hordes of aliens, which threaten to overrun the squad. In solo games (6 marines) the pace is slower (and somewhat less thematic, IMHO): it takes noticeably longer to clear a location. However, slower pace allows more maneuvering. You have to accept, though, that regardless of the number of players, there is much randomness in the game: the best tactical plans can be ruined by a few bad rolls or unlucky draw of an event card. There isn't much that you can do to mitigate the risks. That said, I do not find the game too difficult: so far, marines have won more often than lost. Also, randomness should ensure that the game remains  fast and chaotic instead of being paralyzed by deep analysis. (I am thinking of introducing a sand timer to further reinforce the effect. :devil:) The game has nice components. The only complaint I have is that the art on genestealer cards is a bit too dark. (This does not affect gameplay, though.) I wish there was more more variety to the game, for instance, genestealers are bit too generic. Like all true co-ops the game is prone to be dominated by the most experienced player. The game plays very well in solo mode (I would rate the game 8 as a solo game).

After many years on the shelf, I gave a new try to this game in solo mode.
Good surprise ! The mixed feelings I had previously have now disappeared !
After re-discovering the rules, I have to admit it is a very clever design, faithful to the the original material.
It is true that the luck factor is still high, but I feel more confortable with it, realizing that SP: DA is not the chaotic game I had in my memories. The luck factor can be mitigated (I don't say "controlled" at purpose...) by fine analysis of your assets and clever management of the probabilities. Indeed this is true for all the good games dealing with luck. 
This fresh look makes me realize that I'm probably a far better player now than I was at the time of my first review. 
But as a result, I'm now regretting not to have bought the few cheap existing expansions. 
Due to the end of FFG/GW deal, we are too exposed to the boardgame speculators to get a copy at a fair price !!! Too bad.

This is a pretty tight distillation of a warhammer type experience in a portable, single player package. It's fun for what it is, my only complaint is that setup is kind of involved and I can't see it being that much fun multiplayer.

I enjoyed this little fellow from the beginning. 
I have a copy of Space Hulk on my Shelf and Death Angel really captures the feel of desperation when the genestealer-player has you outmaneuvered and cornered.
Fast setup, fast play and a very though nut to crack. Well worth the price of admission no matter the player-count.

I admire that the author has managed to condense the feel of the 'real' SH into a card game. Death Angel feels just like its big brother, is just as tight. A wonderful solo game in a box that finally isn't too big for the components.

Components: There are way too many similar-looking components on the table for what the game delivers. This is a prime example of a game that obfuscated itself by trying to make all the components a deck of cards. The marines in the middle (who are all basically indistinguishable from each other) should be miniatures, as should the genestealers. The location cards should just be square tiles. There needs to be better color coding between the marines and their action cards; I could not tell yellow from orange to save my life (oh, wait, they all died).

Also, there is too much information spread out over the board in the form of text, between my own action cards, those of my teammates, that of the location cards, and the room card. At any given time I had no idea what the capabilities of my fellow teammates were.

Experience: There are some very clever mechanisms at play here. Thematically, I enjoy how we're all just marching through the room in a single column. The 'facing' aspect is interesting, as is the alternating choices to support, move, or attack. The location cards are cool.

But the game is very mechanical. Every round contains basically two decisions (in a three player game): which action cards to play. The rest of the activity is laborious to perform, but without being fun or tense to watch unfold.

A fun game that can make you bite your nails! Knowing that the baddies are right there but there is nothing you can do and must rely on your Brothers to keep them off of you makes for some tense moments. I love the components as they simply fell out of the sprue(or whatever the proper name for the waste cardboard is) and are nice and heavy, almost plywood like. 
-But-
The rules are a bit tedious, a limited number of examples and a complete lack of a comprehensive card marking chart had me scratching my head a few times.

This game is fairly complex. There's a lot to pay attention to. No room for socialization here. It's all game. It is a co-operative game so there is interaction, but I'm just not impressed with it. I'd play it again, but won't suggest it.

RATING: 9
An abstracted version of the Space Hulk board game. Nicely scales from 1-6 players, and gives everybody something to do (ie, 'decisions to make') on each turn. Cooperative play is a must to win the game, however if everybody does work together, it isn't too tough to win.

RATING: 7
Plays quick, co-op, well-themed, really fun -- elements of Galactica (same designer) contained herein -- excellent effort.

Initial rating 9 drops to 7. The game is certainly replayable, but lacks pizzazz -- probably needs either more variety to its cards/encounters, or an extra mechanic or two. I will be surprised if it's not expanded.

Great solo game for some down time. Works nicely for co-op play too, but I generally prefer playing against other players.

Edit 2012. After more play I find this to be my favourite solo game at the moment. An unusually well designed game by FFG that provides a lot of tension for the player. When you win it seems to always be on your last marine in a desperate gamble. I would only advise it as a solitaire game though, multiple players add little to the game dynamic unlike other co-op games.

My first real "card" game, and I'm still impressed by how closely a set of cards can simulate a full board game.

If only there was a way to mitigate your losses.

To start, I love the 40k universe.

I have only played this as a solo game. From that perspective, it's a fun and clever game. I'm impressed by how much the designer's were able to do with just a few cards. So far I've only won twice - the difficulty is punishingly hard, at least for me. It's a good game but not a favorite.

Co-op game of surviving die rolls and making successful die rolls. Yes, it felt that bland and dull to me.

[2011-03-07 Rating: n.a. -> 8.8]

Space Hulk: Death Angel (SHDA) caught me by surprise. I never played Space Hulk before and so the announcement of SHDA left me somewhat cold. This was until I saw it for a few bucks online and read a review of it to see if it is worth the money. Boy, was I lucky that I did so that day. Otherwise I would have missed a novel and clever game which, and this is it's biggest bonus, is a great solo experience.

Within SHDA you and your friends control teams of Space Marines that try to survive in a Space Hulk fighting of hordes of Genestealers. To win the game, you have to traverse a set number of rooms and fulfill a winning condition in the last room. This sounds easier than it is in reality. But it is even fun to lose in this game, as each round is really tense.

The great thing about this game is the clever approach that designer Corey Konieczka took. While I find that some of his game contain too many mechanics that detract from the main game, this one feels perfect mechanicswise: Each turn, you play one action for each team from a fixed set of three available actions. The action you played in one round can't be played again in the next round. While this doesn't sound like there is a lot to decide on a given turn, each of the actions comes with a special ability that breaks the rules in some way or another. And these special abilities are what makes the game so great. Each round you have to think of a clever way to combine them so that you won't get slaughtered.

Another great decision of Mr. Konieczka was the abandonment of a map. By the use of the formation, he got rid of all the complex stuff like Line of Sight. Instead, each Genestealer can only be in front or behind any given Space Marine. With a quick glance at the formation, you know everything you need to know to make an informed decision about which action to play. There aren't any unnecessary mechanics that detract you from the main course of the game.

Then there is also some luck in form of a die. Sometimes your best laid plans will get screwed by a bad die roll. But the more I played this game, the more ways to prevent these situations revealed themself to me. It's the clever use of your support tokens and the special abilities of your Space Marines that will save your day.

To sum it up, this is really a clever, novel and great coop-game. Even better, it is a great solo experience and this is the way, I play it most of the time. And the best thing about SHDA is it's low prize.

The clever design (game-mechanics) gets the most out of this little card game. Fast moving enemys and  locations (yes i am talking about a card game), the quickly raising threat and the cooperative game-style doing their best, to help you find into the scenery. Although there are just some cards on the table, this suspenceful game makes you somehow feel with your mission and your combat teams, especially when the row of marines begins to shrink and the enemys keep comming from all sites! FOR THE EMPEROR! :)

Perhaps a bit better than I thought it might be. Captures the chaos and desperation of the theme very well. As the player it would be good if you had a little more control and slightly more variety of choices, but hey for a small game in a small box it packs a lot in. The choices and decisions you do have to make do make a difference, and you have to be quite precise how you play (and lucky) to have any chance of winning.

Rating may udge up slightly with more play if it stands repeated plays and if they add some expansions to it.

A good effort.

One gripe however - for something that is relatively simple in terms of rules, the actual rule book leaves something to be desired. I was continually flicking through from one section to another to find information about a specific topic which was spread across a number of sections rather than being in one place. 

Played a bit more and udging my rating up - it does succeed at generating a lot of tension and can be very immersive.

A solo/cooperative card game based on the classic Space Hulk boardgame.  Players represent squads of Space Marines, creeping through a hulk trying to accomplish a scenario objective.  Quite straightforward game - players play a card to issue an order to their pair of marines - support, move, attack.  Orders are resolved in order, game controlled genestealers attack, then more come out to play.  Clever game - certainly tried hard to recreate the "feel" of Space Hulk in a card game format - ultimately however it's quite dull and repetitive, while the parent game is a white knuckled, teeth gnashing, anguish fest.  This game is also let down by a truly awful rulebook - such a simple game explained in a totally convoluted manner.  Still, if you can't get Space Hulk, this is worth a look.

Why 10 for me ? 

because its 
- Space Hulk and Warhammer 40K 
- Portable and in very small package (even with expansions)
- Tense and scary because of dangers in just 1 dice roll
- Strategy play much here, not just run and gun.

Why it might be not for you ? 
- Its 1 dice based combat to decide attack and defend
- new players confused with the basic rules
- Not many people use strategy to alleviate randomness
- if you hate warhammer 40K 

a great game that need some time to adjust before you can enjoy it

a challenging co-op game, but devoid of the things that make a tactical game. And the best ways to win are not about guts and risk management, they are about exploiting procedures. Lacking in fun.

Need more plays to decide where it eventually falls.  Instinct mechanism is great and should be used in more co-op games.  Marine team abilities are different and interesting enough that they matter for your overall strategy.

A fast and deadly combat between space marines and the alien Genestealers.  While it is a card game in the literal sense of "you play using cards", the actual gameplay is far more akin to a board game, as you maneuver your marines around their formation and shoot the genestealers they are engaged with.

Pretty fun, but has the flaw that most co-op games have. Set up is too random, so games can be anywhere from dead easy to crazy, ridiculous hard.

RATING: 8
Fun, cooperative and thematic. You lead a squad of space marines through sections of a space hulk, fighting off waves of baddies as you go. There's a fair bit of luck involved with dice rolling and card randomisation, however strategy comes from deciding which squad will perform which action per turn (move, attack or support), using special abilities and planning ahead. 

People have complained about the poor manual, however I had no issues learning how to play the game.

One thing I love in games is theme, and this game has a lot of it. Plays well solo. Highly recommended!

This does an okay job of capturing some of the flavor of the Space Hulk board game, but is by no means a substitute (nor does it claim to be).   The presentation is a bit more colorful and cartoony than the dark gothic setting should be, but that's a general problem with FFG's presentation of all the GW properties.   The game play is very simple - each player has a pair of marines who can select one of three actions each turn:  Move/Activate, Attack, or Support.   Actually, you cannot choose the same action on two consecutive turns, so you really only have 2 choices each turn.   The rest of the game plays itself, and that's the main problem.    I'm generally not a fan of co-op games (and the auto-play is one of the main reasons), so your mileage may vary.   The price point is about right.

Don't let the awful rule book put you off!  Use Universal Head's E.O.O.G summary instead (found in the files section: 
 https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59380/universal-head-space-hulk-death-angel-rules-summar).  The game gives you that Space Hulk feel, but you can play with more than 2 players down too solo play, love it.
Would add that there's no way this is a 30 minute game with more than 1 players.

RATING: 9
What this game manages to capture is the theme of the original Space Hulk pretty perfectly. That feeling of tightness, of never being exactly where you want to be. That feeling of trying to balance a house of cards just long enough against the pressure until the whole thing comes crumbling in and knowing that every single loss makes it that much closer to collapse. The downside is that in order to create that feeling there's a bit of gamy elements like not being able to shoot every turn and a very abstract facing and spacing element. Personally I think it works best as a solo game myself and there are other group co-ops I'd rather play.

Surprisingly fun as a co-op.  It's got a tiny footprint and great artwork.  As a solo game it's also fun and much harder imo.  Theme might not be everyone's cup of tea but the gameplay is solid enough to win most over. 2 and 4 player count is my favorite setup for this game.

Great card game (not a boardgame).
I like the linnen card texture.
The tokens are not really needed, never punched them out, prefer to use my plastic tokens.
Pity the rules do not clearly explain it all, you have to dig to get fundamental info.
The game is scalable and well done for solo play.
There are important strategy decisions to make every turn.
Maybe the best solo game out there (much better than those higher rated here) if you can cope with losing; and losing; and losing again.

For such a small box, there is so much to this game.  Very well designed.  At the end of my first game, I had one space marine remaining trying to fend off the hordes of genestealers coming from four locations until he was ripped to shreads.  Really captures the Space Hulk feel in a small card game.

RATING: 6
A fun coop card game that delivers on the Space Hulk theme. Each player plays a pair of marines all lined up in order (this is Space Hulk after all) in order to travel through several locations and make their way out. The Genestealers appear in random order and position relative to your line so you all need to coordinate how to use your combination of abilities to combat the threats against you. Sometimes the only way is to sacrifice somebody (which is why you get two dudes, I guess!). The way you can use orders and play cards requires smart play and coordination among the team.

Initially I really did not like this game. The barbaric difficulty left me demoralized. So I shelved it for a few years. This time I read a couple of strategy tips and that made all the difference. Still can be arbitrarily brutal though. I think the issue with my initial distaste was that some of the randomness made it hard to see if decisions I was attempting were of any real use. Liked it so much this time around I went out and bought all of the (now OOP) expansions.

RATING: 7.5
I like the theme, the mechanics are ok for team play and solo, even if I played this mostly solo. It's a bit repetitive on the long run, and often you have to rely more on rolls than on strategy. This is ok since the original space hulk is like this, but I feel a bit more options for the marines would have added to the game.

The instructions weren't the best, but after several reads and an online tutorial I learned to play rather quickly. The game play feels rock solid, while maintaining a gritty and realistic feel. After playing several other solo deck based games, namely Friday, I grew tired of always winning. This game has solved that. It can be very unfair, but with the proper strategy you will make progress. I'm not too big on the card art, personally. But it's growing on me.

I've only made it through a couple of solo plays so far, but I think this is fun. Probably will be more enjoyable when I have everything straight in my head because the two playthroughs took a fair chunk of time. UPDATE: After a few more plays, I am kinda done with this one. It is too relentless and just gets boring after a while.

Update 09-09-2013: I don't know what compelled me to put this on the table again, but I've given it a couple of solo runs recently. It seems to have grown on me. Maybe its my familiarity so that it feels less fiddly? It does a good job of being tense and relentless for a solo game. I don't think I'd like it with another player. Doesn't seem like it would anything to it. Bumped the score up half a point.

My first foray into the world of solo gaming.  This game is tense, difficult, and forces you to make hard decisions.  But it's the type of game that has everyone standing up in excitement throwing the die and cheering when things go your way, or lamenting when they don't.  It's unforgiving at times, but that's really what I like about it because solo/coop games shouldn't be easy.  Also, it comes in a nice compact little package!

I really enjoy this co-operative card game where you are imperial space marines pitted against the hoards of genestealers.

I like that each different marine squad has different abilities (mostly based upon the weapon they carry) but it is a little disappointing that each squad has an affectionately named brother wound. i.e a generic spod. It might have been nice if each marine did something a little special rather than just one of the pair.

I like the facing mechanic and the re-roll ability which applies only if you are facing the gene-stealer attacking you, thus there are a lot of tactics to ensure your marines are positioned in the most effective formation and this doesn't necessarily just mean at the head of the column.

The terrain cards and varying objectives give a lot of replayability and the event card drawn by the player with the lowest initiative each turn is nice, I especially like the events where you must decide what is going to happen before you show everyone else the card .i.e you have to pick the squad the card will effect without discussing it with the group.

With a group that can work together well you can mitigate the luck of the die roll and maybe your marine will even survive!

I love this game.  It is a challenge to kill all the aliens and you have to accept that you will loose space marines.  It is a hard game.  It is not only that the fighting depends on dice rolling (which I normally dislike in games), but the cards are often particularly bad. I like this as a solo or two player game.  I understand why the rules are in place and find them easy to understand and remember (I do play a lot of games). But the rule book is very hard to read.

Simple, luck is a significant factor, but overall a really fun solo game. Variation comes mainly from the different combinations that suggest themselves using the various combat teams. There are a few minor ambiguities in the rules but nothing serious.

First of all: you will lose. Just accept it and have fun seeing how far you get. (Okay, fine: someone, somewhere, has probably won this game. I don't want to hear about it.)

My favorite way to play this so far is with 2 players, although I'd be happy to try a 4-player game, which would be the same number of Space Marine teams. I like playing solitaire, and our one 6-player game was a disaster. Not sure if we were just incredibly unlucky or if it really is that much more difficult with more teams.

I am still iffy on some of the rules, especially when it comes to the shifting of formations and the moving of Genestealers.

I've tried to like this game but it's just not for me.

I'm not a big dice roller but don't mind a bit of it in games as long as I have methods to mitigate the rolls. Limited re-rolls don't count for this in my book. This game does nearly, maybe, just enough to make me think that I am in control - decisions about which orders to give each turn, special card abilities, gaining additional re-rolls etc. And it's short enough that a few bum rolls don't spoil hours of careful tactics.

I don't mind the difficulty either.I enjoy the theme and the stories that can develop within the game. I had started to think of some of my marines as individuals, not just another card. For example, Sergeant Lorenzo is a f**king beast after the stand he made in one particular game.

What I'm not comfortable with is the event cards. The genestealer spawns are fine - the colour coding shows how likely they are to spawn at a location so you can priortise - but the actual events themselves feel a bit "Community Chest". I've spent two turns positioning my marines to cover every slot on each side...pull event....awwwww, every genestealer has now just flanked! Absolutely nothing I could do about that. I can't even be reasonably expected to guard against the chance that this 'may' happen in any one particular game.

And the rulebook sucks. You're constantly jumping around to try and work out what a turn involves. Classic FFG :) The game is quite straight forward but the rulebook makes it seem so complicated.

As I hoped, this is a tight cooperative game which pits your characters against evil monsters of a kind. The setting is a huge space ship in the Far Future. Could as well be a medieval battlefield or ships on the Spanish Main - personally, I would have preferred such settings. 

Death Angel also is an elegant design, and I didn't really expect that. A single die is used quite ingeniously for two types of combat (attack and defense work differently) including all special abilities. It is abstract and feels thematic a the same time. The monsters are just stacks of cards, they don't even have stats - but are terrifying nevertheless. Locations differ only in limited features, some have a corridor and some a dark corner, most have a door and some a computer panel ... and still they feel more different than the rooms in many dungeon crawlers.

This game is an excellent design.

The rulebook makes this one seem hard to play than it is.  It is essential a resource management solitaire game (exactly what I wanted from it).  It manages to keep a lot of the Space Hulk theme.  It is clear to me that Corey designed this after playing SH, not before.  The theme is integral to the mechanics.  It is hard, for sure.  I will definitely be pulling this out to play solitaire, but I doubt that I will ever play it full coop with a larger group.

One of my favourite solo games! (Even though this plays with up to 6). Very tense and thematic. Sure, battles usually come down more to the roll of the die than I'd like them to, but I think there are enough card effects to slog it through. Bit of a convoluted rule-set, but relatively straightforward once you get going.

I'm rating this primarily as a solitaire game.  I wouldn't enjoy this co-op, and seriously doubt my game group would either.  Even with the rule of not showing your hand, this is a game that is too prone to Alpha Player syndrome, or else everyone is just going to die horribly.  Also, with player elimination, whoever is first to lose their squad is going to sit out the rest of the game.  Games are fairly quick, though, but that's still an issue for a co-op game (Co-ops that have EVERYONE lose or win together, are what my family and group tend to prefer).  However, it's been quite enjoyable as a quick solitaire experience.  It will grow old fast, though.  In fact, after 2 weeks straight of solid play, it's already beginning to wear a bit thin.  Definitely going to have to pick up the Mission Pack.

The rulebook is the worst excuse for a "Choose your own adventure" novel that I have ever come across.  Page 7 tells you turn to page 25, page 8 might tell you to turn to page 16, so on and so forth.  I almost trashed this game because of the rulebook.  I stuck with it though, and found that the game mechanics were EXTREMELY simple.  It's a shame the rulebook is the worst I have ever seen.  I can't even being to imagine how many people it's turned off to the game.

First game, I didn't get out of the Void Lock.  I was one blip card away, but got swarmed and lost most of my marines in one round.  Initial reaction to the game is that it's a bit complex to learn, but once you get going, it's fairly simple.  The difficulty of winning, though, seems enormous; that's good in a solo game.

Second game solo I got much farther. Almost made it to the third and last set of location cards.

Based off only one play so far.

This game is great! The decisions, despite being limited to "pick between two cards" are still involved and interesting. The difficulty seems at a sweet spot: not impossible, but hard to make you sweat for your wins.
The wife enjoyed it, and the entire game, including rules explanation, set-up, and some rule look-ups, took only 1 hour. I figure future plays will be more in the 25-45 minute range (depending on how long we survive).
Fun game, and for the price you can't beat it!

UPDATE - Has lost some of its luster, but I still enjoy breaking it out for a solo game fairly frequently.

Excellent solitaire game, plays in about 30 minutes, takes surprising amount of table space to spread out your formation.  Its supposed to multiplayer but I don't see the point at all.  Very challenging, the game is made more excellent if you've played Space Hulk, as it takes a lot of what happens in that game and translates it rather successfully in to a card based game.  The rules are easy to get into and the gameplay is extremely tactical and situation changes drastically from game to game and supplies good replayability.  I got all the expansions for these, most of which just adds more of the same, but adds to the replayability.  Highly recommended.  I am giving this one an 8 out of 10.

Like it, don't love it.  Very difficult.  It is an impressive package---it actually meets that elusive "Could carry it around anywhere and play it in 30 spare minutes" criteria.

Big edit:
Keep playing this.  Your first 3 games will be too mechanical and take too long, but you play more than that and the game will go very quickly and you will just absolutely love it.  The way it highlights a single twist of a special marine and boils your decisions down into a compact 3 card decision matrix is divine.

I prefer this game as a solo game. It brings on the tension of an Aliens-type horde attacking a small group of marines from multiple sides. It is horribly difficult. I believe I've only ever won scenarios in which you have to push the button! Once one or two of your marines die...it's only a matter of time before the horde builds and they drop like flies.

Thematically great (like Space Hulk)...mechanically though, there aren't a whole lot of options. 3 per squad. And since you can't use the same squad action twice in a row...it's more like 2.

Multiplayer, this suffers from the alpha player syndrome. You're not supposed to tell others your actions. You're supposed to develop a sense of coordination through practice I suppose...but still...it's aggravating letting somebody do something that is not complimentary to what you are going to do.

Like 'Warhammer: Invasion', I could explain how to play this game to a new player in a tiny fraction of the time it'd take them to wade through the rules. Does someone at FFG get paid by the word?

But seriously, this is a fast, mean little game. Those space marines look tough in all their armor and such, but they are all sorts of screwed as soon as they set foot on this Space Hulk. What would possess them to go on board that thing? Couldn't they just nuke it? Plow it into some large hunk of whatever? Turn around and go home?

It's plenty random, light weight and the perfect thing for when I'm just itching to beat something up...or die horribly trying.

I own the game and the first two expansions, and I've put a serious amount of play time into this. It's simple enough that new players can understand the rules after 2 rounds or so, it doesn't take up too much space, and it's all played in a manageable time. On top of this, there's a lot going on in every play through, and it works surprisingly well as a solitaire game.

The mechanics match the theme well: every round, an overwhelming number of genestealers spawn in, and you must choose your actions carefully in order to survive. Do you want to attack and try to diminish their numbers, therefore making the defensive dice rolling easier? Or do you want to support a squad mate, which basically is like giving him an extra life for when the genestealers attack? Or do you want to interact with your current room's unique environment, which generally has some fairly interesting effects? To make your decision even more interesting, each of these basic actions comes with a special ability unique to the squad you're playing. Each decision drastically changes the game - there's no 'fluff' here, which is why I gave this game such a high rating. The amount of strategy and substance packed into such a short gameplay time is impressive. There's a LOT of strategy in hand management and card selection here - partly due to the fact that you have a very limited hand of cards to choose from, and once you use an ability, you have to wait a turn to use it again.

Genestealers pile up very quickly. They follow you between rooms, meaning that every time you fail to kill some by the end of the round they spawn in, you have that many more to worry about at the end of the next round - and the more genestealers that are left, the less likely you are to survive. It's when you're outnumbered by genestealers ten to one that the game really shines; you'll risk your best squad member by blowing up a promethium tank, taking out all genestealers he's engaged with, but risking his life in the process. You'll sacrifice squad mates left and right in mad attempts to achieve the game's unique win condition (which is different every game).

If your squad survives, they will generally do so by the skin of their teeth, with just one or two of your original team left. Obviously, because the game relies heavily on dice rolling, there will be some games where you steamroll the genestealers and there will be some games when you're wiped out a quarter of the way through the facility. But these games are still entertaining (the losing ones more so than the winning ones) and when you have a really close game it's like striking gold.

The game does a good job at making you feel overwhelmed, so that when you finally pull through, you feel like a god. Or, at least, a space marine - and that's a great accomplishment for a game of this size, length, and price.

Probably one of the worst I've ever played, I guess I don't really feel the "tension". The rulebook is a thing straight out of nightmares. Lots of "meh" sensations when playing. I don't even care if I lose most of the time, I'm just glad that it's over.

Played my first game the other night.

We held out pretty good until the 3rd location and we all thought we had things under control...

Then came the "They're Everywhere!" event... practically every marine on the board got a Stealer behind him... only one guy had a "Support Token" and didn't get any nasties... but he already had his hands full since the round before.

We did a pretty (considering) decent job cleaning up the mess in our next round, but then the Stealers attacked... And killed four Marines off the bat. Rolling 0's and 1's like crazy.

When we finally got to the last room we had six Marines left... and about a Gazillion Stealer and Two Brood lords.

Actually we didn't even bother to see it trough. It was pretty obivous we had lost, cause even if we killed off 5 or 6 Stealers each round (an impossible feat I might add) they would still kill two marines per round until we were all dead.

So we lost... but as one of the players said: "Oh NOW I recognize this game... the Space Hulk factor just went up by ten!"

Lots of luck is needed to win the game but also a lot of skills. The game can drag for a long time when players do not know the team abilities, but turns into a fast game when everybody knows all the teams.

A lot of synergy is needed to maximize card effects, and there is always more things to do that can actually be done, resulting in tough choices each turn. Hope for the best, plan for the worst, seems to be the key strategy.

The teams are not balanced, so with 1, 2, and 4 players, the game difficulty can be nigh impossible or a walk in the park, depending on which teams are in play.

Packs all the of the theme of Space Hulk into a card game excluding (critically and unfortunately) the shoot-from-the-hip pace of that classic title. It is a good game but quite a bit more "thinky" than Space Hulk, which blows it right out for my usual Space Hulk partner (my eleven-year-old lad). What remains is a good game, but not an especially good game for me. It's a decent solo game, but I'd rather spend my solo time with a historical game. I expect it will play well with adult gamers but who knows when it will hit the table? I docked by review a point for one of those deceptive rulebooks that seems simple when you read it, but proves poorly organized during play. A lot of page flipping during my first game of what is at heart a pretty simple (but clever) design, and several questions remained unanswered even after the first play. A near miss now that may grow into something more as my lad's gaming tastes mature.

Based on one play. The game looks very good but I don't know if it has much replaying value. 
But first impressions are, well, first impressions. So this rating may go up or down with further plays. ;)

UPDATE
Played again tonight with a friend. I was surprised that there were indeed significant choices to make and puzzles to resolve. Cooperation is of essence!
Was pleased by the change in pace of the game at the end. 
This has grown to a 7.5

UPDATE
I have played this several times this period and I'm appreciating the gritty atmosphere that well represents its larger brother. Every turn choices are tough, very good game!

This was recommended to me over the holidays in a forum post in which I asked for dungeon crawl recommendations that I didn't have on my wishlist (I know, I know). It's also a game I would have never even looked at twice had it not been mentioned, and my game life would have never known the fun it was missing.

This game is simple to learn, deceptively so, and do not let the simplicity in execution fool you. It will kill you dead. In fact, my last game ended with a single soldier left alive, five baddies ready to eat his face, three tokens on the final location card, and an activate card played in order to roll. I had been rolling zeroes for what seemed like the last half of the game so we were feeling good about our last chance when...

I rolled a five. A five. A DAMN FIVE. I WOULD HAVE KILLED ALL OF THE BAD GUYS WITH THAT ROLL. 

*head thump* *much laughter* *goes to bed and dreams of rolling like crap*

I managed to snag the last copy of this game at my local shop and the expansions had sold only the week before. I will keep my eyes peeled because this game is just fantastic. Lots of tension, lots of nail biting choices, all wrapped up in a little box and a deceptively simple mechanic. 

Love this game, will be ever grateful for the suggestion to try it.

Never mind the jumbled rulebook.  Go to Death Angel's page, or go to Youtube, and look up the several playthrough videos.  Watch a couple of them.  Then go back and read the rulebook.  It will make much more sense, and you'll be up and running.  This is a really good game.

Often frustrating, occasionally boring, and very occasionally satisfying - despite a 5-10% win rate (seriously), I still pop this in the table from time to time.

For the record, I think it does a sublime job of transferring the Space Hulk experience into a shorter card game. It's actually very impressive, the way it works.

Played Solo.  Fun, and reminds me of Space Hulk for sure.  However, the different "squads" of two were a little awkward and at the end of the game I felt like it was too easy but could easily be too hard without much room in the middle.

As a solo game, this is a mildly tense card game with strong theme. It's annoyingly hard to actually KILL anything, but it makes for a memorable and painful experience. Replayability is good, it comes with different startup scenarios. Looking forward to playing this with multiple players.

RATING: 7
Excellent solo/co-op card game that provides very quick and tense game play in a small box.

Each squad of marines has a unique twist, providing some nice replay value.  My one gripe is that combat success/fail checks come down to a single die roll. Though their is a fair amount of mitigation for a bad result, sometimes that die just hates you and there's no way around it...  

Highly recommend this if you enjoy solo/co-ops and are interested in the Warhammer 40K theme.

I had read good things about this as a solo game, so I decided to give it a try. I actually liked it. I look forward to playing it again by myself.

As for a multi-player game, I think it has potential with the right crowd. Two might be pointless (play Space Hulk instead), four or more might take too long. Three might just be perfect. I can see how it would have that same "doomed" feeling that often accompanies Pandemic, but more fun because you're all trying to waste evil aliens together. 

I will definitely play it again solo, but I also look forward to giving it a try with a couple of like-minded friends.

Missed occasion: the game translates quite well the tension and helplessness of a group of space marines (interesting general organization of the game – and cool art), but ultimately lacks any real decisions: you have to choose between two actions each turn, and most of the time the choice will be really obvious, so it boils down to pure luck: the dice, of course, but also which event cards you drew.

I got this by accident in a recent math trade. I was flagging anything that looked remotely interesting, and I forgot to remove it when submitting my final want list. When I saw that this was what I got I was a little disappointed, but I had read that it's a decent game, so I wasn't crestfallen or anything. When I received it in the mail I was even a little excited, since the prospect of playing a new game always gets me pumped. Of course that was before I knew just how bad SHDA is. At least I only traded Citadels for it.

First off, I can't get past the ridiculous theme. I mean, the Warhammer 40,000 universe is just stupid. It's all skulls and frowns and aliens with long tongues -- like the cover of a fucking Megadeth album. The play is tedious and fiddly. You move these space marines around in a line. For some reason the marines are all named Brother Leon or Brother Spanky or something, so you get a big dose of I-love-you-bro-go-army aesthetic along with the tongue-alien (and did I mention skulls?) artwork. Purple-skinned aliens called "Genestealers" (which sounds scary I guess, but what does that mean? Do they just want a blood sample?) spawn along different parts of the marine line and you fight them by choosing cards that let you do stuff and rolling a die. Then they attack you. Then something happens. They they move. They you draw a card, maybe? Who cares? Don't play Space Hulk! More important: don't fucking recommend Space Hulk! Just a giant turd of a game.

I've played once and have it rated a 6.5. That point five means it falls at either 7 or 6. It was very late at night and although I had read the rules a couple times we were having problems figuring out some of the rules. It seemed fairly hard, which to me was good as I'd like something like this to be challenging.

I love to hate this game. So so hard to win. You MUST read the large strategy guides posted on the BBG page for this game to remotely have a chance. Still, probabilities of death are high, especially in your early games (think 75%). I choose to give my terminators 2 lives so they don't die from a 1 bad die roll. Great game, crappy rulebook and very tense. Mostly a solo game, not really a multiplayer.
This game could really do with a campaign system with experience reward as your teams travel from space hulk to space hulk.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game. The artwork is great, to me the cards are of some of the highest quality I've felt, a pleasure to hold and shuffle. The rule book is fairly well written although it can be a bit to absorb all at once, however once you get through it you realize the rules are very simple. I would LOVE to see an expansion for this game. I also can't wait to play it with some friends!

Edit: After more plays the lack of depth has dropped the score a bit. Still enjoy playing it on occasion, but there are many other games I would play before this hits the table unless I'm really in the mood.

I haven't played it with more than 2 yet, but it sure is a great co-op game. Games tend to be on the long side, though.

Easily my favourite cooperative game. Every game unfolds like an intense sci-fi / horror movie - always epic, always fun - and somehow packed into a tiny box with a cheap price tag (PS: Don't be turned off by the Warhammer theme if that's not your thing: this is about fighting aliens in space and the theme could just have easily been Ridley Scott's Alien).

It's moderately fun, but it feels like a lot of randomness to me. There don't really seem to be many strategies to pursue, it's simply puzzling out what the best thing to do is with the other players. Killing aliens is fun, and I like the different weapons and such, but ultimately they don't seem to affect gameplay much. Take this with a grain of salt as I often have these same complaints with all co-op games.

A fiddly and possibly over-complicated game, very difficult to win! With time the rules might grow more intuitive, and I can imagine some really tense and atmospheric sessions. I doubt it will ever equal Last Frontier: the Vesuvius Incident, though. 

As predicted, rating went up with further play. The play does start to seem less complicated and strategy and atmosphere emerge...

RATING: 7
As far as I see it Death Angel should be played as a solitaire game. Adding more players only muddles the directness as well as the tactics of the game. It's certainly playable with 2 or 3 players, but I wouldn't do it. Certainly NOT with 4 or 5.

No matter how the game goes, slaughter by way of genestealers or a march to victory, it's an always engaging game for 1 player. If you enjoy the theme, at least. Without some liking of the 40K lore it might be a little drab.

Nice production that's very cheap, this is something of a rarity in board game and should be celebrated. Bit heavy on the lucky dice but can build to a tense finale. Good solo too.

RATING: 8
This really is a solo game to me. I've played it cooperatively once, and it was fun, but it was not that much different from solo play, so I'd rather play something else that I can't play solo when I have other players available. But that solo play is rather awesome indeed. And the whole package (including all those POD expansions) is still very portable.

While there is quite some randomness, mostly due to the die rolls, but also because all the carefully laid out plans can get stomped by some unlucky event card draws, there's many things that can influence the randomness:

* The support tokens you get, and where you place them
* How you position the marines
* The special abilities of the combat teams

Particularly those special abilities are neat. While some are rather blunt (flamers and assault cannons do a lot of damage, that's about it), others (like the psyker, or also the power claws and generally the melee teams) are a lot more strategic in nature and really allow for finesse during play.

This is a quite simple and fun game with a very present theme.  This is not the deepest game of strategy available, but it gets extra points for being portable and versatile (1 to 6 players!!!!).
Some of the essence of Spacehulk is captured quite well (swarming aliens, doors, formation...) and it's just a deck of card, but nice to look, inspiring cards.
As usual, the rules could have been written in a more understandable way, but then we have UniversalHead to sort it out.
My rating may decrease after the initial enthusiasm but anyway, this game is an excellent fun per dollar (or euro) ratio.
edit: the problem with this game is that it scales chaotically; the 3/6 players game does not work, and the solo game, despite lacking the coop aspect, is my favourite.

Quite large for a card game. Area-wise anyway. Because of the vertical alignment, playing with 2 or more players means you'll need a long table.

The game plays against you admirably, and there are plenty of tense moments as the Genestealers swarm and flank.

There's definitely an element of Arkham Horror's self awareness: Often it seems like the game "just knows" how to best hurt you.

Apparently the difficulty between 4 & 5 differs greatly.. we played with 4 = everybody one team & on average two new monsters (was really easy)
but on 5 = everybody two teams & on average 4 monsters (waaay harder because monsters stack on troopers, so more troopers won't help)
And thus it seems badly playtested.

Good co-op. Each turn is a mini puzzle where you have to consider what needs to be done about urgent threats and what needs to be done in order to put you in a good spot for the next turn.
Can be very swingy due to the die rolls. Good cards play will mitigate the randomness, but in the end bad dice rolls will screw you over.

Looks cool, cool thematics, lets' go kill some genestealers.

But the whole experience is really bogged by the fact that you only have TWO actions to perform each turn. And then the CPU kicks in and moves everyone around. The CPU can take awhile to perform too, which bogs the game down further.

My friend tried to defend it by saying that the choice between the two actions is very important... As for my rebuttal, you are choosing one of the two actions from two different factors.

1) How good is this action for me, and what can I be assured that it will guarantee to benefit me?
2) How luck based is this action? How SCREWED OVER can I get from playing this?

When my main action relies on me to NOT roll a 1 on a d6 or DIE, I get frustrated with this game and its amount of luck. You cannot account for this BS in this game, and it will have its way with you or you will have your way with it. I really don't care for this game.

What does this game aim to be? An abstract shortned version of the Space Hulk? Thematically it achieves this, and that's why I'm giving it a three. It fails on every other level.

I listed Game Weight as Medium since I had difficulty teasing out what the rules meant. FAQs available online help, but the game is unnecessarily procedural.

In a word: fussy.

Game play does [u]not[/u] feel like a desperate struggle against hordes of genestealers, but seems rather like a series of procedural optimizations. The genestealer cards look great, but differently colored cubes drawn from a bag could just as easily have used to represent them.

I'm not calling this [i]JASE[/i][b]*[/b] or anything like that, but it does seem rather Euro-y with a die thrown in to add raw chaos and make it appear AmeriTrash-y.

Before you laugh at my opinion, consider this: [thing=6249][/thing], [thing=16496][/thing], [thing=30869][/thing], and [thing=3307][/thing] all have greater levels of chaos than this game. In other words, all those Euros contain greater randomness than SHDA-TCG!

To be fair, I did enjoy my second game more than the first, but it still seems like a cube-pusher using cards.

And it's not truly multi-player co-op, but rather a solitaire game that others can play with you. I'd call this a solo game and ditch the semantics.

Plus it drags on so long...

An absolutely terrific distillation of the [i]Space Hulk[/i] experience as a card game.  A real nail-biter, tense and filled with hard choices and awful [i]almost[/i] moments.  (As any good co-op should be.)

There is a real sense of increasing claustrophobia as Space Marines are slain and the formation collapses in on itself; the way swarms of Genestealers shift and wheel to flank the cumbersome Terminators induces a delicious sense of being overwhelmed.

It is a game of grand cinematic moments—[i]after luring a great mass of the swarm into the proximity of an aeons-corroded Promethium tankage, Brother Noctis sacrificed himself to obliterate the foul xenos in a cleansing firestorm[/i]—as well as careful strategizing with teammates to interleave actions into a tightly choreographed dance of death.  When you pull it off, it's exhilarating.  (Most of the time you won't.)

I've played solo once.  I didn't really appreciate the dice based combat and, were it not for the theme, I doubt I'd play this over Friday again.  But...  I do like the theme for nostalgic reasons and I am looking forward to trying it as a co-op.

I originally picked this up as a gift for a friend. After playing his copy, I got one for myself. I prefer it as a co-operative game because misery loves company. If you already own DA and are looking for a solitaire game, ask yourself, if I didn't already own DA, would I pick it up in this search for a solo game? The answer is yes, the implication is that solitaire games are so insular that the search for the perfect one is never ending. Be happy with DA, it's a very good game. 

+Thematic co-op in a small package
+Challenging, interesting decisions
-Big reliance on single die roll
-Takes a large amount of table space

Is it just me, or does the rule book fail at pointing out what exactly to do? I feel the game is impossible to learn from the rulebook, and I don't think I'm alone on this matter. Cause of that I no longer own. I'm sure it's an amazing game

The rule book is terribly written, but there are great Youtube walkthrough videos that will help you make sense of everything. A bit complex at first, but once you get the hang of it you will have so much fun! As an "Aliens" fan, I found the space marine theme very enjoyable. You don't have to know or care anything about the Warhammer 2k world to enjoy this game, so don't let the title concern you. I've never been able to "get into" Warhammer, but I LOVE this game! I've only ever played it solo, and I personally feel it is probably the most fun that way. One of my all time favorite games!

Very much Space Hulk - the Card Game, so anyone who's touched the Games Workshop original (and let's face it who hasn't?) knows exactly what to expect here. Like all co-ops played against an algorithm, whether you win or not is entirely dependent on how favourably the game sets itself up for you. The same could be said of Pandemic, but I constantly feel much closer to disaster playing that, here there was much less sense of urgency, with all Marines in play the Genestealers even seemed reasonably easy to beat.

I got this game because I needed something small and quick to take on trips. This fits perfectly. The box is small, the game is fun, and unlike some you will not be constantly winning.

Very nice and engaging card game. Juego cooperativo en el que uno dirige un escuadrón de marinos espaciales. Imaginen Alien con tropas militares para defenderse contra las criaturas. Quizá muy testaronil pero la puesta en función del juego es muy hábil y divertida. En cada turno los jugadores comparten lo que deben hacer para enfrentarse a los aliens que, por supuesto, los quieren matar a todos. Se escogen las acciones: Movimiento, activación, apoyo y ataque; pero una vez usas una de esas no la puedes usar en el próximo turno. Pueden jugar hasta 6, pero es buenísimo en solitario. Juego difícil...

RATING: 7
It feels a lot like Ghost Stories at all player counts. That is; high, unrelenting pressure against which you sometimes just need to get lucky. Just doesn't seem like my kind of game these days. For solo play, I greatly prefer Dungeon Roll or Friday to this, and there's Arkham/Eldritch, Shadowrift, or the Forbidden pair for group co-op.

RATING: 7.5
Fun and challenging game that plays terrific solo.

Horrible rule book, though.  Sure, everything is in there... but seems impossible to understand and play after a single reading (or even three readings).  The spelling and grammatical errors didn't help.

WAY easier to win with 2 players than solo!

One of my favorite games of all time.

Portable, easy to set up, and very fun and challenging.  Some of the language in the rulebook can be difficult to understand at first, but is well worth grasping.

Great adaptation of the classic "Space Hulk" board game mechanics into card-only format.

EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO WIN.  The words "Space Hulk" have become synonymous in my board game group with near-suicidal chances of victory.  But once you know how hard it is, it can be just as fun to see how long you survive.  Sometimes we all get a good laugh out of being massacred in the very first location of a game.

We do have one house rule that I highly recommend.  Theoretically, any stack of 5 or more Genestealers is an instant kill against any Marine on the Genestealer attack phase (because you have to roll HIGHER than the number of Genestealers in order to survive, and the highest number on the custom dice is a 5).  To even the playing field a little bit, my group rules that a defending roll of 5 is a "Critical Save."  In other words, a roll of 5 allows the Marine to survive anything.  It's not enough to save your butt all the time, but it increases the knuckle-biting and cheering when you have SOME chance of survival against overwhelming odds.

Just as fun solo as with 6 players.

Once you've deciphered the rulebook there's a great game here. The rules controlling genestealers are simple and clever, the different marine squads and locations give lots of replayability, and it's hard as hell to win. Captures the spirit of 'this game hates you and you will die' era GW really well. Also a superb solo game.

RATING: 7.5
A nice short (difficult!) solo game--can of course be played coop with multiple people, but seems like there wouldn't be much to do. Creates a good atmosphere of tension and desperation in a small little package. For some reason, it's difficult for me to retain all the little procedural bits in my head (shifting the formation, what happens when you travel)--so can be a bit fiddly in my book, but one of the best solos I own.

I think it only works well for solo play. With more players, a tendency for one of them to control all the actions is stronger (methinks) than in other co-op games I have played.

Also, I believe it is a good training game before reaching for more advanced titles, which require careful ordering of different actions and forward planning.

I used to be a huge Warhammer 40,000 fan, especially with the Blood Angels - those were my babies.  So when I saw this little card game for a measly $20, I had to give it a try.

My expectations were very low coming into the game, I must admit.  I was also very confused by the rule book (very poorly written).  So after watching some YouTube videos on how to play, I gave it a shot.  On a side note, this is how I discovered The Dice Tower and Mr. Vasel.

Man, was I surprised!  This game is tough, full of challenge and overwhelming odds, but it is simple, fun, and a great game for 1-6 players.  What I mean by that is it plays equally well with any number of those players, which is something I have yet to see in a game.  Tough challenge, very portable, quick, fun, you can't go wrong.

The only thing I seem to have issue with is that my friends after moving from California do not want to play it because of the theme.  Gamer snobs.

The movement mechanics for the Genestealers is great. It just has too much to set up and too many bits to track for a solitaire game,  and I think the level of coordination needed would make it annoying to play non-solitaire.

Love the theme, perhaps it is my favorite one. However I didn’t enjoy my only play of Space Hulk: Death Angel – The Card Game. I played it a long time ago, so I have forgotten much about the game. It can be played up to 6 players, but I think this was the mistake we did, I would like to play it with 2 or 3 players. On 2011, I was a lot more generous with my ratings, so now I’m downgrading its rating to one it fits my current views of the game.

The art is great!

I finally played the game again and it wasn’t a good experience.

The game is obvious but it is hard due to luck of the draw and luck of the dice. The idea seems great but the execution is very boring and repetitive. 

The rulebook could be a lot clearer. Art is good.

Bottom line, I have no desire to play Space Hulk: Death Angel – The Card Game again, luck decides everything. I will sell it. One of the worst cooperative games I have played.

Hmmm, this is a tough one to rate. It's thematic but also quite abstract; a card game that feels more like a board game. Actually, it reminds me a lot of Ghost Stories. The feeling that, at any moment, your luck's going to run out and you're going to get slaughtered. To be honest, I actually prefer to play Ghost Stories but this is quicker to set up and in fairness I've only really played this solo (tried playing with GF but she hated it) so will cut it some slack.

It's amazing how much theme is packed into that little box. SHDA game relies a little too much on dice rolls for my taste, but some players claim win rates as high as 80-90%, which suggests that good tactics can beat the dice. Myself, I'm lucky to eke out 40%.

First off: the game could do with a rulebook rewrite and reordening of rulings. But once you get going everything quickly falls into place. You simply roll dice, get lucky and win, or roll poorly and lose really hard and fast. Yes this game is hard to win. But that is mostly because of dice odds and not so because of bad choices during challenging decisions. This game definitely is dice driven and gives players just a small edge if the powers are used wisely. All in all too chaotic for my taste.

My hands-down favourite game in my collection. The rulebook is pretty awful but the game is quite straightforward with a good balance of skill, planning and luck to make sure that every play is different with plenty of highs and lows. It perfectly captures the summer action movie vibe for me, in the same way that Ghost Stories does.

Very clever mechanics, high quality, and great setting. Even though it is pretty tough, and can get frustrating, it isn't so bad as to make you rage quit all the time.

After about 30 plays though, I just couldn't muster the enthusiasm to play anymore. Just not that much replay value, even with all of the expansions.

Still, it's definitely worth grabbing if you think you have any interest at all. Just don't expect it to make it to your table every week (or even every month).

I like the theme and some of the mechanics but frankly your chances of winning are about 5% at best - and that will be down to lucky die rolls, and nothing more. It's also very fiddly to play the rules are a bit of a maze.

Rating based on first play. Very cool game packed into such a small box. May turn out to be a little too difficult however - we were already struggling when one card ("Surrounded") turned into an instant death situation - one marine had 9-10 genestealers converge on a single side of him (and a few on the other), and when he died another marine moved into his place to be killed the next round (and so on).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It might bill itself as Space Hulk the card game, but its not really. The rules are easy when you know them, but because of the symbology on the cards, the game feels very cluttered and messy and overwhelming.

Also, this game does not work well with many players (i.e. 6 players). Although player turns are simultaneous, the resolution of actions takes a long time and feels too clunky. Also, with more players, all the Genestealers tend to clump together making it a poorer game.

Juego difícil por definición. Al que todo el mundo critica su factor suerte. Personalmente creo que (aunque existe) puede ser mitigado sabiendo jugar. Terminas las partidas con ganas de más y pensando qué podías haber hecho para evitar la derrota. Óbviamente hay momentos en que el dado se carga las estadísticas, pero son marines pegándose contra genestealers en un pecio infestado de estos bichos. Un movimiento en falso y muere el equipo entero. Me sigue sorprendiendo que en un juego de cartas se consiga transmitir las sensaciones de su hermano mayor de miniaturas. Si a eso le añadimos el poder jugar solo, que se despliega en nada, que en 30' tienes hecha la partida y que es portable se lelva el 10 de calle. Como crítica, es cierto que podrían haber más localizaciones, pero aún teniendo todas las expansiones, no las he necesitado y sigo sin aburrirme.

Space Hulk: Death Angel was one of the games that got me back into board gaming.

Being a fan of Warhammer 40K I was reading about Space Hulk (3rd Edition) which was out of print and had gotten pretty expensive. Death Angel was easily available, had the same theme, could be played solo and was pretty cheap.

This was my first non-video game that I played solo and I liked it a lot. 

It's great for playing solo or coop with up to three players. With more players the player elimination, which is not only possible but very likely, kills it for me.

same comments as for other co-ops. Pales in comparison to BSG which feels much better.

I quite like this game - feels very thematic - success or failure of mission is always uncertain. However if players properly coordinate and they have bit of luck it sometis is very easy and loses its tension, because marines just slaughter everything around. Overall maybe this is problem of big number of players but still it shows that it does not scale so well.

CSS!!!

This game is awesome.  I have played LotR:LCG a few times and like it a lot because it is a challenge to try to overcome what the game is throwing at you, and I like that universe.  S.H: Death Angel is very similar in principle, but is more streamlined.  
The game is very challenging, but sitting here looking at the layout of the marine formation, trying to re-arrange them to maximize their success, while considering also the terrain cards and trying to plan for where the genestealers are likely to spawn, and taking into account the special abilities of certain marines on the team,...man, this is without a doubt the best solo game I have ever played beating out Friday, LotR:LCG, and giving RftG with the dice driven robot a run for its money.)  
This game is very thematic and grossly under-rated on the 'Geek, imho.
The rules are a bit of a chore for the first couple of games, as with tons of very rewarding games out there, but if you stick with it, its worth it.

I have just finished my first game of Space Hulk and I can already tell that I will return to this game repeatedly... boy oh boy You just feel how the Aliens (come on they are Aliens :) ) appear suddenly in large or small groups and attack and attack and attack... and you just strike back... I think that with more players the game will get tougher when nobody knows what to do... and if you are unlucky with the dice you will die quickly. But the game is great, components top notch, can't wait to play again when I already know how to play :) great buy :)

When played solo, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Makes a good fist of capturing some of the tension & theme of Space Hulk.  And is typically carnage for the marines.

When played with 2, I enjoyed it less.  Thinking through the action choices (which I suspect is necessary to succeed) didn't fit so well in an interactive environment.

I grew up playing Space Hulk so its probably no surprise that this game would appeal to me greatly yet let me down somewhat even more.  A replacement for the board game it is not and I didn't much enjoy it as a solitaire game either.  I never did play it other than solitaire.   I'd honestly rather just play the Space Hulk iOS game if I want a solitaire Space Hulk experience so I suppose I am one of those who miss the entire point of this game.  Too much dice rolling in comparison to other game aspects as most of the spatial decisions of the original board game have been eliminated.

Not a bad little co-op survival in a card game. I do enjoy the FF Silverline series, though the games are not my favorite. The games are just the right size to take to the coffeeshop or pub, and typically play in a reasonably short amount of time. SH: Death Angel is a brutal little game. There is a lot of luck involved, as you will be deciding the fate of your marines by rolling a single die, but there is quite a bit of strategy, as well. And for a game to carry the Space Hulk name, you know it will be strong on theme. For me the rules presentation wasn't very intuitive, but fortunately there aren't that many rules that you need to know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a cooperative game that is very challenging without being impossible. The game requires that all players fully devote themselves to helping the team uncover its best course of action each and every round lest the genestealers spawn out of control.  My overall experience with cooperatives has been that usually one or two people do most of the strategizing for the group.  My first game session with Space Hulk was no different.  Consequently I am looking forward to soloing the next play of the game.

I've since soloed the game a few times and prefer solo play to multi-player play.  The game is not very forgiving if a mistake is made because the genestealers spawn quickly.  In the multi-player version there are more opportunities for players to make poor decisions.  Most notably, event cards with the INSTINCT keyword require the active player to make a decision without consulting the group.  My experience is that I don't agree with the active player's decision 60% of the time because the right choice often requires advanced planning.  Advanced planning requires everyone's input and agreement, which the active player doesn't have at that moment.  Consequently, I feel that I have a MUCH higher win rate when I solo than when I play with others.  

EDIT: 2 player games work well too.  My husband doesn't like the Event cards with the INSTINCT keyword. He thinks a pure cooperative (you win together or lose together) should encourage team decision making.  Personally I don't mind the INSTINCT keyword in 2 player games (assuming the other person isn't a moron).  I simply don't like to play with more than 2.  Bad decisions become inevitable and the games take FOREVER.

So much fun in this little box! Death Angel has the advantage that it can be played alone or with many players, the setup is very quick and the rules are simple. Yet it has a great impact, both for the high difficulty and for the (claustrophobic) setting.

You often feel yourself helpless and surrounded: collaboration, timing and luck are the key to the success. I've never had so much fun in losing a game, makes you want to play again right away. For its price and size is an inevitable piece in the collection of an ameritrash fan.

Amazing design. Uses a deck of cards to create a claustrophobic Alien-style experience solitaire - the way you "move" around the ship is particularly clever. However, almost impossible to win (unless you study the 120-page analysis - a doctoral thesis? - available as a file on the Geek). I'm not sure I enjoy playing this game but then I'm not sure you're supposed to. Clearly a gaming work of art.

A brutal cooperative game that will drive you crazy. If you have good memories of the Games Workshop Space Hulk you may love this one.

The game engine works very well. This little card game brings the feelings of its older, and bigger, board game brother Space Hulk, which in my opinion is the aim of this iteration of the IP. 

The game mechanics represent very well the claustrophobic atmosphere of the original Space Hulk and it is a very noticeable achievement to such a small card game.

It can be played solo (if you like so) and up to 6 players.

This is a co-op card game.  My favorite part of this game is the balance.  This game comes down to the wire every time.  Just when you think you are going to die you scrape by for the win.  OK you don't always win, but you are SOOO close.  Fun game for a group of gamers looking for a little more challenge.

RATING: 8.5
I'll admit being intimidated when I opened the box.  There are a lot of different types of cards and several tokens, as well as a lengthy rulebook.  Once I actually played through a solitaire game, though, I felt like I understood the game.

Still haven't managed to play it with anyone else--my wife is uninterested, and we haven't had a game night with friends since before Christmas.  I'm hoping to introduce a couple of my college buddies to it next week, though, which may or may not change my rating.

Thematically, the game is fabulous.  I don't even like Space Marines, and I enjoy this game.  There are many fun cinematic moments.  Mechanically, it's a little clunky and takes some time to learn, so it gets knocked for that.  Still, I appreciate cooperative games--as much as I enjoy playing games, I am not hyper-competitive, and I like the idea of being able to work WITH my fellow players, rather than against them.

I wish they had thrown in a couple more Support tokens.  I feel like I run out of them way too often.  Then again, that's just at single-player difficulty.  I'm guessing that the game is significantly more difficult with more people involved.  Boy, I really just need to get my friends over here so we can try it out.

Very hard co-op to beat.  Good co-op experience that didn't feel like one or two guys running everyone else's turn.  For a pure co-op I'm very impressed.  My overall rating is a 8.5.  This game is just fun to play.  If choosing between coops only that goes up to a 10.  Generally I don't like coops but this is the exception.

A fun co-op game that projects its theme full-blast.  Trying to model the Space Hulk boardgame, Death Angel hits the ball out of the park.  This is also the first Fantasy Flight game that I've played that was adequately play-tested.  Fantasy Flight should try that more often.  If you like the Space Hulk boardgame, then you will love this card game.

[b]Space Hulk: Death Angel[/b] is a really tough cooperative game which makes the players take tough tactical decisions on every turn. The game has unforgiving random elements (card draws + die rolls) and it's the job of the players to tactically minimise the risk the best they can.

The replay value is good, as the game comes with many different groups of Space Marines with unique abilities and a good amount of event cards (although most events are repeated in the deck). Most location cards exist specifically for being used with a specific amount of players to ensure a more balanced game - which means most of the location cards are indeed not used in a single game.

The game works great as a solitaire game, but its game design gets a bit wonky when played with more players. The rules state that players are not allowed to directly communicate which of their 3 available action cards they will play on a turn (which is thematically really strange) and that the actions are then resolved in order by printed-on numbers on the cards.

This is strange, as it makes the game even harder than it already is and players with a good memory will eventually crack this artificial obstacle, as the numbers can theoratically easily be memorised, especially because an action card which has been played on the current turn cannot be played on the next turn (so the choice boils down to 2 cards per player).

Another problem when playing this game with others is player elemination. As mentioned before, this game is really hard, so it is indeed possible that a player gets eleminated early on. There is nothing that the eleminated player can contribute to the game from here on, which is a problem. The game's length is indeed usually rather short (depending on the number of players), but it's still a problem and which can be frustrating.

I won't recommend this game to most people, but people who are looking for a challenging tactical solitaire game should definitely take a closer look -- especially if they are fans of the [b]Space Hulk[/b] board game, on which this card game is based on.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting small game that has some potential, but I consider that there is still space for improvement.

I really like how they attempted to convert a Dungeon Crawl into a card game. Thinking that the same process could be applied to other dungeon crawls like "Hero Quest".

I do not really like how the marines are placed. I would prefer having location cards where you could decide where you want to move your marine. It would have increased the feeling of moving in a ship.

The other things I did not like is the fact that you control a team of character. In our game, we controlled 2 team (3 players). This has the effect of not having the feeling of being in the feet of your character. I would have prefer controlling only 1 character, with some HP and a hand of cards unique to that character.

Some cards action cards give special bonus to one of the character in your team. Since your team members cards almost look the same, you do not see at glance that they are different. You really have to search for the character's name. I would have preferred a large Icon on the character which has a special ability.

Finally, the cooperative part is a bit better than "Ghost Story" which could end up as a 1 player puzzle. Still, in our game, we decided to discussed openly, if you normally play with hidden action cards, it would reduce the effect of being a 1 player puzzle. But since every team only has 3 cards, where 2 can be played, they can generally know what you are going to do even if you do not talk to each other.

There are some situation where a character special ability allows him to take a decision. If the information to manage is hidden, then yes it reduce the 1 player puzzle syndrome. But if the information is open, players would get a tendency to talk and share comments.

So in conclusion, it's an OK game, where the dungeon crawl conversion is interesting and that has some potential, but there is still space for improvement.

Neat little co-op or solo game with a solid theme that brings out the feel of the game.  There are some clever pieces to the game such as initiative cards which the person must decide without consulting anyone else.  Facing of the soldier plays a huge role and each soldier is unique with one member of each team having a unique ability.  I worry about replayability as there are only a few scenarios, but this is a fun game and plays quickly.

My wargame buddy likes it.  A big plus is that the game can be played either solitaire or cooperatively with any number of players up to 6.  I also played the PC game of the Warhammer universe recently and hence the increase in interest level of this game.  The game can be quite tactically demanding with the use of cards.  I like it despite the rules are somewhat brief to cover some circumstances vaguely.  Nevertheless, it is quite a good narrative story card game.

The rules are quite well written and organized.  I had to go back and forth a bit, though: some sections give details and are referred to from some main section.

On my first game, I strongly felt the effect of luck (1/3 chance of having an unsupported Space Marine slain by a "swarm" of a single Genestealer).  However, a better strategy might work.

I did not feel the same intellectual challenge as when playing Magic against Magarena, though: there are fewer powers, and combats are much simpler.

Would I rather play Magic (Duel Decks) than this, though?  I'm not sure yet: both games are very different, and I don't yet know how the multi-player game feels.  Looking forward to playing to taste the game a bit more.  I'm sure that I can discover interesting strategies.  I'm not sure about the tactical richness, though, but we'll see.

However, I do appreciate the game as a kind of puzzle: how can the game be beaten?  It's nice to even be able to try this anytime, since the game can be played solo.

These remarks make me wonder whether I would not like Summoner Wars better than SHDA: more powers, more tactical situations, more "geographic" freedom, a fight…  SHDA can be played with 3 players, though, so that's a plus.

I mainly bought this game because I travel a bit. I needed a portable solo game to play. This fit the bill quite well. Cheap, small and playable with 1 to 6 players.

I've always been a bit of a WH40k nut, so this game hit me hard. I love the theme and the desperate feel of fighting against overwhelming odds. The game isn't very meaty, but enough for me at least!

The game's lack of depth is something that's starting to irritate me a bit after 47 plays. I have to see if it lasts 100 plays after all...

Update 30.10.2016

Raised from 8 -> 9. It has stood the test of time really well :)

Raised from 9 -> 10. It is officially in the Pantheon of great games now. Never ever during playing I feel like it's boring, only the setup is a bit sleepy.

I've only played Space Hulk once and while it was okay, it's not really something I'd do a lot of. I've been intrigued by the card version for some time now, but hadn't had a chance to play until recently. I like this a bunch, though both times I played we got slaughtered, and once pretty much right out the gate. The bad news is, it's a co-op, and those don't fare well with my gamer buddies. Good news is, it plays well enough with two, and there's at least one friend who might play it. I don't know that it delivers the full Space Hulk experience, but what it delivers is pretty good.

Usually I don't like card games, fortunately this is just disguised as a card game, in reality it's more like a lightweight tactical game, and it can give you the feel of the original Space Hulk (you have to move with giant armoured soldiers in tight spaces, have to fight with aliens who can shred you to pieces if you didn't pay attention, etc.)
It's a shame it's out of print now.

I like this game, but it took me awhile to figure out how to play. I like how things change with the flips of the cards, but I would prefer damage tokens rather than the one hit one kill. This is less of a problem because of the hit system, but it makes the game impossible when the enemies start to add up. Also some missions are as easy as hit one dice once with five tries. Other missions are kill twelve enemies to advance. The enemies are bland, with three pictures to represent all of the enemies. The expansions fix some of that, making the enemies harder and the players weaker, but it's less fun. There is plenty to this game, and the random room factor is either nerve racking or fun. I have played a few games, and enjoy it, but unfortunately it's not going to win many awards.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=5792][microbadge=5389]

Scenario: make a card game that can, in 30 minutes or less, largely replicate the experience of playing Space Hulk.  This sounds near impossible, but it's pulled off with serious style in Death Angel.  The game is very hard, but that only makes it more sweet when you win.  Very unexpectedly, it plays equally well with any combination of one to six players; that sort of range is virtually unheard of.  You're unlikely to come up with a better game for its price as well.

~~~late breaking news~~~
Just read Friman's Complete Guide(highly recommended), and WOW did he put some thought into the game, and offers some great insight into this game.  If you are feeling it is too hard as I did, then check out his guide.  Before reading the guide I was winning about 20% of the time, which just isn't fun, and so was trying out some variants (see below).  Now I'll give some of Friman's thoughts and advice a try and see what my win ratio and more importantly fun ratio is before throwing in too many of the variants.

~~~~Later thoughts~~~~~
Friman's guide is very good, but geared towards 5-6 teams of marines against normal genestealers where he said he was winning 90% of the time.  In solo with 3 teams of marines against Tyranids, I think recently I am at best winning about 20-30% of the time.....which can sometimes be epic storytelling, but gets old after a while.  I think I need a break from it for a while....when I come back, I may try adding 2 support tokens for each support action.  Sorry, Friman, but the game (with Tyranids) is just too stacked against the marines.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous thoughts: 
Man, do I suck at this(without some below variants, I was only winning less than 20%).....had demoted the Green team to guard duty back on some backwater planet, until I started to use the variants below.  Will see how balanced it is.

Playing solo I was taking 4 teams and play with the 2p scenarios, but now trying the normal solo-play of 3 teams.  I like having more command with 4 teams, but like the shorter playing time with 3 teams.  I'm going to play some more with 3 teams to see which I like the best.

Solo variants that I am trying out from various forums: 

-Grenade(1 time use) for non-hero marine (can use once instead of normal attack(range 1): kills number on die(rolls can't be rerolled), swarm is then stunned and does not attack that turn.  If the marine is killed before using the grenade attack, the grenade is lost(may try adding a Terminis variant).

-Thunder Hammer/Shield heroes: when facing an attacking swarm, has a roll before swarm attacks that kills one GS on skull roll(may not be re-rolled)or blocks that one GS(if not killed)...then the swarm attacks(with one less strength...one GS was killed or blocked). Trying to make the Green team viable, and model hammer/shield from Space Hulk.
-Lightning Claw heroes:  when facing an attacking swarm, gets one attack when defending before swarm attacks (no re-roll)....as above, but does not get the block on one GB (no Shield).

-GS rolling 5 on an attack always misses....just to allow that rare event

-Last Stand: when a swarm rolls equal to it's size when attacking, the marine gets one last attack(no re-rolls).  If they miss then they die, but if they hit, the swarm attacks again with its reduced numbers.

-Terminis: in conjunction with the grenade variant above (or potentially even without it).  If the non-hero marine has not used his grenade yet and is killed he will drop his primed grenade and kill a die roll of 'stealers (first from the attacking swarm, and then from the other engaged swarm if there are two).  Of course, no re-rolls.

I hear this is a poor substitute for the full 'Space Hulk' experience, but never having played the original, I think this is a great little co-op game. It scales well from solo up to 6 players.

The expansions add more variety, and everything fits in the original box, which is compact enough to carry in your pocket.

I don't like most card games, but this one is decent.  I like both the theme and the game play.  Presentation and the quality of the materials is good.  If you are a fan of the James Cameron ALIENS movie you'll enjoy this game.

My only negative is the manual.  It's a flimsy booklet of just 32 very small pages.  While reading through and walking through a first game (or second or third...) you'll be flipping madly back and forth through the pages to figure out what step to take next.  I think that FFG could have written a much better manual.  I had to watch a couple of Youtube videos to clarify a few things.

If there is one game in my collection that I love and hate in equal measures it would be this. The game design is fabulous. So thematic. You really do feel like a team of space marines fighting for every inch of your lives against ever decreasing odds, thanks in large part to that one red dice. But oh my, you really do need to be in the right mood to be slapped about by that dice! Don't pick this one off the shelf if you are wanting a nice laid back solo moment. If you die (and you will) then suck it up and either pack it away for another day, or shuffle that deck one more time brother!

Addendum: I own all the expansions, and honestly haven't begun to delve into them. The base game has been enough to satiate the Space Hulk in me...for now.

Nice cooperative game that manages to create a "boardgame feel" with only cards. 
There's a good dose of randomness mixed with some decisions (discussion between players is guaranteed by the need to coordinate the marines).

Fun little game. Not much to learn, but the rulebook makes it harder than it seems at first glance. Love the theme, and it really does make you feel helpless, probably cause you usually wind up totally wiped out. Great sense of accomplishment if you win, still fun if you lose because it doesn't take very long. 

Hits the right balance as a filler or short game.

It is amazing how Corey Koniecka managed to invoke the greater part of the Space Hulk vibe in a cooperative game crammed into a teeny-tiny box, and Death Angel is a shining example of clever game design. However, it does not play significantly faster than its daddy, and since I happen to have that daddy on my shelf, Death Angel is not for me really.

In other words, my rating of six should be increased by a point if you don’t have Space Hulk and by another point if you like co-ops.

Quick to set up and deceptively simple, the three available actions for each team combo and play off each other in countless ways and force you to think several turns ahead.

The randomness of enemy actions and 1-hit kills detract from the game, though. You can spend actions to set up the perfect attack and then a card flip moves all the enemies to the other side where you can't attack them. Then you roll a die and your marine dies before doing anything. Frustrating.

Hmm.. great artwork.. I like the theme, the gameplay seemed ratherlimited. I have 3 actions, I do them over and over... roll well and we win, roll bad and we lose.  

I am not sure the additional players add anything to the game other than add time while you discussed the optimal move. I would rather think this through solo. Maybe if it had a timer like the original space hulk it would add the needed tension. But for me this one is a non purchase.

Good, hard, tense and quick game. Played a 2 player game once and we won.

Edit: 4 years after writing the comment above, and looking into expanding my solo collection, I bought the game.

The second time I played was solo and I was decimated in the 3rd round due to brutal events (esp. "They're everywhere!") and poor die rolls. Despite that, I had a great time. The game is so thematic that I don't feel sad at all for the marines. They missed most of their kill attempts, so they all just got what they deserved.

The theme reminds me of Natural Selection, a Half-Life mod I enjoyed a lot as a teenager.

Rate went up after playing for the 3rd time with all the expansions mixed up, winning and having a blast. This game is hard and VERY thematic. The story it tells is so involving that you'll have a lot of fun even if you lose.

Rulebook is a bit obscure, but the game works well. Not completely thematic in its gameplay, but you still can feel the fear and despair of the ultramarines. Affordable, wich is a huge plus !

After 9 games, i finally won... It takes a little time to tame the game, to understand the synergy between the special abilities. The game can be cruel to you, but some events or locations can help you too. You've got to love seeing Brother Claudio getting back from the dead ! :)

The more I play, the more I like this game, so much fun, you will learn to know your guys by their names !

Still, there is a veat : it could be less fiddly. It's not that the rules are heavy, but with the special powers, the travelling phases, the event phase steps, i still make little mistakes in the flow of the game here and there. it's just that it's easy to miss a step at one point or another, especially if you're a bit tired.

Plus the setup is a bit long for the length of the game...

Solitaire: I didn't really grok this game after a read-through of the rules, but within a couple turns on my first play, it clicked. I lost, of course, so maybe it didn't click all the way! But I like losing solo games; it motivates me to keep playing.

This is a fun game. There are plenty of levers to pull, but not too many; just the right amount. There's a palpable sense of dread whenever genestealers attack, which seems about right, and the game does a good job of expressing its theme: genestealers scuttle about, flank, form larger swarms, and are hard to eliminate entirely.

It's mostly tactical, but satisfyingly so. The balance of luck and skill is good, and the mechanic whereby you can't re-use any single card from round to round is just dirty.

The components are great, of course, and I'm glad it uses no half-size cards. I can see lots of replay value, what with variable events, spawns, locations, and team composition.

And perhaps most importantly, playing it makes me want to play it again.

RATING: 7
I like the atmosphere that this game create.  It is very tense and you are either doing really well, or doing horrible!  The designer succeed at making you feel surrounded and every die roll makes you nervous.  It's a tough game to win and can be really cruel.  The theme is pasted really well, and it doesn't feel like a card game at all.  I was not sure if I would like a card game, but Space Hulk is definately a convincing experience!  It's one of my favorite solo game. You have 4 expansions, I think tyrranids is a must have, and deathwing is second. The expansions add a little replay value and increase the challenge, however it's still more of the same.  I wish there was some add-ons to help the space marines instead of just making a tough game even harder.

Stats: 5 wins out of 20 !!!1!1!

THEMATIC (Rahdo #1)
My personal #2 solo game

This is a very solid game, though the difficulty is harder than most other card games. One will often find their marines on the losing side of the battle, which makes winning even more satisfying.

The biggest drawback for this game is definitely the rules. You'll often be forced into situations where you'll ask yourself "ok, this situation isn't in the rule book, what do I do?" After navigating to the forums for this game, I understand certain scenarios much better and have a better grasp on how to properly interpret a few card's abilities.

This is a SOLID solo game and a lot of fun. The artwork is top notch and really pulls you into the bleak situation of these marines. It's very fun to have to make decisions about which marine to kill off or who to attack and defend. Strategy is very much important in this game. While the roll of the dice does offer something in which you cannot control, using strategic maneuvers to have the dice roll in your favor is key to a successful mission. 

I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a card game that packs a punch and also requires all your concentration.

This is a fun, tense and very thematic game. However it is also very difficult to win and although it appears to offer the players plenty of choice I get the feeling that the dice and cards totally rule this, and that the decisions you make only have a minor impact on the chances of success. But then again, it's short and simple so does that really matter? Components and art are fantastic: possibly the best looking card game I've ever seen.

Though it can be played with more, Space Hulk: Death Angel - The Card Game is, for all intents and purposes, a solitaire game.  In it you assemble a team of space marines, a la the movie Aliens, to board a spaceship and fight off hoards of, you guessed it, aliens.

Once you have the rules down the game is actually fairly simple to play.  In a solo game you get three teams of marines to work with.  Each team of two space marines has one of three actions they can perform on a turn.  They can either attack, support, or move and activate.  After they take their action, the aliens will attack them.  This goes back and forth until either all the marines are dead, or they've made it through to the final area of the ship, and completed their objective.

For a small card game Space Hulk: Death Angel - The Card Game offers an intense experience.  Death lurks around every corner.  That sounds fun, right?

Changed my mind about getting the expansions. Not convinced about the quality of the print and play components.  Plus the game is really well balanced as is, and I could put the cost of the expansions towards other games I want to own.

After 6 plays:

This game ... will kick ... your ass.

It is oozing with theme and the game mechanic is very true to this theme.  Even with a great strategy, sometimes you'll get wiped by a bad run of draws or bad rolls.

My first solitaire game, Space Hulk plays in about 30-45 minutes (or less, with bad rolls) and offers an satisfying solo experience with meaningful decisions to weigh. There is naturally a high element of luck with the dice involved, but this can be mitigated through smart use of your squad's abilities. I cannot recommend this enough as an enjoyable solo game with enough complexity to keep you coming back for more.

I like the game. It reminds me of LotR-LCG, but without the deckbuilding. I also like the use of the die, but it makes the luck factor significant: you can lose a marine, even if you have multiple support tokens on that marine. Of course it also can go the other way.

7 - 24/07/2015 - Just bought, and collected two defeats in the first two games. This game is hard! In the first game, after a good start, half of my squad was wiped out just in the same turn! Now I understand what brutal means...
I still have to decide how much I like all of this. I would like to try a two player game...

9 - 05/08/2015 - This game got me by replaying. It is very good to play in solitary, with variability coming from randomness in the choice of rooms and teams. It is also a great experience in two players, for the degree of coordination it requires. A note: reading the guide too soon, as I did, might spoil your interest in finding the right tactics. However, knowing how to play a team definitively makes the difference in reducing the luck factor.

10 - 01/03/2016 - Great fun even playing this after long time it had been staying on the shelf. I love it because it is really tensed and thematic. Many say it is too difficult and random, but playing with the right tactics really minimizes the chances to lose.

I had my reservations when I first saw the material and the rules - but, wow, this co-op game does really work and captures the essence of its bigger brother well! Having no human opponent but the game only needs some random elements (otherwise the game would be pointless after "solving" it once). The luck swings by these randomizers, cards and a die, are not as terrible as they seem over the course of the game. Seems to be easier with more Marines (= players). I witnessed lots of sessions as a game explainer and saw player elimininaton most of the time only in the final stages of the game, as long as the group acted wisely. 
As the game mechanisms are very interlocked, it is not easy to explain and grasp at first, though basically everything is quite easy to play, after ALL rules have been explained.
Try to roll the die on a soft surface - I have witnessed that the die I have notedly "prefers" several results when rolled on a hard surface. Repeatedly having 6 Zeroes in, like, twenty rolls is no fun.

Great filler when you want to frag some monsters, which is what this game is.  The cooperative angle is a nice addition in a genre that mostly put peoples against each others.

A couple good laugh and some dice rolling complete the game.  One thing is you could find yourself in big trouble if you don't pay attention to hte blip...You MUST sacrifice some marines in order to achieve the greater goal.

I feel this is one of the better coop/solo games, It is possible to plan in advance and I can see some will have the ability to beat this game quite often, for myself though it takes too much brain burning coupled with unlucky rolls that destroy said planning (It is a game!). For me it was not enough fun and too stressful almost, at least solo, in a group I think it would be a lot of geeky fun, unlucky rolls solo are hardly enjoyable.

 Choosing and using the tactics is interesting, I like the sense of physical progression through the ship, ending with a satisfying boss fight, I just wish there was some way to play a game like this but without the horrible luck of the roll, maybe its just the nature of the beast and unavoidable??

Honestly, I never expected this much fun when I bought this. Looks contrived, twenty pages of the rules could easily replaced by a single page flowchart to be much clearer, but after the first few rounds it pulled us in. You don't just push cards around anymore, but try to maneuver Brother Zael in position to save Brother Claudio's ass. It certainly can't replace Ghost Stories, but for a small-box card game it does very vell.

[COLOR=#FF3300]Haven't beaten this game yet. I can't rate it too high, because from my previous plays, I've learned that luck plays a very big factor in here. It's off-putting when you get deep enough and then die to some lucky spawns on the Genestealers side.[/COLOR]

I'm a fan of the old GW Space Hulk game and bought this upon learning I could play this Solitaire.  I wasn't disappointed. A good game.  It is a card game so it doesn't capture all of the elements of the original Space Hulk, but a good Solitaire game is hard to come by in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Does an excellent job of porting the Space Hulk boardgame to just cards, each mission seems like it will present different challenges.

Brutal & lethal game, so that's 2 positives already, don't get too attached to your marines, they're meant to die in service to the Emperor, but if in any way you're into the 40K universe, you'd know the creed of the Space Marine

"Only In Death Does Duty End"

RATING: 7.5
Card-driven tactical game based on the Games Workshop 40K/Space Hulk licence in which you play space marines clearing out aliens from a drifting spaceship. Though playable with a group it works just as well as a solitaire. Session times for solitaire about an hour. 

What is remarkable about this game is that it through very clever spatial layout of cards and draft mechanics excellenlty captures the theme, mood and setting of the original game. Cards are laid out in a single file and can face two ways, capturing the narrow confines. You can be beset from any position and direction, and every choise you make is a hard one with consequences. The rules are complicated for a card game, but actually, just as complicated as they need to be to capture the setting, and not more than that. The game is difficult--very difficult!--but this too contributes to the desperate atmosphere of the game. In all, the theme/mechanics intergration is quite outstanding.

Game in a Nutshell: Co-op card game of Space Marines trying to survive close quarter alien attacks via a small hand of action cards and die rolling combat.

Played as: Solo

Played with: Base game, no expansions

Pros: For a plain-old row of cards, the theme actually shines through. It really can feel like walking into the bowels of hell knowing full well, as your marines are getting devoured one by one, that it's not going to get any easier. Does an excellent job of putting players in some very tough situations with interesting decisions to make. Quite challenging. The artwork is good. 

Cons: There is nothing intuitive or easy mechanics wise when it comes to this game. Too many niggly rules, an unnatural game flow, unhelpful graphic design, and a landmark achievement in poor rulebook layout all detract from what should be a quick immersive experience. Forget a reference card (of which there is none included), this game needs a flow-chart; how's that for fun in a small box thematic game? The game can often boil down to how well you roll the die.

Other: It's interesting that a card game could be more complicated than its boardgame counterpart. I almost never played the game, as the initial read of the rules was really that hard to stomach. After four plays, I still haven't made it through a game without needing to check for the 'order of events' or something else. Despite that, I'm still interested in trying the game multiplayer. My only fear there is, the time to play is only going to increase exponentially and the game will basically require someone to 'be the boss' to have a chance at surviving.

Best Use: Great if you want a lot of theme in a small box and don't mind an un-necessarily steep learning curve.

You might want to spend some quality time reading those cards with the marines on 'em, because they don't last long enough in the game to get to know them otherwise! Really enjoy this as a solo game!

RATING: 5
After a couple solo plays, I must say this does seem like a rather dry logistics exercise. I've seen enough to reasonably say that, as a solo experience, it's about a five. Perhaps it's better as a multiplayer game, and I should have a chance to try that in the next couple weeks.

It's got a bit of the artificial Euroness that typically detracts from the immersiveness. For example, you can't take the same action twice in a row. Why? Because the cosmos requires play balance, that's why! If Euros have taught me anything, it's that you can't build a ship, hire a specialist, make babies or sell a red whatchamadoodle at the same time someone else does.

It's not quite enough of a Euro that it extracts my soul and stomps gleefully on it. But it's not really AmeriTrashy enough, given the theme. And no, the saying "best of both worlds" does not apply. The "best of both worlds" would be all AT, no Euro. Obviously.

I think that with a game called Death Angel--admittedly they were up front about it and called a card game, it says so right on the box--there should be more, you know, of a sense that you are being snapped at by the pointy claws and teeth of nasty death.

The rule book is a strange beast: reasonably well-written with good explanations and relatively clear rules. Yet a few bits of information are clumsily placed so that you have to flip to the back to make sense of something you are being told in the front.

It has a hefty dose of luck that can hose you early. This is not a big issue for me--I loves me some dice!--but it will drive Anti-Dice EuroBob to fits of madness. Even with just the one die! Exciting, isn't it?

The game is quite likely to confound the first-time player, because it so stubbornly refuses to be anything like what you expect it to be. It's probably best if you wipe your mind, have someone teach you the rules and get really shouty while you play it. You may love it or hate it or just feel a little blah like I did, but I don't think that mere words can prepare you for what a weird little morsel this is.

rated as a solo game.  Has some exciting moments, and I had a dramatic last-ditch victory against overwhelming odds, so that was fun.  You don't seem to have too many options on a turn, so that is less interesting.  Combat nice and simple, which is a plus.  Awful rulebook makes the game sound complicated when it is really, really simple.  Could have used a lot more variety of room cards, for example.

I prefer LotR: The Card Game as a solitaire card game, but the deckbuilding required to prepare for a quest does not make it one I can just pick up and play when I have a few minutes.

The Death Angel rule book is not easy to read or quickly review, mainly due to the small page size and the lack of any concise turn workflow player aids.  Every step of a turn is introduced in a summary on one page and then explained in more detail several pages later in the book.

But now that I have the rules down, it works nicely as a solo game I can play in under an hour without any need for preparation.  Luck in rolling dice is a big part of that, but for a game this dependent on luck, it is short enough to not overstay its welcome.

[u]08-Feb-2013[/u]: This is one of my favorite games.  You command a team of Space Marines going on a mission to take down the alien Genestealers that have taken over a Space Hulk.  I knew nothing of the Warhammer 40K universe prior to picking up this game, and I still don't know much about it.  But I do know it didn't stop me from loving this little game.  It's mostly cards with a few cardboard chits and an Evil Red Die.

You line up your marines in a straight line formation and the enemy spawns on either side.  You must use the basic and special actions of the marines in the right combination to slay the creatures and work your way through a number of "locations" within the ship.  Reach the end and meet the final condition of that location and your mission will be successful.

There is a lot of strategy and tactics in this game.  There is also a lot of randomness as both your attacks and your defense is based on a single die.  However, by using the special actions of the marines as well as support tokens, you can mitigate that randomness, and even turn it in your favor.

This game is easy on the wallet.  It comes in a small box.  The replayability is fantastic, especially if you add in any (or all!) of the four expansions currently available.  The random set up and gameplay adds to this, as well as to the challenge.  It can be daunting sometimes, especially early on in those first several plays.  Eventually, if you stick with it, and learn from your mistakes, your successes will be fantastic.

I like to say this is the boardgame version of Aliens (the movie), when the marines go into the spaceship and are attacked by the aliens.  I play those scenes out in my mind every time I play this game.  I love it.

[u]26-Jan-2014[/u]:  Yep, still love this game, so I had to add it to the top of the list with Carc and Friday.  How could I not.  I'm still working (slowly) on my 100 Play Challenge.  I'm almost halfway there and still haven't touched two of the expansions.

While it may be somewhat similar each game, I just really enjoy the Aliens-like narrative that plays out each time I play this game.  So cinematic.  And the game is still tough, no matter how much experience I have gained so far.  I'm still finding new ways to succeed (and fail!) even now.

Combine this with the small box and a reasonable price tag....winner!

I'm not big on cooperative game but can appreciate the theme, difficulty, character powers and quick playing time of this one.  You really need to work together to have a chance but be careful that the character(s) you're playing aren't thrown under the bus when they're asked to attack or defend some territory.  I thought the simple left or right facing (for attacks) worked quite well.  It's brutal when you're being attacked from behind with little you can do about it.

Surprisingly immersive, nice mechanisms, the die can be a pain though...

I actually sold and then re-bought the game as I started to miss it. I realized that I only like solo games with a strong theme (or a great presentation) and a fairly easy ruleset, and this one does just that.

Sold again. Ultimately, I just didn't care for it enough and it's not a game I would play with my family or friends.

RATING: 6
Pretty good.  The rules are not well organized, but a couple of the tutorial videos and Andreas Ludwig's review/walk-through (http://wargamecenter.wordpress.com) helped solidify some concepts for me.  Game play is quick and intuitive, once you get into the flow of it.  Seems very tough on the Marines, so this is a game where you can easily get sucked into a "just one more try" mindset, as you try again to beat the "A.I" Genestealers.

Components are excellent;  attractive, functional and durable.  Win.

(170115): It's hard to justify death angel being the game of the day when time could be spent playing something better. Death Angel is not really bad, but it's not really good either. Anti-climatic is probably the word for the game. I think that it's like Pandemic - good occasionally but never the first pick. Perhaps beer and a multiplayer environment will make it better?

(220515): Replayed with other people. It doesn't work as a two-player experience either. IF anything, I just wanted to play sub-optimally and drop out.

CCGs are a scam, and "deck building" games are a bore to me for the most part as they are just CCG games with out the Collectible aspect (I would exempt Dominion from this as it isn't really in that genre).

I love that this is a straight up tactical fight that captures the mood of Space Hulk but is much faster and simpler to play. It also allows for unique characters so each marine feels more like an individual instead of a faceless drone. There are lots of decisions to be made amongst the team and it feels real good when a squad works together successfully.

Wow what a terrible rulebook: how to make a medium/light game as hard as possible to learn.

Die rolls are a bit to much of an all or nothing affair. Space marines can die a bit too easy by bad luck.

RATING: 7.1
A fine Games Workshop card game that is relatively quick and easy to figure out how to play - but which remains quite difficult to easily win.  Operating as a line of hulking Space Marine Terminators, clearing out hallways in a floating abandoned starship (a "space hulk" in the Warhammer 40k parlance) of insectoid Genestealer monstrosities, the game is an emulation of cramped quarters fighting and struggling to avoid precious losses in the face of enemy hordes.

I haven't played this game in a rather long time, as I think I overplayed it with people in New Haven.  Everyone enjoyed it, but I just got sick of it. Even still, keeping it on the shelves as an easily-transported and fun challenge of a game suitable for many different numbers of players.

Played solo five times, lost four times. Played 40k Epic as a kid, so I'm loving the theme here.  I also enjoy that the game plays tough.  Two drawbacks are that it feels quite luck driven, and that the game setup is awkward and takes up more space than I'd like.  Waiting to see if some of the "luck driven" aspect wears off and I improve with more plays.

Initial impressions after a 1 player and 2 player game are pretty positive. Tough co-op. Should be fun with 5 or 6.

After a couple of easy wins I hope the game retains its challenge. The only thing in the game I really dislike is when we go for a turn or two with an empty board and no new spawns. It feels like we're just passing time and waiting. Still fun, but I'm seeing potential cracks in the armor. Need more plays to find out.

Playing the game with the correct rules makes quite a difference. Excellent game.

Excellently fun card game. Far deeper than I expected, and with some great replay value.

The game is fairly difficult, but it still feels balanced overall - it's particularly fun with one player controlling each 'squad' of two marines.

With fewer than 3 players, people have to control more than one duo (which can get a bit too much until they start dying off), while with more than 3 a player only has one marine to control. If they die then that player is essentially out of the game!

I received this as a birthday present and was most grateful that my chums knew me well enough to think that this game would suit me down to the ground. The premise is the same as [thing=54625][/thing] in that you’re a member of a small squad of space marines in ‘terminator’ armour (extra-super-duper heavy armour) making your way through a derelict spaceship to find and clear the objective room. The catch is that the spaceship is infested with angry, angry aliens (Genesteelers in [company=26][/company] lexicon) who want to stop you. And there are a lot of them. They are pretty dangerous with claws that cut through terminator armour very easily, but at least they don’t have acid for blood, so there’s that.

The game proceeds as your team clears each area and then advances. It’s a co-op and you all play against the game with a choice of around five or six from the eight or so marines each with various abilities. Then into the hulk you go, the game will control your surroundings and move the genesteelers about the place. From what I have seen it there is a fair bit of randomness in the movement so things don’t get predictable. This also adds a bit of tension to the gameplay.

I played with Mrs Fish and we tried to learn the game as we went, alas, the rulebook is not as well organised as it could be and several times we found ourselves confused and made a couple of mistakes which turned out to be pretty serious in game terms.

At the end of our game, in which we were slaughtered, Mrs Fish indicated that one play was enough for her for now. I kind of like the idea and want to play a bit more to see how it goes with another try, but I can’t see this displacing our other two go-to options for co-ops so when I get the chance I’ll try it solo and decide about it from there. 

Overall, it is a good looking little game, the components are all of excellent quality and the artwork very much fits into the whole 40k dark future sort of universe, but I’m just not sure how engaging the actual gameplay is.  I’ll give hang on to it and try to play a bit more on my own to really get across the system before I see if I can tempt Mrs Fish into another foray into the grim dark future...

Buen juego, cooperativo que aporta tensión infinita a pesar de solo tener un motor de cartas, que... funciona a la perfección. Temática para mi brutal (PEP) ya que vengo de Warhammer y me trae grandísimos recuerdos y a NANY le gusta también, pese al tema. Difícil de conseguir, si tenéis oportunidad de comprarlo... no lo dudéis.

The release of Space Hulk 2014 (and my purchase of said classic) re-energized my interest in this game.  During my original three plays in 2012 I missed tons of special powers on the action cards...the game is hard enough when you use all the capabilities you can.

I finally won a game.  Woohoo!  Raising my rating now that I've worked through the rules to a 7

Played with 2 and 3 people. Classic Ameritrash distilled into a combination of a card and board game. Easy to explain but enough strategy, variable set-up, fun theme that works, and it always ends up being tense by the end. I'm sure I'll buy the expansions.

UPDATE: Really? This procedure-heavy, Euro-centric, insufficiently thematic card game will dethrone Space Hulk? I simply don't know what FFG are up to. Time after time they acquire can't miss licenses and then mire them in Euro-formula. Where's the Ameritrash, I ask you? The combat in this game was as tepid and banal as that in StarCraft:tbg, asnd both games are all about combat. One lump or two?

Sounds really neat. Here's hoping it's good.

Sigh. Nice to know idiots are already rating a game they've never played...

A great tactical game, be it solo or co-op. I can see it eventually playing out with me and I'm not sure I want any other expansion (the one I have is extra marines that came in a trade). But until then, it's a LOT of game in a tiny box.
All expansion plays recorded against the base game.

Moved this on as I realised I'd nearly always choose to play Legendary Encounters or Project Elite over this for my alien survival co-op kicks.

Take my rating with a grain of salt since it it based on one solo game.  It's fun and thematic but lacked the same tension that I feel when I play Zulus on the Ramparts.  My rating may go up with more plays.  Update: Disregard my last remark; I was incorrectly playing the rule of not selecting the same action consecutively.  That explains my first game's lack of tension.

Feels like the movie, Aliens, in a really small box. There's quite a bit of game packed in here, but it's really fun. I wish there was a little more variety from game to game, since you're essentially just doing the same three actions over and over again, but otherwise this is a solid co-op.

Prefer this to Ghost Stories.

Players command teams of space marines making their way through a number of decks on the space hulk while fighting off aliens. Each space marine has a special ability and some appear to be more valuable than others. Major casualties in the early rounds make it tough. Good cooperation, communication and strategy are required to survive. I've played solo and cooperative games and enjoyed both.

Way more fun than it ought to be this game somehow manages to distil the Space Hulk experience into a compact coop card game.

RATING: 7.5
Rulebook took 2 full reads and 1 reference while playing, to get the mechanics... 
Not enough choices. All you're really doing is trying to maximize the few combinations you have at your disposal, all the time. It's like the culmination of an action-movie, meant to bring you into the high adrenaline moment of just barely making it. However, there's no build-up, and no pay-off.

Theme-wise, it just doesn't seem to grasp me.

Too bad, since I like the lore.

--- 

I still have this, and from time to time play it. So it must be doing something right. But I've so far (and I think I always will) play this game solo.

It's steadily become my game of choice for solo play, together with Onirim. I've gotten 2 expansion packs as well, so I'm bumping this up a little :)

This game is very fun but deadly. It is high strategy and high luck. Without good strategy, you are doomed anyway, even with good strategy, a few unlucky dice rolls can kill you. Well, strategy is probably the wrong word: You can't really set up a master strategy since you really don't know what's coming, you rather play turn by turn.
Definitely a recommendation.

Although it's a card game, it requires a lot of table space to play it.

Pros: Great art and theme. It's box doesn't take much space on the shelf. Great on solo.

Hands down the best solitare card game there is...  Especially if the Ameritrash Space Hulk setting is your thing.  The die rolls in this game are so unbelievably tense it's insane.  Corey K. has built an amazing array of powers, location effects, support token uses, and tyrannid abilities that REALLY delivers on theme, gameplay, and suspense.
[B]TTS Play:[/B] TTS module is really well done for this, although I still prefer rolling an actual die when possible.  Note that the Vassal module is also well done and doesn't require a program install to play.

A friend of mine who is a big fan of the Warhammer universe purchased this game, the Space Marine Pack 1, and Mission Pack 1 expansions.  He sleeved all the cards, then read the manual, and promptly packed it away.  When he learned that I enjoyed board games he brought it out of storage and asked if I could learn how to play, then teach him.  I took it home for the weekend and spent a night reading the rules and playing a couple of solo sample games.  I then took it to my FLGS and played with a buddy there.  My thoughts: I could take it or leave it.  There are some good things going on here, but altogether I think it is a lot of motion for not much game.  The theme works really well here with the concept of terrain in the location where your formation of marines are fighting.  Enemies spawn and you do battle.  That thematic integration carries the game pretty well, but in the end you are really looking at limited play.  You can make a choice to select one task among two options to use for your marines.  You then may have some follow-up choices, but in the end it is quite literally a roll of the dice.  I think my friend who is a Warhammer fan is really going to like this, but for me it didn't entice me into desiring my own copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't find any real fun in this game. There is a reliance on luck and dice rolling that I am not a fan of, and not enough ways to manipulate/mitigate that luck other than rerolling. The theme is pretty great, but the game itself just doesn't do anything for me.

When a game uses dice, it by the nature of dice, introduces randomness.  It is not likely that you can roll 6 times with a 50% chance of hitting and miss every time.  But, dice do not care about what is likely.

This game, so far, from what I can see, hinges completely on die rolls.  Yes, you can mitigate the effects and probabilities.  And you must do so to have a chance.

The question about such a game, is not whether the die makes a difference.  Rather, does the way the game plays make it worth while in spite of the rolls?  Is it fun and interesting to attempt to mitigate the die rolls?  I'm not sure yet. - update: Now I am.

I do find the effort worth the risk.  After playing several games, I find the journey to be exhilarating.  I carefully craft (read AP) my tactics, trying to mitigate the risk of short term losses in order to plan for the victory.  Every time I have a string of bad rolls, I do not find myself discouraged.  It really feels more like a challenge rather than a setback.

It is amazing how much variation has been packed into just a few elements (i.e. you can do a LOT of different things with just 2 marines, 2 facings, and 3 cards with 4 actions).

I am fortunate to have found yet another solo system that does not feel like the game is playing me.  I would have to say that this system is really smooth.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all of the time
-> The theme is not my favorite
-> While the variations are amazing, they are not as complex as the games I favor the most

RATING: 7
First impression (5- & 6-player) : The game was actually better than expected. It looks to scale pretty well with different player amounts (only amount of genestealers really changes) but takes too much time with 5- and 6-player so perhaps it might be best with just 3 or 4 players. It was way too easy when accidently played with 4-player "base card" (that determines # of 'stealers that appear) in 5-p game but seemed to be very hard (= good) when played with right with 6 players.

Needs a few more games to see if this is correct.

RATING: N/A
Cool art and theme and decent gameplay once you get it down. I rated it 5 simply because I find it so frustratingly hard to win. In fact, I've won once out of the dozen or so plays. And I've gotten to the final level maybe another couple times. Even playing with what others consider the strongest marine teams it's common for me to lose 2 or 3 in the first two levels. The dice play too big a role for my taste. It's hard to summon the energy to set this up when I go in to the game with little expectation of winning.
Edit: There is a thorough guide to this game here https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/101153/death-angel-complete-guide that is surely worthwhile reading for anyone wanting to improve their Space Hulk game. I've changed my rating to n/a since it doesn't seem fair to down-rate a game for which I haven't put in appropriate time to learn tactics and strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Brutally difficult co-op/solo card game. It is a touch more fiddly than I'd like--on a given turn (solo play) you might select 3 cards, shuffle some Marine cards around, fiddle with some tokens, discard some baddies, roll some dice, shuffle some baddies around, draw new baddies, flip a room card, refresh terrain cards and blip piles, and repeat.

That said, it's one of the better games I have for solo play. Getting to the final room as the lone surviving Marine barely hits the objective is exhilarating.

Un bon petit jeu "portable" puisqu'il est dans une petite boîte stylée. Et pas n'importe quel petit jeu puisqu'il s'agit ici d'un jeu de coopération avec un thème WH40K Spaces Marines vs GeneStealers (genre de créatures moitié humaines moitié Alien®). Il va falloir survivre jusqu'au bout du vaisseau Space Hulk pour venir à bout de la mission.
Ce que j'ai beaucoup apprécié, en plus du fait que le jeu soit dur, mais pas trop, c'est la gestion de la coopération. Les joueurs jouent cartes non visibles et ne doivent pas révéler leurs cartes mais uniquement la stratégie globale qui sera mis en oeuvre avec l'escouade. Il y a égalment un système d'event qui ne doit pas être révélé par le joueur qui le lit jusqu'à ce que ce même joueur choisisse, seul, la ou les cibles de cet event. J'ai trouvé cet aspect vraiment original qui pallie grandement au problème de l'effet leader des jeux de coopération.
Il y a une grande rejouabilité puisque les lieux sont tirés au hasard bien qu'il n'y ait pas beaucoup de scénarios différents selon le nombre de joueurs.
Le facteur chance est aussi bien géré avec les différents pouvoirs de chaque binome de space marines.
Un bon jeu à tester au moins une fois si on aime les jeux coopératifs.

10/2010
Overwhelmingly negative reactions from my friends after the first play (5 players): The game fell flat because of 
- "too much randomness" (game description suggests you can plan well, but it's actually rather limited), 
- quick player elimination ("What? Now I'll have to sit and wait for half an hour?!") 
- very few tactical options and boring combat system ("Rolling the dice is just like throwing a coin!"). 

I personally liked the game feeling, and I think it's really okay as a filler (although it might take too,long to play), but as long as I'll be playing with my current group, I am sure the game won't hit the table soon again.

UPDATE 08/2012
I still enjoy the game, though I doubt that it is suitable for 4 or more players. The marines get killed really quickly, resulting in early player elimination. Could factually become an unintended solo game.

Rule book is badly structured in the usual FFG manner. I think I'm going to rewrite it soon, strictly putting the rules under the respective step.

My impression is that this game can indeed provide a play experience similar to the original Space Hulk, only with higher complexity and a longer playing time – also, on the good side, at a lower price and with better availability. I'd much prefer to play the original SH, though.

RATING: 5
Hard to grasp rules, as I find often the case with Fantasy Flight rulebooks, which tend to make the games harder to learn than they should be (kind of like letting the computer science guy write the how-to-use manual). Not a good sign when a rulebook lists two editors and both of them somehow missed the spelling of "seperate" under "Setup". More to the point, however, the explanation of rules, even the setup, are unclear (pages 21-22, the explanation of spawning Genestealers, is a perfect example, as, if I was deliberately trying to connfuse people about this rule, I couldn't have done a better job than what's printed--only when I found a setup video did I understand what was meant), so I would expect that many players should expect a longer-than-necessary learning curve for a game rated complexity 2.4 (as of July 15, 2014). I'm also not encouraged by comments of some Geeks that the quality of playing the game isn't worth the effort of learning it. Purchased, December 2012.

Realized I don't like to play board games solo. Much rather play with another human being. Also realized I don't like to play coop games without an engaging and enduring story line. If it is all just tactical play, I'd much rather play a competitive game. Tried the game once but just didn't enjoy it all that much. Now if only they could make this into an app...

This game has a very steep learning curve and is pretty unforgiving. My first game and a few since then have seen my whole squad wiped out in the first room. The rule book is much maligned. I think it flows well enough. The game is fiddly though and you do have to be on your toes to avoid accidentally cheating; the worst possible fate to befall the solo garmer.

Got this for solo play. I like it pretty well. It's pretty random, though: you can only do your best, and then the die rolls decide your fate. There are enough choices and details to make the game captivating, and you can win--sometimes.

RATING: 8
To early to rate, as my play wasn't a full play.  But it was a fun play.  The game felt very tense, and the decisions felt important.  I liked that you couldn't just lay your cards out and have on person decide everything for the group.  The inclusion of the "instinct" events (the person resolving the event must decide what to do without consulting the group) were a clever touch, and something that I expect to see in more co-op games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of the more boring co-ops I've played. You control two guys each, and they're mixed and spread along a long line. Baddies appear at various points along the line. Basically you've got to kill them, so each team plays a card to either move along the line into killing range, or try to kill (roll a die at 50%) or play a support function to get support tokens out which will help with defence or future kills. Then the baddies roll dice to try and kill any team member it's next to, then more baddies come out and/or move in a really fiddly gamery non-thematic way (you say the corridors move towards each other if he dies? huh?), rinse, lather, repeat. Because it's meant to be frenetic corridor killing action, it's thematically correct to limit the amount of communication teams can have, but you can do some clever things if you move / action in the right order. Sometimes. Usually it's obvious what to do with your powers so there's little sense of key decision making, ie that you're dramatically influencing the result with your decisions. The end-game condition belatedly appears and it can be easy or ridiculously hard depending on how things have gone to date, so there's another random blow on top of all the random die-rolling which characterises success or failure throughout. To finish off, the rules are a mess as well, and the game usually plays long, so this is for those that are thematically blinded.

RATING: 10
Talk about your Kobayashi Maru of Warhammer 40K! This game kicks your butt! But I love the atmosphere of the game. The mechanics seem intuitive once you,ve really got the rules down. Winning, however, is a different story. You really have to think and cooperate your way through to survive as long as you can. Much replayability. This one is a keeper, for me.

Rules are confusing; need many readthroughs. This is a game better to learn directly from someone; thanks for the video tutorials people have made.

I love this game, but here is what may turn people off:
the puzzly strategies for survival, the violent atmosphere, the awesome gruesome artwork, the deadly results of dice rolls, and the confusing rules.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Very Portable
- Clever mechanics, and good use of theme
- Difficult decisions and short/long-term tradeoffs

What I don't like:
- One roll of one die can kill half your forces
- Took WAY too long with 4p (95 minutes after rules/setup)
- Player elimination
- Theme of religious military warriors

My first solo game took 100 minutes (I made it to the last room, although possibly by accidentally cheating a bit). My next two solo games took 30 minutes each. Maybe I had a rule wrong in the first one.

I don't love it with 1 or 2 players, because I don't like to control just one pair of marines. But with 4 players it took 95 minutes, so that was no good either. Maybe 3p is the sweet spot?

I'll go along with the BGG-voted weight of 2.3 Once you know the game, it's pretty smooth.

This game was disappointing. I'm getting a bit tired of "The Card Game" version of games... This one looks great, but to me the mechanics don't work, it's too random... And the price is too high for a card game, and now they made an expansion for this game and will probably do more since the expansions is called "Mission Pack 1"... I really disliking this... I read another comment of someone which was probably one of the most accurate remarks I've heard in a long time: FFG seem to be making products, not games!

This one is a clear example of that...

- The rules could be better structured, although as you read the rules it tells you where you can read more about a certain subject, but if you need to look something up as quick reference, you're doomed to be slain by the genestealers!

I like the feel of this game - it really brings you into the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The instructions aren't great but you can find simplifications and summaries on BGG. My problem with this game is that it is extremely difficult in 1 player mode (the way I play it). I have played games that were shorter than the set up because I got slaughtered straight off. I think making it that if the genestealers roll equal to their number that is a miss (only lower will do) and giving 3 starting support tokens should help!

Based on one play: A co-operative game where you fight off gene stealers. You control two marines/mechs and decide whether to attack, support or move & activate each turn. You must work as a team supporting others when needed in order to pass through the different levels in the area and then kill off the gene stealers. Fairly straightforward but some good co-operative and fun to play.

Never got to play this one. The components were nice though, but the rulebook was hideous. They must've set on a quest of "how difficult can we make a fairly simple game by ruining the rulebook?"

EDIT: I gave this a second chance, and wow, that was a good call. This is probably the best co-op I've ever played. It's simple, intense and has lots of interesting choices. I love the theme, and the wonderful sensation of taking out a huge genestealer swarm delivers every time it happens. The game is tough, and every final die roll has me on the edge of the seat.

Fun game to play solo. Very challenging to win as any Gene Stealers that you don't kill on the current level follow you to the next. You can quickly find yourself overwhelmed! Each pair of Space Marines have unique abilities. If you randomly choose your teams, you have to adapt your strategy to the teams you have. Very good game for the money.

-Not sure where I sit with the whole relying entirely on a die roll mechanic. It's got some ways to re-roll, but it seems to always roll numbers and never skulls [like seriously ever].

Have only played solo and the rules are pretty badly written in places - luckily the rule book isn't a magnum opus so after the first few games I'm pretty much sure of 95% of the rules.

Since I can only comment on solo play I'll simply say this...

The game is fast, nailbitingly tense and very thematic. I can imagine the uneasy terminators knee deep in xeno body parts and their bolter's barrel blackened and smoking in the dim, flickering light of the cold metallic hulk corridors.

At times it can be a really hard decision choosing which card to play and even though the game relies almost entirely on luck, if I lose the game I don't feel short changed, it just encourages me to ready another squad of terminators and embark for the hulk once more.

Recommended for those who want a space hulk fix without the months of effort of collecting, painting and finding an opponent. I was playing this within a few hours of it's arrival!

Highly luck based, where games can be decided by one or two rolls of a single die. This can create a situation of intense frustration or create a situation of joyously overcoming significant odds. Not a huge fan of the movement of monsters, as all too often it creates a swarm too big to deal with and you know almost immediately that you've lost.

HOWEVER, the game is strangely addicting for solo play, and one I play often when I have 30 minutes to kill.

I really like playing this game with my son. It is very hard, as any typical coop game should be. I like the design of the space marines, and the Genestealers moving around all the time make for a very entertaining fight. The special powers of the marines, as well as the semi-randomness when determining actions are a nice touch. I have even played this one as a solo experience and found it entertaining. I would suggest this one for younger ones and people that really like the Space Hulk concept, but can't afford the tons of money to get the 3rd edition box.

RATING: 8.75
It's great to see a version of this game packed into such a small box. While this is obviously a very different game to the original Space Hulk, it does capture some of the same feeling.

The biggest change is probably that it plays as a co-op game and supports a range of player numbers, so nobody needs to play the part of the Genestealers (for those gamers who would prefer things this way). Of course, that may be a negative for those who enjoy playing as the aliens.

The way the Action Cards provide each Combat Team with different abilities is quite clever and doesn't over-complicate the rules. There are also some nice ideas in the terrain cards. However, I would have liked to see a little more variety and quantity of both location & terrain cards for repeat plays. Maybe there are plans for future addons...?

For a card game, it can take up quite a lot of table space, though this reduces slightly throughout the game as marines enevitably fall along the way.

The rules are a bit jumbled with way too many references, but fairly clear after a bit of effort. There is a lot less setup involved than the board game version and the game is fairly streamlined, so it can move along quickly - as long as you don't tgake too long mulling over who will do what this turn! There are plenty of small decisions, so enough to keep your interest, but not too much to bog down.

Components are excellent, although I would have preferred the card art to be a little brighter and/or have more contrast. Depending on lighting conditions, it can be tough to tell some of the Combat Teams apart as their colours are dark & quite similar. Also, the only other important pieces of information on the Combat Team cards are the marines' names & their attack range, both of which could have used a slightly larger font.

The dark borders on the cards isn't an issue once they are sleeved.

I can't stand this game any more. It annoys me. Gameplay is way too fiddly regardless of the game having so few components. Rules are obscure. You struggle to understand what is what. Facing, corridor, range, clearing a room, travelling. Nothing makes sense. You do not get the spacial feeling required for a game to seem claustrophobic at all!

Seriously. I won't be playing this game ever again!

It's frustrating to line up your toughest terminators on a swarm of genestealers, and then just inexplicably kill none of them because you rolled poorly, and then roll a zero and get your best man killed. That is not good. There are some things such as variable player powers that sorta help mitigate the randomness, but in the remains of the day you're still rolling a d6 to see what happens.

Not sure how I feel, but instinctively I'm pretty sure this game got problems.

Not keen on the W40K Universe in the first place. I found the game too fiddly and all the setting up throughout the game takes longer than the actual playing time. The game is deceiptively simple, despite all the different actions on the cards and comes down to two die rolls. Not my cup of tea.

* Enjoyable and fairly quick, good for large groups and others seemed to enjoy it.

Originally bought it because I really liked Warhammer 40k at the time (and still do, just not as much) and wanted to share that theme with friends in a co-op game. After playing it solo a couple of times (and having some really great experiences), I concluded that this game should just be for me to play solo. The rulebook sucks, and this would be a major pain to teach people (and wouldn't flow well with more than one player IMO, never tried it though). The character abilities are cool, but a lot of the interactions in game are unclear. Fun to whip out every once in a while for that dark theme though. It feels like it has very limited replay value, even with the customizable maps.

Update, Feb 17, 2011

This is staying at a 5. Awful, awful rules. I first learned this game at a convention, with only ourselves to learn the rules. Because of the awful rules, the game left a very bad impression.

I then finally played this again with a big fan of the game who explained the rules properly and clearly. Big difference, since this is an simple game to play.

As a co-operative game, it does its job; most players are actively involved in deciding what to do. You usually don't have too much of the Scotland Yard syndrome in which one person directs all the action. I think this is the case because each player has three action cards with unique powers. I don't think anyone is patient enough to find out and remember the powers for every player. Hence, people have to talk ...

Even though the game presents a compelling puzzle to solve (and co-operative games are just that, puzzles to solve as a group), the luck factor is so huge. Perhaps that's the point of the game. I suppose there's some entertainment value of watching the game/system totally annihilate you.

To be fair, I'm not a fan of Fantasy Flight Ameritrash games. At least Death Angel is short and not that rule-bloated.

------------

2010-11-29: Very, very fiddly card game.

The core of the game is about managing a queue of cards representing all the players' space marines. All players are using their limited actions to manoeuvre this queue so that they can better attack monsters on both sides of this queue. This itself is an interesting challenge, but because almost everything in the game is represented by cards, it's quite cumbersome visually.

Birthday present. Have played three times (solo) and have lost twice (close calls) and won once (only lost a single marine). Note sure yet if the game relies too much on luck, as my win seemed to be down to a fortuitous mix of good dice rolling and helpful events at just the right time. Had loads of fun, considering I was playing solo, so current rating is an 8, pending further plays.

UPDATE: Have now played some two-player games. Yes, there is loads of luck involved, and some games are a walk in the park because the dice is on your side. Game is still great fun, very tense, very thematic. Some people will hate the chaos but I really enjoy this game.

UPDATE UPDATE: Played some three-player games. I am not sure how much skill (if any) is involved. There are definitely choices. And you can play "well." But playing "well" doesn't mean you win. It means you lose less spectacularly.

As co-op games go, it's an okay experience but doesn't solve any of the normal co-op problems: strong personalities "play the game" for weaker ones, the game play is mechanically just "throw some dice" and there's no real incentive not to just drone your characters for the good of the team.

Strong theme but not compelling to me. Possibly more interesting if they expand it with personal goals, play verses player, or a deeper narrative.

The most frustrating conga line you'll ever take part on.

Decision space is essentially limited to 2 options per squad per turn. Luckily, that doesn't matter, because it's all going to be decided on the roll of a die anyway! Why bother? The game is mostly tactical, since with few exception of support tokens and room features, you are essentially reacting. But (a) things can shift dramatically from a turn to the next and (b) several of your actions "lag" (need to be set-up turns in advance). You can probably see how this can lead to a lot of frustration...

This is a very solid card puzzle game that actually benefits from solo play. The theme is very strong and the game mechanics are very clever. It is tough but very rewarding and so invites many replays.

My only issue is that the key moments come down to dice rolls which may add tension but also seems at odds with the puzzle nature of the game.

Death Angle is franchised from the infinitely superior Space Hulk board game, a practice that annoys me a great deal as invariably the new game has nothing in common with the old one.
Rather than a tactical wargame for two players you will get a solo to six player co-operative, somewhat lacking elegance as it is a Fantasy Flight game. It is a reasonable co-operative, and has an interesting 'instinct' mechanic which forces players to make their own decisions (some co-ops often end up with the best player at the table just taking everyones turn for them). On the other hand it has a military theme, and a lot of the success of co-ops (think Pandemic) is they appeal to the sort of people who doin't like military themes.
I've played a few solo games through and established that it is a purely tactical turn by turn response game, in which the Marine player is trying to maximise his kills of genestealers. The game as balanced seems a little too easy, I suspect it needs to be adjusted by some sort of 'bravado' rule in which players bid for how many extra genestealers there are at the start.

It's a fun game for any number of people, though the more interested minds, the better.

I finally won my first solo game on my third attempt after reviewing what I had been doing wrong: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/577108/what-am-i-doing-wrong-the-list-of-possible-mistake

This is a tough game to crack in terms of trying to manage the luck of both the card draw and die roll but it really captures the theme well and after a few plays it also starts to draw you into the characters involved.

My current rating of 8 reflects my initial thoughts with regards to this as a solitaire filler game and I'll be interested to see how this game plays with a group given the possibility of early combat team elimination due to the intrinsic Space Marine high casualty rate...

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Interesting cooperative game, which brings out the theme of space marines versus genestealers quite a bit. Each turn, you take actions and try to kill gene-stealers. If you don't succeed, marines start dying.

[b]Good Things:[/b]
:d10-1: It's thematic. Even though you're Marines aren't physically moving across the table, it really feels like they're advancing and fighting through a large vessel. Genestealers come pouring out of the ducts at the most inopportune locations. The event deck helps a lot.
:d10-2: I like the tactical feel. Each combat team is different, and each marine within the team is different. Some have special abilities, some are regular line marines. These differences give the player many decisions to make when planning his turn. The decisions feel meaningful and tie in with the theme.
:d10-3: The game is challenging. There are no guarantees a player will be victorious. Death for the marines will often come abruptly and even when the odds are in your favor.
:d10-4: Playtime is fairly quick; just about right for what the game is. It does not drag on with routine and monotonous decisions. 
:d10-5: The game is fun. Blasting genestealers, pulling off big kills and surviving improbable odds while making the right tactical plays is exciting. By the same token, losing your marines to bad luck or when they miss easy shots adds to the tension and theme.
:d10-6: The game will occupy hardly any space on your shelf. Don't worry about needing to get rid of one to make space for this.

[b]What isn't entirely positive:[/b]
:d10-1: Some players may not enjoy that one bad die roll or a series of rolls can overwhelm your good tactical decisions. It may feel too luck based, or bad luck based.
:d10-2: Setup time takes longer than I would like. Even though the game comes in a tiny box, it seems to take longer than it should to separate the different decks and the few counters.
:d10-3: Learning the game rules, processes, and mechanics may be difficult due to the way the rulebook is written. While I don't find the rulebook to be bad, I also don't think it was written as effectively as possible. I have a lot of patience for rulebooks, though I know others don't have the patience for a rulebook that is not clear & concise. It will likely leave new players scratching their heads & constantly returning to the book to search out an answer to a question about game flow or mechanics for the first several games.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I don't have any play time in with 2 or more players. My experience, and comments above, are based entirely on solitaire plays at this point. I do believe this is a great game at a great value for $20 or less. It should offer many players a good deal of replay value. I recognize the theme, luck based mechanics, and rules will not suit everyone. But I think thematic gamers, card gamers, and solitaire gamers will more often than not find something to enjoy & appreciate here.

--Nov2010-- I'm sure this would be more amusing for someone that knew (or even appreciated) the setting.  The whole _Space Hulk_ thing is no doubt very delightful.  Outside any context, though, the game is matter of surviving a partially interesting, partially strange set of rather odd constraints.  And it's a co-op, with all the "one person easily over-recommends' baggage that entails.
I'm happy to play, at least occasionally, but it's not one I'd buy.

Rule book is bad.  Rule book is bad to the point of being prohibitive to young, inexperienced, or impatient gamers.  I can't give a copy of this game to my nephew who would likely enjoy it very much because he'd never get through the first turn.

  I'd wager 50% of the copies sold are never played due to the entry-barrier presented by the initial exposition of the core concepts of the game.  I received a second-hand copy that came to me super-clean, apparently never played.  That's a lost sale.  I should own a copy that was purchased new, especially at this price point.  250 people should not be looking to trade this game.

FFG needs to reach the conclusion that [i]the rulebook [u]is[/u] the game.[/i]

The game itself appears to be solid, a multi-player true cooperative with a lot of thematic elements and plenty of options to choose from.  The artistic aspects of the package are unified and beautiful.  The rules were too small and too terse to make determining which cards were which easy and understandable.  First-time setup on this game took entirely too long.

The cards themselves would have benefited from labels indicating what they are.  Here's a tip -- if it's an "event deck" consider writing "event deck" on it.  Trust me -- no one will mind.  This is how you move a new player into a game.  This is how you establish a relationship with a new customer.  This is how you sell games.

RATING: N/A
Very enjoyable and eventful both played alone and in a group. The setting is easy to imagine and the mechanics don't get in the way. I like the instinct cards, they're a good way to keep everyone involved. In part they prevent an alfa-player from taking over because everyone will likely get to make decision with those cards. You could even ensure that easily and houserule event cards to be drawn in turn by everyone instead of the 'active player' being responsible.

The only downside is the rather small number of different locations you'll see. There are lots of combinations, but few single locations are memorable.

In the end, it's a co-op, and those have been shown to have low mileage with me. It's one of the best, most enjoyable ones I've played, but it's still a co-op. And, fun as it may have been played alone, I don't want to play alone. I'd rather do something else then.

I love this game. It's actually really simple. There's a lot of strategy, although once you figure out the techniques, your choices each turn are fairly clear. The luck is very real, but you don't feel that you have no power. It's hard as balls, and rightly so. Sometimes you have a freak game in which your dudes walk over all opposition and you win with 0.00% casualties. And you're like "I'm disappointed in you, game." Then you go back and play again. And everyone is dead but for one guy by the second room, and he's covered in 20 tall stacks of aliens on both flanks and you're thinking "That's more like it." 

And, crikey, is this game epic when luck and skill come together. When it's down to the wire and your three traumatized, viscera splattered warriors are facing off with the mother alien and her minions, and your Swordly Sergeant single-handedly faces down the charging horde and swords them all to death in a stream of skulls, it's incredibly exhilarating. You're basically cheering him on. 

And it is skill. Placement. Full awareness of what each Space Marine is used for. Making sure the grunts get killed first. Some are your cleaners, who hose down the foe. Some are your armored tanks, who can stop towering masses of Genestealers on their own. 

I had one game in which we were down to our last legs, with two survivors in the toxin pumping station. My shield and hammer sergeant and my psychic force-barrier dude. And they were up against a 20+ tall stack of aliens. And had to kill them all to win. And we did. By bouncing the grotesque foe back and forth between energy wall and metal shield, and chipping away. 

The Blood Angels are all unique and useful in certain situations, and they all die like flies when things go south, which they do, and often. But you can still win, with enough guts and brutal efficiency. But you can always still lose. And with even a smidgen of imagination, inspired by the Alien series or 40k, it's ALWAYS one hell of a story.

Excellent solitaire play.

This seems to be very highly thought of and I'm not sure why. Combat is purely dice based with very little you can do to modify the outcome, which leads the game to feel like "roll 100 times and see if you win the game". It's entirely possible for your entire squad of marines to be killed off in the first turn, then to be in exactly the same position another time and yet survive for most of the game. I don't mind a good dollop of random chance, but Death Angel goes way too far. You might as well just toss a coin for an hour.

RATING: 8
If I remember correctly, this was my second solo/co-op game (after Ghost Stories). I really enjoy the atmosphere this game creates with just some cards. 

The game really keeps you on your toes, it can feel as if victory is within your grasp, and then it suddenly spawns a new wave of genestealers and victory gets taken away from you again. This makes winning the game feel all the more rewarding. 

If, after some time, the genestealers become a bit boring, it is easily remedied with the Tyranid Enemy Pack.

The theme is great as is the basic concept for a light filler of moving through rooms and clearing out the aliens.

A lot of back and forth, hoping things go your way.

I've played several games of this with a gaming group and HATED it. The game created a lot of confusion and the person teaching the game didn't know the rules well which created a very sour experience for all involved.

I still have no interest in playing this game as a group, there is too much deliberation and everyone really needs to know the game to have it run smoothly.

Solo though, I am impressed. A tight and challenging game, I think 2p would work fine as well. 3p I am less confidant about (too many space marines to look after, maybe 3p with 1 team per player using the 1p setup would be good), 4 might work, if the rules were thoroughly understood. I will never play this game at 5 of 6, not even if the game's designer was cloned 4 times and it was me and 5 of him. Never.

My rating reflects my feelings toward solo play and my assumptions of this game as a 2p game. Past that go play something else.

So I picked this up at a bookstore a few years back on sale. Get home, break it open, okay, looks cool, boxed it up, put it on the game shelf, and never touched it again. A couple years later; I stumble on this cool little box on our game shelf, cracked open the box, read the rules, played a couple of really tense games... Holy Crap, why did I wait so long?! I'm still playing, trying out different tactics, still loosing, and loving it!

This little guy hits many of my high marks; affordable, potable, dripping in theme, very hard to win, plays in about an hour, and plays great solitaire. Feels like a big game in a small box. Defenitly worth checking out.

Got this for Christmas (2010) and played it 4 times yesterday.  3 losses and 1 emphatic win.  It's an impressive design - so many ideas packed into a little box.  As others have mentioned, success is highly luck dependent (as it is in the boardgame as well), and it can be painful to lose a marine on the first roll of the game (vs. a single gene-stealer).  But there's also a significant dose of strategy involved, and the decisions you make absolutely affect the outcome of the game.  When to attack and when to save your attack for a subsequent round becomes a crucial issue.  At first I didn't understand the power of doors, but in my one win, they played a prominent role in my success. I can see myself pulling this out every couple weeks for a couple quick solitaire games.

Update:  I still like this game.  As predicted, I pull this off the shelf every now and then when my schedule permits and play a couple rounds solo.  Always tight and very satisfying to win.  Haven't bought the Print-on-Demand expansions from FF, but mostly because they're clearly overpriced.

Update (Dec, 2012):  I might be over this game.  The last couple times I've pulled it out, it's just felt a bit too fiddly for what it offers.  Some of that FFG over-design getting in the way.  Thematic, sure.  Tough, you bet.  But not getting as much solitaire play-time as I thought it would.

2013: 8. Really impressed with this game's design, packing the feeling of fighting aliens in tight corridors into a card game. The "spine" of marines is really brilliant.

I think the game works best solitaire, I have more fun that way.  Adding more people is ok, but because the game is so "small" in scope and play area on the table, I think it's terribly easy for one player to completely take over the decision making.  No fault of the game, I just think it's better for one player.

2014: 8. Have been playing the game more often lately after a long time sitting on my shelf.  Picked up Tyranid pack and have been experimenting with other game variants/house rules: the "token flips dice up one or down" rule to help mitigate the brutal randomness of the die; tokens can be used regardless of facing, and the fire team "drafting" rules to balance weaker and stronger teams. (see forums)  Feels good with these modifications.  Still best as a solitaire game though.

This is the game that shifted my acquisition priority from multiplayer games to single player games.
The game play was clever and used innovative mechanics (at the time) to saturate you with atmosphere.
You quickly grew to empathise with the marines you controlled, participating in their struggle against the horde and sharing their triumphs.

Although the luck of a single die roll is normally a bad thing, in this case it allowed you to feel the thrill of suspense, anticipation and release without breaking you out of the narrative.
You are still able to think about your decisions, weighing up the odds to choose the best path, but knowing a resolution is coming in a single blow.

This was the first game to demonstrate the fraudulent idea behind trying a game once to see if you like it or not.
I was honestly thinking this was a complete luck-fest for my first few games and that it would fill a gap now and then. 
However the theme appealed to me enough to keep me playing through the losses (and wins), which then enabled me to discover some luck mitigation strategies.
Hint: [i]You really need to be aware of all the information presented to you when playing, and think everything through.[/i]

One of the worst team games ever.I'd rather play anything else.  This game is completely boring.  The theme is pasted on and you really just guess on what should be done next.  The characters abilities are bland.  Try space hulk instead.

When I played this game I was pretty bored and found myself asking "why was this game ever made?". Honestly I couldn't figure it out. It's nothing like Space Hulk. But it is hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I generally don't like co-op boardgames but this has to be the lowest of the low. The cards look nice. That's about it.. 

Co-op crap at it's worst!

The claustrophobic feeling produced by the formation and genestealer spawning is what makes this game great. Accompanied by the tactics that need to be understood to survive along with Space Marine's special abilities leads to great moments where you conquer the Tyranid force or scummed to it in last stand. Fun from solo all the way to six players.

If you are just in the mood for hanging out, beating some things up (or getting beat up), and not strategizing too much then this works.  I think other games could fill that roll better however.

The more I play the game the less I like it.  For several plays it was entertaining, but the more I played the more the balance annoyed me.  Between the factions, some abilities are just straight up more useful than others.  Also, the luck of the dice heavily influences the outcome of the game more than any strategy you could come up with.

Kooperatív szörnygyilkolós menekülős játék a Warhammer világából. Mivel a világot egyáltalán nem ismerem így számomra téma egyáltalán nem jött át. A játék engem az  	
Aliens: This Time It's Warra emlékeztetett. Csak itt akár hatan is menekülhetünk a helyszíneken keresztül. A hat különböző csapatnak két-két tagja van, ezeket irányítják a játékosok, akik három különböző akcióból egyet választhatnak a körükben annak tudatában, hogy a következő körben az az akció nem választható. A mozgás/aktiválással helyet lehet változtatni a függőlegesen egymás alatt elhelyezkedő katonák között, illetve meg lehet fordulni. A támadással egyet támadni lehet a gonosz szörnyek ellen, illetve a támogatással kvázi egy újradobási lehetőséget lehet adni valaki számára. Ezen felül minden csapat rendelkezik az akcióhoz tartozó valamilyen bónusszal. A szörnyek az egyes helyszíneken különböző módon kerülnek a katonák mellé. A cél a 4. helyszínig eljutni és ott vagy mindenkit likvidálni vagy egy speciális dolgot véghezvinni. A játék rendkívül nehéznek tűnik és persze szerencsefüggő, hisz egy kocka dönt a támadások sikerességéről és a védekezésről is. Ettől függetlenül szerintem nem rossz játék és kis helyen elfér. Talán kicsit tovább tart, mint kellene. Ha rövidebb lenne, egy ponttal többet érne nálam.

All I can say about this is...DAMN THAT DIE! It is seriously made from pure evil. The game is pretty fun and a good tactical adventure, but the die rolls kill the excitement. It's tough to play for a half-hour, only to lose because you rolled poorly at the wrong time.

Space Hulk lite.  It's pretty entertaining for such a compact design (both in rules and size).  It probably plays better solo than with a group, but I think I got my moneys worth.

RATING: 2
Lost its luster after about 4 games. Compared to real Space Hulk, this card version really comes down to just luck. 

There are not real meaningful decisions or anything. You can change the luck by very miniscule percentages.

Each marine after the first turn, only has 2 choices for the rest of the game. This or that over and over again.

BLEAH!

Rating after 1 complete play and two partial plays.  First two times I played it I played it horribly wrong.  Third time I only played it a bit wrong.  The rules need a serious rewrite, I think.

I tried, but SHDA didn't grab me like I thought (hoped) it would.  I've been a huge fan of the original Space Hulk, and Space Crusade, but this felt like no more than turning cards, (often lop-sided) die-rolling, and some clunky mechanics.  Very nicely produced/artwork etc, and I highly recommend printing, laminating and playing with Viktor Csete's excellent playmat.  Obviously a great game for many - just not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
I like the theme and how the game is structured. It is challenging. Sometimes it is overwhelming (brutal). 

It plays very well as a "solo" game. I play it solo with 4 teams.

The main aspect that I do not like is the dice rolling. You get only a 50% chance of hitting an alien swarm, and if the dice do not roll your way, it gets very frustrating very quickly.  So I cheat once in a while by ignoring the dice results.  I wish there was a more player-controllable mechanic for battle.

3 solo plays, with Red/Yellow/Blue teams

Kind of a cool design, but just not for me since:
- I don't like cooperative games
- I don't play solo
- I don't know anything about the game universe
- The randomness of the d6 rolls can be somewhat annoying!
However, I may play a few more times, just to test out the other teams.

Each player plays a team of 2 marines; if playing 1-3, play with multiple teams/player. Every team is a unique pair of marines, with each one having its own special ability. The game requires you to travel through several locations (random subset of cards) and accomplish whatever the final location requires. Along the way, you'll face swarms of Genestealers who appear in random order and position. The trick is to figure out how best to use your particular combination of marines to survive (or sacrifice the less useful ones as needed!). And, you need to manage your hand(s) so that the formation (all the players) is able to maneuver and attack as needed every turn (each team has 3 orders, but may not use the same one in successive turns). Surprisingly, you do get a bit of the feel of a tactical game as you play out the turns!

The rules are fairly clear, but jumbled in a way that makes it a bit difficult to get through those initial plays correctly. A better player aid would have been great!

SOLO Core Game
Fun Game. As all coop games not so easy at the start. Much luck - because of the use of a dice.
In my opinion you can't play it very often - the games are to similar and to much luck depended on the dice.

I've only played this solo and have had some enjoyable games. I would like to play it co-operative and see how it works with others.

The game just hasn't grabbed me that much.

RATING: 6
This is a completely card-driven cooperative game set in the Space Hulk universe.  In it each player plays a set of space marines that are lined up in the center of the table.  Each round the players will play one of 3 cards from their hand to move, support, or attack aliens.  Then the aliens attack back and an event happens before repeating this process in the following round.  The goal is to kill enough aliens to progress through 4 different locations.

I've heard it said by many people in the industry that we are in the midst of the boardgaming Renaissance.  I tend to agree with that statement.  The industry is big and growing each year.  There are tons of outlets to use to produce and discover great games and even more outlets to get any and all information you could want on any game.  Why am I bringing this up?  Because this is a fine game.  And with so much available to us in this day and age, "fine" is a failing grade.

There are just too many good games out there for this to be anything more than an "also ran".  Granted, this game was produced 4 years ago but that simply means that while it might have been a good game once upon a time it just didn't remain competitive in today's boardgaming environment.  There's just not enough here to hold my interest past more than one play.  Each round is so formulaic and sleepy.  You just play one of only 3 cards and roll a die a couple times, rinse, repeat.  The cards are varied among players and do some interesting things...the first couple times you play them.  But you play them over and over and over again, they lose their flair really fast.

All of the combat is decided with the roll of a six-sided die.  No modifiers, the only thing you can do is spend a support token to re-roll.  If you hit an alien it dies, if the alien hits you, you die.  This isn't exciting or tense.

Speaking of not tense.  I think the worst problem is that this game commits the cardinal sin of cooperative games.  It's too easy!  I never felt in danger of losing and we went through the first half of the game 100% clearing the locations between rounds and not losing a single marine.  Out of 8 marines, we finished the game with 6.  Cooperative games need to beat you up a bit to be interesting, in my opinion.  Otherwise my eyes wander and I start looking at the clock for when it's over.

Like I said, there's nothing really BAD about it, it's just not something worth playing next to the hundreds of other coops out there, dozens of which are much, much better.  Once you know what you're doing this game does go quickly and it is all just a deck of cards so it has a small footprint and is portable.  But other, better games also fit these criteria.  I don't see any point to it unless you are a huge Space Hulk fan.

I am not sure if you are aware of this or not; but I am a fan of Space Hulk.  So when this was announced, this immediately became a blip on my radar.  I wasn’t initially exited about FFG putting their spin on "my" game; but for $25 I thought I’d give it a shot and decided to purchase it.  It is a difficult Co-op to win, but only the good co-op’s are.  I was surprised how well the game maintained the theme.  It also presents a good amount of tension as the players try to overcome the Genestealer hoard.  I give it an 8.

I know the people who are rating this game low are doing so because either (1) they are comparing it to Space Hulk or (2) they think it is "too hard".  Well the game takes the theme of Space Hulk and translates it into a card game, and does so well, in my opinion.  As for it being too hard?  Any co-op game that does not provide a real challenge is pretty boring, so I am happy for the difficulty level.

I'm not gobsmacked by Death Angel, but I like it. You could even say I find it addicting: I played 14 times in the space of 5 days. With a collection as large as mine, that's saying a lot.

If I were trying to find fault, I'd say that the basic tactical situation doesn't vary as much as I'd like, and that there isn't much actual movement. Theoretically your marines are moving, but the successive levels come to them rather than you physically moving them towards the new levels.

There are other small points I could quibble about, but they are all from a simulation perspective, and this isn't a sim. What it is is a small footprint, quick playing tactical game that captures the Space Hulk flavor well and provides an excellent challenge. It more than carries its weight given the small price tag.

My rating and comments are based entirely on solo play, but the game does support up to 6 players. Even if I never play it with others, Death Angel is sufficiently worthwhile solo to have earned a permanent spot in my collection. Recommended.

Space Hulk has an impressive amount in such a small box.

It's a fun game, and managed to recreate a lot of the classic Space Hulk feel.

Does a remarkable job of distilling Space Hulk's tension and atmosphere into a portable, card-driven co-op package.

Luck still plays a huge role, but I don't mind that so much in co-op games where everybody suffers equally. And unlike the original it doesn't take three hours to set up.

Would be great filler except it seems to take >90 minutes to play.

Very difficult game.  At first with only Solo plays I couldn't understand why it was so popular.  Then I played a four player game and realized how fun and tense it gets when it comes down to the wire at the very end.  Fun game, easy to set up and play.

In retrospect I feel like the gameplay tends to be very pre-determined, with the best decision often being relatively clear, so the game feels like it runs on auto-pilot.  It's really heavily based on dice rolls, you can do your best to try and maximize your odds but the game just finds so many ways to throw a wrench into the works...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Rating after one solo play. The game is hard. Manual is missing summary card. While things become clear after one play, lots of small rules required roll on willpower during first play. Moves require a lot of small optimizations, and I think such would not be quite feasible in real clash of space marines with fierce evil.
Edit: Traded away.

I own the base game and all of its expansions.  Space Hulk: Death Angel-The Card Game reproduces the tension of Space Marines battling Genestealers and Tyranids in the Warhammer 40K universe.  There's a lot of game here with just a deck of cards, a few chits, and one die.  However, prepare to die, a lot, in service of the Emperor.

RATING: 6.5
Just finished my first play.  I reached the final location (Genestealer Lair) with four space marines.  They did not last long!  

When I traded for this I was hoping for an easy to set up, fast to play, thematic and fun experience.  That is exactly what I just had.  I used to have an old 3DO version of this game that was a blast.  Makes me want to play my real version of Space Hulk even more.  This will do though when I have a short time frame to play games.

Update:  After playing some more I just felt like the randomness of the die rolls were too much to overcome.  One round of rolling poorly for my Space Marines and well for the Genestealers ended most of my other games.  I felt like I lost more to the dice than playing poorly.  I know that there is skill to the game I just was not interested enough to deal with it.  I am going to put Space Hulk on my next 10x10 challenge to see how it plays solo.

Neat little solo game. I don't see that it works well as a coop - the group communication rules seem a little poorly defined. The actual tactical gameplay and dice-rolling tension make this fun, but not deep enough to warrant repeated plays.

RATING: 7
Does a really good job of transferring the feel of Space Hulk to a card game. Action is tense, with some interesting decisions and tactics, however, luck rules the game.
1 hour seems optimistic; we hit that mark, but we're only playing with 2 people and are both pretty fast.
I worry about re-playability; several games so far and they've all felt very "samey".

Its amazing how well this game works.  I think it's actually better than it's predecessor.  Wonderful game system makes for a lot of tension.  Some fun choices and not too many rules make this a great choice.  Solitaire works great as well.

RATING: 7
This game is pure awesomeness. Easy and relatively quick-paced, with an incredible variety of strategies and overall very playful and fun. The only flaw I can see in it is that sometimes bad luck with dice can really blast you down, but strategy plays a major role, and you won't damn your bad luck if you don't make it after the last location.
Considering that it's also very portable and relatively cheap, I call this a must have for any boardgamer. Especially if you like the Warhammer 40'000 universe. Absolutely recommended.

Legit co-op play where everyone must pull their own weight, and players must work together to complete the mission.  Tense, fun, and enjoyable for 1, 2, or 4 players, but has some scaling issues when all 12 marines are involved.

Takes time to get through the rules correctly (FFG needs to learn how to write a damn rulebook!), and is a little tricky to get the hang of at first (semi-fiddly gameplay).

Bought with a coupon for $13, but would easily pay MSRP of $20... or even more!

Playing with a large group, this can feel a little downtimey whilst resolving cards, but this gets faster as marines start dying.

If you play this game in the right mood, it turns out to be great fun; accept that you're probably all toast and just try and stay alive, often at the expense of your fellow marines.

Technically, it's not a great strategy, but often in this game, the closest you'll come to winning is being the last to die...

Tried it once, solo.  It seemed ok, but I was still trying to figure out all the mechanics and play 3 "teams" at the same time.  In the end, it somewhat overwhelmed me...I'd prefer to play this with others and only use 1 (or 2 at most) teams each.  Going to reserve my rating until then.

The "Grim Dark Future" of Warhammer 40k cracks me up sometimes with their names and their "hardcore"-ness, but I really enjoy this game.

The game itself is a standard co-operative game (BGG Rating - 7) i give a 8 for the art of publishing - small box. 

Every player has 2 characters and 3 action cards to use. It`s not so easy to see what every player can do, so you it`s not so easy to dominate the game (one player who tells the other players what they should do), so we have a real co-operative game. 

To resolve an atack you roll a dice, so the game is luck dependend, but that creates emotions.

A great little game that is really fun to play solo. It really creates a sense of tension and suspense on each and every turn as your marines fight for their lives. A quick and deadly game that will keep you on the edge of your seat until you either taste sweet victory, or fall in glorious battle to hordes of aliens. Even when I lose it doesn't feel like a wasted experience, its truly dramatic and engaging.

Another criticism I have is that it often feels like the game is "on rails". The best decision for the group is usually somewhat easy to figure out, so it feels like you are just going through the motions of playing the game. I suppose that applies to all co-op games to some extent, but it feels more pronounced to me in Death Angel - possibly because it is such a small, compact game with simple rules...there aren't that many decisions to make or unique tactical situations that arise."

"Ben(chally)

One of the primary problems of co-operative games is that they tend to result in obvious decisions. Players approach those games as a bugger-like hive mind and view individual turns as interchangeable tools to advance the common good. Well-known complaints, such as that of the overbearing leader, are really just manifestations of this problem. Death Angel manages to do away with much of that difficulty by introducing both player elimination and simultaneous, secret action selection. Of course, those mechanics introduce their own problems. But giving players incentives to act in divergent self-interests and asking restoring the significance of the individual turn through simultaneous individual decisions is a neat innovation. "

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Everything feels really bogged down in details.  The decision of which actions to take is actually pretty difficult to make, but I don't think it fits well with the theme;  I was expecting something a little more quickly-paced and less analytical.

This is a cooperative game set in the Warhammer 40k universe.  That really doesn't mean a lot to me, since I'm not particularly familiar with that universe.  Still, for a card game, it is quite immersive and engaging.  One player can get eliminated fairly early if things come out just right, but I don't think that is a big problem.  The feeling of getting overwhelmed can be palpable at times, and so winning against great odds feels pretty good.

If you'll pardon the pun, there's good bang for the buck here. Space Hulk: Death Angel is a cooperative, card-driven, kill-the-nasties dice fest similar in feel to Ghost Stories. In many ways, its a puzzle game, with players trying to figure out how best to stay alive and eliminat the baddies with the options and abilities available. But where I don't like pure puzzle games, discussing options and tactics in Death Angel is a blast, and a large part of the attraction here. Given that each team has only three actions from which to choose each round, there is a surprisingly wide range of tactics the space marine teams can employ ... almost to the point of analyis paralysis on occasion. But generally things move along at a good clip, and players feel thoroughly engaged. The theme is strong and works well with the mechanics. In fact, this little card game captures much of the feel - and tension - of its older board game brother, Space Hulk. My only real quibbles are that the rulebook is just awful, making a fairly simple and straightforward game far more difficult than it should be, and that the genestealer artwork isn't all that dramatic or threatening. Other than that, Space Hulk: Death Angel is a winner on a number of fronts, including box size, price, ease of play, tension, player interaction and plain old fun. I'm starting this with a conservative 7 rating, but I look forward to playing more and expect that mark could go up a notch or two.

Initial thoughts following first solo play:  wow.  If this game would've come out before the blazingly chromed reprint, I might have saved a hundred bucks.  It really is a very good representation of the board game, complete with agonizing tension and all.  But it's all represented in cards and a few chits, so it costs a pile less.  

Getting through the first play was harrowing for me, maybe because it has been so long since I ran through a new rule book.  But after it got off the ground, and in spite of a few hiccups, it is almost dynamite.  I'd love to get more plays in, both solo and with a few pals.

UPDATE:  4 plays, 4 losses.  This game is absolutely fantastic at both crushing your spirits and giving you small doses of thrilling triumph.  I'm about ready to proclaim it one of the top 5 games I've played in the last year.

Nonetheless I offered it up in the One Player Guild's Chain of Generosity. It's in a better home now :)

Edit (July 2017): I have been watching play through videos of this lately and am starting to miss it.  I may go after it again.  I never liked the Warhammer universe and the whole "Brother this and Brother that" is actually unappealing to me. However, I feel I may be getting over that ... a bit.  So I will be keeping an eye out for this on trade forums.

I only play it solo.  Fairly new to tabletop gaming and find this game very difficult.  Bad dice rolls are often the end of it for my games.  Also, too many times I end up with genestealers stacked so high from event cards that I can't roll high enough to save my marine.

A fairly solid card game translation of the old Space Hulk formula, with a great solo component.  Take your Space Marines through a series of rooms, trying to pick off the constantly-spawning Genestealers and hoping to flee to the next room before they pile up too much.  I lost my first game, but enjoyed playing it very much.  This game is incredibly hard and requires you to manage your skills and choose your actions wisely.  Might want to look up some rules explanations first though; the rulebook is a bit confusing.  I found Rahdo's playthrough to be the most helpful.

2011-02-20 -- This was a cumbersome experience for me. I didn't like it at all--SOLD.

2011-11-06 -- I actually re-bought this game! After seeing much conversation about it, I realized I didn't give it a fair chance. The rulebook is WIDELY criticized; rightly so. It's horrible. If you don't want to have a long, slow session with difficult referencing to the rulebook, then either avoid this or make sure someone else teaches it to you.

I will say, though, once you've got it down, it does make for a decent solo experience--this coming from someone who thrives on good PvP interaction in a game.

I've upped my rating from a 5 to a 6.5.

1/8/12 -- Alas, I think I'll be trading/selling this game off once again. It just doesn't call my name. I think it may be too long for what it is. I can set up Gears of War: The Board Game and play it in nearly the same amount of time. GoW is a superior experience for its components and streamlined play--not to mention my GoW minis are beautifully painted thanks to my Secret Santa (Christmas 2011).

An interesting game where you lead teams of terminators through a space hulk, trying not to die to those nasty genestealers!

If you want the expansion packs for this game...you're most likely out of luck due to those being out of production. However the core game has a lot of replayabillity. This is mainly due to the game being so incredibly difficult.

I personally like the game but am not overly fond of it. I don't really enjoy the whole spacehulk thing with there only being genestealers. For the game as is the mechanics are fine and solid but just not something I am looking for to play as a solitaire game.

You can play this game with more people but I recommend it as a solo game.

Go in knowing you likely won't win (just as the space marines know they're not likely returning home...) and a win will be that much more to celebrate on those rare occasions when it does come.

Another solid game by Corey Konieczka. Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the players work as a team of Space Marines against the Genestealers aliens. A a tough battle it is!

The ratio of Win x Loss is low, but I don't mind this at all: I enjoy the challenge. And the game is fast enough so that the losses don't hurt that much.

The mechanics can get a somewhat fiddle for a card game, but I think that this happens because we tend to expect little work when playing a card game. It is easy, once everyone understands their options, to get the game going.

So, to summarize: a good game indeed!

I am a big fan of the table top version. This card version is almost better : a lot of calculation and tactical options, coodinated actions and decisions with other players, desperate close combat with genestealers, heavy weapons... a must. The fist play is a bit difficult because the game is complex but it worths it. Fabulous game.

Rating after two plays with 5 players. The rulebook is really badly written (even for experienced gamers), so it wasn't a suprise that we played the Genestealer supply rule wrong the first time. Our second game ended in a very close defeat, but the first player was out of the game after only 10 minutes of playing time due to some bad dice rolls. Not a bad game, but considering the time required to learn the rules and its playing time, I cannot see myself picking Death Angel over Ghost Stories or Pandemic (or Castle Panic) to scratch a similar itch.

I admit I am not much of a solo gamer. But this game intrigued me since I am a closet Warhammer fan.

There is one word to describe this game: tough. It is not easy to slog through a game without heavy casualties. While the mechanics are interesting and rather complicated for a card game, I can't help but feel that getting a space marine killed with one lousy hit kinda takes away something from the game. However, 

I really enjoy how the location, event and terrain decks interact to add flavor to the game. Being able to activate panels on terrains and how they interact with overall goals is neat.

Have to play with several more people, but I bet you the game will be even more random and chaotic with guys moving and switching around the formation.

Sometimes this game can be nail-bitingly intense and great fun, and sometimes it's sudden death due to unlucky rolls (and probably some bad choices). I'll play it if someone else wants to, but I doubt I'll ever pull it out when I'm feeling like a solo game.

Gotten a chance to play it a few times, and I have to admit that it's never been a satisfying game experience. True, I've never won, but it runs into the Settlers problem of dice/low rolling distributions, where you can just get screwed because of a single bad run.

Better than I expected.  Tight gameplay and interesting decisions, and the "instinct" mechanic helps break up alpha-player railroading a little.

Too brutally random. Winning requires LOTS of luck. It's also absolutely no fun to lose characters in the very first turn. Losing a team in the first turn can really put a damper on the entire game.

One game so far. Simple mechanics in this co-op: choose one of your three action cards and do the action. The co-operation makes it more interesting, you need to discuss with other players to find out the best set of actions. The game gets better, if you are into the Grim Darkness of the Far Future and get in to the flow, but if the theme doesn't hit you, there is not much game left to enjoy.

This is the only game I've given a full 10-point rating on Board Game Geek so far.

I never thought I'd like to play a card game or a board game solo. I tried this one solitaire to learn the rules so it would be easy to teach to my friends and became addicted. 

Death Angel is complex without being complicated, but the rulebook is poor/unclear due to poor organization. You can learn the game from it, but I recommend using Universal Head's printable rewrite at Board Game Geek. This makes the game easy to learn quickly. ( 

Death Angel is very difficult to win. That's part of why it's fun. It's a challenge. Luck is involved, but making good tactical choices is much more important than luck. Luck is mostly your enemy, something to plan against rather than something you're hoping will help you. This creates an awesome sense of dread that feels somewhat like playing a survival horror version of X-COM. 

The cards are very high-quality and harder to damage than the cards in most games. They feel nice.

There are expansions but I find them totally unnecessary. The game will keep me entertained for a very long time without them. I don't think I'll stop playing this for years, though I won't play it every week, or maybe even every month. If someone asked me to play it every week though, I don't see myself turning it down. It's highly replayable and great fun.

However, if you want to expand it, there are a few expansions available (get the Tyranid one if you only get one.) Also, there are fan-made expansions here at the Geek.

RATING: 6
Difficult and fun co-op with loads of theme. The difficulty of this one combined with the various luck elements make it feel more like telling a story than solving a puzzle (ala Pandemic, which I also enjoy). Excellent solo game (I'd rate it a 7.5 for the solo game), but still good as a light co-op filler for groups.

Update: Rebought for solo play. Good fun.

Feels like it wants to be a board game. You lay out scenery cards beside a row of space marine cards, and they fight gene stealer monsters. It's in a little box, but the cards are laid out spatially - like a board - meaning it's hard to setup and transport.

The mechanics feel really awkward, and the whole game would be easier to visualise and understand with figures and scenery pieces. Didn't work for me really. I didn't feel my marines were in a tunnel with gene stealers either: it's too abstracted.

One of the better card games I've played.  I love sci-fi and this one sucks your right in.  You actually "feel" the danger your space marines are in!  I love that it is co-op and you can collaborate with you friends and devise strategies together.  The only thing I hate about this game, is the custom dice it comes with.  I swear, whenever I need to role a skull, it rolls a 0, 4 or 5 and when I need to defend it rolls a 0, 1 or 2.  So I just use a regular d6 where 6 represents 0.  Other than that, great card game!

RATING: 5
As a solitaire game, this isn't too bad.  It takes a game to really get a sense of how the turns flow, but by the second game, you shouldn't have to refer to the rules too often.  It has a touch of Dungeon Lords, what with the "select a card this round that you can't use next round" rule, and a heaping helping of Arkham Horror/Battlestar Galactica with the event cards.  It's relatively thematic, for a card game, though it really can't compare with its pappy, since it had the miniatures and all.

As for the cooperative game, I'll have to hold off on rating that for now.  For one, I haven't played the game other than solitaire; for another, I'm not sure if I still like cooperative games as much as I used to.  Either way, I'll pull it out to play with the other FFG fanboys and see what they think about it.

Excellent solo game! I could not believe that with so few components you could make so much of a game! The single die can be really cruel with you from time to time, even if you have planned for 2 unfortunate die rolls, so the game is really difficult to beat. But I think that exactly this fact is the beauty of the game. If you are a solo gamer, this is a must-have game!

Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers!
\13\\13\
Game play is quick and easy-to-learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely!
\13\\13\
Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels!
\13\\13\
The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it's back into the fight!

I have been thoroughly impressed by this unassuming little card game from Fantasy Flight. I'm not sure how Corey Konieczka managed to distill the mighty Space Hulk down into a deck of cards, but this fairly simple 30-minute card game feels every bit as epic as a three-hour run through a Descent dungeon. From the scenario cards to the combat team formation, there are just so many clever design decisions found in this game. I'm also completely astounded by the game's consistency. Every game seems to play out a little differently, yet it always manages to come down to an exciting and climatic ending. It really is a work of art.

If the game has any weakness, it is the multi-player rules. I don't think two or three player Death Angel is nearly as much fun as the solitaire version. This is very much a puzzle game and an unforgiving one at that, so having half of the Space Marines out of your control can be very frustrating. Also, you are only playing one action a turn for each squad. If you aren't controlling all of them, the game can drag a bit with some turns leaving you to feel like there aren't any real decisions to make. Player elimination is also a threat when playing with more than one, so again, I think this all adds up to Death Angel being far more effective as a single player experience.

Surprisingly fun cooperative game in a tiny box. I love tiny boxes.

When you read the rules to this one, it sounds too simple--each round, each of the six squads can choose one of three actions and that's basically it. Ho hum, right? What makes it work is that each squad has wildly different and powerful special abilities to go with each of those actions. These abilities are often tied to a particular marine, making some more valuable than others--this is great since it makes positioning very important. Also, the way the single combat die is arranged to complement these abilities is very clever.

Fun to play solo, but definitely shines with buddies. It's a lot easier to sacrifice marines if you're controlling them all, for one thing, and it's just more fun to puzzle out the best actions cooperatively, when everybody's got their own abilities at the front of their mind.

RATING: 7
While this game has suspense and is fairly fast paced, it lacks the drive or feel of pressure to accomplish anything other than basic survival when traveling from point A to point B.  The lack of any specific missions or creation of specialized teams makes this a random survival sci-fi horror game. On the flip side, the artwork and construction of the game is typical top notch Fantasy Flight but only worth picking up if you can get it discounted from the suggested retail price of $24.95.

So far I've played a handful of solo games and one two player game.  But I would imagine the game being much more enjoyable with more.  There is a good amount of tension without feeling like I am losing all the time. The variety of abilities that the marines have is interesting and would only be better if I didn't have to keep track of so many (as is the case with fewer players).

I look forward to trying this with a larger group.

Warhammer goes co-op card game with Space Marine squads going up against gene stealing aliens pouring out of vents and bulkheads. Their fate rests on tactics and chance  chucking special event dice. The rules are intimidating but seeing it played helps to make it clear. Once grasped it is easy to stay immersed in the sci-fi theme. Very tough to get an honest win.

I like the variable powers and it's certainly not an easy game. However, the dice can really be brutal and there are many times where, regardless of good or bad decisions, the game can be won (or lost). However, it's a nice theme and a short game so I plan to keep it around.

So far, I've only played this solitaire. I find this game to be very challenging. The combat mechanics are simple, but still allow room for strategy and planning.

Space Hulk: Death Angel captures the sci-fi theme and tension of its big brother, the mighty Space Hulk, in a compact card game.  And also resembling Space Hulk, this card game features very high quality components, with especially good artwork on the cards.  There's no board and the entire box can fit in your pocket (cargo pants pockets anyway), so this one travels nicely.  Another thing that lends to its travel ability is that it plays solo, or multiplayer cooperative up to 6.  It's a nice solo game too, exceedingly challenging to win, but a lot of fun if you allow yourself to be immersed into its theme.  (Note: I did win on the second play.  Check out my session report!)

One negative: the rulebook jumps all over the place, and while it does have some nice examples, it still leaves many rules unanswered or unclear.

RATING: 8
A solidly entertaining coop game, but a sudden onrush of bad luck (three dead marines! oops!) can turn the tide from near-win to no-chance.

I wish the set-up were a tad easier, but Death Angel is quick and fun enough that I'd run two games as a batch rather than stuff the game back in the box after only one play.

Love this game. Can be played single player and doesn't lose any of its play-ability. Captures the tense, could-die-at-any-moment feeling of the board game and is dripping with atmosphere. Cheap too. And lots of expansions for it now. Although when played with other people it can feel a bit like multiplayer solitaire.

RATING: 8
Really enjoy this one.

I love the 40k theme.  The challenge is steep.  Game play is strong and has good decisions.  Also, this is the only game I own that is really compelling in solo as well as multi play (that was a while ago - now have robinson, mk, nemo, etc)

eurogamers beware : dice make life and death very random in this game.  If you cant get past the chance factor in this game I recommend skipping it.

I forgot to mention - these rules might have been written by a schizophrenic with ADD on acid.  The organization is totally mind boggling, but do in fact explain the rules if you are patient and persevering.

Interesting enough theme, and it doesn't feel terribly 'pasted on', however some of the mechanics (the aliens stick with your forces as they move rooms?) are pretty clearly for game balance vs any semblance of 'reality'.  Bad die rolls can doom you quickly, though, and event cards can really make a bad situation worse, so...initial thought on few plays is that it's a bit more luck dependent than I'd like, more plays may refine that opinion.

RATING: 7.78
That game has the feel of the boxed miniature game: same squads, same atmosphere despite the loss of pseudo-3D. Game mechanisms are easy to learn and get used to, and each game is fast paced (solo game only for me). Each space marine team has its own special abilities making every one of them very useful and some combos can be exploited. It is in fact easier playing solo since the player can chose each action card knowing all other ones.
It seems that the game is hard to beat (have not managed it myself so far) and relies a lot on the randomness of the die. Needless to say, each space marine lost makes it even harder to go forward and the final stages of a typical game sum up to confronting one side's luck to the other's. The more space marine available, the more attacks possible and the lower chances of a hit from the genestealers. It requires however many support tokens in play at that time, and even then comes a time when a marine will be attacked while flanked.
The game material is great and helps a lot for the atmosphere, the size of the box makes it easy to travel with, and the duration of a game is such that games last for only a few dozen minutes. Replayability is high as long as one mixes the space marine squads before each new game.

It's not the worst game I've played. I enjoyed it at first, but then it got kind of boring after multiple plays. This game made me decide to never spend too much money on FFG's card games. I am not going to sleeve every game I have, only the ones that are hard to replace. And I can't stand the quality of the expansion cards. The expansions are much cheaper in quality, no linen texture and super thin and flimsy. Because of this, I'll never buy into FFG's LCGs no matter how interesting they seem. I can't stand the inconsistent quality of the cards.

What a disappointing game.  The laying out of space marine, genestealer, and location cards was very artificial.  The choices of action to take very limited and also artificial.  Why do I have to take the same action for both marines of the same color when they may be in very different situations?  When I got a bunch of genestealers in front of me, why wouldn't I keep attacking?  This game pales in comparison to Aliens This Time It's War for a space marine vs alien card game.

quality components, but a turd of a game

Rulebook is a total disaster. Theres thirty pages of rules questions here on bgg....

Its a good idea but the execution couldve been better.  Theres many confusing concepts with very few examples and some of the terms are inconsistent or placed in very odd places in the rulebook.

The game itself really boils down to a die roll to see if your guy survives, way too much luck involved, there are ways to re roll dice but there are times when you simply have no chance.

I enjoy a challenge but this is too much, maybe I'm doing something wrong, I just can't tell cause the rules are a mess.

Cool theme though, I want to like this cause I can solo play it but right now I don't like it at all.

A cool 'puzzle' game that captures the spirit of the Space Hulk game. It's very good to play solo, since it's quick to set up a game. The game is hard to win but a good team composition should make you win most games. There can be annoying dice rolls especially at the beginning of the game were 1 genestealer kills a marine. But when you get going the luck gets more mitigated. 
With two players the game is also very nice. I wouldn't recommend to play with more if there are newbies in the group.

RATING: 6
An interesting co-operative game that delivers some neat, new ideas but doesn't quite have the impact or staying power of Pandemic or Ghost Stories. The system is extremely brutal, killing Space Marines left and right with wild abandon. I think part of the problem is just that: in Pandemic, the tension builds slowly to a crescendo. In Ghost Stories, you are slowly overwhelmed, gradually losing your life, feeling yourself fading away. In Death Angel, your guys just die. No growing weak, no feeling faint. Rolling a die = you're still alive OR you're dead. I'm not saying you roll a single die and the game is lost, but since you're losing the characters that represent you (or are supposed to represent you), it is somewhat detaching.

Own the first two expansions.

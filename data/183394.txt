O jogo tem um clima sensacional e as mecânicas se encaixam perfeitamente no tema. Depois de mais de uma dúzia de partidas jogadas, ele realmente tem mais sabor de jogo tático (é uma corrida por pontos) do que de estratégia. Mas não tem furo: a sorte está lá, mas é limitada; existem muitas maneiras de ganhar; e não há receita de bolo para vitória. Minha única reclamação é que a partida frequentemente parece ter durado menos do que o necessário para causar satisfação.

Viticulture offer nothing exceptional or fresh. It is just a basic worker placement for its core mechanics. The fun factor might be a bit below average. This is due to the repetitive nature of your actions, i.e., harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver and so on. 

I also did not like how half of the action spaces were useless for the first half of the game and then in the second half you used nothing but them. Personally, I would have liked to see a more balanced use of actions through the whole game. Furthermore, the fact that your first delivery might be the most valuable one and the last the least valuable definitely does not add to the dramatic arc. One reason behind all this is that there is basically only one basic route for victory.

There is nothing broken nor exceptionally bad design choices. Viticulture just feels too much of work, one dimensional, and is at least 60minutes too long to be anything but average.

The add ons from the Tuscany expansion do not add anything that would make the game more interesting or shorter. Just more of the same.

As with all Stonemaier Games, this one has beautiful components and a fun theme. I don't always love worker placement games, but the theme really makes this one feel intuitive and fun. A solid solo mode doesn't hurt either!

RATING: 10
It's worker placement at it's finest.  Many worker placements have this feeling of having a pasted on theme, but the way this game works feels very good.  Everything makes sense and feels very thematic.

I have taught this game in under 5 minutes and I have yet to have a person not love playing, including new players.

I always play with some expansions.  I will not play without every visitor card added, mamas and papas, and sellable fields.  I prefer to use the Tuscany building board plus other expansions, but new players I use just the few mentioned earlier.

Currently my favorite in the medium weight euro worker placement spot. The theme is well present in the game and does not need flavour text to make itself present. Very streamlined gameplay but with lots of strategic possibilities. Some people complain about luck of the draw, but in my group one person wins 85% of the time, so I would say is a lot more about strategy and tactical adaptation than luck. Solo mode is very solid and it feels just like the multiplayer game. A masterpiece by Stonemaier games.

For a kickstarter, this game was pretty good. The theme was interesting, the bits were excellent, and I liked the engine building aspects of the game.

Like almost every kickstarter, it ended up feeling unpolished. There were parts with needless complexity (all the different buildings that no one built until the end), randomness in the form of the cards (there was such a huge difference between how good individual cards were) and pacing issues (by the end of the game, half the boards was useless).

If I were to play it again it would have to be with an odd number of players, due to how strangely tight the game is. I had fun with my one play because the theme and bits were very good. 

Update: Essential edition with the big meeple and the tweaks is better and is a decent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Never played the first version, but I know the differences, and ok, the game really seems to be very improved from the first state.

The art and presentation are best quality, something expected from Stonemeyer.

The mechanics are very simple, a simple worker placement mixed with contract system and event card effects with no complications. The theme is great and the game really contemplates the theme well.

RATING: 7.5
This is the sort of light worker placement game I prefer as a gateway to introduce newcomers. The visitor cards are not balanced at all and I look forward to seeing Tuscany: EE mitigate the problem with the trading action. It's simple, yet there are enough moving parts to open up some strategies. It also isn't completely deterministic thanks to the card draws. It suffers from terribly low player interaction so replayability feels limited. I don't think the area control aspects of Tuscany are important enough to fix that either.

Medium-heavy worker placement game about producing wine.  Quite a lot going on but easy to pick up the basics.  Random card draws for what grapes you grow and what wine customers want can bog a player down if nothing decent comes up and some cards seem to offer big points which led to a sudden victory in the game I played.

Okay game but not good enough to knock Snowdonia off my number one spot.

Interesting theme and the wine-making is very fun. I only played the solo game, which I liked. But I ended up letting it go due to nit-picky component issues: The card art is not to my taste at all and takes away from the theme in a big way. The card stock has a plastic-like finish. The box shape is odd and the insert is not useful. I'm not a fan of the lightweight wood components, though the custom shapes are neat.

I find the game underwhelming.
The decisions are limited, there's a lot of luck involved (all cards are drawn at random), especialy solo (the automa is not good at all, it's far from scythe's!).
I like the wine theme (living in France), and the wood part are gorgeous, but are just bling, really.

This is easy to compare this one with "La Granja", and La Granja win easily the match: more decisions, less luck, better automa...

EDIT: a few games later, i add 1 point. There's more than what meets the eye the first time.

Middle-weight worker placement game that's filled with charm.  The end game point trigger needs to be extended by at least 10 points to allow you to use (and enjoy) your wine production engine beyond a couple of wine orders.  Doing this would score it higher for me.

Got in late on this with the Essential Edition releases, but I admit I do really like the game play, it's elegant but threaded with plenty of tough decisions, and also fairly intuitive once you get the hang of the actions and the crushed grape and wine tokens. Like the variable starting resources with the Mamas and Papas and the field cards, so I'm not sure I'd play without them. Not a bad choice for introducing worker placement to players who haven't tried it, either. Will have to try the Tuscany Essential content soon.

 - You need the luck of the gods to draw the right cards

The fact that max number of workers is not always best is refreshing in the WP genre. Paths to victory is not as varied compared to some WP classics such as Agricola, but the combination of theme and clean mechanics makes it enjoyable to both teach and play. Tuscany provides more options to score but also takes away some of the streamlined feel to the game.

RATING: 10
Probably my favourite worker placement game. The artwork and the components is very nice and the theme is charming enough. I can't help but compare this game to the Manhattan Project. Like the Manhattan Project, it is about managing a supply chain from grape cards >>> planted vineyards >>> crushed grapes >>> wine in cellars >>> fulfilled wines contracts. Like the Manhattan Project, it absolutely necessary to unlock your additional workers, which comes with no additional cost beyond the 4 Lira you pay beforehand. This game has two gimmicks to MP's free flowing roundless play. Viticulture goes in the opposite direction and has two rounds, thematically summer and winter, and you have mange your worker pool to not exhaust it prematurely. The Grande worker is a sort of "free" action, allowing you to take an action even if it is space occupied. That does mean you can take the additional worker actions at beginning of the game (a kludgy way of dealing with the problem, but it works) and then one of the conversion actions . It's an interesting choice that balances giving the players latitude in getting locked out of their supply chains spaces versus diluting worker placement's main interactive element.

Beyond that, I think what puts it top is the cards, which provides for some interesting gameplay choices and thematic flavouring. I don't recall playing the original editions, but the card options provide are another kludgy fix to the game original problem cards being useful at the beginning or the end of the game, but not both.

I've played the original ed. + Tuscany, and the choice of expansion modules ported to the essentials (made by Uwe "lets farm and feed our people for X rounds" Rosenberg himself!) was a good. Mama and Papa cards for variable set up with some initial choices and a little thematic flavour to boot. Aforementioned updated cards, sellable fields and solo game choices.

I think maybe they should have brought the full board, but hey (1) they keep SOMETHING back to get you to buy the he essential Tuscany ed., and it does make the game heavier, which may not be everybody's taste.

It will not change the world of games, but Viticulture works really fine.  It is part of the large number of games in which the challenge is to optimize the puzle of producing and transforming elements, in this case grapes to wine.  Worker placement mechanics, with the small addition of having two seasons each year (round) so you have to decide how many of them to use in each season.  Components are really nice, and once you know all the locations, it plays smooth.  A good option among this kind of games.

I really love this worker placement game.  It is very satisfying with the Tuscany extended board.  I love the options and the choices.  The theme comes through really nicely, and I even really enjoy the use of glass beads for grapes - it works surprisingly well.  It is simply a wonderful experience.  There is a fair amount of tension in competing for spots, but the El Grande workers does alleviate in a very satisfying way that alleviates any of the frustration that can come from this tight of a game.  I enjoy how game scales up through a play, and it really has the feeling of a vineyard, as it does take some time before you see the (heh) fruit of your efforts.  I even enjoy the point-threshold as a game-ending trigger instead of rounds in this game because it does go through a lot of rounds (fairly quickly once you get into the groove), and it gives you that long-term investment feel of a vineyard.  I really love the turn-order grid, especially in the Tuscany board (I can't remember if it's in the vanilla version or not, honestly).  It fires on all cylinders.  The reason this doesn't get a higher score from me is that it can be slow with some AP players who are looking for the most highly optimized play.  But if you don't mind waiting a bit, or have fast players, the experience is so satisfying to me.  It is a beautifully-designed game.

I do not really like euro or token placement games. But this game seemed to have so much theme and has a SOLO option (like Terraforming Mars), I took the plunge and it feels great.

Of course playing much more will wear off some shine, but the mechanics are well thought out and the solo is hard in my first run(s).

Edit: downgraded the rating a bit to 8 as after 10 games the solo game began to feel too easy to beat in solo mode. I realise there is a harder campaign mode, but realy after 6 or 7 plays the bot is beaten with mostly the same trics:
- get asap to 4/5 workers.
- sell land
- invest in cellars
- try to limit in fields and making champaign is rather easy with full blown cellars.

Mostly you win by selling 3 wine cards with approx 15 VP value (one added with the solo point extra per fill) and the rest comes from visitor cards.
Next time I will only play the campaign challenges I guess.

I've been wanting this game for a while and finally got it as a Christmas gift! I played this game 2 player and loved it. I can only imagine it gets better with more people. 

I was very impressed by the variety of cards in Viticulture Essential Edition, and a lot of the visitor cards have 2 different options. This will definitely help make the game a slightly different experience each time you play. I also like that some of the cards require a choice by your opponents, many of which include them getting a benefit but you getting victory points if they decide to do it. 

The art in this game is beautiful, as are the meeples and tokens. All the meeples and tokens came sorted and pre-bagged which was awesome.

Not a huge fan of the theme as I don't drink so really don't know much about wine. The components are nice, though the copy I played on had warping boards that was annoying. Maybe due to humidity. The worker placement actions were interesting and there didn't seem to be one set path to victory. Definitely involved engine building as players' vineyards ramped up and things shifted to the importance of the winter actions. I wasn't crazy about the end game scoring capping at 25.

It would be a fun game, but it is an engine builder, but by the time you build your engine, the game ends...somebody can skip objectives, and just win by playing cards...it has potential, but just falls short for me.

This has become my favorite worker placement game and one of my favorite games overall. The skill/luck balance is perfect. The components and art are top notch. And not only is the theme something I like but it's wonderfully integrated into the game itself. This rating includes the Tuscany expansion elements as well such as the bigger board, structures, and special workers. The "base" game would be an 7.5.

RATING: 7.5
Great worker-placement game, well balanced at any player count and simple to get into. I don't know if it's as satisfying as Waterdeep or Stone Age as it's a bit heavier. Still, would be my go-to 6-player experience.

RATING: 8.4
I enjoyed this even though I lost by an incredibly wide margin (24 to 11). The worker placement is really tight as only 1 player can go to a spot (in a 2 played game) unless the grande worker is used. You really need to puzzle out the correct order to plant fields, harvest them, make wine and sell the wine. Money is also incredibly tight. My opponent got incredibly lucky and was able to upgrade his cellars using Visitor cards for a total of $3. That would be my only complaint about the game, the visitor cards. They seem soooooo powerful and you really have to base your whole game off of them. We will play this with the Tuscany expansion soon and I will see if this is balanced out in that.

This is an elegant euro game that offers a variety of action choices to facilitate running an operational winery.  Players start with minimal resources and carefully plan how to maneuver their workers towards a meaningful strategy that includes catering to visitors, raising money, planning and harvesting grapes that can be made into wine and sold to fulfill orders.

A great game that bumped its way into my top ten after only one play. A great mix of card play, combos, worker placement and a "race game". Love the theme, also.

This is one of those games that I think that has nothing in particular stand-out about it in terms of mechanics, but is nonetheless awesome. It is something of a middle of the road game in many ways. But it does everything middle of the road so well, in such style. It is really good, at being really good. And that ends up making it great.

I've only ever played this game solo so far, and the solo game is fantastic- different modes of play, different difficulties. Limited turns and limited resources mean you really have to work and to know the way the parts of the game interact to pull ahead of random deck of cards that seem to block you when it's most frustrating.

Hoping to share the experience with more people soon.

a.k.a., the [i]Inferior[/i] Edition. Why anyone would ever buy another game from Stonemaier when this has gone through three rapid editions, changing the rules constantly. So if you own the initial edition, someone else owns the second, revised edition, and someone else owns this, you will be playing with different rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Viticulture Essentials presents a streamlined package of the previous Viticulture/Tuscany.  It is smooth and quick with fantastic components and the usual Stonemaier attention to detail.  It is also still swingy and random enough to be unsatisfying at times.  To be fair, I'm not big on race games.  This is a good race game but I'd likely choose other race games (Steampunk Rally, for example) and would DEFINITELY choose Vinhos over this any day for a wine theme.

Once the new Tuscany board is available again, that'll likely improve things.

Bedarált az alapjáték, mind a színeivel mind pedig a kidolgozottságával. Nagyon várom a következő játékot, de már ezzel a kiadással amit sikerült beszereznem :)
Hangulatos játék, melyben benne van egy euro játék majd minden lehetősége és még a kártyák által kijátszott akciók variálhatósága. Talán egy kicsit túl rövisnek tartom az elérendő pontmennyiséget, bár az is igaz, hogy ha tovább tartana, akkor csak a végtelen ciklus kerekedne felül benne. Tehát egy jó eltalált játék. A freskóból ismert korán kelés választása is visszaköszön a játékban. Számtalan újrajátszhatósága van.

// This is a solid worker placement game. The theme is fun
and works well with the game. My only quibble is that end-
game scoring feels a little like a letdown at times. My 
only other quibble is that the game doesn't scale well to
6 players - some cards are incredibly overpowered at higher
player counts.

This is a super solid WP game and a very good two player experience.  Many different strategies to explore with just the right amount of luck involved. Did not like the Tuscany expansion, though: Too much useless stuff added to the game, making lots of things much too easy to accomplish - reminded me of the 7 Wonders expansions.

Thoroughly enjoyable experience. Really had fun playing it with my partner. It is simple to play, but there is a nice element of strategy to keep you on yours toes. I love the fact that ultimately it is the production of wine and filling orders which matters most, not making money. Would recommend.

RATING: 8
10x10 2016. The base game is rather ho-hum light-ish worker placement game.  It's fine but a bit uninteresting.  Tuscany, the expansion, changes the game perhaps more than any expansion I've played for any game.  There is a completely different board, a new deck of cards, and different worker powers.  It also mitigates the luck and variability of visitor power levels with a space allowing you to trade cards and other resources.  And all that makes the game much better and much more interesting.  With Tuscany it's a very good medium weight worker placement game.  I would always choose to play Tuscany if given the option.  The game is pretty tight but allows for some different wrinkles in you path to victory- especially with the optional building cards (again in Tuscany).  A tricky game to rate, so my rating is for the base game only- with Tuscany I'd give this a strong 8.

After having a great experience with Lords of Waterdeep, I was looking for the next great worker placement game to add to my collection. After just a few plays, I can already tell that Viticulture is just that. The game strikes a great balance between brainy and breezy; while it may not be the best WP game to introduce new gamers to, it's definitely not too overwhelming. The theme is very well-integrated, too. As you play, you can't help but feel just that much more classy as you're filling wine orders, upgrading your vineyard, and giving tours to wealthy and helpful visitors. The seasons mechanic definitely adds a strategic dynamic to the game, as you're forced to think steps ahead. If you're looking for a great "next step" WP that isn't as complex as, say, Agricola, I definitely recommend Viticulture.

Like a cross between Stone Age and Vinhos, with complexity somewhere between the two - though more towards the SA end of the spectrum. There's a lot to like here but the dollops of randomness inflicted through the visitor cards may be excessive and the odd 'take that' cards are just naff.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great worker placement game with a strong hand management part (Visitor cards are a great part of the game), a engine-building aspect to it and many path to victory.
++ Great theme that is pretty well integrated, which is easy to understand (accessible) and one that we like a lot (What is better than playing Viticulture with a good glass of wine with your wife?!?!).
++ I like the concept of seasons (2 or 4 depending if using the expansion board) that limit where you can put your workers (each seasons has unique spots with different actions which is thematically grounded).
++ The starting player track is really interesting as you have to choose between having better bonuses for going late over having nothing but being first player (Inspired from Fresco).
++ I like that it's a game with no direct confrontation that play well at 2-players as it is perfect to play with my wife. She find this game relaxing and really enjoy playing it, and thus she often ask to play it.
++ Great components! The board has a nice matte finish, the wooden components are nice and the glass beads are awesome: Much more games should use them as it's a really clever way to indicate different things by seeing through it and thus seeing the meaning on the player's boards (Bonus: it magnifies!).
++ The Essential Edition really put together the best smaller modules of Tuscany to get a streamlined experience right out of the box.
++ Great value, not only because the Essential Edition retail for the same price as the older 2nd Edition, but also because you have a lot of quality components for the price.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (even with the Tuscany EE expansion in the box!).
++ Most negative points about Viticulture I had (and many other had) have been addressed with the release of the 2nd Edition and now with Viticulture Essential Edition.
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).
++ The Moor Visitors expansion add new visitors with more unique abilities which really refresh the game. 
++ The Tuscany Essential Edition expansion, streamlined all the remaining expansion modules of the initial Tuscany expansion, to just the best one in my opinion, for a great low price.
++ TEE is a must have expansion for anyone that want to bring VEE to another level, strategy-wise and gameplay-wise (It is not a "Must Have" in the sense that it is needed as VEE by itself is a great game though).
++ The new board now feature 4 seasons with worker placement spots (with bonuses at the 2-player count!), and also an extended player order chart that I really love with bonuses at each season (I also really like the new implementation of the player order track where the first to choose next year is the first to pass) All these changes increase the depth, strategy and the replayability of the game.
++ It adds the structure cards, which I love as it give a unique feel to each game: it enhance the engine building feel, add more possible strategies/path of victory and again add more replayability.
++ It also adds the special workers which make the game a more strategic and add variability from game to game, because these special workers enable some cool new stuff that were not possible before that, which again adds more replayability.
++ I really like this kind of expansions made by modules which you can play with or without any modules easily ( so you can scale Viticulture from an accessible medium weight game to a much more meatier game).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- With just VEE, it's a tiny bit more luck-driven than I love, but still not that bad (but with the experience, players will adjust and mitigate "bad" card draw, especially with the new "trade 1 for 1" action space on the Tuscany board).
-- I would have really like to have some action space bonuses available in a 2-player game on the base board, as this extra incentive is kind of missing at that player count.
-- The only major non-thematic aspect of the gameplay is the grapes aging and not spoiling at the end of the year. But as an Eurogamer, I agree that mechanisms must be first, then theme, so it's minor. 
-- The Moor Visitor expansion is expansive for what it is (just 40 more cards in a box), especially when you compare it to the Tuscany Essential Edition expansion that really add a lot of gameplay component for a really great price.
-- The Tuscany Essential Edition (if we add every modules included) adds more complexity and more choices which lengthen the setup time, slow down the flow/speed of the game and make the games last longer (but we can still add more or less modules according to the playtime we wish, which is great).
-- With the extended board and the extended player boards (with the structure board), it take a lot of table space, so it's hard to play this game beyond 4 players on a normal kitchen table.

My favorite worker placement game. Such an elegant design where everything you do just makes sense thematically. Rules are simple enough that I can play with my wife or other non-gamers, but it has enough depth to satisfy Euro enthusiasts. Love the mamas and papas for variable player set-ups and the components and artwork are just fantastic. Cannot recommend this game enough.

Un juego de colocación de trabajadores con manejo de cartas y manejo de recursos. Me recuerda un poco a Lords of Waterdeep sólo que en este juego hay 4 diferentes tipos de cartas y las estructuras que construyas sólo tú las puedes usar. Me parece un juego muy divertido con una temática muy atrayente para cualquier persona. Es acerca de que cada quién inicia con un pequeño lugar donde hacer los vinos pero a lo largo del juego puedes ir mejorando tu infraestructura y ganando puntos de victoria a través de los vinos que produzcas.

I felt the long road to completing contracts was fulfilling, and the puzzle element was great to figure out. The breakdown of the seasons adds a lot to the decision making. The components are gorgeous, the art is thematic. It's one of those games that just feels like a pleasure to play. It's something I like to bring out as often as possible as far as euros go. Top notch.

I like this twist on worker placement, where there are four seasons that each have multiple action spaces, and you start with just two guys to play across all four. Sequencing becomes really tough. The competition becomes tight as players accrue more guys and fight for the same spaces. The scoring itself, and the special cards and contracts are all a little uninspired though. You aren't doing terribly interesting things with the actions.

Requires the expansion

A really good worker placement game, and quite possibly my favorite of them all.

So many things to do, and cards to use, and things to build, and oh, look, I ran out of workers and can't do anything else.  I am not very good at this game, but despite that, I still really like it.

Plus, it is a great, high quality game in terms of production quality, contents, and what-not.  Definitely must continued to be played.

(The Essential Edition is a better copy than the base, just because of some of the extra "essential" goodies included in the larger package.  But I will play either version, and I rate both of them a 9).

Worker placement games are a dime a dozen. I find most to not offer anything really new or game changing, and if the game lacks any semblance of a theme, I'm left asking why I'm playing the game in front of me instead of titles I already know and love.

And yet I was attracted to Viticulture based on ratings and the fact that it seems the theme is more than pasted on.

Update: One play with four players and I'm glad I picked this up. This is one of those games where the sum is greater than its parts. There's nothing really too crazy in the game that the typical gamer will not have seen elsewhere, but it flows very smooth and feels surprisingly thematic. Solid worker placement game.

Glad I finally got a chance to try this game to see if it is really as good as everyone has said. I enjoyed it because it played very quick and the variability in the setup with the mamas and papas is a nice touch. The variety of cards gives this the bit of randomness I like in games and with the quick playing time of 60 minutes for 3 players I think this could hit the table again. My only gripe is the strategy of getting the worker placement right in summer and winter as I know more than once I messed that up and it cost me a few points and likely winning the game. I look forward to trying this one again soon.

Only two plays in and I feel comfortable giving a rating. This is a very fun game and is a hit right away.

It's a really tight worker placement, and the very limited resources is what makes it both fun and challenging.

Thought this was just an average game. I did enjoy the theme, however it was very bland gameplay. I did enjoy the 'bonus spot' in some of the actions, that made decisions a little more strategic. However sometimes it just came down to who drew helpful vine cards. And the mama and papa cards were just plain odd. Didn't really make sense to me thematically. Solid gameplay, just not very fun to play.

Initial impressions: I enjoy this game, even though solo worker placement is a bit bland, in general. I like the drama of flipping over the Automa card. It creates tension, especially when your plan depends on two or more locations being available to you in a given turn. Solid.

It's fun trying to hit the bonuses when placing your workers, maximizing the most of your turn. The visitor cards really make this game shine in offering great replay-ability.

Great game! There's a fair amount going on but it all plays so smooth, and with all you have to think about a (2 player) game still plays in an hour or less. Great components (love those glass beads!) and I really like the racing feel to it. That said - and this is petty - this game has to have the worst game box I've ever seen. It's awkwardly deep, there are 3 slots to fit the 4 different types of cards, and the bigger cards have to be jammed into half-circle wells and scraped out every time. Why not just make a standard box? But whatever, the game inside is loads of fun.

This sits proud as my favourite board game, of any I have played to date.

The presentation is stellar, from the board and artwork, to the wooden components and the glass beads (grape/wine tokens).

Plenty of strategy built-in, with multiple avenues to victory.  Should you find you are being blocked from performing certain actions, you are always able to take a different path.

Takes a while to teach, and games likely to take around 2 hrs or more to finish.  I've never had a game where someone runs away with victory, and most people are complimentary about it afterwards

TL;DR Total disaster. Straight to the sell pile.

Ok, I give up. I guess Stonemier games just aren't for me. And I would actually assert just aren't any good. I never played the original Viticulture, but haven't heard that this is the game plus the best parts of the expansion, I'm just flabbergasted that this is the best they could come up with. Completely vanilla worker placement game. Yeah, there's a summer side and a winter side to the board. Big deal, doesn't really make much difference. The actions are very straightforward, with very little opportunity for any sort of clever play. Completely plodding. But absolutely worst of all, the game is ruined by cards that by far overshadow the core of the game. Cards are so random, they completely alter the flow of the game for the player who plays them (and sometimes others). Cards vary [i]wildly[/i] in usefulness. And there is no recycling. This got a big thumbs down from everyone in the group. And more than a thumbs down, it was, "it's sad, this game might have had potential with some competent development." But I guess this is how it goes with this publisher. Euphoria was the same. Looks great. Big splash on Kickstarter, fancy art and components (although I strongly dislike the art on the Viticulture cards), but completely flat gameplay. Ugh. Back to Viticulture, how in the world is the base game ranked in the top 100? This is like a Twilight Zone episode to me.

Learning and teaching Viticulture was refreshing - Why? Because it was so easy to learn and explain. It was easy to learn and more difficult to master.

Viticulture is a very good worker placement game with some tough choices on where to go first, and a little push-your-luck as you struggle with decisions to go places because you worry that your opponent will block you.  I enjoy this game. It is fun to plant & harvest grapes and it is fulfilling to plan for big points when filling wine orders (especially when you are able to fulfill more than one order in a given year, thereby scoring big victory points at the surprise of your opponents).

Components are great!  I love all the wooden shaped pieces and I love the box insert. On the negative, I do not like how small the game board and cards are.  Otherwise, Viticulture is a fantastic game with good re-playability. It is awesome that you can play this from SOLO to 6 players and it scales well between numbers. AWESOME!

A tight worker placement game with a good length for its depth and good component quality. The glass beads used to track aging grapes and wines are especially delightful. The wide variety of visitor cards is interesting and most are really satisfying to play.

My main gripe is that, mechanically, gameplay is kind of vanilla. It does the worker placement thing really well but there's not much that really differentiates it from other worker placement games; the only part that strikes me as particularly unique is the two-season, one workforce system. I likely wouldn't turn a game Viticulture down but neither would I choose it over other worker placement games.

This is a really good worker placement game with tough decisions and not many spaces so you might not be able to take an action that you need.

I wish I knew what I didn't like about this game, but I can't figure it out.  I love worker placement games; Champions of Midgard is one of my favorite games.  SM's other games definitely keep my attention.  I don't know, maybe I was expecting more due to the hype/high rankings.  I guess I feel like your moves are almost pre-determined - my field are empty so guess I need to plant some vines, or I have no grapes so I better go harvest.  And there are enough ways (grande meeples, visitor cards) to get what you need after someone takes your spot that the game seems to lose its strategic feel.

The mamas and papas are nice for the assymetric starting positions, but it would be nice if they were even more different from each other.  Maybe I just need to go out and get Tuscany to make this the deeper game that I need.

Unlike so many euros that are systems layered atop a shaky theme, Viticulture actually feels like you are running a winery. You need to deal with the seasons, build structures to improve your land, age your grapes and wine, combine them to produce better products and so on. It has that wobbly Stonemaier Games feel, that makes you think a good developer would have smoothed out the kinks (like the uneven card draws) but it’s still their best game. 

Update: Played recently with the expanded board and rules from the expansion, and liked it even more.

A wonderful pack of nice mechanics very well connected to the theme stand for a challenging game that, nevertheless, remains simple enough to be viewed as a gateway game.

The main core of the game, that is, all the process of developing and upgrading the fields, the harvest of the grapes, the making and blending of the wines to fulfill the contrats, it´s just great.
It´s a little shame, however, that some of the cards meant to give some randomness to the game may be sometimes too much powerful in comparison to the main core of the game mentioned earlier: A player may sometimes obtain about 1/3 of the points necessary to win through those cards, which seems a little nonsense, when you have such nice game mechanics...

This game is amazing, and has quickly became a favorite of mine and my friends.  The worker placement mechanism in this doesn't feel the "same" as other worker placement games for some reason, perhaps it is how rich the theme is in the game, but it is easy to get immersed in this one.  The changing of seasons driving the different rounds is clever, and the summer/winter visitor cards always seem so powerful to play.  Also works well as a 2 player game.  I have yet to play it solo.  Definitely glad I request this for Christmas!

Reviewing this assuming you're playing with the expanded board and structure cards.

This game is a great and great looking worker placement.  Tuscany packs in enough interesting things to allow you to experiment heftily with your vineyard and build some weird and interesting point generators.  It also extends the game to a more reasonable time frame, allowing more long term strategies to come to fruition.

Couple of problems with the game, in the first few turns you pretty much all need to plant vines, harvest grapes, and make wine.  The fact that start player hardly ever fluctuates through the seasons makes it a little bit too important for my liking, although this is less problematic in a three or more player game.  Two player games might actually benefit from using the small board, which unfortunately cuts out a lot of the interesting things.

The second problem is that you're a little bit constrained by luck of the draw.  In Tuscany there are plenty of methods to assuage this, but if you have to do that you're going to be a little behind the guy who didn't.  Because the game is a race, it can sometimes just be decided by who got the perfect wine order at the perfect time.

The fun way to score points in this game is to figure out how to coordinate the types of grapes you produce with the wine orders you need to fill. However, the four kinds of cards play such a prominent role in the game that, in order to have a chance, you probably need to score a significant share of your points just by drawing and playing victory point cards, a much less interesting aspect of the game.

[March 2017 - 8.2]
(My review includes playing with the Tuscany expansion.) Viticulture ranks as one of my favorite worker-placement games, largely on its great theme. You definitely feel like you're running a vineyard versus just pushing cubes around. Everything is very sequential... plant grapes and harvest them, all the while aging and blending to before making the right wines for the demanded orders. In between, there are side actions like giving tours and building structures that help you along the way.

The Tuscany expansion does a good job in opening up the game, allowing for more asymmetry, different strategies and adaptability with a beautiful larger board. I have the original Tuscany expansion, but the "Essential" Tuscany expansion works just as great as I don't play with the other modules in the original expansion anyway. 

My one gripe with the expansion board is the stars/influence/area-control map off to the side. To me, it's a bad distraction from the main game, however, one you really can't ignore because of its extra victory points and card draws. I'd rather not play with it, and give an extra card (orange or purple) to the fifth-player winter spot, and anywhere else on the board that you get a bonus star.

My only other gripe with the overall game is that some the visitor cards are pretty over powerful. This certainly moves the game along, though, and I really enjoy the ones that give everyone a chance for a bonus action. But, some of the cards break up the flow of the game... you could spend a lot of work and actions doing something, and then your neighbor gets a card to skip all the work, trade in some useless cards and accomplish the same thing. Meh. And again, it's not part of the game you can really ignore.

Besides my nitpicking, it's a game I enjoy with some good interaction/tension for a Euro in the limited worker spots. The theme, art and pieces just bring it all together in a beautiful way.

The full-year worker placement puzzle is modified by the randomness of the visitor cards, making for a good light-to-medium weight game. I have played it several times with different groups, and still like it, but sometimes it leaves me wishing I were playing a more complicated puzzle like Anachrony. But having an orange rooster meeple in my collection is not be be underestimated!

After 1 play, really enjoying it.  Plays best with a glass of wine.  Mechanic wise, it is a typical worker placement.  Shift resources around, ultimately getting VPs.  But it is fun getting there.  Very thematic which is worth the extra point.  I've only played this version, so not sure how the other editions or the expansions rate.

Essentially the same fragile, luck filled Viticulture, with a few extra knobs added.  Okay if you don't take the end result too seriously.  Marginally more interesting than the original.  Much better worker placement games out there that have had some development.

Though I like Viticulture, I don't love it. Saying that everything about this game is top notch, perhaps unimprovable, if that's a word (it's not). From the production to the gameplay everything is polished; I even like the odd box shape. I find the gameplay to be kind of relaxing, not tremendously exciting but solid, enhanced by having a glass of wine. The game could be criticised for lack of interaction, but then again how much interaction exists between adjacent vinyards?  The rules are well written and though there is a bit going on, the game is actually quite simple, not gatewayish but not far off. You could criticise the cards are being a bit too luck driven, but that's all part of the fun (imo) and they are actually quite fun - don't you get the impression that the people are all real and theres a few in-jokes on the go?


Addendum: my favourite worker placement game.

One of my favorite worker placement games. I love how flexible the game feels, and the aging grapes/wine mechanic is very clever and elegant.

Additionally, the Summer/Winter (+Spring/Fall for the superior extended board) action spaces being separated without refreshing your workers brings a really unique feel to the game tempo. Skipping entire seasons is not uncommon.

Another amazing game that has worked well with 2 but also contains a compelling solo game mode.  This game requires careful planning and strategy to achieve success and every game can play quite different than the previous despite a small number of core mechanics.

8 on the Cindometer (worker placement games are generally a win and this game is no exception)

1p games have been very, very good.  One of the better ones.  Played a 2p and 3p now top notch... thematic and simple.  

There is a little bit of a the feeling that it's luck of the draw if some get excellent early vines and complimentary orders and visitors.  However if you look at it as a puzzle to maximize your points with your cards (similar to Agricola) you will enjoy this very much.

RATING: 6.5
Overrated. It is good game, solid simple worker placement, amazing art and components and very nice theme. But what bothers me is its pace: Games starts super slow, turns feel very inefficient and that initial phase is long... then it accelerates quickly and by the time your enjoying what you are doing, the game abruptly ends because someone achieved the 20 points. Multiple season phases (especially with the Tuscany board) also makes the flow quite choppy. It is a good game, but not a top 20 ever, like BGG indicates.

RATING: N/A
A revisit after my last play of the original game, back when it first came out, my opinion remains the same.

I still dislike the racing nature of the game. I don't really understand the hype, over at Stonemaier Games as well as the designer. His other game Euphoria, also fell flat like a sand dollar.

I admire the fact that he's anal with his production, so he created great components and stuff to bling your games, but other than that, I don't get it why people enjoy Viticulture and Euphoria so much.

I love worker placements! I like how each season has different activities, strategizing the wake-up track, and being able to use the grande worker to pick up an action claimed by someone else. Only played 2p so far but the bonuses are an interesting twist I'm excited to try out.

Update 2017-11-06: Played some 3p and 4p, I like the advantages the action bonuses give. I need to win one of these days!

I will be copying/pasting this comment to the many versions of Viticulture and Tuscany. For reference, I only have experience with the Collector's Edition + Moor Visitor's expansion.

[b]Publishers: Rather than doing all of these iterative releases to improve your game: playtest, playtest, playtest. Get it right the first time! A game should have no 2nd edition (not talking about  additional printings and expansions) until the game is at least 5 years old. At least![/b]

Let's review how annoying it is to want to own everything Viticulture, in a congruent manner, from what I know of the line:

If you owned the first edition:
-Annoying randomness of the visitors
-VP cap
-No Grande worker if you get hosed.
-Other things I don't really know about because I never played it. Rahdo talks at length about it (I think in the Tuscany final thoughts because it improves many of the games issues)

Fine... upgrade to second edition edition?

If you owned second edition:
-You still have some the issues of the 1st edition but at least you have Grand Workers

In walks the Tuscany expansion
-Mamas and Papas: asymmetric startup. I don't like it, others do.
-New visitors: fixes some of the problems of the visitors.
-New Board: amazing in a gameplay sense but the glare on the glossy board is annoying and the fact that the player boards are not this way too. Consistency please!
-Structures: fun and easy addition
-Properties: good addition, but has a misprint and needs to be stickered.
-I haven't played with anything else as I believe most consider it to not make the game better (with the possible exception of the special workers and solo option)
-Ignore the fake attempt at Legacy and just treat things as modules

"Woo! I have everything Viticulture now and it's decent!"

Now Viticulture Essentials edition is released as they're making Tuscany as originally printed OOP
-2nd edition + M&P, New Visitors, Properties, Solo Option
-Where is the new board?! That's Essential!
-A slight few cards are slightly revised/errated, just to be annoying
-A new rule is introduced regarding the Tasting room. Have the old player boards from 1st or 2nd edition? Too bad, so sad.
-By the way, the new visitor cards don't have the annoying "advanced _______" in the title. 
-Bet you want to upgrade. Especially if you missed out on Tuscany.

If you didn't get Tuscany and have the 2nd edition, you don't have to get another edition, because the upgrade pack exists. It still won't fix your player boards for the new Tasting Room rule though. It will fix some of the issues with Tuscany.

Since people want the new board and other aspects of Tuscany... Tuscany Essentials Edition is announced:
-New board: not glossy this time (just to annoy first edition owners of Tuscany)
-Structures: good
-Special workers: apparently good
-Who knows what slight tweaks they could make to the workers and structures between now and when it's released.

Savvy business model you have going there Stonemaier Games.

If you got into the product at the Essential's level, that's fine. Well, it's mostly fine. I say this because if you actually wanted a deeper game with some of the Tuscany modules such as Aboriculture/Fromaggio, you're out of luck. Maybe they'll realease it in another edition: "Viticulture: Hard Core Grapes," or some other renamed edition. Do you see how many iterations and changes this has made since the game launched like 2 years ago? It's ridiculous. How about what I actually thought of the game?

Well, the mamas/papas aren't very appealing to me despite sometimes enjoying asymmetric games (ie Marco Polo). For example, "yay, I have a sparkling wine order card that won't be useful for many turns." I also didn't like the almost forced build-up of workers in the early game. Why can't we just all start with a specific number? At least people can't be blocked from getting workers because of the Grande worker. While the Visitor cards have been tweaked to be good at both the beginning and end of the game, some still seem way better than others. Then there's the randomness of which Vine cards you receive. I will say that I love the Tuscany board and the turn order mechanism. I thought it was also interesting how the grapes turned into wine, how they age, and properly managing your property. Overall, it's a decent game, but there are so many better worker placement games out there in my humble opinion. Even if I wanted to explore it more to see if I would grow to love it, I'm worried where the publisher is going to take the product line with how its managed things so far.

Fair or not, I am reminded of Istanbul. You're running around, doing stuff, so that you can do other stuff, hoping you can do the stuff that leads to more points before other people do the stuff to make the points to beat you. Maybe that explains half the games out there, but, the interplay of mechanisms, the range of choices, or the desperate search for alternatives, made for a very enjoyable experience. Being more than the sum of its parts doesn't hurt either.

Components are high quality, and the artwork is elegant. The learning curve is not so steep, but there is one. AP is a factor, especially if you (ironically) decide to imbibe while playing, but not off the charts. The sequence of actions can be delicate enough to be thwarted by a single blocked move, sooooo, yeah.

I've heard many people talk about how the first edition was not a "great" game, and that it was unplayable without the expansion. With this edition, I think the game is not only fine, it's really awesome. In fact it's one of the few games so far that encouraged me to invest in the expansion because of how good it is.

My issues with the game are three, so far:
1. Pre-modern Italian setting with modern-looking people and fashion (eye glasses)
2. Pre-modern Italian setting with multi-ethnic, non-Italian-named people
3. Not yet finding the "need" for building the windmill and tasting room

The first two break the theme for me, really. The 3rd, I'm "meh" about.

RATING: 6
The trend in games to make gimmicky wooden pieces is starting to grind my gears, they add no functionality and I find them distracting. The player mat is also wonky... why the field tiles spill over the edge is beyond me, and the field cards spilling even further out adds to the problem.

Theme aside (which is represented VERY well, but not one I am interested in), the game has solid mechanisms and varied paths of victory. It is a good game. My main gameplay annoyance is how swingy the card effects are. You could get a card that "might" help your current situation and another player can get a card that will always be useful AND score victory points. This would be OK in game with a high point total at the end of the game (think a Stephen Feld point salad), but in a game where 20 or 25 points wins this tends to throw everything off.

For example; in the game I recently played, I took advantage of unused opportunities on the board and (I felt) was playing a very tight game with good decisions, in the last round I had 20 points with the other four players at 13 or less points! Then one player plays a few cards to jump his score all the way to 21 for the win. Yes the cards are part of the game, but if we drew differently and swapped my cards (with no relevant effects) for his, I would of won 28-13 instead of losing 20-21. It was just annoying that the one random factor in the game had SUCH a huge impact causing a very Euro game to be decided by the final roll of the dice.

This was the first worker placement game I had ever played and was a gateway game into drowning in heavier and unfortunately more expensive games. The game lasts through each of the four seasons where players will purchase more workers, more land, more grapes for wine making and this will eventually be used to harvest grapes for wine which will age and ultimately be sold for points and money. This game feels like you are truly a part of the wine making process and the components are beautiful. The little marble beads keep my wife coming back. The tension is created in the last season because you never know if someone is going to finally sell wine and how much they will sell. The game is normally very close and I love how the game will end when a player reaches a certain point on the point track but definitely doesn't mean they will win the game. I will finish the game and my wife will sit there planning this power move for 15 minutes and end up winning by one point somehow. It is extremely satisfying and is an all around beautiful board game.

It's a nice light worker placement game. The art and components are really nice. The theme is really appealing to my friends and I. I sometimes feel like the optimal move is obvious and sometimes restrictive. I get to a point where I need to do a certain action to get points and I feel like that's the only action that I really want to do, so I feel a bit stuck. Maybe this means I'm playing sub-optimally, or that I haven't explored other strategies enough. 

----------

I incorporated the Tuscany expansion and have been enjoying the game more. I'm finding it to be less of a gateway game though. There's added complexity with the expansion, the contract filling engine aspect can be hard to grasp immediately, so run-away leaders can be a problem if someone gets a couple good visitors and gets their engine running more quickly. I have also found that the game has been taking a much longer time to play than expected. Still a great game though. - 2017-9-3

The theme plays out well in this well-designed and beautiful worker placement game. Random draw of cards requires you be tactical and adaptable in your strategy but can be frustrating at times.

Components are top notch with a wonderful insert included for easy organization. 2 thumbs up for Viticulture EE!

See comments about Viticulture.  This version was tailor-made for me.  Everything I like about Viticulture and most of the Tuscany expansions that I like in 1 box.

It really is the 'essential' edition of Viticulture.

By far, my favorite worker placement game (as of March 2016).

March 2016: Finally played solo and it delivers.  Took two tries to win against the Automa deck, but it was tight both times.  Further solo plays confirm that solo can be quite difficult as it usually comes down to the very last turn to win.

Oct 2016: Played with the Structures expansion (which I bought alacarte) using a 4 card draft at the start, although I don't count the cards against your hand limit.  Definitely added a lot of great variety.  Will always use this expansion.

Friendly worker placement with not much blocking thanks to the Grande Worker but still very competitive. Engaging theme, great artwork and fun to play. Some people don't like the visitors cards as they add a bit of randomness to the gameplay but I think they are just sore losers, most of the luck can be mitigated. It's everything I could ask from a worker placement game.
Plus it helped me propose to my fiancée and it's how I found out we were having a baby. This game is part of the family!

Un super thème. Très bien retranscrit. Du placement d'ouvrier avec un twist interessant.

C'est vraiment domamge car on est proche du Terraforming Mars V 0.9 alors que ça pourrait faire un super jeu juste en rewordant pratiquement toutes les cartes ...

With Tuscany EE-after playing with this expansion Im a bit worried that a few of the structure cards are a bit overpowered.

This is a sweet game. I really love building my little vineyard and producing wine. The visitor cards can be very mean to you, but on the other hand they add variety to the game and you might have to adopt another strategy depending on what cards you draw. The only downside for me is that it ends just as you get your awesome winemaking engine going, I wish I could see it in action for a few more turns!

I also feel that this game is accessable to people not used to boardgaming, I play it regularly with my mother and it works fine just as long as I help her with some of the visitor cards as they are in english.

I was really happy with the recent plays of this. Excellent, clean combo of worker placement and engine building. Looking forward to getting my goals a little more focused in my play, so far I've played with to broad a strategy 

But yeah, as far as this game goes I really enjoyed the theme and I thought the gameplay was excellent. Every turn and year was full of hard choices.

On the surface, this game might seem like a very simple, albeit solid, worker placement game, and it is.  However, the inclusion of the Summer and Winter Visitor cards really spices up the game and keeps you on your toes.  Add to that the ability to (mostly) block other players from spaces they might desperately need is another welcome mechanic.

I have to say this game is my current shining example of what a worker placement game is and should be.

Update: I recently acquired the Tuscany: Essential Edition and I have to say, it is absolutely necessary.  It takes a very basic and simple worker placement game and dials it up several needed notches.  Now, the game feels very rounded out and full.  Excellent

It's a balance between getting the staff or planting the vines.  The end game needs to be well planned out, so it works better for all players if you have a trial run

RATING: 6
Cute and beautiful, but the theme doesn't come through the mechanics as one might initially expect.  

Actions and card pulls can seem/feel inconsequential, fall/spring seem too outside of the theme, and many elements too easily reducible to numbers / meter-pushing.

Still, there are a lot of choices each turn with appropriate constraints.

In der Troika der drei Weinanbauspiele mit GRAND CRU und VINHOS auf jeden Fall das fluffigste. Nachteil VITICULTURE: nicht zu unterschätzendes Kartenziehglück der teilweise recht mächtigen Karten, die den schleppenden, strategischen Aufbau der Weinwirtschaft torpedieren und dadurch ein wenig die Sinnfrage des mühsamen Aufbaus stellt. VITICULTURE lässt sich im Grunde auch ohne die Grundidee des Weinanbaus, sondern über Konzentration auf die Karten gewinnen. So mein erster Sonne und Schatten beinhaltender Eindruck eines visuell fein gemachten, sehr thematischen Spiels nach einer ersten Partie mit dem Uwe-Rosenberg-Qualitätssiegel.

This game really doesn't match many of my other top picks, but the hype is real about this rich euro game. There is one obvious route to victory that everyone must take through the wine order cards, but how you get there is the fun. Efficiency, worker placement, running your own vineyard with basically all good choices to take no matter who has taken what from the board. Fun, laid back, and intense all at once. Love the artwork too.

I didn't know what to expect from Viticulture as I had read very little about it. I found a rather straightforward worker placement game that nonetheless does the mechanic quite well. A decent engine of growing grapes, harvesting those grapes, and then making them into wine to fulfill Order cards. It would be as straightforward as that if it wasn't for the Customer cards that is the main way players can break rules and do extra things they normally wouldn't be able to do. Again, not an idea that hasn't been done to death already, but Viticulture is well-enough designed that it holds your interest the whole time and keeps the tension riding at a steady pace. I also like the ability to buy improvements as an action and sacrifice engine operation to facilitate engine building. Some of the Customer cards are a little too much "take that" for me and randomly hit the "player on your left" or "right", which I thought a little mean. Why not just target the leader or someone with an advantage? Punishing a player that could be in last place isn't very nice. Otherwise, I'm not sure at this point we needed another straightforward worker placement game but Viticulture is an excellent example of the genre nonetheless.

Such a well thought out solo system with various difficulty modes, and a campaign that forces you to approach the game differently each time.

Because of the way the game scales, competition for actions will inevitably be fiercer in 2, 4 and 6 player games. 3 and 5 player games will be 'friendlier'.

The theme didn't initially appeal to me too much and I did wonder how often I would be able to get it to the table but so far it's going down quite well. It didn't take me too long before I decided that I definitely wanted to lay my hands on the  Tuscany expansion though.

Holy sweet mother of god, this is a hard game when played solitaire.  The regular rules for the Automa are fairly simple, but the campaign play rules are tough!  The different challenges definitely force you to adapt your strategy and try different ways to win.  

I've read that some people have a problem with the luck of the draw of the cards, and yes, that can affect you, especially when playing solo.  My one play with other players (4-player game), however, I probably had the worst cards, but it was fun trying to get around that.

It's early on during the development of Automa decks, but this simple one might be one of the best.  The campaign challenges vary greatly, and there are almost no Automa rules to remember during the game.  Outstanding, and bumps my rating of the game to a 10.

Solo high score: 23

Campaign Play:
Challenge 1: 3 tries (successful)
Challenge 2: 1 try (successful) - woohoo!
Challenge 3: 5 tries (successful - argh - a tie in the 3rd game)
Challenge 4: 1 try (successful)

Complete and in excellent condition. Bonus: also includes the board from the Tuscany expansion as well. This expanded board increases the "seasons"(available spots each turn) from just Summer & Winter to all 4 seasons. It's a big improvement over the 2 season board from VtEE. Helps to balance the game at the 2 player count as well.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent solo mode. I enjoy the tension in 2p games, the freedom of the grade worker and the decision about when to use him each round. Dislike the luck of the draw, but enjoy needing to improvise around the cards you get. 

Update: Having played some more, I've finally had my chances in a game completely hosed by bad draws: Getting order after order that required red grapes and unable to get red vines. Despite having a cottage from my Papa and spending actions to draw cards, it took me until the final few rounds to draw a single 1-value red vine, and I hadn't been getting visitor cards that gave me other options for making many points either. While this is a rare occurrence, it's immensely frustrating when it happens. I think Tuscany basically solves this, giving you alternative ways to make points, but I wish the base game addressed it effectively. Rating docked 1/2 a point.

Update 2: The way turn order is handled in the base game is problematic. Having the grape token when you can trigger end of game and choose to go first in wake up order is tremendously valuable and can swing the outcome of the game. Again, this is addressed in Tuscany, but in this case I think the base game should have been revised in light of the improvement in Tuscany.

The game is well designed and well presented. The actions all make sense thematically, which serves as a mental aid (plant, gather grapes, make wine, sell wine). The card play provides a nice layer of variance (others say luck), while the game offers a deep, yet somehow relaxing puzzle! UPDATE: Tuscany bumped this up, from 8 to 9. The complexity to enjoyment ratio is excellent!

This game has so much going for it. The art is great. The components are stellar. The theme is super cool. After the first hour or so, I thought I was going to really love this game. But as I played it more, I noticed something was missing. I couldn't put my finger on it at first, but then it hit me. In all my games, but especially in my worker placement games, I crave tension. I need to feel like I am about to make a move that I prey none of my competitors see coming. Or, I am hanging on the edge of my seat saying to myself..."Please don't go on that spot (or take that card, or do that action, etc.). After 60 minutes of Viticulture, I realized I wasn't feeling that tension all that much. I began to wonder why that is. Then I realized. It's the grande worker. The grande worker lets you take any action on the board in any season, even if all the spots are taken. That KILLS this game for me. Knowing that I can do whatever I want, whenever I want removes that tension from the game. Yes, you can only do this once per year and yes, you have to plan your moves in advance, but that grande worker mechanic just kills the game for me. I like the game even with this mechanism and will play it if it's suggested, but I can't see myself ever buying this game. There's just not enough of what I enjoy in this game.

Love this game!! It's one of our favorite worker placement games. The theme is so deep and doesn't feel pasted on at all, and the mechanics work so well with the theme. I love how someone who appears to be leading at first can end up coming in last by the time the game is over.

Likely my favourite worker placement game.  I love the idea of the theme and everyone loves sitting around the table with this one and a bottle of wine.  A lovely Euro that screams theme.

One of the best games! Essential worker placement with 2 twists (grande worker, seasons). Very much card driven (you cannot win ignoring card draws) - and that's why it is awesome that each card is unique! Makes for a very nice replayability. Solo game is absolutely top (automa). Plays great with 2. Desperately want to try it with 3+. If worker placement, this is a stylish way to go. And I almost forgot the outstanding

I'm a *little* bit sad that it does not include the Tuscany board, but I'm fine with the other omissions/streamlining they chose to apply.

After the first two plays I had some concerns that bad card draws could spoil a game for you. This turned out not to be true, at least for the most part. I found you can pretty easily adapt your strategy to "bad" (low value) wine (green) cards or to mismatching wine and wine order cards. Useless visitor cards seem more of an issue if you draw many of them. But even then I saw people just keeping a powerful but useless to them visitor in hand and make the card worthy for them in a later turn.

A much, much better game than the over-hyped Scythe by the same designer. It's not that Scythe is a bad game - this game is just quite a bit more enjoyable, and also more intuitive to newer players.

And the components are gorgeous without being overblown and tacky. A real treat of a game.

Great game. There's 2 phases of learning and you need to enjoy both though to get the most out of it:
1) you like the engine and feel of making wine
2) when you get to know the game more you realise a lot of the skill/fun comes from playing/adapting to the cards you see rather than sticking to a strategy you came up with at the start. 

My wife loves point 1, but doesn't like point 2 that much. I love both. So an 8

Viticulture is a good game that highlights a lot of ways that I feel newer games have misstepped. There are a lot of mechanisms and there is a good deal of randomness. The game is pretty long too. Not enough payoff for all the work though. Again, not to say it's a bad game. Compared to games like Agricola and Puerto Rico though it's fairly shallow and not very interactive. This game isn't the clever game I was hoping for, but instead a well-put-together distillation of mechanics we've seen a thousand times over. Balanced to the point of boredom

Found the Mama and Papa cards to be very cute/interesting for variety/thematic.
The waking turn order is neat but makes it hard to play  if you aren't 1st or 2nd.
There is a lot to grok; I would try to figure out how to obtain cards for the current game year while placing workers, forgetting that the game was going to give me cards anyway. I can't imagine the game without the grande worker, which is a way of guaranteeing that you can't be blocked out of doing one action of your choice each round. I also can't imagine playing this game with 6 people (eep).

It's...fine. Hate the blind card draw. This game could definitely use a China/Ticket To Ride type setup for the vines and orders. Far too few workers to get screwed because you drew a combination of vines and orders that just don't match. Also, don't like the race to 20 points end game condition. I don't need to play this again.

Update February '17: just magnificent. This has moved up steadily in my collection to one of my favorite and most-played titles. 

So smooth and balanced. Have not played any other version of the game, so I can't speak to the expansion modules included herein, but it feels great in this version - not too much, not too little, a few different viable paths to victory. The "grande worker" innovation is ingenious. I don't tend to play new games repeatedly within a short span of getting them, but this has hit the table three times in the first two weeks of owning it. That says a lot.

If you want a great game, all you have to do is add Tuscany, this will join my collection once the essential version comes out. The luck you sometimes get with the cards is a bit of a downer for me, but it's what keeps the game accesible and somewhat less heavy.

RATING: 5
I initially reviewed this game as a 9 but after extensive play and mastering of the tactics, I quickly realized how, once you don't make obvious mistakes, the game comes all down to luck, specifically in who gets the best visitor cards early and the best wine orders first. Of course you can draw more cards but that will only set you behind while people luckier than you at the table are already working on filling their orders and sailing off the better bonuses they got from their visitor cards. The game offers no comeback mechanics to bring you back on top, you simply continue the game trailing behind. I'm ultimately very disappointed with this title because of it's untapped potential. This game disguises itself as a tactical, analytical worker placement but if you define yourself as a player who strives to play games to their max potential, you will quickly realize how the tactical part falls completely secondary to the luck factor. On a secondary note, I also feel like the flow of the game is very off. You start by needing currency badly and you work on wine orders that increase your recurring income which suggests an engine building mechanic that should come to fruition later on. Instead, what happens is that someone fills 3-4 orders and game is over. You can spend money on structures that you will maybe utilize once or twice. The game ends too quickly and the game currency goes from essential to useless in a matter of a round. To me that doesn't seem logical. The recurring income is basically useless with the exception of one, maybe two visitor cards that let you trade residual payments for victory points, again, confirming the fact that the game, if played by an experienced group, simply all comes down to luck.

Marvellous euro game with strategical choices, wonderful mechanics and lots to explore. One of the favourite euro games i have ever played. Contracts should be done to earn points and making them is becoming more tensed with each year. I should try solo variant.

I just dont like some card abilities. It would be better if we may draft them instead of randomly draw one.

First time I played Viticulture about 18 months ago (original version) I came away with a headache following a 6 player game with Tuscany expansion. Boy, did I feel exhausted after that 4 hours - to be fair 4 players knew the game inside and out and my friend and I were newbies! On reflection though I loved the theme, it really did feel like I was setting up a vineyard, plus that beautiful board and playing pieces kept me interested. Anyway time passed and my immersion into modern boardgames continued to a point where I knew next time I could tackle Viticulture with more assurance. Then the Essential version came out and reading the reviews it seemed like the perfect game for me.
And so it has proved. I love this game. Everything about it is such a joy to behold. We're now introducing others to the game slowly following on from Fresco so they understand worker placement and wake up times etc. Recently my friend bought me the metal coins for my birthday and they just add to that experience. Accompanying wine recommendation: Big bold Italian Puglian Primitivio (Zinfandel)

One of my favorite worker placement games especially at 2p (about 20 2p plays). I've played some 4p and 5p with new players and it is harder to plan out your turn compared to 2p.

2p feels like a basically perfect game of its genre. I only played 3 times with multiplayer and I don't know if it's as good.

On my first play I was struck straight away by how poor the theme is. It's not just pasted on, but taken off, ripped up, accidentally put through the washing, then reassembled in a jumbled mess. Grapes do not age, they rot like any fruit - ageing grapes is complete nonsense. For some reason "pre-modern" Tuscany is visited by tour guides and oenologists, grapes are harvested in winter, and blush (a type of wine created in the US in the 1980s) has been transported back in time and across continents. But, if you manage to ignore the thematic errors and anachronisms - or just don't know much about wines and wine-making - then you'll find an interesting worker placement game.

I had no expectations so it was a pleasant surprise for me.
The game has tension and emotions, but I'm not sure about them in future plays.

The game seems too random due to visitor cards.  They are great because they introduce a tactical layer and provide excitement, but on the other hand they can decide who wins...

Viticulture has a number of great mechanics (particularly the turn order selection and wine creation mechanics) with some simpler ones to make for an accessible worker placement game experience. My main complaints are that the luck component (especially in card draws) can play a slightly-larger role than I would prefer and the scaling of the game for different player counts creates unique but sometimes subpar experiences (for instance, the game doesn't scale much between 3 and 4 players but the competition is tighter and more fun at 4). In spite of these drawbacks, it has enough clever mechanics and an enjoyable engine-building feel for me to recommend it.

NOTE: I haven't played the original version, only the Essential Edition. I'm not sure how it compares to the vanilla base game.

I supported the original Viticulture on KS and I´m very uncomfortable with this new Viticulture Essential Edition. By my count is the third DIFFERENT edition that Stonemaier Games published in as many years. The real issue for me are the changes in the rules. This is VERY rude toward your original backers and it brings problems along the line. If we are playing which set of rules do we apply? Stonemaier Games did the same thing with Euphoria, they changed the rules after release :/. 

That’s the reason I didn’t support Scythe nor I will ever support any other Stonemaier Games KS campaign.

I´m surprised I´m the only one that seems bothered by this behavior. Most people praise Stonemaier Games a lot, but to me, they are the opposite of a classy company. They don’t treat their supporters with respect.

Extremely thematic (except the grape mixing - why do two reds and a white make champagne?). Easy to teach, fun to play, but not too light. The planting, harvesting, wine creation and aging mechanics are creative, thematic, and fun. Minor cons: money loses its value as the game progresses, scoring is "end-loaded" in that many early rounds tend to go by with no or little scoring and then all of the scoring seems to happen in the last round or two. 20 points seems like an arbitrary and premature stopping point.

This game achieves what it sets out to do perfectly. A great light-med weight euro that rewards players, can be taught to newer players intuitively and has quality components and artwork that help with the immersion. This is my top euro and great to play with other couples. Player points are often very close at the end of the game, and then there's all of those deliciously unique visitor card abilities - yes please! I've even acquired real Italian lira coins to play with :)

Another solid worker-placement euro.  There are a few paths to focus on (or dabble in each). Ultimately, as with all other euros, you must earn points. The idea of planting grapes, then harvesting them, to creating wine is fun. But remember to do so to complete your orders. It maintains a 7 for now, but I'm not interested in owning it. My one full play saw two people struggle with poor card draws that really saw the fun removed. Curious to see if Sean's copy gets more table time...won't be requested by us anytime soon.

RATING: 8
A great worker placement game in which the theme shines. Our only gripe was the unbalanced visitor cards. 
With adding the moor visitor cards, we have made 2 separate decks of both the summer and winter visitors. 2 decks are the powerful cards (personal opinion), which we use for a faster, visitor heavy, higher luck game. The other two decks are weaker visitors we use when we want a game that is lower luck because there is less emphasis on the visitors and higher reliance on "engine building" (for lack of a better term). Both ways play very differently, but still work really well in our experience. It may ruin the intent of the game, but for us, it is perfect. It's like 2 games in one now. Cheers!

This one is near, if not at the top, of my board game collection. Fantastic work Stonemaeir Games!

Smooth game play.  Subtle.  Some of the cards seemed to weighted which allowed for players to get up on the victory point track without having to cultivate and harvest their vineyard.

I don't understand the hype for Viticulture. I realized it was a mistake while doing the initial solo run-through. Playing it with a group didn't change my opinion. As an introduction to worker-placement I can see it being useful, but I'd rather play Stone Age. The production is excellent. I love the glass beads and custom building meeples. The theme is cool (plant grapes, turn them into wine, age them in the cellar, sell them to customers), but the gameplay mechanics are dull (put a bead on a numbered grape, transfer the bead to the same number in the cellar, wait while the number increases with time, match to the number on a customer card). And oh, the cards. So many cards. So random. So unbalanced. Listed the game for sale the following day.

RATING: 8
I was struck by how thematic the game felt and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is not one that I would pull out when looking for a deep and challenging game, but I feel like mechanically the game strikes the same, appealing middle-ground that Lords of Waterdeep does - while still being a very different game - which makes it a game I can throw on the table with virtually anyone. 

What makes the game good? The turns run in a seasonal cycle whereby you actually have two entirely separate areas where workers are placed, a summer area and a winter area, and you need to divide your workers between them in two phases of a single turn - a novel device and an interesting - if not quite compelling - decision space. There are numerous steps involved in producing and selling wine, which makes for slow points gathering at the beginning, but which speeds up tremendously as players begin filling wine contracts. There are lots of cards in the form of visitors that throw quite a bit of variability into the mix. While action spaces are quite limited, every player has one piece that can be placed when spaces are not available. Yes, this makes it a kinder, gentler worker-placement than some - for that reason it will not be a top-ranked title for me (I like hard choices, for the most part) - but it has some cool things going on and I know it will be a crowd-pleaser that I can also enjoy.

Terrific worker placement game with card play that distinguishes it from the crowd. I have not played the first edition- which does not include some of the elements that this "essential" iteration offers. I am assured by those familiar with both that this is the edition of choice. The theme is effectively married to the mechanics which helps make this rather heavy game far more accessible that it would otherwise be.

This is a racing game, perhaps in the abstract but none the less a racing game.  It is possible that one might beat the player who triggered the ending, but this is highly unlikely with experienced players.  The first half of the game is fun, but the second half seems to be over too quickly.  One player scored twenty points in one turn and bam the game was over.  The cards seem very swingy, with some very powerful no matter what and others being powerful only under certain conditions or with a few actions necessary to maximize results.  The variance in the cards I guess is fine because they are random draws but the cards can really break the game, which again is ok if they are all in the same league of breaking ability.  However, there were many cards that just seemed worthless or so specific in conditions as to rarely occur.    Ultimately, I don't hate the game but I think it really needs work for me to want to play it more than once in awhile.  For example, more locations would be good.  A place where you could trade cards for another card.  Or in a five player game, two bonuses per location for first and second player (first bonus better than the second).  Perhaps a way to make trading cards better with investment.  Perhaps even end points for buildings.  I don't know it just felt like the game was really building up and that was fun, and then bam, game is over.  The ending felt very premature and I am not sure I found it cleaver.

A fun worker placement game.  It requires some delay of gratification regarding getting points from eventually selling wine orders (my spouse says "it takes forever for anything to happen -- it's slow").  Honestly though, I think the planning to grow, harvest, process, and then sell your wine is a rewarding process.  My only concern is that the card system (all colours) adds a layer of unwelcome randomness.  If you get red grape vines (green card draws) and white wine orders (purple card draws) you are swimming upstream against players who get matching cards.  Also the summer/winter visitors (yellow/blue) cards are swingy in terms of variable strengths and then it's kind of luck of the draw.  If you like randomness to level the playing field in terms of skill level you might like the randomness.  If you like strategic games with no luck so that rewards the best planning and execution the luck will be unwelcome.  Put me in that camp.  Final verdict though, it's a game I want to hit the table again, so definitely a keeper and worthy of its popularity I would say.

Simple and beautiful worker placement game about making wines. This is definitely of the most aesthetically pleasing games I own; the component qualities are top notch! Growing grapes & making varieties of wine are fun and intuitive. The downside: cards are bit unbalanced, and during the late game, often times it becomes very obvious who is going to reach the end-game score of 20 and win.

Despite so, I wouldn't turn down this beautiful & pleasant worker placement game.

Played it about 10 times in a row on the first day of opening the game. Wooooooooow what an amazing game!!! I didn't think I would be so interested in wine but the fact that it is super thematic actually got me into it; I love that I'm learning about making wine and harvesting grapes. And all the little pieces everyone gets is just so fun to handle. The game scales very well too. It's simple and accessible enough for newcomers to understand and complex enough for gamers to enjoy!

Hard to say something after one play. Seemed quite rules-heavy when the cards are so chaotic. Some benefit you at the start of the game, others at the end.

I love the ever-harvestable vines, the aging mechanism, the special card, the turn order Fresco-like bidding, and the two seasons. But here is where the game breaks down for me: drawing your vines, and drawing your clients, completely at random. Drawing one or the other would be acceptable, so you could align the other to what you get, but what made the randomness necessary?

There are a lot of interesting paths you can go on this game. You can always go to victory point spaces or you might build some good buildings before you go on and make some wine or even you can create 1 wine and give tours every single turn with the building that gives vp on tours. 
My only complaint is that when playing 2 players there is no bonus spaces so it takes a bit of the fun away but still a solid game. I like it a lot.

2015-10-13 - 7.5 - Cool worker placement with a lot of options. Thematically it makes a lot of sense. The artwork is not as beautiful as some say but it's OK and functional. You need to get used to a division between summer and winter. I don't know which expansions were added during my game, probably none.

2016-02-20 - Rating stays the same. Finally I managed to play it with someone. It's quite quick and has pretty simple rules. I use houserules very rarely, but I consider to have vine "market" with 3 visible cards to choose from, or draw one from the green deck. 
I can see now that in this edition there are no modules (except for automa for solo play) and most probably I played full game in Essen (although rules explanation was rather confiusing and made this game much more complicated than it really is).

2018-01-27 - 7.5 -> 8 - I played with the Tuscanny expansion twice and it makes this game more interesting adding two more seasons, although considerably longer. However both plays were with 5 players, what could affecth the length. I don't think it needs any home rules. It's just a really good, pleasant worker placement.

Feels like "Race for the Vineyard" in terms of game length and direct strategy choice. You have your setup, pick your strategy accordingly, and go.

Some may not appreciate the swinginess/randomness of the card draws, but, at this game length, just play again.

I really enjoy this worker placement game. I'm a fan of the theme (usually have a glass of wine while playing), and the mechanics are superb. This is really the essential edition, except for one element- The Tuscany board. If that board was included in this edition it would easily be a 10. Yet, everything else is great to play with right out of the box, and if you haven't played on the Tuscany board you are really not missing too much. It is just more of a preference for me. If you are thinking of purchasing this game, but don't really want to pay more money for the extra fun in Tuscany this is a great buy.

Es un juego con una mecánica muy chula y muy entretenido, pero en mi opinión las cartas están muy descompensadas, las hay muy tochas y otras que no valen para nada. Y lo peor es que te toquen unas u otras es puro azar, pues no hay cartas vistas entre las que elegir, todas están ocultas. 
Si no tuviera ese alto componente de azar le pondría una nota más alta.

This is my favourite "agriculture" style game - which I am usually not a fan of. Not at all. 

The mechanisms are great, turn order, worker placement, all really well defined. Scoring track is tense as well! Only thing that is bothering me besides the art is the visitor cards. I know they make the game more strategic and are very important but they are too much in number. Really increases the game length especially for new players.

Art is bland. Even though it fits the theme its very low saturated and keeps itself in the background. Good for readability on the other side.

One of the best worker placement games ever. Love that you have to decide which season you want to use/save your meeples for. Tough to do everything and build everything you want to in this, so it leaves plenty to explore. Cards are sometimes random in one players favor but not overwhelmingly.

the base game is wonderful...a wistful worker placement affair that leaves you satisfied, at peace with life, and your head slightly throbbing; not too unlike drinking a bottle of medium bodied red. tuscany, however, gives this game TEETH. these teeth are sharp and good. almost like having two different games. i will personally never play without tuscany again. it adds just enough to give the base game depth and meat to make it nearly perfect. this game rules. hard.

This edition, and this edition only, is sheer perfection. You will love it. Even if you have no friends and cannot transport yourself to gaming booths, you can play the AI.  And man, the AI is good... 

Also, some hobbyists have published on bgg patterns for printing wickers for the pieces (so cute! i had to make them too), and card holders (like the stuff to keep playing cards together).

The box is small, required table space is reasonable, it plays quick, the components are gorgeous in both visual and tactile sense, the gameplay is immersive, the theme fits very well with what you are doing (making wine),  and afterwards you feel wam and cozy and happy. 

What more could you ask for?

Oh, after reading the manual I can teach the game in 2 minutes.

Initially didnt like it due too the randomness of the card draws, houseruled it to draw two cards and pick one for the "plant/green" and "orders/purple" tiles. Mitigates the random draw of the cards a bit and made the game work for me. The theme is very refreshing and the artwork and component quality is great. Also bonus points for a good single player mode. Update: Tuscanny Essentials expansion is also a must, bigger board is a very big improvement to the flow of the game.

Far and away the best worker placement game Ive ever played. I love that the spaces to place workers are always tight, but you can also always take a spot that you desperately need with a grande worker. Having the worker placement broken down into two phases forces you to balance your actions very efficiently. Its also very difficult for there to be a runaway winner, making each ending exciting. Plus theres just something satisfying about moving those glass beads from one spot to another on your player mat

Reduced score to 7 as after repeated plays you can streamline your actions to pretty much guarantee end game victory points after 7 turns, making the game less fun for yourself and other players. Also the game is fragile as some of the chance cards are overpowered and unbalance the game, in particular some of the building cards like the 'Tap room' or 'Tavern'. 

I'd recommend Tuscany Expansion as improves the games, 6 players takes longer but is still very enjoyable and can be more frustrating in a good way trying to get your engine started. 4 players is definitely the sweet spot with the right amount of blocking and less time between turns. Quite an easy game to learn and a great theme.

I bought this game as something to play with my wife. She loves Lords of Waterdeep, but we had both burnt ourselves out on the game. Viticulture gave us both the worker placement we craved with a new theme and a great excuse to drink wine. Great production value by Stonemaier, nothing new there.

RATING: 7.5
[2016.Jun.24] A fun theme encapsulates a rather traditional worker placement and resource conversion board game. The game revolves around guiding your vinters (workers/meeples) through numerous years (broken further down into seasons) to grow & harvest grapes, produce wine, and finally fulfill orders. This process works (and is fun for me, at least), but is really no different than other get-stuff-and-convert-it style games. The inclusion of the rules for the Grande Worker (big meeple) means that no player can be truly blocked from performing that one really important task they need to do this turn. This is a plus in my opinion. Luck of the (card) draw does come into play with respect to the vine, visitor, and order cards. While many, many cards are drawn & played by each player throughout the course of a game, a few consecutive draws of ill-suited cards (for one player) can hamstring his/her game. Alas, the card drawing aspect is an unfortunate minus that slightly mars an otherwise solid game. The "Essential Edition" version gets an extra plus, since it repackages just the right components from older editions (incl. expansions) and also includes the latest fined-tuned rules; the solo rules are another plus too. (The automata rules work surprisingly well.) Overall, nothing new or Earth-shattering here, but what is present works. If you like wine, give this game a taste.

RATING: 5.5
It’s nice but certainly not essential, on behalf of a couple of glaring loose ends.

First, once you get your engine running all money you gain is practically useless, and it's most often before you’ve maxed out the residual payment.

There’s also the highly situational carddraws. I did about 8 games solo, but having a round-time limit really accentuates how dependent the game is on recieving the right cards. Get no match between vines and orders and you’re in trouble.

If I didn’t know beforehand how Tuscany fixes a lot of problems I’d probably be one to playtest some variants myself. For example, I’d really wish the purple order-cards had an open market as well with about 3 cards open for everyone to fill (perhaps at the expense of a coin).

Never would have thunk wine making could be so fun. It is a worker-placement that forces you to cater plays towards your card draw, unlike something like Caverna which is very open ended, this is not a bad thing as it makes the game way more accessible and fast.

This really scratches my itch, as you see your vineyard and business grow and because the game is only up to  20 VP's, you really have to think through how to best optimize things, which makes for some very heavy thinking.

Viticulture is nice economic worker placement game with some hand management. The theme is very original and the artwork is beautiful. The worker actions are so thematic that you really feel like running a vineyard and not just selling wine. I love the solo variant of the game as it differs from multiplayer strategies and provides good challenges.

This is definitely a solid, not too difficult to learn but deeper than say Lords of Waterdeep, worker placement game, but it isn't amazing. I like that you have to balance your workers between the two seasons and some of the mechanisms thematic to wine making (e.g. the aging of the wines). However, I don't like how situational a lot of the cards are, which makes drawing them at the wrong time seem to be pretty swingy. I wish each card was slightly weaker but you could draft what you needed when you needed Ticket to Ride style instead.

Love this game.  Great theme, simple to teach and play.  Really enjoy playing this game with a tall glass of red wine! :o)

My only critique is that I can usually figure out my entire turn pretty quickly and then there is a lot of sitting around waiting for slower players to execute their actions. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can be blocked or forced into less favorable spaces which causes you to readjust your plan.  Even so, there is considerable downside when playing with an AP player.

A great multiplayer game and also a solid solo experience due to the Automa rules - I love that there are multiple difficulties, an aggressive variant and a campaign mode - the game does not feel stale after a few plays due to that, although I'd like a bit steeper challenge overall.

All in all this is a gorgous, mechanically sound game with great theme and mechanics to match it.

[i] After first plays [/i]

Short setup, low upkeep and great AI make it very addictive. Mechanics are very straightforward and very visible. It feels like someone made a 6 hour wine making game, then shrunk the box three times and put a summary of the original in it (in a good way). It might be the case that there is one deck of cards too many, in that if you keep drawing the wrong grapes, you might end up having to spend a lot of workers on redrawing grape cards. 

[i]Update[/i]
The more I play this, the more I see the elegance of the design. Everything ties together really well, nothing feels tacked on. It's challenging, but never leaves you with truly bad options.

Sold. Not because I don't enjoy it anymore, but it just seems to sit between heavy and light in terms of weight, meaning I am inclined to go with other options when I have time to play a game.

Played it once and had to buy it, But the essential edition. Very lucky and happy to have it. After a few plays I have realized that the nature of this game changed from what me love it in the first place. You could just stop making wine and just take visitor cards for the entire game and actually win just by plying the cards. No more wine making has actually ruined it for me. I still like it but the feelers that I had for it when I first played are nothing more than a forgotten vintage.

Good game. The yellow and blue benefit cards seem a little too important, there are some cards that are really good and some that can be useless. This makes the luck of the draw more of a deciding factor than I like in a game of this style.

Sadly enough behind the nice wine-theme and atmosphere ("things take time") there hides a run-to-the-end-optimization-game. After several plays I have to say: I like optimization-games better if they have a pre-set ending - like in Terra Mystica but Viticulture is really, really smoooooth. Maybe too smooth and polished. I would say that it lacks character - a bit sad for a game about wine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A truly brilliant game. Every decision you make, every worker placed, every card played, and in what order you do them, counts. Some of the smoothest gameplay I've ever experienced, I was planting, harvesting, smashing and making wine in no time at all. An elegant rule book and the best components of any game anywhere, you'll just enjoy having it out on your table. I'll play this game any time, any place.

Neat little worker placement game. It's a slow build and there are lots of options to choose from with your limited supply of workers. The cards add opportunities for clever play and a fair share of unpredictability (which some may find off-putting). First play was with 5 players and it took almost 3 hours. I think the sweet spot will be 3 to 4 players. I thought this might be a good game for some non-gamer friends who like wine, but after playing it, I think it is a bit more of a gamer's game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Viticulture is a fantastic worker-placement strategy.  There's engine-building, and task prioritization but with plenty of potential wrinkles and paths to victory.  The grande worker, far from reducing some of the usual tension in a worker-placement game, actually adds another element to your strategy: Do I play him now to take an already occupied action, or do I wait and use him as a further insurance policy? The breaking up of turns into two halves, with different actions available in each one is an inspired touch since it emphasizes the need for long-term planning.

Plus, you can't beat the uniqueness of the game theme - the look of shock alone from new players when you casually announce "Who wants to play the game of strategic winemaking???" is worth the cost alone.  And the theme here is perfectly integrated into the game itself.

My only complaint is that some of the wooden components are pretty fragile - already at least 2 of the tasting room pieces have split in two.  My other complaint is the card sizes - while they are visually appealing, why is it that the Mama and Papa cards, which are used only at the start of the game and then discarded back into the box, are the size of normal playing cards while the Visitor, Wine Order, Vine cards, which are handled throughout the game, get the hand-cramping mini-card treatment?  Other than those gripes, the components are pretty solid.

This game is a must own.

Two things i don't like. The Grande workers defeat the purpose of the worker slots being limited, and the crushpad mechanic is hard to grasp for some. i love the turn order track, and how it gives better bonuses the later you are in turn order. So you have to decide between getting to pick first, or getting a better bonus. Overall a pretty good game and Great theme. I'd have to say i like this one a little better than Vinhos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nearly perfect.  I have found I really like worker placement games and this is the KING IMO.  I'm also a wine-lover and blogger so the theme is just gold to me.  Only complaint is the balance of some of the visitor cards.  Some are kick-ass and others are worthless.  I'd like to see theme evened out a bit, but it's really a small complaint.  

Update:  Encountered a negative that I can easily rectify but wanted to note.  When playing 2 player it can very very difficult to come back from a deficit if you drew poor cards to begin.  Next time I play I think I'll allow each player to discard and redraw all of their cards once if they feel they get a poor starting hand.  Played with my wife and she got saddled with orders and grapes that didn't match for a first 1/4 to 1/2 of the game and was in such a hole from that that she couldn't get her engine going and it was a bloodbath.  Not fun when that happens.

FUN:  the rules are not that complex, but there are a lot of decisions to make.

UNIQUE: the ageing mechanism is 
interesting, but the rest of the game is definitely not unique.

NEGATIVES: the theme doesn't interest me at at all (but it's executed nicely). There are a lof of 'surprise' points to be made with the visitor's deck, making the game a tad more unpredictable than you would think based on the rules.

More going on in this instantly addictive worker placement game than I thought there would be. The multiplicity of cards and card types made this worker placement game a bit tricky for me to fully wrap my head around in my first play. I could see my ranking going up or down depending on future plays. There seems to be multiple paths to victory, and if they are all balanced, I expect my appreciation for the game to grow. If I uncover unbalanced cards or approaches, my opinion could also decline.

Very good game.  Playing through automa at the moment.  Prefer the essential edition to the first edition due to the extra elements worked in. Automa can be frustrating at times, but I think it is a case of working out a good strategy and loading up on workers ASAP, and not forgetting that the grande worker can overplay your own worker (not just automa workers).

Viticulture is a game with really well done dovetailing of theme and mechanics. The game is pretty simple to grasp and I feel it has a low ceiling, making it great to play in a group with various skill levels. 

The luck factor with the cards means you don't play to win really, you just play to be in a position to win. If you need strong competitive elements in your games, Viticulture isn't for you. However, it is a fun game to just play, regardless of winning or losing.

I like competition a lot so Viticulture won't make my Top 5, but it's one of my favorite games to bring to the table with my friends. Add the Tuscany Essentials expansion though and this game becomes fantastic.

Rating this game after one play seems unfair... oh well. 
In our game, one player (noob to the game) rushed points and won by nearly double. Hopefully that isn't the best strategy cause that will lead to a dumb game.
There is way to much luck in such a brutal worker placement. Everyone is growing grapes and making wine, so once those two spots are filled you can do almost nothing... that means half the time you don't get to do what you want, which sucks since there are only 10 or so rounds in the game.  There is also a very high amount of luck with the cards. Some yellow and blue cards are clearly better than others and it is merely the luck of the draw, which isn't nearly as bad the luck factor with drawings green and purple cards. I drew nearly no white grape green cards, but all of my purple wine cards had high white wine red/white mix wine requirements, and I drew almost a dozen purple cards since I was locked out of harvesting grapes and making wine so often.
I know I could do better with my increased knowledge of the game having played it once, and would give it another shot, but based on my first play, there is NO WAY that I would spend $100 to get the EE with Tuscany, which everyone seems to agree are both necessary.

Really beautifull worker placement game with excellent components. Player interaction is limited to blocking worker spaces though and that quickly becomes annoying. About half of the playing time you're not working on wines but try to get and use visitor cards with a great portion of luck of the draw involved. Additionally there's a runaway leader problem because fulfilling orders not only gives you much of the victory points but increases your income as well.

This is an excellent worker placement game. I really enjoy the separating the worker placement bit into two sections, meaning you need to plan how many workers to spend in the summer versus holding onto them to use during the winter.

I like the way the turn-order selection is done by choosing which bonus to take and the better bonus you take the further down the turn order you go. It balances out the benefit of going first with the bonuses gained from going last.

It works with two players, but is even better with three. I'm really excited to get this game back to the table to try out some of the modules in Tuscany. A solid game.

Played once with 5 players and it felt a little bit long. That being said, there were a couple of visitors that scored a lot of points, such that the game can be won with little participation in the wine production system. This game may be best with 4 players. Not much engine building, a bit more randomization than I'd like, but very suitable for a introduction to gateway games, where skill can be offset by luck.

Builds up in a straightforward and intuitive way.  The board scales well with different numbers of players, but some cards do not.  Competitive at times, but feels relaxed and low-tension overall.

Looking at the board, the game seems so complex, but then you play it and discover just how smoothly a game can run.  The mechanics support the game's theme, the components are excellent (love the effect of the glass beads on the board) and it scales perfectly in my opinion.

Before playing this game, I almost entirely based my purchases on looks alone, which means that I own a fair amount of Ameri-thrash games. It seems I've been missing out by ignoring the generally more drab-looking Eurogames! Viticulture is possibly my favourite game!

Viticulture reminds me why I have fallen in love with board gaming as a whole. This game presents itself in a beautiful package, both visually and from a design point. The game creates the right amount of tension, luck, engine building, and chaos that makes it a ten for me. If I could just play a handful of games for the rest of my life, Viticulture would make the cut and then some. Will this take Alien Frontiers out of its top spot for me, not at the moment, but it does have the ability with future plays. 10/10 great game, great design, great designers.

A good game. Enjoyable theme. Right now I need more plays to pin down my feelings. I always feel like there is so much i want to do every turn but can only do so much. 

Played it with 2,3,& 4 so far. 2 felt a little too confrontational for my tastes. Lots of blocking moves in this game. 4 was a bit long, but people were distracted so it could have just been that. Also being last is brutal in a 4 player game. 3 was a good balance, I felt. Hopefully additional plays at 4 will pick up speed.

Just 1 play so far.  Initial rating is 8.5/10.  I can only see this going up with future plays.  The various cards make this game interesting and fun.  Theme is similar to Vinhos but easier to explain the rules & play.  Where Viticulture deals mainly with the growing and production side of wine, Vinhos deals more with exporting and wine taste testing. Don't know which I like better.

This game, and every games I've played by the same designer, feel like a bunch of tried and tested mechanics thrown into a mixing bowl and cooked into a mundane and boring meal. There's just absolutely zero innovation to be found in there for me. 

If you're new to boardgames and need just one game to get a feel of the mechanics that are out there, I guess it is a good idea to buy Stegmeier games. Otherwise, for every one of his titles, I happen to own something similar in theme and designed with more expertise and originality. 

Dont get me wrong, those games arent -bad-. They are well designed and succeed in being decent pieces of entertainment. Its just not for the boardgame snobs like me :)

What a beautiful, well-designed game that integrates so many themes and mechanics wonderfully with high replay-ability. But holy hell, did they ever screw the pooch by printing Kickstarter's faces on the cards. Boardgamers are not typically very comely people (self notwithstanding). It really ruins the look and feel of the game in a way. And how many asian people really were there in pre-modern Italy? Stonemaier, PLEASE release an original-art replacement set of cards! We will pay!

Love the game and the theme.
Best played with to board of the expansion 'Tuscany'. Which gives the game even more depth.
The fact that it can be played with six people and that it offers enough variation means that it can be played often.
It scales also very good to 2 players where you will have to use a different tactic opposed to playing with 6.

Oh, the horrendous Kickstarter backer portraits... but what we really need to discuss is the luck of the draw. Now someone just gets all red orders and white vines when all they have are white wines, and someone gets white orders and red vines when all they have are red wines. Also, when you get your engine going, the game ends. Other than these, a nice wp game!

A favourite for the girlfriend and others. Not the easiest game to pick up, but it was the gateway to other Euro's. Can definitely say this game was a turning point for my liking of other games.

Great mechanics, excellent components, and an OK theme making it essential to a collection that wants something that packs a punch. Streamlined all the way to the victory condition, at times the game is drawing to a close and it felt like your engine is finally doing something.

Played 3 times rapid fire. I think I played each slightly off the rules. Won games 2 and 3. Had a lot more money than I think I should have (and a lot more workers. 5 in game 2 and 6 in game 3). Ended games 2 and 3 with 23 points, but didn't feel like I should have won. I want to play this one some more though!

Great game as a solo player with the automana and really good with more players.

6 players is very crowded at the start and end, with far too many workers to be placed for the spaces available. It makes jockeying for the turn order very important.

The randomness of the visitor cards, vines & wine orders requires some careful management and planning to use them to your best advantage.

Love this game!

RATING: 10
One of my favourite worker placement games.  While there is a possibility that some players can be burned by the blind card draw, I believe that you really have to utilize the resources and cards that you get (not what you wish you had) in order to maximize your chances of victory.  Beautiful components complement the immersive theme, and it plays relatively quickly no matter the player count.

This is a great game, which is much more simple than it looks. Interesting timeframe and I love the fact that each visitor card is unique and relevant in its own way.

Based on one play, Viticulture is a really fresh take on basic worker placement. The cards feel really cool and the gameplay is as smooth as silk. Feels like there is lots to discover in this game.

EDIT: Two-player game wasn't that good, although passable. I was really longing for those extra actions which were snuffed from a two-player game.

EDIT2: Tuscany Essential makes the base game obsolete. There's no reason to play without it, it turns an ok game a into a very good one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Additions ruin a nearly perfect original. The mama and papa cards aren't balanced. Selling fields is too powerful, and some of the new cards are imbalanced. The optimal strategy now seems to be to fill a minimum number of orders and get points from other cards. It's now rare for people to collect more than a couple coins from residual payments where as before it was common.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Looks good on the table; easy to remember rules; fun game that plays quickly.   

It does rely a lot on the luck of the card draw, as we had a game with orders requiring white wines and the play never drew a white vine, so there was no way to win.  When it plays balanced, it is a lot of fun; hopefully, Tuscany solves some of the "bad" luck issues.

Update:  I can't see the base game being played now that we have Tuscany EE.

Nice to see a worker placement game with strong and integrated theming, and also one that doesn't automatically reward having the most workers. It's a pleasant, rather than confrontational experience, and with a large number it is quite feasible to see everyone calmly pottering along with minimal interaction. But there is a massive amount of card-filtering required, and I'm yet to be convinced that luck of the draw doesn't dominate with experienced players. It's also a little longer than it feels like it needs to be.

I love this game. The theme fits very well; growing grapes, making wines, aging them for more points, etc. Some of the "visitor" cards are so deliciously evil - for example, every other player may get a free action, or some money, etc. ... but if they choose to, you get a point! A nasty way to get people to help you win the game.

I love this game. It was the first worker placement game that felt just right to me after playing several others that were fun to play but still felt slightly off. The theme and art adds to the joy of play for me, and the rules are just heavy enough to offer choice and variety without scaring off interested new players. The components are great and fun to play with. It has one of the best exponential ramp ups I've played that still almost always manages to be a close finish somehow.

It was either this or Vinhos since I don't need two games on this topic and I chose this one. In the end, I'm glad that I did since it is fun, easy-to-teach and can be played to completion in 60-90 minutes. It is not as thematic as Vinhos but it has enough theme to keep my interest over the course of the game. When you include the Tuscany expansion, you really have an excellent game with is myriad of options and strategies.

First time we played Viticulture (1st edition) three years ago it was so poor it took three years until we tried it again. This time Essential version with Mamas & Papas. the major problem we saw with the game three years ago are gone, but now I'm not sure if the changes in the rules fixed it or if we did something wrong the first time. Anyway, I have set my rating of the essential version accordingly.

Decent straightforward worker placement that really offers nothing out of the ordinary.  I played with the version with 4 seasons on the board and additional card types.  But even without the additional cards types (structures), I think this game relies too much on random card draws to provide variety.  Some of the cards are so powerful, there is really nothing you can do to defend against opponents drawing them except try to get some awesome cards of your own.  So the game has a a bit of an identity crisis:  is it a worker placement game or a card game?  I know a perfectly good hybrid is possible, but I'm not sure this game pulled it off.

The Essential Edition of Viticulture takes the basic game of Viticulture and combines it with many of the elements introduced in the (original) Tuscany expansion to form a more complex, robust base game.  Some of the elements introduced are the Mamas and Papas cards, four seasons worth of worker placement actions, the ability to sell fields, and the countryside board.  I don't think these additions make the game too much harder to learn even for a new player, and the added depth is appreciated.  However, my main complaint with the original game is that the cards are potentially too swingy, and that's certainly still in play here.  However, this is still a very good game.

Traded away at Alphaspel. Feels good! Bad, bland Euro. This highly regarded Stone Maier-game makes me for some reason hesitant of another highly regarded Stone Maier-game (Scythe)

***

Mediocre game in deluxe packaging. I love good worker placement games, this is not an exciting example of that genre.

***

Some more plays. 3-player was deacent. I think 2-player dosen't work as well when the bonus reward-spot is not available on the board. Was not bugged by the visitors cards that much now. But the early game is still slow and your Engine just starts working when the Game is about to end.

Lots of conversions, but just to produce points from ONE type of thing.. A long chain of coversions, but that is the thematic heart of the game of course. 

Solid game, but pherhaps a bit unpolished. Some buildings are not that interesting (windmill, tasting room, cottage) while the yoke, wineyard-improvements and winecellar upgrades are crucial. 7 still stand.


***

Ho-hum experience first game. Rating may go up or down with more plays

Hard work to get those pesky point by building structures and making wine, what really is the thematic heart of the game.. to get that engine working takets long time. But the summer and winter cards can give you a LOT of points, like.. for no real effort

You can get crippled with unlucky draws of ordercards in the beginning ( just fancy wine when you just need to send away some quick ).

My first game was really slow beginning, long middle part, and really accelerating endgame.

This is one of my all-time favorite games, this is neck and neck with Caverna as my top spot for worker placement. This game is simply fun, it can be played quickly, the unique thing to this worker placement game is the grande meeple and being able to get your extra workers quicker in the game. So many options, so much to do, but it also feels a bit more focused, you need to grow grapes to make wine! Love this game, it only gets better with the Tuscany expansion.

Decent wine-themed worker placement.  I found it more enjoyable than unnecessarily complicated Vinhos.  I liked the different options for buildings and abilities to get to different spots on the board without strong blocking.  I liked the rooster aspect for bidding for turn order.  Game was straight forward.

The game started off pretty slow for the first few rounds and didn't pick up until later rounds.  I can see where it felt slightly repetitive with the grapes-wines-orders.

Simple game, propper worker placement but nothing more. Your decisions and strategy are dictated by card draws in fact. Quite race game - who gets 20VP first wins. Some decisions to make, but in fact You're doing always the same things supported by cards You drawn.
Fast gameplay but dull.

If You know heavy economic games don't try this at home ;) there's nothing new, nothing hard in it, nothing what makes this game different from light-medium euro games. 
Too simple and obvious.

I could play it it as a a filler or with casual gamers.

------------------------------------------------------
It's so random game!! If You have luck in draws, You'll win. Plant red wines and one white wine on one(!) field. I sometimes plant on two fields but it's not necessary never on three. If You have luck in order cards you won the game. You could do everything but if You don't have luck in cards, You loose. 
Randomness and unbalanced cards make this game poor expierience, not fun at all. Your strategy and Your efforts during game are crushed by cards. Something here is wrong... For me it's undeveloped game.

RATING: 6
WP mechanism with bonuses for being first on a spot (in a 3+ game), a little too much luck in the vine/wine order card draws for me, but visitor cards are often powerful enough to mitigate at least some of that luck. I personally think the visitor cards are the best thing about this game, they give you interesting bonuses whereas the spots on the board are often a bit bland. Ends a bit abruptly if someone suddenly fills a few expensive wine orders, which can be a bit annoying. Unfortunately the game does not often induce that "accomplishment" feeling, like in Orléans for example. It just didn't click with me, but I don't feel it's a bad game, just not very interesting. 

Edit: Sold, never felt compelled to play it unfortunately.

Strong worker placement game with a very well integrated theme. Definitely a denser euro-style game, but the theme takes it well beyond a mind-numbing cube-pusher/resource-conversion exercise.

Rating without the Tuscany EE expansion - it raises to a 7 with it.

Good worker placement game, though nowhere near justifying the hype that surrounded it. The theme and the relative short times makes it hit the table frequently.

My main gripe with it is the cards. Cards are vital to every facet of the game yet they vary widely in their usefulness. The problem is that the way you get them is absolutely random. There's no drafting or deck trimming so the luck of the draw ends up playing an excessive role.

RATING: 8
Not terribly complicated for teaching new players (not super easy but good gateway game that most people could get down). It has a solid worker placement system for planting vines, harvesting the grapes, crushing to wine, and fulfilling orders. The two seasons make the worker placement very interesting. The theme is also pretty strong. Chance is pretty low, there is some, like with the card drawing, but it can mostly be mitigated by careful planning (drawing your order cards early will let you plan which wines to make early on).

It did take us quite a bit longer than the recommended playing time but mostly because of new players and generally slow players. I could see the play time being much quicker with the right group.

Das Spielprinzip von Viticulture ist ganz klassischer Worker Placement; die Abläufe sind nett, reißen mich aber absolut nicht vom Hocker. Allerdings sieht dieses Spiel phenomenal aus und das Material ist einzigartig (angefangen bei den tollen Holzfiguren bis hin zu den Glastokens). Die Mama und Papa Karten sind eine super Idee für die Startbedingungen und das gesamte Spiel verspritzt einfach Stimmung und tatsächlich Lust auf Wein und Urlaub- und gerade deshalb ist es für mich eines der besten Worker Placement Spiele, das trotz meiner Abneigung gerne auf den Tisch kommt.

RATING: 8
A solid worker-placement game with a lot of interesting choices. I like the turn order bidding each round, where you have to weigh the benefits of earlier turn order with the bonuses for later ones. I like the grande worker that can go onto a full space, so you never feel completely boxed in. I really like how the different actions have multiple spaces, but the first worker to go there gets a bonus, so you really want to get your desired space before anyone else. The visitor cards give some nice semi-random options too. Overall, there are lots of options, and it doesn’t just feel like trading in workers for generic resources, and then trading in resources for points (like, say, Lords of Waterdeep).
I didn’t like the pace of the scoring though, where everyone gets very few points (or even negative points) for several rounds, and then suddenly everyone’s engines are set up and people are scoring 5-10 points per round (the game ends when someone hits 20). I also find the theme unappealing.

[ESP] La diferencia con la segunda edición es muy sutil, agrega un inicio asimétrico y los campos tienen diferentes valores para agregar cartas al sembrar, también se pueden vender los mismos. Corrige unas pequeñas reglas y cartas también. Me sigue gustando y el hecho de cada quien comience de forma diferente le da un toque muy interesante para ir viendo el camino a tomar en el juego.

I'm really stunned by the love for this game now that I've got around to playing it. 

It's not a bad game. It has lots of cool pieces, and the theme works nicely to help with the mechanics. Although many of the pieces are shaped pretty similar to others and the cards use symbols to show what building you need....I personally find it a little hard at times to know what building it was meaning for sure, but alas that is a very minor complaint. Overall the game and components are nice and the theme is well done. It is relatively simple to understand what is going on, and the selecting turn order and bonuses is a rather clever mechanic. Regrettably it is about the only novel part of this game. 

The rest of the game is a fairly standard worker placement which is fine, but the problem is most of the others do it better in my opinion. Each player has a large worker which can go anywhere, including action spaces that are already filled up. This really reduces the tension of potentially being blocked out of actions you really want, lowering the overall interactivity of this game and removing a lot of the tension that makes some of the best worker placements so good in my opinion. (Agricola, Caylus, etc.)

Then again I'd still give this game a 7 or so, if it wasn't for the card draws. There seems to be little doubt to me that there are pretty wide effects on how well your cards synergisze with what you are doing when you're drawing them. If you get a bunch of wine orders for some sparkling wine but you don't have a large cellar, well that rather forces your hand. But then another player may have invested in a large cellar for one order, but now cannot find any other orders to take advantage of it. This isn't even taking into account how the blue and yellow cards can have effects that are either great for what you're doing or relatively useless. Finally the green cards which are your grapes also sometimes need certain buildings to plant, so one player can get luckier in getting a bunch of grapes that work for their buildings while another may be forced to build more buildings than they wanted to just to be able to plan the grape cards they got. 

All of which is to say that in a close game against somewhat similarly skilled players, the winner is likely whomever gets luckiest with their card draws. The loser likely is whomever drew cards that weren't synergizing well for them. Given that there are so many other worker placement games sitting on very similar ideas as Viticulture, I just fail to see the situation I'd ever rather be playing this. It's not a bad game, but it's very meh, hence my 5 rating.

Lovely little game that somehow marries the theme of winemaking almost seamlessly with a Euro. Fine on it's own, made impossibly better by Tuscany. Great art, good quality components, cards make it a little random (which is just the right amount of nice); all in all a non-cutthroat Euro. The game that convinced me Stonemaier can do no wrong.

Great solo variant too!

A beautiful, smooth, and light worker placement.   
However, progress is often a bit too dependent on drawing summer and winter visitor cards which often careen between overwhelmingly powerful or contextually worthless. 
Add to that the random draw of fulfillment orders (your main victory point goals) and you end up with a game where you can either luck out and and easily score fountains of points or get hosed and effectively loose a few turns.  

Fine in a children's game, not so in a what is otherwise a thoughtful euro.   I don't like it when a game asks for mental effort from its players, then disrespects them by making it irrelevant.

This game is excellent.

Now, I'm biased, I'm a huge fan of worker placements. But I can't think of many people that would dislike this game. It's simple enough to teach most people, as the actions you take are generally just "place a worker, do the actions it says to do". I think the hardest thing about this game is probably explaining what some of the symbols on the visitor cards mean, but it's really not hard to teach for an experienced player and even a first time player might figure out what the symbols mean with context clues.

I love making money and building buildings in games. I have no clue why but those two things just always make a game more enjoyable to me, and Viticulture delivers on this as well. I am a little disappointed that there are a small number of buildings to build (which is actually fixed in Tuscany) and that they usually all end up getting built anyway, but the buildings have good effects that can allow you to deviate from your normal play.

This game feels very thematic. I can only do certain actions on certain seasons, each year the wine grows better, I have to harvest grapes and then crush the grapes in order to finally make them wine. I love the grape components, they're small glass semispheres that magnify whatever is under them. So when you harvest a red grape and put it down on the crush pad over the red circle, it makes the entire semisphere look red, and for some reason that's just really fun to look at and have on your player board.

The visitor cards are fun. I think the biggest complaint most people have is that the original Viticulture had cards that were only good for certain points of the game. Viticulture: Essential Edition does away with most of those problems by giving multiple options on most visitor cards. Some visitor cards are still kinda meh either early or late game, and some are kinda meh depending on the amount of players, but I really don't think it effects gameplay THAT heavily.

Viticulture Essential edition also adds Mama and Papa cards that determine starting resources, which keeps the game from getting too formulaic for the first few turns.

Overall, I'd say that the Essential edition is worth getting over the base game. But before buying this, I would suggest looking up some of the things that the expansion, Tuscany, adds to the game. Viticulture: Essential Edition adds quite a bit from Tuscany, but some of the aspects are still left out. Even though they're coming out with Tuscany: Essential Edition soon, it still leaves out a few of the things from Tuscany, which is disappointing and kind of makes the idea of adding more "essential Tuscany" elements kinda redundant since that's exactly what Viticulture: Essential Edition was supposed to do.

Anyway, I kinda went on a tangent. Buy the game, you'll almost certainly enjoy it. And if you don't, it'll be easy to trade off since it's a pretty popular and respected game.

This is a great worker placement.  The pieces all fit together very well.  We always play with the Tuscany Essential expansion.

There are so many things I like about this game.  The way the visitors change the game.  The way the area control of the territories comes together.  The grande worker.  The engine you build to get grapes and make wine.  It's all so good.

My only reservation would probably be player count.  To be fair, this is always a concern for me.  I don't like dealing with players with AP.  I have little patience with games that promote AP.  I don't feel this game necessarily promotes AP, but the player uptime can run thin with too many players.  Just because the game [i]can[/i] play with 6 players, doesn't mean you [i]should[/i].

What can I say about that game? Its just perfect! I like the graphics, i like the plan which is not too big and not too small, i like the different wooden meeples and pawns. The game is so thematic and you have really the feeling being a vine producer. The rules are clear, the game is taff but not overheavy that you will get knots in your brain ... one of the best game flow i have ever felt. The game offers variety and you have always make other decisions if the bot player block your action fields. I like the campagne mode against the automa. The box looks not extremely big but that what you get is every cent worth! Its one of the best solo game in my collection. Great!

One of my first ever board games, and still to this day one of my favorites. There is just something so enticing to Viticulture, from the stand-out theme, to its surprisingly brisk pace, not to mention it's an incredibly balanced game. Without the Essential Edition features, it's a 9, and with them, it's a 10. To this day, I still don't think there is a "right" way to build your vineyard. I've seen so many different approaches work out marvelously in the end.

 Viticulture just keeps getting better, aging like fine wine! I truly treasure this game.

Enjoying this so far but need to get in more plays for a more accurate rating.  Played solo and 2-player so far.

Pros:
- Beautiful artwork
- Quality components
- Simple, easy to understand mechanics
- Many choices to make
- I like how the grande worker can help mitigate getting blocked from an action each round.  If you have something you really need to do, save your grande worker for it.
- Solo is pretty intense and is so far still a challenge.  Got a limited number of turns so play is a bit different from multi-player.  

Cons:
- Wine orders are the luck of the draw.  You could end up getting harder orders than your opponent and that could put you behind

This rock solid 10 is when combined with Tuscany EE, which is my preferred way of playing. The only reason I'll go back to the original board is if I'm playing with newbies.

More than any other, this is the game I initially didn't understand the appeal of. I'm not a huge fan of wine so it just looked like another worker placement to me. Other people had said they were in the same position and ended up loving it, so I gave it a shot and gosh were they right! It's really lovely, and captivating. I believe it's because of the "growing". The little thing of your grapes and wine developing each year gives the game a momentum that carries you along with it. The worker placement is also nice because you start out with a plan for the year. You can be blocked, but the grande worker makes it more forgiving and only the riskiest plans tend to be foiled.

Some take issue with the randomness of the visitor cards but they may be my favourite aspect of the game. The EE re-balanced the cards so that they're almost never useless. You have to mould your plans around them and doing so is rewarding. Basically, the game has a lot of little positive moments, and the developers have worked hard to weed out the negatives ones.

My favourite worker placement and in my opinion an essential part of any modern board game collection. And Tuscany EE only makes it better!

On the surface, from reading the rules, it seemed a bit dull. However the visitor cards added just enough unexpected to the expected to keep it entertaining. Sure, it's a "nice" worker placement game. There's not much in the way of conflict or tension. You plod along for about four years and your "opponents" just really get in the way occasionally. I could wear my "I'd rather be playing Carson City" t-shirt, but I have to admit that in certain social circles a game about running a small Italian vineyard is just going to be a better fit. Worker placement done gently with wine and cheese. Worker placement that plays up to six players makes it worth keeping in the collection.

I can see the value in the Tuscany expansion. A few more quirky ideas is going to give this game the legs to keep returning to the table. I'm not sure about being able to sell off the fields in the Essential edition to gain quick cash. Sure it takes a worker, but such a big cash boost being available from the beginning of the game makes some of the buildings an easy buy. I definitely feel you should have to have bought sold land back by the end of the game - at a loss. Anyway...

Featuring clean play and relatively simple rules for experienced gamers, this game just doesn't grab me. I like games I can play repeatedly night after night with my girlfriend, but nothing particularly excites me about the gameplay. Some of the visitors seem like they escalate in value insanely in multiplayer, so perhaps that's where the excitement lies. 

The theme is well executed and aesthetically pleasing. The grape tokens slip on the player boards too easily and cards tend to cover text there as well. Generally though, nice production value.

For 2-player at least, the game feels overrated. Tried to play multiplayer with more of a Catan audience and it seemed a bit overwhelming to them. 

I question whether it will widely appeal to more advanced gamer groups. The abilities granted by structures play like unlocks rather than unique play-altering engines, so each game feels pretty samey.

As far as worker placement goes, the competition for slots doesn't provide the consistent tension found in other games as the grande worker exists. That's not to say you aren't competing for slots, but more often than not the worker placement element either gravitates towards distant and nearly irrelevant while occasionally being crushingly annoying. In other words, the worker placement element is a swingy experience.

If you have a group of experienced gamers looking for a game to play occasionally, this may hit the vibe. For frequent 2 players runs though, this just doesn't hit the spot.

RATING: 7.5
Feels old-school Euro to me but gets away with it. Downside is the visitor cards varying wildly and the luck of the draw on Orders as well. But it's still fun, and to us, very replayable too.

RATING: 9
So first solo run through of Viticulture and as you can see I was a couple of points off a win. Even though I lost, the game is very cool and I can see where I went wrong, shouldn't have sold off the field. Also the automa is actually quite accurate in the sense that it takes that space/action you were banking on, the Grande Maple does mitigate that a bit but sometimes I found I could of done with two. Still a very chilled out game with loads of potential.

RATING: 9
[2 plays] A bit long with 5 players, but a very interesting game with mechanics wedded to theme. 

Worker placement but with a healthy dose of cards that introduce some unpredictability. Those who like perfect planning may dislike the game for that reason.

I enjoyed this and look forward to trying it again with 3 or 4 players.

Update after 2nd play with 3 players: Fast, and many paths to victory yet to explore I think. Rating going up to 9.

The theme really makes this game shine. Despite the somewhat complex system in place for scoring, it is really easy to explain how to get points because it all makes good, solid, thematic sense. The cards are sometimes a little too random (especially in a two player game where someone can kind of run away with it if they get better vines and visitors than their opponent). The grande worker really makes the game by making it impossible to be 100% blocked out from a spot you desperately need to take. I also love the idea that your workers are shared between seasons, so there are some really tough decisions in the early-mid game on how to use them and what type of visitor cards you should try to take. The artwork is also fantastic, this game just looks beautiful on the table.

Excellent light eurogame. It has simple mechanics but offers a lot of interesting decisions every round. The thematic really suits the game and every action feels logical.

Even though it's a competitive game there isn't a lot of interaction between other players besides blocking actions. I love that even when you lose looking at your own vineyard makes you feel you have accomplished something nice during the game.

With the Tuscany expansion the new board mitigates the luck involved in drawing cards. It gives you more options thanks to the trade action which makes the game even better. There are also new ways to obtain points which can help to have different strategies.

Rating bumped to 10 after adding the expansion, otherwise it would be a 9.

Munkáslehelyezős, borkészítős. A sima alapjátékhoz képest pár 1-es szintű kiegészítő került ebbe a kiadásba. Ezek bőven elférnek és színesítik a játékot. Egy tematikus euró a Viticulture, amiben átjön a szőlőtermesztés, borkészítés folyamata, világa. Érdekes, hogy pl. a Mamas & Papas kiegészítő eltérő kezdőkészlet ötlete teljesen logikus gondolat, mégis azt éreztem, hogy nagyon nem mindegy ki milyen épületet kap meg ezzel, úgy gondolom érdekes módon ebben a játékban talán jobb, ha mindenki ugyanazzal a kezdőkészlettel fut neki a játéknak. A kártyák esetében több lehetőséget adnak a fejlesztett kártyák, mégis úgy éreztem túl erősek. Megnyerhető a játék csak nyári és téli idénymunkás kártyák kijátszásával is. Jobb lenne, ha ezek gyengébbek lennének, mert így a szerencse a húzásuk miatt elég erős lehet. Egyes akciók is teljesen egyértelműen a játék elején vagy a végén népszerűek, emiatt sem éreztem teljesen jól teszteltnek a játékot. Ettől függetlenül egy komoly, játszható játék a Viticulture.

RATING: 10
Great game, really enjoyable with some unique mechanics and a really strong theme that matches the game perfectly. Very well designed.

This game hits that sweet spot where there is enough depth and complexity to keep you stimulated without burning your brain or causing analysis paralysis. Everything works nicely, the rules are easy to understand and intuitive. Turns are fairly fast as you can figure out what needs to be done between them.

Making wine is a lot of work so there is a lot of variety and decisions to be made. The visitor cards add a dash of randomness (if you choose to spend a precious worker obtaining them) and *usually* result in a benefit (though not always). There is a lot of competition for certain spots as you can see and predict what your opponents are up to - so do you spend a worker to further your own goals ? or do you thwart your opponent's ? 

End game triggers at 20 VP so there is a lot of tension and competition to get wine out the cellar door in the later part of the game.

Enjoyable worker placement game. It definitely feels like a race and requires a lot of improvisation depending on what cards you get. I like that you can pull off a victory at the end of the game, given the right conditions. The Tuscany expansion is essential (haha!) to really make this game shine. I still prefer other worker placement games for a more thematic or sandbox-y experience but this game is really well done.

Deceptively straightforward worker placement game about winemaking.  Although the path from vine to wine is lengthy, it's relatively intuitive and simple to explain.  I worry this game is perhaps a bit too reliant on drawing the right cards at the right time, but for now, it's a solid euro and a great next-step worker placement game.

The Tuscany Essential Edition adds a lot of interesting elements.  Wouldn't play without it.

Neat worker-placement game with a wine-making/-selling theme. Each year has 2 seasons. During each, you use workers (single pool for entire year) to collect vines, plant them, harvest fields, turn grapes into wine, obtain contracts for wines (specific types/quality), etc. You can also buy a variety of buildings which may improve your ability to do other things, give you bonus VP, etc. At the end of each year, the quality of grapes/wines in storage improves. The game ends at the end of the round when any player reaches at least 20 VP.

Cool game, but the cards seem pretty swingy. Worth playing, though I'm not sure it stands out especially much for me.

RATING: 7
This is probably one of the highest regarded games I had yet to play until recently.  At least out of ones that I am interested in playing.  It was fine.

I like worker placement games quite a bit, probably my favorite game mechanic.  This is a worker placement game about running a vineyard.  Each game round runs through all four seasons and each season players do different things.  During the spring you decide player order by which time you get up.  Earlier you get up earlier you go in future seasons, later you get up the better "happiness" benefits you get.  This has been done before, one of the most memorable is the  game Fresco.  During summer you play simple worker placement.  During fall each player draws either a summer or winter visitor card, these cards are very powerful and allow you to use their abilities using a specific action space during their designated season.  Finally winter is another basic worker placement but uses different spaces than the summer worker placement.

This is a game about efficiency.  The main way to gain points is to fulfill wine orders and that is a multi-step process that everyone has to follow.  You draw and plant vines, you harvest grapes from those vines, and you turn those grapes into wine.  There are different ways to go about this process.  You can build buildings that make this more efficient or use visitor cards to do these things more efficiently, etc.  But for the most part you're trying to do it better than everyone else and the game is a race to 20 points.

I found it fine, like I said.  I think the sweet spot for this game is 3 players.  With 3 players there are 2 action spots per action, so there is some competition for highly sought after spaces but not so much it can feel crowded and frustrating.  After 3 players it starts to feel very crowded.  With 4 there are still only 2 action spaces with another player and their pieces fighting for those spaces.  With 5 there are 3 action spaces and yet another player.  6 seems abysmal with 6 players fighting over 3 action spaces per action.  I also think any game that is essentially a race needs to have a balancing mechanism for starting player order.  Yes, you do choose your player order during during the spring but you choose that player order in a different player order so it's not quite as balanced as it should be.  I think that balance would get closer to disappearing in a 3 player game with less competition and crowding during the worker placement pieces.

It is also a very pretty and well built game.  Lots of different shaped wooden meeples for your workers and different buildings.  And soft pastel art for most of the cards and boards.  I even like how the field cards line up with the art on the vineyard board.  Simple thing but it looks and feels nice.

Great worker placement with a very unique theme of owning a vineyard! Since the board is split into different seasons, it provides interesting decisions whether you should save some workers for the later seasons or not. My two complaint about this game are 1. Sometimes the benefits on the visitors cards seem unbalanced and 2. there is a lot of luck involved when drawing green or purple cards.

I enjoy playing with the Mamas & Papas cards as it adds some variability to each game play as it changes one's starting conditions (number of workers, money, etc). The expansion (Tuscany Essential), adds even more variability.

Wow, this is a LOT better than Viticulture first edition.  The grande worker is a huge improvement, and the card balance, while nowhere near where I'd like it, is much, much better.  It still feels like a pretty vanilla worker placement to me, though, so combined with the swingyness of the power cards, it's not a game I'd often opt for.

Such a great solo game! I'm getting killed by Automa but I love the game anyway. Even as I am losing, I feel like my strategy is improving. Love the variable setup and variety of visitor cards. The Automa deck plays with very little fuss or overhead, and I swear sometimes it knows which actions to block to really get me. And now that I have the rules down, it plays in just over 30 minutes. So that's three things which I can tick off on my "what makes a great solo game" -- challenging, replayable, and pretty quick. The board is gorgeous, too. I can see my rating going up after more plays. And I haven't even started the Campaign!

Simplistic worker placement with a decent theme. The problem is that a lot of the game comes down to what cards you draw. Some cards are just flat out better than others and ultimately boils down to getting the right cards at the right time. Still it can be fun and there is room for optimization in the mix, but nothing really unique or innovative in my eyes.

This is an intricate and expansive worker placement game, especially with a bunch of the expansion material thrown in for good measure.  But it does all flow as you'd want it to and is surprisingly easy to learn.

The only thing I didn't care for in the game are the cards.  Using actions to draw random cards from a deck that may be of no help deflates the strategy of the game.  Most games like this would have exposed cards you can choose from (Trajan and Argent being two examples that spring to mind).  The cards also seem to be pretty imbalanced, so sometimes you'll waste your actions drawing total duds that are of no help.  It would take up a little more table space but I think would definitely improve the game.

I've only tried this elaborate version of the game.   The vanilla Viticulture looks like it would be relatively boring, at least based on a look at the original board.

I played the base game for the first time today with high hopes, since I was looking forward to play it for so long...
I must say I expected more (how? I don't know, I think this is just me idealizing the game because of its rating, opinions I have read, etc). I think I will rate it higher when I play it with the expansion, since it adds more mechanics. It is a simple gameplay yet quite difficult for planning (which is not a bad thing: it makes it deeper and complex). Worker placement needs some thought because the spaces are limited, and even more than that because of the bonuses (the space you can claim it anyway even if it's full with your special worker but the bonus is often lost).

One of my top favorite games. I am a huge worker placement fan, even though Im new to the hobby, this game simply does it all for me. I play it solo most of the time which is the only reason I gave it a 9.5 and not a 10, If the wife was as big of a fan of worker placement as I, this would hit the table all the time. Great mechanics, excellent components (purchased the metal coins addition) and just an overall great experience. Must have for any game collection!

Pretty good game, it's a little on the light side.  I wish it came with the Tuscany board.  I'd be interested to see what adding a few more modules does to the strategy level.

Playing with the Tuscany board, the structures and the special workers, definitely take this up to an 8.

Wow! Really enjoyed this one. Without the cards (hidden hands) which introduce some uncertainty, this game would have been very AP prone and probably pretty dull. Instead, it flows nicely while still being heavy enough to remain interesting. I love that it's a race to 20VP and not a fixed number of turns, because it add a lot of tension and interaction in terms of "when should I stop building my engine and reach for VPs".

I enjoy Viticulture a lot, but it has frustrated me that they've changed the rules and come out with several different versions over the years.

The essential edition feels like they finally have gotten the game to where it should have started from in the first place. I'd be happy if they just leave it as is and don't change anything else.

This was a must have after my incredible delight with other Stonemaier games, first Between 2 Cities, and more recently, Scythe. Both games have great, innovative multiplayer gameplay, but they also feature some of the best solo gaming rules around. Keep an eye on Automa Factory if you're a solo gamer!

RATING: 6.5
[thing=183394][/thing] is a nicely knitted and clever game: the duo phases of actions (summer and winter) allow for many possibilities and give a different color to what is being done: should I focused now on summer or winter? When to pass and save workers? These are very relevant decisions to be made.

The game is, mostly, strategic, but demands a lot of tatical swing in order to do well, since there are many blind draws of cards, and cards are the types of grapes one can plant, the winer orders and the visitors. Therefore is necessary to do the best possible with the cards you are given, as they are an essential part of the game.

The pacing is agile, with each person doing just one action on their turn. Still, in 6 players, the downtime can be bothersome. In three people, which is my most common number to play, the game advances pretty quickly, ending in around 60 to 75 minutes; and the options on the board are, usually, very open, with the biggest dispute being for the bonus the actions give, more than in getting the action itself. [thing=183394][/thing] isn't focused in blocking others, at least with smaller number of players.

The production value, as expected for an Stonemaier game, is great: different pieces for different types of buildings, neat tokens, nice art.

Overall, [thing=183394][/thing] is an euro that offers constant decisions, mostly indirect interaction (dispute for actions spots, and some cards that affect the others), with a good pacing and some complexity, but nothing major. There is the racing aspect of the mechanics, which bother certain players, however, in here it works as a trigger to give the final round, and not the goal on itself.

Although I wouldn't change my path to go and play it, I wouldn't reffuse it either. [thing=183394][/thing] is one more of those OK and harmless euros.

The rating is for Viticulture Essential Edition AND Tuscany Essential Edition together. Without Tuscany EE, the game is a nice 7.7. Tuscany really makes it stand up as a concurrent to the other euros on the market. The plus: the theme and the art is marvelously done and transmitted into every action in the game.

RATING: 9.5
Five games in, I'm already having a hard time being patient about acquiring Tuscany. Viticulture has the pastoral beauty Agricola, the weight of Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and, and the smoothness of Ticket to Ride. Like CoMKL there's quite a few sources of randomness to deal with, but are several ways for seasoned player can mitigate this randomness. The result is a game that is just tractable enough for relatively novice games to enjoy on their first play but complicated enough to engross heavier gamers as well. I'm going to try and hit a dime on the base game, but then I'm shooting straight for Tuscany, because we all wanted four seasons.

RATING: 9
Wow. Someone describes this game to you and you thing "that sounds like the most boring game imaginable". Well take that assumptions. This game is fantastic everywhere except card balance (which they have tried to address). One of the best, if not THE best worker placement game I've every seen. 

Different ways to play and win. Family accessible theme. Easy to teach with depth of gameplay. Games have come a long way. This is impressive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After a few plays, just a solid classic worker placement with some fairly strong luck factor in the draw of the visitor cards, but that turns into a fun aspect of it because the cards are so plentiful. Always something productive to do, a pleasant, swingy race to 20. Expansion arriving soon, and that should be good, but the base game (Essential Edition) is fun in itself. I like it more than I would expect for a game that I describe with phrases like "strong luck factor" and "swingy."

After adding the expansion and a few more plays, still feel the same way. I seem to usually win, so we'll see if I still like this very luck-driven game after I lose a few more.

Pros
- Thematic
- The rules permit loans, which I like - although the implementation makes these a no-brainer (no interest, you get a point for taking them out and for paying them back!) 

Cons
- Nothing new here mechanics wise
- Low interaction, difficult to affect other players in a meaningful way because the large worker can get into blocked spaces
- Perhaps there is more to this, but the engine building here seems a bit flat ie more grapes planted = more grapes = more wine. The mechanisms aren't designed to produce synergies, just economies of scale.

Card draw affects a lot of the game. Have seen the suggestion that this is in fact a card game in disguise, which in retrospect seems accurate. That's not really a con (I like card games) but it may impact on people's feelings about the game.

Overall I'm surprised this game has two mentions in the top 100. It's ok, but a lot of games deserve its place.

RATING: 6.5
A worker placement game about growing grapes, producing wine, and filling contracts.  Though I'm not a particularly big fan of wine, this game looked right up my alley.  I loved the "Wake-Up" turn order mechanic and the overall theme/idea. 

The board is divided into Spring and Fall action spaces, and therein lies part of my problem with the game.  I like the idea of the seasons and different times when certain spaces can be used, but one side of the board is overemphasized in the first part of the game while the second part of the board is overemphasized in the second part of the game.  I really wanted to feel that 'should I spend my workers in spring or fall' throughout the game, and while it happens, it's relatively rare. 

My next big issue with this game, in the Essential Edition, is the inclusion of fields that can be sold for money.  Perhaps I need to play this game more, but after several plays with my wife (could be groupthink) we both agree that it's never worth it to keep all 3 fields.  You can get much more out of selling the expensive field early in the game when you need money.  Whether or not this is true, it certainly feels to be the case, and I don't like when you 'have' to take a certain action in a Worker Placement game.  I don't feel that all actions are well balanced here and thus certain strategies are emphasized by the game itself.

My last issue with this game is the rather odd abrupt ending that comes, usually with everyone within a couple points of each other.  You spend so much of the game trying to set up your wine production, and then you or others rapidly complete contracts for a lot of points and the game ends.  There's nothing objectively wrong here; I just don't like how it feels.  Similarly, the value of money drops off greatly as the game goes on -- I wish money counted toward your points as you may just have a lot of money sitting around useless at the end of the game.  And if you fulfilled contracts that let you earn more money each turn, that often feels useless/wasteful once mid-game has passed. 

Is it still a good game? Sure.  But there's a lot of other worker placement games that I would consider much better.

Wife enjoys this one. I prefer this edition over the base game. The addition of the mamas and papas gives you more control over what you start with at the beginning of the game, and being able to sell the fields provides additional access to capital, which is often tough to come by.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is probably my favorite game. The theme perfectly fits with the components and the mechanisms in a way that makes this euro-game surprisingly easy for people to pick up and a wonderful experience every time. There are various different paths to winning, so if you aren't getting traction with making wine and filling orders, you can do so many other things and stomp the competition. In Viticulture, your destiny is very much in your own hands. 

Be aware that, as would be expected, it's an incredibly different game with 2-4 than it is with 6. I've played with all player counts (including the solitaire version which is breathtakingly done) and I like them all for different reasons. 2 and 3 player games are oddly relaxing. 4 players seems like a nice even ground where everyone is running their plans in a fair paced way. 5 and 6 players is quite the experience where so many people are playing different tactics that you have to make sure you're on course with a viable one.

This game is wonderfully done and I highly recommend it!

Currently our favorite game. From 9th play on the Moor Visitors are included, and our 10th play was with the Tuscany board, which is likely to stay. Viticulture flows quite naturally and even though you can be lucky or not with the cards, I like a bit of randomness. It's true that once you have your engine running, the game ends. That timing is perfect, otherwise there would be a serious runaway leader problem. 
For now VEE deserves its BGG rating of 10, and the same goes for TEE and MV.

A worker placement game with a few complications (different actions require workers be placed in two different seasons), very loyal to the wine-making world. A single "grande" worker per turn allows players to use an already filled position, which alleviates a lot of the frustration when a "must perform" action has already been claimed by another player.

Dammit if this isn't just a wonderful worker placement with a completely inane theme... though, to be fair, I guess building various things in France isn't much better of a theme, so...

You'll find the original Viticulture release way down on my ratings.  I thought it was pretty shallow and way too swingy with luck of the card draw.  The Essential Edition really overhauled everything.  Overpowered cards were changed, situational cards were given secondary options, the board was opened up, the wakeup chart tweaked, options fleshed out.  It's now a very solid worker placement game that's great to look at.

Mike D's copy.  Provisional rating after one play.  Initial impressions are positive.  It reminds me a little of Stone Age on steroids.  Worker placement game, with various avenues for VP generation.  Might be somewhat overwrought (four different types of cards to worry about, VP generation is often a multi-step process, etc), bordering on "point salad".  Pacing seems a little off, with a slow start ramping up to a quick, almost unexpected, ending.  Played this at the end of the evening, so I was rather tired and somewhat inebriated.  More plays needed, as I would like to try this again with a fresh brain.

I played this at least 30 times.  I really enjoyed this one but did not see myself playing anymore unless I purchased the expansion.  I received great value on a trade so decided to part with this one.  This was a medium weight game and I prefer heavier games.  I may revisit this as my girls are older but I am sure there will be other great games to play then.  No need to hold onto this if I am not going to play anymore.

Game is a cool worker placement. Not really innovative but so well made that its Always a pleasure to play. Should be a 7.8 without tuscany epansion btw due to some flaws: 1) too few choices opens up for too easy long strategies 2) a couple of buildings are hardly useful 3) some unbalanced cards 4) As an Italian i really dislike their interpretation of "making wine" (its the process to make the cheapest 1$ wine actually). Tuscany fixes 1-3 and partly 2 making the game totally awesome.

Most of it looks good but there are a couple of niggles - the writing on the cards is very small, the icons on vines don't exactly stand out, the rules summary does not quite fit into the box (I am going to trim it down) and while the pieces are interesting shapes they feel too small and not quite right. Cockerel is good though. And as for the insert, nice and firm but useless so that is going in the bin. There are other things too but I should not dwell on them. The attention to detail has been misplaced. All that said there are many great things about the game,  the board works well, everything you need to know is on it. Perhaps most importantly the game play is great, lots of choices for your workers and there is a solo mode.  It plays upto 6 but I do not know that I will ever try it out.

what I don't like is the design of the cards especially the back, e. g. I think for the visitor cards it would be better if there where something like a portrait just to see which type of cards they are. In my first game I had always problems to remember the colour of the different card types.

Agricola *was* my favorite game. The tension and depth were just right for me, and the cards added so much variety and deployability. But (and this is a BIG but)...it rarely made it to the family gaming table. Others didn't like the tension. 

Enter Viticulture! While the visitors cards aren't quite as in depth as the Minor Improvements/Occupation Cards for Agricola, they add tremendous replayability. Agricola is now gone from our shelves (*sniff*), but Viticulture is here, and is here to stay!

RATING: 8
Theme/Art:
This game is reaaally beautiful with amazing art. Each mama and papa card has a different portrait and the whole winegrowing theme fits very well and feels immersive (especially when you upgrade you wines each year).

Production quality/Design:
Each building has a different wooden token (even the wine cellars look a bit different, even though they are both cellars). The cards feel high quality, as does the rest of the game, like the glass pearls used to represent wine.
Once you know the rules, the board and the player boards are easy to read and understandable. Great rules too.

Replayability:
I only played it once so far, but I think the replay value is pretty high, although I think it may be that Viticulture has some kind of meta, you can figure out to increase your win chances (e.g. rushing the cottage for more visitor cards).

Depth/Difficulty:
It is heavy-ish, but not as heavy or hard to learn as other games. It takes an experienced player about 20 minutes to teach the game to others.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
Viticulture forces the player to plan ahead, since you have a limited number of workers which you need to use in both Summer and Winter. You should also have a strategy when to build which building and fulfill orders.

Luck:
Cards are the only luck factor in this game, but they can be pretty influental.


All in all Viticulture is a very beautiful game which takes about 45 to 150 minutes to play, depending on the number of players (up to 6) and their familiarity with the game.
The only negative aspect I recognised is, that the game is over as soon as you hit late game. You upgrade constantly and once you feel like you have all you need and you are finally able to fulfill all those wine orders, somebody reaches 20 victory points and it's over at the end of the year.

[microbadge=39352] Part of the epic PiFF I received from [username=burgsrus]

Tyler and I both found ourselves quite impressed with Viticulture: EE, despite our neutrality on the theme. The theme is incorporated surprisingly well into the mechanics (e.g. aging wine and grapes, requiring certain structures to grow certain vines), so it all makes sense, too. The Tuscany modules included with the Essential Edition all incorporate seamlessly and I’d never want to play without them. This is a really pleasant and slick Eurogame and I can see why it’s as popular as it is. If I had one miniscule complaint, it’s that the card draw can sometimes be frustrating, especially with 2P (some of the cards just aren’t as strong with only one other opponent); however, since the card draw ended up pretty equally swingy for both of us, it’s a fairly minor complaint.

I can't believe it.  I think this is replacing both Lords of Waterdeep and The Manhattan Project for me.  :-O  Gets better and better with every play!  Easily an all-time great.

Theme certainly is present.  The gameplay is pretty good, but it can accelerate very quickly the last couple of rounds.  The components are very high quality - the cards have a nice glossy finish, the meeples have many different custom shapes and feel different than meeples found in other games -- I'm not sure what it is, but I like it.  The rule book is well-written and explains everything clearly using images and example scenarios. It's one of the best rule books I've seen from any game in my collection.

Great game with tense decision making.  Scales well at all player count, which is uncommon.  Not necessarily overly complex, but not really for beginners either.  There need to be more games at this weight.

Update: the inevitable addition of Tuscany complicates my rating of the game.  It is a very good game, but I cannot fairly say that I would ever play it again without Tuscany added in.  Maybe to teach, but even then maybe not.

I like the concept of the grande worker. Some starting visitors and vineyards are stronger than others which makes it feel like more variance than I would like.

RATING: 7
A well-made game, but feels pretty limited in its worker placement mechanic: it feels like you have only one strategy more or less, and it doesn't feel so amazing since everybody else is completing it at the same rate...

A medium weight worker placement euro for 2-6 players. Everyone uses their workers to grow and harvest grapes and turn them into wine to fill various wine order cards.

a great worker placement game about wine making that is even better in this edition, with all the best features in one box... excellent!

How the hell is making wine this much fun? I don't drink wine and I don't usually like heavy strategy games, which this game can sometimes feel like, but the player interaction via the worker placement aspect of the game gives it a perfect balance, like a fine cabernet sauvignon... or something.

Beautiful game and components, thematic and strategic ... but I'm not sold on the swingy nature of the cards. As of yet this hasn't soured the experience but I am not sure how well it will hold up over time because of this. This may be balanced out by the fact it scales so well up to 6 and is a "proper" game.

Amazing worker placement game, one of the best. Multiple avenues to victory (you can win by not making any wine or not filling any orders at all). You can block players from actions but everyone has one grande worker that can't be blocked out. The turn order selection and bonuses are a really good mechanic. Outstanding game overall.

Quick set-up, satisfying game-play, a multitude of strategies that will shift with our visitor cards, and adjusts well from 2 to 6 players. Perfect!

Right up there with Concordia
Probably a great drinking game with a couple of bottles of wine, like the ap system, the theme, and the use of the cards
Agree completely.

Nagyon jó kis euró, mely nem mellesleg szép is. Borászkodás és építkezés a fő- és a saját táblánkon, sok odafigyeléssel. Ráadásul mindegy, hogy 2, 3, 4, 5 vagy 6 fő játszik vele, mindenhogy jól működik. Ez most az egyik kedvenc eurónk, még akkor is, ha a kártyák elég nagy szórást visznek a játékba, növelve ezzel a szerencse szerepét.

A worker placement style game with many similarities to Agricola. Players must build up a Tuscan vineyard from nothing by planting grapes, making wine and building new farm buildings. There is tough competition for the central action spaces and a wide variety of "Visitor" cards give useful one-time bonuses and abilities.

Theme: Wine-making and vineyard management
Mechanic: Worker placement / Hand management
Ideal players: 2-4
Length: Long

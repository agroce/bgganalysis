Very few similarities to [b]Bazaar[/b] but still a good game.  The arrows create paths that really create some interesting channels in the game play.  The trading is neat, and you have to really pay attention to make any money at all!

RATING: 8
A fun game for its short length and simplicity.  Don't trust the negative reviews: there is actually some amount of (non-obvious, /especially/ to those who think that the game is obvious) strategy in this one; there is a fair amount of luck, but how you play can often be important.  Scales well for 2 to 5 players.

This one is a classic. There is some challenge in it, and the rules are relatively easy to understand (although there were some ambiguities). It wasn't bad, but there are other games I'm much more willing to bring to the table.

I don't know if we missed a rule or something, but I just kept teleporting and buying up big sets of cards and then sold about 4 of those sets to win the game.  I hardly payed attention to the other players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Rules are pretty simple & kid-friendly.  It's a bit of a math-y game that can reward players that are observant and plan ahead, but there's a big luck factor in the cards and die rolls.  It's okay every now-and-again for being simple enough to pull off the shelf and play with little rules reading, but it doesn't feel very satisfying since I like more control in my games.

MORE RAMGLINGS... You really need to use the die roll as part of your strategy/tactics to jump ahead and get what you want... also, it certainly helps to constantly be on the lookout for times when any die result is good/okay for you (because jumping ahead and not paying the nomads can be very helpful).  I really just like more control over my destiny and prefer leaving less up to card luck and die luck. 

UPDATE 2014:  My opinion of this game continues to decline with each subsequent play.  There's just too much randomness and opportunism, which is especially frustrating when it drags/runs long as players get blocked, scooped, and hit by the hand limit or bad dice rolls.  I'd rather spend my time on another game.  Pro: it's easy to explain on the fly.  Con: it's not much fun.

The original 1980 version is different from the Rio Grande version.  I'd like to try the original some time.  Looks like you can buy 1,2,3 or 4 cards instead of 1 or 4 at the oasis spaces.

Others say: Must be played with the Isfahan expansion and the perpetual reshuffling rule.

Enough going on in the game to keep you playing and engaged, but not so much that you cannot table-talk and have fun with people you enjoy playing with. Set collection/pick up & deliver- I do not enjoy 'solitaire' games and this did not seem like solitaire to me. The interaction was subtle and if you are paying attention to your opponents, you can mess 'em up pretty good since (mostly) only one person can really 'deliver' thier goods in a given round. I don't understand how someone could rate it a '1.'

THIS should be the "gateway game" of choice for bringing people into the hobby.  Just the right mix of chaos and control, and it's very easy to teach to new players.  Fun, fun.  And I've never even played with the Isfahan expansion yet!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Something about the theme of this game appeals to me.  Perhaps it's those ever pervasive camels... or the lingering hope of selling 6 diamonds for a huge profit and laughing at the other players.  Who knows.  But what I do know is that this game is longer and more difficult than it appears when you first look at the board.  It's important to realize just how costly paying for dice rolls is in the long run (and how useless those rolls so often are).

Fun game of collecting/selling goods.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The old-fashioned roll & move dice mechanic appears to me as outdated and an unoriginal way to add a little 'chaos' to the game.

The game features rather little opportunities for player interaction. A pretty common feature in family-oriented boardgames (since that tends to help the younger and less game-savvy). Naturally, most 'gamers' are bound to wish for more player interaction opportunities. The Isfahan expansion offers here a little more, but not as much as I'd wish it to.

Gameplay's pleasant and brisk. Quite nice in a casual gaming environment.

RATING: 9
Have only played 2-player.  We always enjoy this one, and we both end the game in a good mood.  Not a heavy game, but not fluff either.  You have to balance your money with your cards, both of which are very valuable.  The choice of paying to roll the die is particularly interesting.  The money is quite thin, but usable, and the cards are fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An innocous hand-management/set collection game with a little more interest than most. There are three types of spaces on the board - oases where you can buy a card or four, deserts where you pay a card to the space and trade one-for-one with what is there (or just take all the cards if the space is full), and marketplaces where you can turn in sets for money/points. On your turn, you can either just move one space or roll the die and move -1 to 5 spaces. Arrows on the board direct the flow and limit options. The best move or some close approximation thereof always seemed pretty obvious. I suppose one could pay more attention to the cards their opponents are trading and picking up, but it likely a lot of tracking without a lot of payoff; one ususally doesn't have a lot of choice in what cards are available for trade since sets need to be pretty large. A narrow point-maximization focus seems to be prudent. Ultimately, winning or losing is going to be dependent on getting lucky with cards and rolls such that you collect and sell quickly. Since points come in big, uneven lumps, you want to be faster than others.

RATING: 3
Production: Attractive board and cards.  The money is too flimsy.  Play: This promised to be a game of tense board navigation in search of great sets of commodities, but in actuality the board circuitry was circumvented by the ability to begin a turn on any nomadic space, and there was never any real competition for any particular commodity.  My one playing resulted in a swift, dominating victory for one player.  (2+0+1) (1 play)

I have owned this for years and have played it many times.  I really love the game, but I have never won.  Ever.  Some times I end up with less money than I started with, but most of the time I'm only about 100 ahead.  My best finish was last night, when I had 485 and was one move away from selling enough wheat to give me over 600 and the win.  Instead my son sold grapes and won with 540.  My wife came in second, with 490.

This is a set collection game.  You visit various spaces on the board trying to build up a trade set of identical goods.  Then you visit the designated spot on the board where you sell that type of good for money. First one to $500 wins.  A lot of what happens is out of your control as you are at the whims of what happens between your turns.  Probably better w/fewer number of players.  I'd certainly be willing to play again, but the fun-factor is a little low for such a simple game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Procedural, plodding game where players wander around a gameboard and try and trade their hands with the spaces they land on to build up valuable sets of cards.  Tedious, with a distinct lack of fun.

[Sackson] Harmless little trading game. Minimal conflict and screwage factor makes it perfect for newbies and families. It has a good positive vibe too, because good play involves making the most out of your opponents' discarded cards. I find myself making comparisons to other games: card-trading and set collection is Civilization yet the movement is Chutes and Ladders! Never thought I'd say that.

* Played 15+ times. Middleweight strategy. My opinion on this game swings wildly. Sometimes I'm convinced it's a great little game, othertimes I think it's sytematic and dull. Most of my playing have been 2 player and the game seems designed for more (though it says 2-5 on the box.) Maybe best with 4-5? I owned this, then sold it.

As roll and move games go, this is superior to what is out there.  However, everyone are racing to 500$ but there isn't anything we can do to affect the other players.  So for seasonned gamers, there isn't enough to warrant replay.  For kids and family.

Interesting game and I like it, but it seems pretty one-dimensional. Roll a die (or not) move forward, pick up commodoties, race to a city to turn in the stash.
Points:
1) Try to degrade commodoties in cities everyone is approaching.
2) Try not to leave card-full nomad camps and try to grab the cards from card-full camps.
3) Turn in partially complete groups if the draw deck is getting close to empty.

Based on 1 play strategy seemed intuitive to me.  Plan your routes so you don't need to roll the dice very often.  Go for large sets.  Early on focus on size of hand - switch to selling your sets as quickly as possible when you have a significant number of cards.

Sid Sackson game from 1980. Like many of Sackson's middling designs, this is likable enough, but with a bit too much randomness to be truly memorable. Players move around the board spaces, buying, trading and selling goods. Those who can move most efficiently between these needs will do well.

I don't really need any more Arabian-themed games, but Samarkand is a fun exercise in efficiency.  I like the race element and the game is pretty fast-paced.

I was surprised to find that this had a 1998 publication date as it, in my opinion, has an older feel to it. Early 90's perhaps.  A fun game, easy to learn - a card collection game, cards are gained (and lost) by moving around the board, and sets are transferred into money.  However, progress around the board is not always straightforward.  A game often defined by how much frustration it causes you but ultimately a winning game in the end.

Very tough game to play, but very simple ruleset.  Fairly elegant in that regard.  Good production quality.  Absolutely no game play relationship between Samarkand, sometimes referred to as "Bazaar II" and Bazaar, also by Sid Sackson.  So far have only played it with four, and both sessions have been a tense race to the finish.

With 5 players the downtime in this game can get a bit too much.  The game overstays its welcome.  For 3 or 4 players the game is improved.  

The dice rolling mechanic slows the game down as players look at all their options before completing moves.

A game of ebb and flow - you make small gains and then small losses.  Some people invariably end up with less money than they started with.  There is also not much interaction for a "trading game".

Samarkand is at once a simple economic game and a somewhat punishing one. Given its almost transparent mechanisms, it's surprisingly easy to play poorly and barely make any money at all on your transactions. Luck can be a part of this (there's definitely a share of it here), but as with many Sackson games, I think there's more than meets the eye in this design.

First impression (3 players): Earn money by collecting big sets and selling them for profit. Game has some interesting twists, for example Travelling is either very slow (one square in determined directions or decided by a die which can be very good or total catastrophy depending on situation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Originally issued under the name 'Bazaar II', Samarkand does indeed keep the two basic elements in Bazaar (trading and scoring) but it evolves in a completely different way - as players move on the board, they aim to collect uniform sets of goods (or a mixed set of one of each of the goods) to sell (i.e. score) them. The board offers only restrained freedom to advance: there are two pairs of markets, each market selling different goods, and players have got to move from one pair to the other. Players have got to replenish their hands regularly, since as they progress they've got to drop cards on the board (which they can also trade for their own).

These features lead to a gameplay that involves a bit of resource/money/risk management and a certain amount of luck (some draws can be a real boost). There are no complex tactics - players need to follow and anticipate  what has been traded, sold and collected. There's no interaction more direct than that but some little features popping up every once in a while (goods losing value after just having been sold, players discarding all but twelve cards when the pile is used up) can affect other players' moves.

Samarkand is a pretty solid family game - quick and a bit on the light side for two players, a tad long but ultimately filling for five, and scaling well in between.

RATING: 7
A clever set collecting game. Turns usually cost money, and most money wins, so you're having to work backwards (lose money) to move forwards (make money). With the cards able to be picked up on show around the board, it means you need to plan a few turns ahead on what the most profitable "run" of turns will be, and the likelihood of your plans being dashed by opponents given what they've been doing. And if worst comes to worst, pay $5 and roll the die, hoping for a big number to move you to a more attractive part of the board for cheap. Which of course other players can do to upset your plans as well. So, lots of look ahead, a dash of luck, lots to like.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: This is a move and play game, in the sense that you have to use the board to your advantage and determine the best path to reach the goal of $500. As you move on board spaces, you must perform the actions, so you need to plan ahead or hope to get luck by paying to roll the dice and hopefully moving ahead faster or skipping costly squares. There is no interaction here between players, but still plays pretty well for what it is. Worth a try.
The expansion (Isfahan) just causes the possible sale locations for each item to move around, which changes little for most of the game, except if you are collecting the same thing as someone else and they trade first.

Reading through the rules I went "Bah! That's it?". Rolling dice, moving around the table and applying the effects on the square you end your turn on sound frighteningly like Monopoly, but this is far from it. Great game and loads of fun! There should be more of those "double price"-tokens.

I have seen this being played but I never got around to trying it. It is a set collection game to try and get a certain amount of money and win the game. You have to collect the goods and then sell them in sets. It is a fast fun set collection game. I very much enjoyed my play and will certainly play it again in the future if requested. Oh, this is the OLDER Samarkand. I have played the newer 2010 game and it is a very different game  Both good.

RATING: 6
Initially I was a little hard on this design, believing it was old fashioned but I guess playing with 4 just highlighted the slow movement of turns (the game is about camels anyway); this could be interesting, fun and tense with 2 or 3. I've come around now as I think it captures the theme very well.

My main concern is that it may be difficult to get excited about how you are faring compared to others as you need to follow the numerous payouts and income.

Decent trading game.  One friend really likes it, so it is played 3 or 4 times a year.  My son only wants to collect camels so that makes for an interesting randomizing aspect.

A lot of fun keeping an eye out for the sneaky players while not tripping over the arrow paths on your way to triumph. Random elements may be too much of a controlling factor.

A very basic ruleset. Players can buy, sell, or trade goods, trying to be first to turn their starting capital of 200 piasters + 7 goods into 500 piasters. Movement must respect directional arrows at each map location. The 2p game seemed a bit luck-heavy, based on what players found at the oases. With more players, perhaps trading with the nomads would take on more significance. The RGG edition leaves much to be desired, particularly the tiny, almost impossible to shuffle commodity cards. I found it hard to build a strategy or even find an approach to winning this one.

RGG English edition.

Sackson shows what he can do with very little. This is a clever little trading game. Players have a hand of goods cards and have to move around on the board buying and trading cards. First player to hit $500 wins!

The movement rules are tricky and players have to often lose a little to gain more. Each turn, you have to either move one space along the arrow, pay $5 for a die roll (1-5 or backwards) or jump to a trading post. Forward planning is important as is hand management. Lots of tension with choices and trying to trump other players with better, cost efficient trades at the Oasis'. Simple, elegant, fun.

Cool, light trading game where all the trading is done with the game.  Not a whole lot of player interaction, but if you pay attention to what other players are buying up you can really screw them over.  Neat mechanic where you clean up the mess that other players leave behind.  There is a fun push your luck element where you can vie for extra movement paying out against the die.  Once the game gets going it plays quite quickly.  I understand why this game is out of print, but I am quite glad that I own it.

As Samarkand.  I thought this was an interesting and quick trade game.  We put out the board and wrapped the game up in about 30 minutes, including rules explanation.  I like how one is given the option of moving freely each turn for no cost, or one can spend a little money to take a chance on the die, which could move a person closer to their indtended destination, or cause them to overshoot it.  We had quite a good time, and I definitely look forward to playing again.

When I play Samarkand now, it feels like a first-generation Euro that hasn't stood the test of time well. The biggest flaw is there are just not enough options or things happening to grab anyone's attention. This is probably still a good family game, but it's going on my trade pile.

Although described as a trading game, players interact solely with the board.  That makes Samarkand a classic efficiency game instead.  There's almost no conflict; just a race to get $500.  It's an intelligent excercise in multi-player solitaire, but it is also clinical and a little dry.

Played once (with 4 players). An interesting trading and set collection game with some clever ideas. It is rather light and enjoyable to play, but I wonder whether players really have enough control - the die roll can have really bad consequences at some times, both against the current player and hugely in favor of another player. Also, the fact it is a race (first player to reach the goal wins) means that there might be a slight first player advantage, but I don't know how significant it is.

I guess I'm the only one who finds it ironic that Samarkand is a trading game which features no player interaction.  Although most people usually wouldn't complain about the short playing time, I think it is ridiculous to be able to end the game in just a few turns with a couple of lucky draws and pick ups from the nomads.  The movement and the gift giving ideas are kind of neat, but not enough to entice me to try this again.

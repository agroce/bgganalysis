A fun and interesting game with lots of visual appeal to the cards! Map cards are an interesting way to represent timing of campaigns and how much infrastructure the South/North has in the area.

I must say the design is incredible.  I keep asking myself how a card game can capture so much depth and historical feel, yet here you go.  The game is not that difficult: the mechanics are really smooth.  The Union's forces are so much more powerful as is their ability to supply their troops, yet they have their work cut out for them: trying to meet their objectives in a fixed amount of time and having a large group of ineffective generals.  So in many aspects, it captures the feel of the Civil War, and it does it in a card game!  Too cool!!!

Very good game but can get very boring for the Confederate player. I'm not sure about the naval rules at all. They just don't feel right. It generally playes well though with both sides facing tough decisions at various stages. On a strategic level it just feels right and both players still have a chance of winning. Highly reccomended even though the author takes a cheap shot at a British WW2 general within the game.

Nice game, nice cards. The QED version is excellent value for money (I have several copies). 

The GMT version less so, but still worth getting if it's your only choice as it's basically the QED decks in their original packs plus a box, a map, and a rule book all of which you don't strictly need. I bought the GMT upgrade edition (as before but without the decks), and I felt it was pretty much a waste of money, certainly given the price.

The most novel, and ultimately the best game system yet developed on the strategic efforts needed to win the American Civil War. The "Enigma" system shows the devil inthe details. God help the Confederate player who thinks he can just dig in his heels and defend, defend, defend, because ol' Abe Lincoln'll have him dancing to a Union tune right quick! The combat resolution system has enough quirks and kinks in it that no battle result is EVER pre-ordained in this game. A keeper in any gamer's collection.

Anticipated buying this for years when I first read about it (original QED version). After many delays it was finally released, but I was highly disappointed to find an unplayable, overly complex game that seemed to be essentially all about arranging and rearranging your units. Worse, the rules were on cards and impossible to follow. Sold it immediately. 

Update July 2013: repurchased based on the strength of downloadable GMT rules and charts, which made it playable. While the game now really shines as a simulation, it fails as a game. One reason is that CSA has very little to do except defend against USA attacks and occasionally counter-attack or try to penetrate into the north. Another is the game's relatively benign combat results chart and use of step-losses; there's a constant and tedious back-and-forth of attacking, taking one step-loss per unit, restoring them to full health, attacking again, etc., etc. Also, a destroyed unit can return to play at the cost of a supply point. So both sides' armies get bigger and bigger, which may be historically accurate, but in the game, adding up the strength points and considering the permutations of each side's attack and defense strengths becomes a colossal pain in the butt. Clearly, changes are required to cut the game's playing time down from 3-4 hours to 90 minutes. One of these might be a replacement combat results chart along more traditional lines (which I've tried, but without success).

Love the cards. Love the concept. Pity it doesn't quite work.

Brilliant strategic-level ACW wargame with innovative mechanics. Game mechanics encourage generally historical strategy without making the player feel like he/she is being led by the nose. Playing as Lincoln one really "gets" his frustration at sorting out command of the Union armies. Playing as Davis you feel like you are in a struggle against time to avoid being ground down, with the opportunity of landing a quick counter-punch every now and again. Haphazard CRT captures the unpredictability of ACW battles and is not, in my view, a weakness. My only criticism lies in bookkeeping - counting up army strengths can be tedious. I use dice as counters, which helps.

As noted, rules are terrible. However, even once I had worked them out I didn't find much to get excited about here. There just didn't seem to be much in the way of tactics or strategy. Card effects were kind of boring, battles were just a matter of accumulating large stacks, "board" position was virtually irrelevant. There may be a game in there, but it certainly didn't grab me enough to convince me that it was worth the effort to find it.

Excellent game.  The repeated adding up of each armies combat factors gets old - it needs some way (twenty sided dice or numbered chits) to record each armies' strength so you can tell at a glance.

A very good game but the mechanic is so unfamiliar that it can prove quite overwhelming to play and also means rules must be relearned each time.

This is a fun card game version of the US North vs the South. The board is made of cards with only part of it in play at the start- then as the players get them, they can play the board to their favor. 
When you get into the game, it really feels like the war - never enough troops, south always fighting rock solid regulars from the north, the north always running into cavalry.. its a blast to play!

I very much like the focus on military structure and hierarchy of civil war armies and the representation of the different abilities and problems of civil war commanders.

Nevertheless I still don't know why to choose Bragg for a field command (assuming Jeff Davis had a reason) and in the few games I've played, the battles depended too much on luck.

Very innovative mechanics which create a surprisingly good simulation/feel. Having only played a few times, I'm uncertain of the replayability.

I really want to like this game.  I think I do.  The mindset it requires, however, is quite different from almost any other game I've played: you need to manoeuvre so that the "randomness" of the battle results is good for you regardless of the outcome.  You have to walk in, eyes open to the fact that in every battle you are risking the commander(s), and hence they need to be protected ("shielded").

RATING: 8
Ingenious strategic level game where players take on the role of Lincoln and Davis, trying to win the American Civil War. The game consists of two decks of cards, North and South, which consist of generals, units, events and maps. Yes, maps. The map grows as you expand it with cards from your hand. Units are deployed &quot;east&quot; or &quot;west&quot;, but aren&#039;t strapped to a geographic location. An eastern unit could attack Washington or Florida, for example. A very clever game that can be played to completion in 2 to 3 hours.

This is a game that I really wanted to love...it just didn't work out. After many problems with the rules and a sameness of play I finally gave up.

Very nice strategic game possibility, but the sameness wears off the shine.

It's better than the Lightning series. It doesn't suffer from overpowered cards like Lightning: Midway or weird start-game/end-game problems like Lightning: D-Day.

We did have to go back to the rules quite a few times.  Game play ranged from the blow out to a close finish down to the wire.  If suspension of disbelief can be held long enough and forget that this is not at all a simulation but a game with the Civil War tacked onto it, there is some fun to be had.  Both games we tried were nowhere near what happened and I doubt the system lends itself to replay history.  For one, there is absolutely no obligation to use the weaker Union leaders which historically proved to be a major advantage for the South.  Indeed, an early Grant or Sherman draw coupled with a late Lee draw creates quite the opposite as the Union's units are just so much better.  The combat system makes for bloody battles but we found that it works pretty well.

Will try again but not a classic at the moment.  After a 3rd and similar outcome rated this game further down...  Won't be touching it for a while.  A House Divided is a far more enjoyable and playable depiction of this conflict.

Although I'm not a big ACW fan, this is one of my all-time favorite games.  The innovative mechanisms simulate many historical aspects: strangling the Confederate economy; Lincoln's need to find reliable commanders and succeed in the field to survive the elections; the early-war Confederate window to break the Union before they have overwhelming manpower.  The initiative and combat ratings mean give each general personality and a niche to fill.  A completely strategic-level game with very little operational or tactical play.  I'm still amazed how much detail this game contains in its small, relatively quick (compared to, say, For The People) package.

Took several plays to break the back of the rules -- it's not a difficult game, but it takes some thinking to untangle how things work. Longer than it looks, and the last hour can be a slog, but the game generates a good narrative and where else are you going to get the whole Civil War in a long evening? (If it was an hour shorter it would get a lot more play, though). Improved by creating strength counters for the formations to reduce counting and help tell at a glance where you can best attack. Great flavor text on the cards. Brutal combat results table. Full impressions in our Operation Blackboat geeklist here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/listitem/919506?commentid=1068396#comment1068396

What a peculiar game. I don't think I entirely understand the supply rules. Found it incredibly hard to make any progress in the West after losing Cairo, and pushing past the pestholes in the West needed the prolonged attention of Grant. The smaller strength of CSA units means they tend towards taking much more step-losses or surrendering the soldiers battles, with the knock on effect that more of their supply goes to refitting units as the war drags on - this is excellent thematically without special rules to force it. The combat resolution is very pleasing, you can work out the odds without too much difficulty - just work out on what types of outcome you win. The ability to sometimes win even with a not so great force is fun and feels historical. I found it difficult to remember what the victory conditions were at times, and working out when the CSA railnet was severed or not was tough. A lot of very interesting concepts and definitely plays with a lot of character, but the constant addition and comparison of command strengths makes the game feel fatiguing, the value and position of units fluxes quite quickly. Game felt very tense and I feel a few different moves (maybe railing Grant out West to deal with Cairo and get moving down the Mississipi a bit earlier) would have changed my fortunes - as was I lost on +3 on the 1864 elections. The political elements and looming 1864 elections which can shift the victory conditions are excellently implemented, the political element of the war feels convincingly present. The down side is that the victory conditions are really tricky to remember and assess.

Certainly a lot of interesting things going on (especially given that it's just a card game), but I do wonder if too much comes down to single dice rolls. It's hard to get much in the way of modifiers without really overwhelming force (10 strength points), and without those it's very hard to get better than 50/50 odds either way. It's fine, and reflects the uncertainty of ACW battles, but if you get a bad run of luck (especially early on, as the Union) you can easily end up losing in very short order.
Still, great period flavour, cramming loads into such a small package.

PbeM suitability: medium. Logs can be quite short; a bit annoying when doing reserves. But not bad. You can do logs very quickly most of the time, which is good because a full game to the 1864 Election will run at least 200.

**The cards alone are worth having for the history and deserve an 8 on their own**

Got it on a whim...actually seems cool. Odd for a wargame in how it functions, but it seems like there's potential here. 

I got it for a very good deal on EBay (GMT version - new) and I'm very happy with it. A great civil war game for history's feel. It is not a simulation, but it's more a "if this is what you have available to you, how would you proceed?" Really, pretty cool and damn portable.

The cards could have used some better design work in game play terms, but I'm torn on how to do so...the truth is that the historical notes on the cards are fantastic for flavor, history, and education, but the cards are too cramped, the text too small, and sometimes important information for game play gets lost. 

As much as it would pain me, because I believe that one of the main goals of the game is education/history (as well as game play), I'd ditch the history text, but is a steak a steak without sizzle? No, it's just a meat shank; still, the game mechanics should not get lost in the history text.

The oddest part for me was the movement and how open it seemed in a theater based way. Your troops aren't really in any one spot, they're in a theater. It felt very strange to me, but in reading Shelby Foote's "The Civil War: A Narrative"...the troops really did cover huge tracts of land in movement via rail, cavalry, and Jackson's foot-cavalry's speed marches; so from that angle, the game's abstraction of movement works for me now.

This is an odd duck, but it may end up the swan. A clever swan at that.

A+ for the historical information and photos. Hands down a reason in itself.

UPDATE: You know what, it's getting an 8 now. A great Civil War feeling game in an evening. Wonderful history, free flowing, plays in 3 hours. It is a winner.

Blue vs. Gray is a fascinating and very unique design. It's amazing how the designer managed to capture the ACW by just using cards. In order to achieve that, the designer used some very original rules. These rules are both compelling and (since they are unique to this game) unfortunately easy to forget or get wrong. That makes the game a little tougher to play then you would assume after browsing through the rules. Kudos to Evan Jones for this achievement in wargame design!

Excellent light game with a terrific narrative and more strategy than one would expect, and a great aid in learning the history of the conflict.  Plays equally well using the ACTS website in conjunction with Dave Townsend's excellent map tracking program.  Be careful not to be tempted into lengthy factor-optimization; it might aid in victory but kills enjoyment.

This GMT version is an upgrade version to the original QED version, with the original rules on the cards as well as a new rulebook.  It includes some notes on clarifications on the use of some cards.  The game emphasize on the army organization and the use of optimal forces to strike, with supply determining the timing and replenshiment rate of both sides' armies. The cards are beautiful and they contain historical account of the armies, leaders or the historical events.  An easy subsitute to reading an history book.  The map cards divide the whole U.S. into eastern and western theatre of operations.  The game is dozed with a lot of strategy depth.  The Union is burdened with the need to push and continuous pressure on the south by taking city after city.  The Confederate has to conduct a war of attrition, capturing the cities in the north. A rather "philosophical" game by and in itself.  Deterministic conceptually, the game is wired to the ACW history with random development.  Sounds complicated but its execution is rather simple.  Seeing the movement in cards and tokens and thus rolling out the entire history of ACW, it is a tremendously satsifying experience.  The game cannot be played solitarire but finding an opponent for this shouldn't be that much difficult.

While admiring the innovative design, (expansion of the map by card play, a clever system for resolving battles, etc.) I have never enjoyed playing this.  For some reason, in the games I've played the good Union generals have always come out early leading to an early demise of the Confederacy.  Perhaps I should try the option in which the decks are pre-arranged in order of historical appearance?

The rules provided in the original edition were just about unplayable; those with the GMT reissue are much better.

8: A very good game. A bit unconventional in that units don't move on the map. The game is about command and management of forces. Strengths and weaknesses of each side are well represented and it's a challenging, different way to play the Civil War.

This is a platypus of a game. Plenty of stuff in it for both Grognads and Eurogamers to hate. It employs innovative mechanics that can be hard to understand. It can feel unhistorical with armies fighting in one moment, say in Petersburg, Va., and the next moment, launching attacks on Harrisburg, Pa. The USA war effort may stop because the USA player just can't draw the necessary map card. Much larger armies are often defeated by smaller armies, and the result largely dependent on the roll of single die. But it has a ton of US Civil War flavor, is fun to play, and balanced.

RATING: 9
One of the more clever wargames ever made.The really astonishing thing is how it plays out in such a true to life fashion with regard to the strategic possibilities/limitations of the combatants in the ACW.Really not hard to play,but some unusual mechanics along with the byzantine rules(in the original version,GMT&#039;s rules are supposed to be quite a bit clearer) make it a bit difficult to grasp unless someone with experience teaches the game.One of the best games on the ACW.

Rather abstract mechanics, so more of a thematic card game about the Civil War than a wargame.  Quite innovative, but I didn't get a sense of maneuver and campaigning from this game which is available in other wargames.

It's a clever game, with some neat concepts on how to create the map out of cards and how to create armies for each theatre of war.

One of the more unusual war games.

The cards are informative - a real history lesson. The play is good, it is a simple game, but enjoyable - not as convinced about the simulation. 
Army placement is very abstract you declare which leaders and armies you will commit at movement time. 
The battle outcomes are very random and can swing wildly.
I did enjoy the game regardless of some of these issues.

RATING: 7.5
Truly strategic wargame.  Victory is achieved and described in plausible terms - take the Mississipi, cut the rail network etc.  Two problems - the game can last 1 hour or else about 4 hours.  The other is that adding all the cards up gets a bit fiddly - having different values adds flavour but really slows the game down.  However the game makes up for this by being unique, fun, flavoursome (lots of historical anecdotes on the cards) and one of the few games that simulates strategy without dropping into operational detail but does not feel abstract.

Beautiful cards with loads of historical content.  Based on the cards the game is worth a 10 rating except the rules are so poor that the game is unplayable.  Very obscure wargame concept and bizarre Combat CRT.  GMT upgrade which includes a really nice play map does make tracking the war easier but the bizarre mechanism for attaching, detaching and moving units is not intuitive and very hard to comprehend.  (I must admit I do not have the rewritten rules from GMT or the Turn Sequence card so this rating might be a little harsh.)  Bottom line is the game needs a complete ruleset redo and a better combat table layout.

I've played once; won as Confederates, which is possibly the easier side to win with given the pesky election. Notable deaths: Sherman, Beauregard, Hooker, J. Johnston, Grant. 

The game is compelling, fascinating, and fun. I love focusing on leadership and organizing commands, so this game appealed to me right off the bat. Combat is quite a random affair; never expect victory, although you can place the odds in your favor. 

It seems difficult to accumulate supply points, hence making cavalry raids possibly irrelevant. Maybe upon further plays this will be cleared up, or some other thing to raid could be found.  

Special traits and abilities of leaders, political (dis)favor, etc. seem pretty right on chromewise, however much I sometimes wish there was even more. I could nitpick with some of the general ratings, Rosecrans too weak, Burnside too high a troop capacity.

An expansion with more leaders and Enigmas would not be unwelcome.

Could serve as a good model for some other conflicts.

What a nice unique game!  It took me forever to get around to playing this one.  I think you really need to the GMT rules to play the game.

I like the East vs. West strategic dynamic.  I wish that the game included more western locations.  It excludes General Curtis but brings in Stand Watie for a bit of flavor even though the Oklahoma Indian territory is excluded from the game.  I also wish that the game came with more event cards.

I think Hood should be ranked lower as an army leader.  Kirby Smith is excluded from leading an army -- even in the West.  Forrest is really powerful in this game.  Hooker and Bragg actually get a bit of respect in this game, although both automatically lose certain battles.  The Union has a real leadership squeeze as McClellan, Burnside, Pope, Rosecrans, and Banks all refuse to serve as subordinate commanders.  Halleck and Sherman are the two possible army-group commanders that can be used a substitution for Grant.  The mandatory Department of Washington card and the optional XXII Corps card really help save the Union.

This is quite emersed in theme, this does a great job with the history and the personalities.  The game is simple, with just a few tweaks to the main rules, yet still evoked assigning troops to generals and sending them to the front.  The battles are quite stripped down, and while I don't mind the luck of the dice, I don't like having to math out the optimal attack or defense to maximize my withdrawals and thus potential losses just to get to a simple die roll.  

As with any card game if you get the right cards early it is going to be in your benefit, but I sense it more so here.  Last game I got Lee off the bat with some good generals and calvary and just pounded on Washington, I had to roll and 6 to win, so I kept building up my force trying for the one in six chance.  It really just seemed like the best move, and it was.  I won. I'm sure that is a fluke, but I'm also sure that the game can be just as swingy depending on the cards you draw.

Still, a fun system.

Inspired design.  I love the political pressure Lincoln is under and organization and shuffling required to get a good commander in the action with good troops.  The card text is wonderful.

However, it gets black mark from me since I've played 4 times and each time the strategic maneuvering has been the same.  The actual combat decisions the players are presented with seem repetitive.

This game is brilliant.  It manages to have a great deal of weight using simple rules with a short total play time (except for those who play Euros).  The system is genius.  I have never had a problem with the rules; I think part of that is not being upset and biased because it is not a generic "hexes and chits" Avalon Hill game.  It is also not nearly as luck driven as people think - those who best use the multiple die rolls over the course of the game as a whole (which are influenced heavily by your card play) will win.

A lot of creative ideas went into this so it's worth checking out inspite of my rating. Use of map cards, generals with different abilities for different situations, innovative CRT. Problems arise in nearly all other aspects. The rules are so bad no one can learn this game by reading the rules. SOmeone has to teach it to you. Even some set ups are not explained, e.g. there's an eastern and western theatre but where does naval unit go? "in the east, dont you get it?" Supply rules are totally idiotic, with some 11 or 12 possible situations; none of this either; a) makes the game fun; b) makes more interesting choices c) make game more historical. All it does is add to play time and aggravation trying to decipher. Hate love relationship for me; love some mechanics, development sorely lacking.

Finally I have found the perfect wargame.  I have played dozens of Civil War games, but this one has engaged me like no other.  Here, there are no abstracted, anonymous "strength points"--you are fighting with A.P. Hill's Division, the XV Corps, etc.  The commander cards [Maury?  Wow, I never even knew this guy] become like members of the family.  Through the ingenious game mechanics, you WILL engage in a personal relationship with all of them.  The game works on Victory Points, but this is the most imaginative, organic use of VPs I've seen.  The VP mechanics flow with the game so superbly that it seems that it is no abstraction at all.  I can imagine complaints that the Union is pretty much stuck with the Anaconda Plan.  But that is not much of a complaint.  The fun is seeing the plan unfold, or fold up.

I've found a real gem in this game. The GMT version is VERY good. Much better rules. Wonderfully strategic, many tough decisions to make. Highly recommended

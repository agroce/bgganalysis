I bought this to play on the train to and from Disneyland and it was perfect for that purpose.  It is a great game in its own right, but I would play it over other games I have at home.  But, when out and about this game comes into its own as it is easy to slip into a back pack and is great fun!  Got some odd looks when playing the groan like a zombie rule on the train...

Yeah, just a smidgen better than the original, Fluxx still stinks as a game. Looney Labs makes *toys* that look like games. You literally *play* with Fluxx, you don't play to win or lose. It's a liar. Avoid it.

Did this game deserve to win card game of the year at Origins 2008?  -shrug-  I don't know and I really don't care.  All I care about is that it's a quick game that's fun to mix in between other games.  Plus, it seems to play well with non-gamers.

My personal favorite of the the Fluxx franchise. I love the ranked up number of Creepers, there have been times when I have drawn 5 creepers in a row. In any other Fluxx I'd find that annoying, but often it is actually a boon in this game (maybe).

RATING: 5
Each iteration of Fluxx seems to add just a bit more depth than the last.  This can certainly be seen in Zombie Fluxx which uses its theme to have players mind Creepers (Zombies) along with whatever else has to be fulfilled on the current Goal card.  While the game itself can be interesting at times, it's still a really random affair which takes anywhere from 1 to 45 minutes to play.  Not my favorite game, but not too terrible, and features a rule structure easy enough for anyone to pick up and understand (I was actually introduced to the gaming hobby through Fluxx, followed by the Settlers of Catan).

Similar games to look at besides this would be Innovation (More Strategy and Tactics), We Didn't Playtest This At All (More Random, but plays faster) or any other version of Fluxx (there's a lot of different ones out there with a theme that may be more appealing to you [Pirates?]).

There is a certain charm to the random Fluxx. I enjoy the original Fluxx pre creepers so whenever I play a newer variant it reminds me when I dislike their inclusion. It has the same random luck as Fluxx but with added annoyance.

Very Silly, but a lot more fun than fluxx as the overarching theme helps gel it together a bit more.

Love the way that the zombies can end up just killing everyone so no one wins. It means that the game does not overstay its welcome.

A fun twist on Fluxx! --and NO it is NOT Fluxx with different pictures (like the guy at the store told me).

This is Fluxx with different pictures AND a dozen or more Creeper cards that move around from player to player making win conditions impossible at times Plus Keepers classified as Weapons that allow you to kill or push zombies onto your neighbor.  And there's the "Zombies Win" goal.

Even my fiance (who's NOT into Zombies) requests another game of Zombie Fluxx. ;) Plus, I've already bought a copy for a friend.

Great for a quick game you don't have to worry about, winning/losing/paying much attention (after your first game anyway). First time players (of any of the fluxx games) need to do a lot of reading of cards, but should pick up the flow quickly.

RATING: 6
For those late nights in October when I'm watching zombie movies and drinking, we can carry on a game of this and enjoy the movie for several hours.  Not a game to play seriously, EVER.  Sometimes fun to randomly play with a non-shuffled deck if only 2 players, but that would ruin a 3+ player game.

My favorite of the Fluxx games, due entirely to the theme.  Fluxx games are highly chaotic, and often times when you win it's due to random luck more than skill, but the chaos of the game can be enjoyable when you're in the right mood.

A lot of fun, but obviously not a serious game for serious gamers, as long as you're laughing all the way through then you're probably playing in the right spirit. The game plays you nearly as much as the other way round, but it would be a good de-stress game after a long brain-burner.

In my first and only play of this game I was lucky enough to end the game in my second turn by letting the zombies win. I was however unlucky that the game already lasted more than an hour. Defies description. Stay away unless you already have or want brain damage.

It's Fluxx. It's not going to blow your mind (well, this version will EAT your mind), and how much it entertains is commensurate with how long the game takes. When the game starts dragging, it can be a real bore. When games end after 15 minutes, it's great fun.
The Zombie edition is recommended for people who like zombies.

Hi! I'm Doctor Steve Brule with another episode of [b]Brule's Rules[/b]

Do you have the "Zombies Eat Brains" promo card for the original Fluxx game, but you wish that you could use it in Zombie Fluxx? It's easy! Just treat the "Brains" card as if it were "the Brain" from the original, and "Larry the Zombie" as if he were "Death." Why didn't you think of that, ya dingus?

RATING: 5
Fluxx for me has become a 'take it or leave it game'. I'll play it if you really want to, but I'd certainly suggest another game instead! I certainly don't despise it, and it's got it's own merits- silly, with constantly changing rules, and goofy cards to boot. But it can also drag and become tedious, with games varying between a few short minutes to a very, very long time. Sometimes you'll hit a game where it just never feels like it hits a flow, and is a fiddly, frustrating mess instead. The humor in it doesn't strike the funny bone for me anymore, and I'd just rather spend  my time playing something else!

RATING: 5
   A curious game...

   Introduced to us as a 4 player game, we immediately thought Fluxx offered some quick, light fun.  Pulling the zombie cards out of the deck & played much like the base game, Zombie Fluxx works - but certainly not for 2 players.  - And when played with the zombie cards, I felt that the game becomes unnecessarily more complex for what it is (and long.  Potentially too long...).

This is like Fluxx, but better - the chaos feels more acceptable and less purely absurd.  With two, I'm actually not sure it works as good as it could, given that many times you wind up passing all your zombies back and forth rather than divvying them up amongst multiple opponents.  Still, the bare pittance of a theme elevates this for me, as I can feel more like the game is laughing with me, rather than at me, these days.

It's Fluxx. You have no idea what is happening, you have no control over anything around you, and you let the game play you for anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Too bad it's not always 20 minutes.

It's like any other Fluxx game, but with a ton of Creepers!  I'd played other versions before, and I bought Zombie Fluxx thinking that the game would override the theme.........I was mostly wrong.

I'm not a huge zombie theme fan, and should have thought about it better.  Fortunately, Fluxx is a very inexpensive game, and many people enjoy playing it.

If you like zombie themed games, then I recommend this.

If you've been thinking, "gee, Fluxx is a nifty idea, but I wish they'd apply the concept to a larger, more fleshed-out game", then this is what you've been waiting for.  More than just Fluxx with a pasted theme, and more than just the same old chaos.  Many more decisions to make, but most of them are small, and there are lots of cool things to do besides winning.  Lots of fun whacking zombies and groaning when they just keep coming.  Creepers make drawing cards is a risky proposition.  The goals take more effort to achieve, and there's a lot more player interaction than in classic Fluxx.  I'm not into zombies, but this game is still very nifty.

On our first 3 plays we each managed to win a game.  This made for some excited enthusiasm from the kids.  Trying to keep the flow going while attempting to remember all of the new rules can be a struggle - more plays will see us more familiar with all of the cards and perhaps a little quicker in playing.  Enjoyable.

Better than regular Fluxx IMO simply because it is slightly less abstract.  Still, it probably wont convert people who dont enjoy Fluxx in the first place.

Adequate filler. Fun if in the mood with the right crowd.  But then again, what isnt?

Nice artwork.

Initial rating a "6" after one play that went very quick. This was my first play of a fluxx game. Not quite sure what to make of it. The total rule-breaking nature of some cards makes me wonder how this all fits together. 

I'm intrigued enough to give this another shot, but I'm also aware that this is competing with a heavy population of other light card-based games, and there's plenty of those that I already enjoy.

One of my favorite Fluxx variants. Like all Fluxx games, the RNG factor is a little bit high for most situations. As a family game, however, it does fine. The addition of all the zombies is thematic and also adds a bit more interest to the game, since you can kill zombies while waiting for the right goal to show up.

This is, by far, my favorite version of Fluxx. It seems to have the best balance of the series. There are plenty of goals that allow you to win with creepers, there are several ways to get rid of your creepers, and they built in a way to just make everybody lose (giving another way to end the game in a timely manner).

I'll pull Zombie Fluxx out once a year. Overall I found that Zombie Fluxx was too slow because as a stand-alone it has too many rules cards and too few action cards to remove said rules with. There's no chance of a 5 minute filler game with this one and it gets boring after 10 minutes. I also don't think there were enough thematic goals and the food related goals were lacking in theme for me.

Zombie Fluxx is a fun, simple game that has a great sense of humor.  The potential turn by turn rule and goal changes provides for the always amusing "screw your neighbor" plays.  

Zombie Fluxx is a quality game for midsized to large groups (we played with 8 people and it seemed to work fine) and a very easy game to pick up in a party setting for veteran gamers or newbies alike.

Fluxx meets zombies and introduces Ungoals. Fun, but very dependant on how the cards interact with each other.

Played it twice with so-so results. REALLY need the right group for this one. I have Star Fluxx, so I thought this would be the same thing just re-skinned. It plays very differently though with the Zombie creepers. I get the mechanics, but it is definitely more of a brain burner than Star Fluxx. That might be what keeps this from the table...you have to pay very close attention to the creeper mechanics, but it is still Fluxx...so you can't really build a strategy.

I have enjoyed many games of Zombie Fluxx.  I like the pacing, and I really enjoy the chaos at times.  The mix of both luck and strategy is really nice.  Also, the game itself is really not terribly complex and is very easy to teach to others.

I will say that I've had games that have lasted 5 minutes and games that have gone on for hours, so consistency is not a strong point for Zombie Fluxx.  I would be very interested to try some of the other games in the Fluxx series.

Here's wishing them many fun and laughter-filled games.)

I know a lot of BGGers are really down on Fluxx and I can't comment on the base game, having never played it.  Still, I found this particular iteration of the game fun.  I think the addition of the Creepers to the Keepers probably changes it enough to make the game feel different to basic Fluxx.  True it still has the potential to go on for WAY too long given what it is but that doesn't seem to happen that much.

I am not huge fluxx fan, but it does have a place in my collection. When you are in a silly mood, are limited on time and have the right people around Fluxx will find itself pulled off the shelf.

I do believe Zombie Fluxx is better than it's predecessors. The creeper rules adds a bit more strategy to this overly chaotic game, the theme is fantastic, and the everyone loves to kill a zombie. Killing zombies is a very satisfying activity.

That being said, I was hoping for better artwork.
But that is just my preference.

Who would have thought Fluxx and it's various incarnations were cooperative games?  They're not you say?  The last time I played this game, everyone but one person were trying the end the game as quickly as possible by handing victory to the first person they could.  Sometimes this one player prevented that from happening and other times the game wouldn't let it happen.  This is the worst co-op game I've played.  As a competitive game, it equally fails.

All Fluxx games are a solid 4 for me, if the whole group is playing then sure I'll play but I'd really rather not.

If you are a FLUXX fan then this is definitely worth purchasing.  It's the BEST Fluxx game.  The Zombies as Creeper cards adds a new fun element to the game, and I like that the Zombies are optional (though I don't see why you wouldn't want to play with them) and I love that the Zombies can win!  and if Fluxx needs anything it's some more crazy rules.  

BTW - the best custom card for Fluxx that I've seen is: "The player of this rule card chooses one person to immediately leave the table and go buy drinks for the others."  good times.

Not the worst version of Fluxx that I've played, but (and I'm surprising myself by saying this) I think there are actually too many cards that interact with each other for a game as random as Fluxx. I've played Zombie Fluxx a few times now and after a few plays, some of the Goals kind of telegraph themselves - if you know someone is purposely gathering up Zombies, they're probably going to try and play one of the goals that require you to have a large number, etc... Could be worse, I suppose, but still not anything I ever want to play again of my own volition.

Fluxx-- with zombies.  More of the same I guess.  If you like one, you'll like the other.  They didn't seem to really do as much with the theme with this one as they could have though.  This game is really dependent on your group and setting.  Drinks help I would guess.

RATING: 5
Fluxx (as the name suggests) is random... very random... too random. This means it is impossible to plan any sort of strategy and end up being at the mercy of the cards all the time. Zombie Fluxx introduces a co-op element (the Zombies can win) which adds some interest.  If you're in the mood for Fluxx, rather play Monty Python Fluxx, which is all-out silliness.

Surprisingly, "more of the same" is far from a fitting expression for this version of Fluxx. It's an amazing upgrade from the original game with interesting tweaks to the gameplay that suit the theme perfectly (zombie hordes in card form actually work!).

It's the best Fluxx ever! To some people that may not be saying much, but to me this strikes a good balance between player control and silly, fun luck.

Color illustrations are also a nice touch.

RATING: 6
This has been a HUGE hit with my tween/teen sons & nephews.  They love the ease of play, the ebb and flow of chaos, and especially the zombies.

UPDATE:  I'm not going to rate this as it's more of a pastime, something "game-like" to do while waiting for those last couple of people to show up and form a quorum for anything else.  We're comfortable noodling around with it and then calling it done when it's time to ditch it.  It fills that niche nicely, and as such it pulls a 6 or 7.  As an actual game (i.e., played to completion of the win conditions) it rates far lower.

UP-UPDATE:  I lied.  I call it at a 6.  Painless but not necessary.

Of all the editions of Fluxx that I've played, Zombie Fluxx is the least enjoyable. The rule card selection has too many different requirements and errata, making the game somewhat tedious to keep up with. For a game that's supposed to be played quickly and from the hip, that's a detriment. Zombie Fluxx is not terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but there are much better editions to play. Try Monster Fluxx instead.

I don't really understand the appeal of this Game. Cards can be played to change the rules. To win, collect keepers, get rid of your zombies, and play the goal that you can fulfill.

Played 3 or 4 times now, it tends to be so random people end up exasperated with the game, and can't wait for it to be over. Game could take 5 minutes or in our case nearly 2 hours!

We pull this out when we are playing with someone who isn't interested in a big complex game.  It is a trick.  The rules are simply, but you constantly have to keep up with them.  Yes, it is 100% luck if you win, but most people we play with like it.  It is also great for a simple, quick 2-player game.

I can see why some would like this game, and especially how the zombie theme could be a draw for some.  If there was a guarantee that the game would finish in 10 - 15 minutes I could see being willing to play this, but there are others that I would prefer.  It just seems completely random, with too much to keep track of and no true interaction or tension.  If the game was going to take longer than 15 minutes I would just refuse to play altogether.

Yet another Fluxx!
It's not a bad system per se but it is... not well designed. Assets that only work for one win condition are clearly less valuable than those that work for three or so.
Oddly enough, despite the cards being crammed to the brim with text, people rarely seem intimidated by the system. Why can't this hold true for better games? :p

RATING: 6.8
Definitely a fun change from regular Fluxx.  The Zombies tend to stabilize the game somewhat; so far my Zombie Fluxx games have lasted longer on average than my Fluxx games.

My initial feeling is that the new rules could have been balanced a little more.  For instance, I think the different kinds of zombies are interesting, but my games haven't included a lot of zombie killing so far.

I also don't really get the tension of having or not having zombies; I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I have the keepers necessary to win, but can't because I have zombies.

Preliminary rating, played once. The game itself plays quite the same as plain old Fluxx, with the addition of "Creepers" -- Zombie Keeper cards that must be played, and make the game unwinable as long as you have any. The zombie theme may make or break this game, depending on your preferences. Myself, I'm holding out for the recently announced Monty Python Fluxx.

Just like Space Fluxx, but with a great zombie theme. Creepers are not such a bad thing in this game.

RATING: 6
This one surprised me quite a lot: the addition of zombies has balanced things out. Chaos is still there, standing above all else, but now not only it's harder for the game to drag forever, but also you seem to have a slightly higher degree of control over the outcome of the game.

The theme is also surprisingly well implemented, given the abstract nature of Fluxx itself. Almost all the clichés of zombie flicks are present in some card's flavour. The flow of play is mostly abstract, though.

Still, I prefer the original Fluxx over this one. Provided players agree upon a fifteen minute time limit. Without that, Zombies, all the way.

I gotta say, I really wanted to like this game. Zombies. Light. Gnomic rules. Fun!

Unfortunately, it's another example of virtually random win conditions and card interaction.

It suffers from kill-the-leader, the possibility of winning without anyone having the chance to affect your chance to win, complete reversal or destruction of strategies by single card plays, etc. etc.

I'm not averse to randomness, indeed, I find games without some random element to sometimes be quite dry. This game is just silly.

Playing Zombie Fluxx makes me feel as though there's the seed of an idea for a light, fun zombie game that didn't quite make it past the germination stage. Unfortunately, unlike some other light fillers, I don't see a possibility of Zombie Fluxx improving with additional plays.

Extremely luck based, prone to AP cause of the amount of text on the cards and the rules changing everywhere, very chaotic with no real structure (I guess that's kind of the point, but to me those are not signs of a good game, and it's not even at the level of Munchkin where you can at least expect to progress in levels once in a while; here the goals change so often that you can play for quite a while without any end in sight).

There is the added "Creepers" element in this game.  These are cards that (mostly) you don't want to be stuck with.  This adds a bit more time, and certainly more chrome to the game.

The first Fluxx game I've ever played. Played it several times (3-4 players). It's a party game and not a particularly interesting one at that. It's 95% luck based, especially when your 'play' gets higher than your 'draw' and you're forced to play all cards that you draw. I've heard Fluxx games praised (?) for the rule-changing mechanic but the luck factor negates its benefits.

I'm not sure whether or not I like this more than the original Fluxx, but it definitely feels like the same great game.  I particularly like the increased number of Creeper cards and the numerous methods that are available for removing them.  The Creepers don't feel nearly as devastating as they are in the original Fluxx game, which makes the whole game feel like there's more you can do to improve your position if you do happen to end up with a creeper in front of you.  After one play, I'm liking this game, and I'm intrigued to see how it holds up against the original after more plays.

Game in a Nutshell: Start the game drawing and playing a card. As the game moves along, the rules and victory conditions change.

Played as: 2,4,7 player

Pros: Everything's better when you throw some zombies in it!  Even though you're doing nothing more then dropping a card, it still feels good to smear some zombie brains. The game pretty much teaches itself, just draw a card and start playing. A good filler to give your brain a rest while still holding some excitement. If you can read, you can play this game.

Cons: Some games, at a certain point, pretty much play themselves and reminds me of a re-vamped improvement on the game of War. While it's the best, most thematic game of war I can imagine possible (in that you can occasionally make a decision that'll make a difference), it still reminds me of playing War. Trying to keep up with the constantly changing rules isn't my favorite thing.

Other: I much preferred the game with more then two people. It still feels 'war' like, but taking the back and forth play out of it actually brings some welcome variety as each player is trying to pull things in different directions.

Best Use: A quick mindless game when your brain could use a break.

Craziest card game ever!!! Players changing the goal repeatedly just to push Larry round the room for a bit, as if teasing Larry "no you have him!". Larry gets one last chance to dance ending a turn with the Pink Miss Tutu Zombie. Then that player (me) draws a huge horde of Zombies and decides to blow Larrys brains out with the shotgun! All simply to achieve the highest ever 1 turn Zombie kill combo. Combos only possible due to other in play 'New Rule' bonuses, Sorry Larry. Crowning me the Zombie Slayer! All nothing to do with winning the game!!!

It's ridiculous, but if people have played Fluxx before, they're going to have fun with this. Just go with it. Possibly more strategic than vanilla Fluxx, and the rules give several ideas on combining the game with Fluxx (same card backs), so it's both a standalone and an expansion. I appreciate that effort, not that it is anything unexpected from the folks who produce the Icehouse pyramids.

RATING: N/A
Zombie Fluxx doesn’t disappoint. The basic Fluxx mechanics remain the same, a couple small new rules and card types are added, and all wrapped up in a great, fun, lighthearted Zombie theme, satisfying to you zombie nerds while not being offensive to everyone else. The basic premise of Zombie Fluxx starts with adding a new permanent card type, called Creepers, which generally prevent you from winning, (unlike their counterpart Keepers, which generally help you win.) Most Creepers are Zombies, (though there is a hilarious non-Zombie Creeper card, which I won’t give away here,) and must be played in front of you whenever they’re drawn. (This does not count towards the number of cards you must play on a turn.) Most Goals require you to have no Zombies in front of you to win. Many Action cards help you dispose of Zombies, but the most direct method is by killing them with the new, more weapon-like Keeper cards, like the Shovel, Chainsaw, and Shotgun. Overall, it’s a fantastic expansion. Yes, it can be added to base Fluxx, or played by itself. In fact, in a remarkably generous move by the game publishers, you may even remove the Zombie-themed cards in order to play a regular game of Fluxx without needing to buy the base set.

Zombie fluxx is a zombie-themed version of the card game with ever changing goals and rules. Don`t expect deep strategy or serious gaming experience. Zombie fluxx is ligt and chaotic fun  and a good filler after a heavy euro brain burner.

At first I didn't think very highly of this game, but the more I play it the more I enjoy it. It's a great little simple game that's fun, silly, can be played very quickly and most anywhere. It's a very neat game. Always a different game style. My girlfriend and I enjoy playing it quite a bit.

Light and random and raises a few chuckles but not something I'd plan to play. Good for burning up about 15 minutes and when you don't want to think too hard about a game. A positive in its favour is that it is easy to learn and quick.

So so.  After a single play, this version certainly has lots of zombie cards but seems short on zombie theme. Only one or two ways to affect your fellow players limits tactical options.

Not my favourite edition of Fluxx but I'd be willing to try it a few more times.

RATING: 5
I first played Fluxx just before 9/11/2001 at Gencon. This was a fantastic memory because it was all of the old Gaming Outpost crew and I think it was Mike Mearls' game. It was one of the first card games I can remember and the board game renaissance was just starting to settle in. Years later, I picked this up since Fluxx had expanded from everyting to Albacore Tuna to Zombies. The zombies add an interesting aspect to the game but I feel like there aren't enough in the deck to make this version interesting.

I played Star Fluxx and really enjoyed it, so I was happy to receive this as a gift. After playing a handful of times, it started feeling overly long and the zombies really don't add any interest--in fact, I'd rather play without them. It's fun for a while and the randomness can be zany, but it's not something I pull out very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Funny and mindless, but since the cards are easy to memorize, the game can be gamed (like all Fluxx) by holding on to an easy goal until you have met it. The Zombies add a descent counter balance in that they can win. Replayable only until you have it memorized.

If you like Fluxx I am sure its fun, but not my choice in game play style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Big disappointment. As soon as I opened the box and saw the cards I knew I would be disappointed. Way to much text on the cards. It felt like I was reading the whole game. And for more of a party atmosphere game, that is a huge drawback. And this game doesn't work in a more settled atmosphere either because the strategy is so unclear. Everything feels disconnected. The winning conditions change so frequently I have no idea what to do, just wait for my winning card? What's the point?

Fluxx, with zombies. How can you go wrong?

We played this at the end of a gaming night and it took a few reads to understand the zombie Creeper cards, when weapons work and how to "kill" zombies. But once we got going, as usual, we had a good time. The game ended when one player used the "Everyone loses" card and we all went home. 

I enjoy the Fluxx series of games a nice filler-type games. Not enough time to set up and play a full game but not quite ready to call it a night? Break out Fluxx and make with the fun.

I just hate the Fluxxes (Fluxxi?) overall.  I have to have even a tiny bit of meaningful decisionmaking in a game for me to enjoy it, and Fluxx just doesn't feel like it's any more than rolling a die to see who wins.  I rate this just slightly higher than normal Fluxx because it's got zombies.

I only played a few rounds of a scuttled game and already dislike immensely. The "random/raucous card game" is not my genre (see also Killer Bunnies, Cards Against Humanity). In fact, I had to up my rating of the latter in order to slide this one underneath it.

The addition of the Creeper cards also adds a little something to the chaos that is Fluxx.  The zombie theme makes this my Fluxx game of choice.  That probably won't change until they come out with Giant Robot Fluxx.  Hintety hint hint.

Warning: Do not play with 9 people if you want the game to end at some point. Six is the apparent maximum. Don't allow others to tempt you to think that more people playing means more people trying to bring about the end. It's really just more people trying to bring about the end on their terms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is highly dependent upon rapid play by all players. If it takes longer than about 15 minutes, it's running too long. Just due to randomness, this can happen with even the fastest players, but add in slower-paced and/or inattentive players and it can DRAG.

Still, it's easy to pick up and play, so I look forward to playing it again.

I'd played Fluxx before and was unimpressed because it seemed too random for me.  It's still a bit too random, I think, but the zombies seem to add a bit of balance.

This game seems to come out a lot in casual settings.

RATING: 8
I like silly games, and this is one heck of a silly game.  First you have the zombie theme, which was a big selling point for me.  Then you have the fact that the rules of the game, and even the objective, change constantly.  Then you have Larry, the zombie.  He makes the rounds, going from hand to hand, preventing you from winning, by his very presence, just when you had finally managed to meet all the current criteria for doing so.  This game is fun!  (4+4)

Same comment as for Fluxx: A game for timefilling only where it might be some fun to see the different combinations come out, just to see what happens. I'm not sure why gamers would want to waste gaming time on it though as the decisions are trivial and the fun marginal.

Like any variant of Fluxx, it's all about the luck, which I don't like.  However, my kids enjoy it, which means I get to spend time having fun with them.  Our other Fluxx variant is EcoFluxx; Zombie Fluxx is at least two rating points cooler because it has zombie baseball teams, weapons (including cars), and a rule that makes you say "Uhhhhn"  during your turn or suffer a penalty.

I played the original Fluxx sometime in 2007 and loved it. Fast, although quite random, fun game and easy to learn for beginners.
Bought this, it's awful. The Creepers system doesn't add anything fun to the game, it just makes it longer and boring. I don't care to win, I just want it to end.
I will, however, play it again with someone who really loves Fluxx. If they enjoy the game and have fun, I'll survive.

Yes, I know very little of the decisions you make will affect the outcome of the game. Yes, I know the game is pretty crappy. But, damn it, sometimes it's just fun. And sometimes it's nice to just allow yourself to go into "auto" mode playing cards and seeing what happens.

Just picked this up to try out after passing it many times in the store. Im not much for card games and only played this as a 2 player game,so take this rating as you will.

But we played the zombie fluxx as it recommends in the rules to start out without the zombie cards and I couldnt stand it! So finally watched a vid on how to play and had a better grasp on in,played again. Then we threw in the zombie cards and it was a bit more enjoyable. 

While the wife and I both said it was a ok game,we both agreed that it would be much better with at least 4 players. I also thought it was a bit pricey for what it is,we payed almost $20.00 for this,that also brought the rating down for me.

Like Fluxx but a little more of a 'story' to it. You've all seen zombie films, so you know it's all about surviving against the zombies. Introduces 'Creepers' and an 'Ungoal' to the usual cards, which help conjure up the impression of teeming undead trying to munch down on you.

Aug 2014: Everyone prefers this version. I find it fading but still keep it ready.

We received this as a gift. The general Fluxx game seems ok if you're in the mood for the wackiness, but the zombie theme doesn't really work with us. We'd probably like another version a little better, but doesn't seem worth the effort to actually go get another version.  Looking over the other Looney Labs stuff, I think I'd probably prefer Chrononauts.

Sort of like getting your brains scooped out of your skull - it's not exactly fun, but it's quick.

I like the sudden changing rules and both my games have been mercifully short, so I can cope with the complete lack of skill required to win the game.

My problem is it isn't quite fun enough to warrant the brainless mechanics. But the theme is cool, so I'd give it a go when the night is dark and there's scrapings on the back door and you don't want to go to bed.

I got this game because I though zombies would be cool and fun to play.  But I'm really not all that interested in this version because the massive volume of zombies gets so boring.  I realize that it's well designed.  If there are going to be zombies, there will probably be swarms of zombies that are all pretty much the same.  Even though it's well designed with a theme that matches the game play, I am still not that interested in it.  I'd rather play Monty Python Fluxx or even the normal version of Fluxx that I broke by adding Blanxx that are too powerful.

After playing original Fluxx this game adds a new level of complexity by adding "Creeper" Keepers that typically prevent players from winning, which makes the game a bit more strategic than the original flavor.  I think that there are too many Creeper cards in a deck and that they should be reduced to enhance playability.

better than regular Fluxx, and not just because it has zombies (but mostly for that reason...)

update: actually, the zombies (and, indeed, all creepers) make the game longer.  That's bad.  The game includes some counters to the problem, but mostly it just makes the game drag on.

Okay beer and pretzels game. Lots of chance involved, but the game and theme is goofy enough that it doesn't bother me. You _can_ play tactically, with some success, but I've found myself mostly playing this one when I'm too tired or tipsy to take on a real game, and then I'm usually less interested in pursuing strategy than relaxing. Easy to pick up with non-gamer friends, to pass half an hour or so.

A quick half hour time killer.  The rules can become quite confusing when too many are in play.  Still, a fun and fast pace zombie romp that I play once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The addition of the zombies makes this less luck driven than most other fluxx games.  On the other hand, the addition of the "you all lose" card added to the randomness.  Overall, I think the theme makes this better than the original.

RATING: 4.5
I suppose this game is OK for the end of the night, after 8 or 10 beers, and thinking is not really an option. For that kind of mindless silliness it works (and there is a time and place for that) but it is not something I would put on the list to play for any given game night. More like, I would pull it out after we've played everything we already wanted to and have some time to kill.

It's Fluxx with a little bit different flavor.  Nothing great, but nothing too bad either.  The change of flavor to zombie might be more interesting if I were more into zombie stuff in general.  As it is, that is not a plus for me.  I suppose I would rather just play regular old Fluxx. [06.25.2014]

Creepers (keepers that you don't want) are a great addition to Fluxx and have since become canon in the base set.  Here, the creepers work especially well for the zombie theme, with a variety of cards to disperse them to opponents or dispatch them.

Well, it is actually better than Fluxx.  Same game, but with more endgame conditions I can't see this game going on forever.

RATING: 7
I really fun light card game where crazy things happen. There's almost no strategy to this really you are often at the mercy of the cards that you have in your hand (and probably have to play) or the current rules (which change almost every turn. But the chaos is generally a lot of fun and you can watch someone plan something for several turns and end up with exactly the right card to see it all come crashing down. Then again you can actually accidentally win and no even realize sometimes because of the chaos. It's need deep but the theme and chaos are a lot of fun.

RATING: 3
I find myself playing this with just about anyone.  It's fast and it's entertaining (not a gamer's game for sure) however there is rarely any strategy or tactics one can implement to help win the game.  This game is VERY random and the goals change so often that it's nearly impossible to plan a victory.  So I can totally see why many people hate this card game.  On the other hand it is mindless and I find it enjoyable for what it's worth.

I am not sure I will ever be a big fan of the Fluxx family but this is fun, likely more so because it is Zombie themed.
The chaos and ever changing scenarios and goals do create some hilarious moments but the randomness (the random win) dim my enjoyment a bit. It works well as a filler or a light playing experience, no doubt about that.

Fluxx as a game is easily a rating of 5, however the addition of ZOMBIES accounts for the additional point in my rating.  It's too light a game to really be playable after a few attempts, but your more casual gamer will come back again and again for ZOMBIE FLUXX!!

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  This game just seemed completely random and pointless.  If there was any opportunity for strategy I missed it.  One turn I have to play all my cards, the next I can only play one.  The goal and rules change so often, that the players are really mostly spectators rather than feeling like active participants.  I didn't find the game particularly humorous either.  The only way I would consider this game again is if we needed a filler game and this was one of the only valid choices.

This gives some purpose to Fluxx which should cause you to give this game a try even if you didn't like the original, but there is still a lot randomness.  A nice touch is that many of the cards from the original game have been changed to fit the new theme.  Great artwork and the cardstock is high quality, too.  Be sure to add a bag of zombies!

Fluxx is a fine game and the Zombie version is exactly the same game, but with zombies.  It's fun and silly.

The downside to Fluxx is that it has a lot of downtime.  There's so many cards coming in at the start of every turn and it just bogs the game down as everyone reads what they've got.  From now on I'll play that cards are drawn at the end of the turn.  That should help quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Just kind of frustrating really, not having any idea where you are headed. I like the idea of a game where the rules change and the goal shifts, but perhaps it could be scaled back a notch so that for two consecutive turns you can have some sort of plan?

Well, I got sucked into playing a Fluxx game again.  It was new people to our game group, after playing a nice intro game of Ticket to Ride, I was looking for another 5 player game and they pulled this one out, to not be rude, I sat down and we all played.  

Yep, it's still fluxx.  And I think they saw it on my face.  Unfortunately because I couldn't find a different 5 player game fast enough, I don't think they are showing up again.

RATING: 6
It's Fluxx...with zombies!  Well, it actually plays a bit differently because of the massive amount of zombie cards and zombie killing cards.  There is a lot more context in this instead of the randomness of topics in the base game making this more of a zombie slaughtering chaotic rule changing game.

This one seemed to attract almost universal hate from our group. I didn't think it was that bad - the principle is quite interesting. Unfortunately, it's easily broken by inexperienced or malicious players, putting the game into a state where things quickly get either silly or boring. The chaotic nature of the game is what keeps it interesting, but it also seems to be its main flaw.

Much like the movie Friday The 13th,  Fluxx just keeps churning out these sequels without any regard in paying heed to that old adage of leaving well enough alone.  Along those same lines,  they are both technically bad but have somehow garnered a cult following.  Both also share a similar lack of imagination when it comes to choosing a title  -  the movie simply opting to add numerals as they slog along and Fluxx adding a theme, which they would simply prefix before said title.

In the interest of creativity,  I will offer an alternate title or two for this game and a brief synopsis.

The Definition Of Futility  or  How Not To Bring All Things To Fruition.

Idea 1.  Attempt to add some strategy to Fluxx in the hopes of converting hardcore gamers.

Idea 2.  Add that "Z" word to the game to arouse interest.

Result:  While the original Fluxx had an unexplainable charm on occasion, this removes that aura completely and what you are left with......... is this misguided mess actually trying to be a real game.

Conclusion:  Bad ideas.

I'm not much of a fan of Zombie Fluxx's theme, to begin with. The gameplay itself is very random and can vary wildly between a simple game of set collecting or a series of long, drawn-out turns involving players drawing, discarding, and playing multiple cards at a time. Having more rules cards in play makes for more interesting decisions, but it often means other players are waiting a long time between turns, and it can make it confusing to keep track of which actions a player has taken or has yet to take in a turn.

RATING: 4
A drastic improvement over Fluxx through its 'creeper' mechanic.  Clever tension of allowing a couple victory conditions that favor the presence of the usually undesirable zombies.

This too solves the 'hoarding' problem nicely, as many cards are played immediately (either by choice, like weapons, or by rules, like creepers).  

However, while this makes for an entertaining zombie card game, the sheer underlying cleverness and uniqueness of rules-in-flux got lost along the way.

Man, I am just Mr Opposite when it comes to Fluxx.  I like basic Fluxx.  It is a fun, silly game, and it shouldn't be taken too seriously.  Based on the ratings, this game is better liked than Fluxx, probably because it adds a little more game to Fluxx, but I don't like it as much.  The general concept is good, I just wish there the Zombies weren't so static.

The one good thing about getting to play all these Fluxx knockoffs is that I'm able to genuinely add ratings in the all-too-sparse bottom of my range.  

Good God, I'm not sure I've ever played a more pointless (and, depending on the cards, possibly interminable) game; the problem is that there are so few Keepers, so many generally-sucky Creepers, and so many kludgy New Rules, that it's well-nigh impossible to ever actually satisfy a victory condition.  (Well, those are the problems *assuming you think the base Fluxx game is any good*, which I really don't.)  After we went through the deck one and a half times, someone kindly played a Goal that handed the game to an opponent, and we were mercifully put out of our misery.

Never again.

An ok game, can get boring eventually. I do like the Zombie element of it over the other Fluxx games and different lose condition caused by them. It's fun as a starter game while waiting for other players to show up for the next big juicy game.

"I am not a fluxx fan after trying this game. The idea of the rules constantly shifting is cool, but it makes the game very luck-based."

OK, so after having this game for over 2 years, I decided to play it with the kids (they love zombies!) I will retract my previous statement. This game is awesome with the kids playing.

RATING: 7
Great zombie theme for a Fluxx game.  I avoided Fluxx until this release.  If played with large groups a game can last quite a while and some people can get bored really quickly with Fluxx in general...at least that has been my exeriences with Fluxx.  But I couldn't pass up a zombie version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Fluxx but with zombies, however it's more than just a zombie themed Fluxx.  They've added in new mechanics so it's at least a little different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The theme is the only real reason ZF got the extra .5 rating over the above Fluxx. Still very fun with inexperienced gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick and entertaining game. Nothing mind-blowing but good enough. 
I personally love that I can carry it with me when I go travelling or I have even played it during my work lunch hour. 
It is relatively easy to play once people get over the changing rules and goals (even my mom managed to get a grip with how to play it!)
However, I do sometimes find that people can get very frustrated with how quickly you can lose (or win for that matter) just as you are getting into the game. 
Even though it is a fun little game for what it is, it is not really good enough to engage you for long periods of time.
I recommend it as a travel game; if you have an hour or so in a train, ferry or even at an airport to kill, then this fills in the time perfectly.

RATING: 3
There's not much here that differentiates this game from standard Fluxx.  There are new CARDS, and the new cards do some different THINGS, but really, this is the same old game with the same old frustrations.  Don't get fooled by the theme, thinking it will somehow improve upon the Fluxx formula.

1 play: 3 players
2 plays: 4 players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It is allways intesting to play this against new people. On the other hand it's the best filler when waithing for person x since anyone can join the game mid playing and still have very good (sometimes even better than the rest) chance of winning!
But this is fun if game takes 10-20min totally painful if it takes more than 45min or if people think too much with 20 + cards in their hands. 

So depending on people it will be fun or really really dull and you never know before you play it. If you play let's say intrigue you know that some kind of people will like this and others will hate and you can sorta suspect before the game starts that does person y like tis kind of gameplay mechanics BUT never with this one!

Zombie Fluxx is the zombie uprising card game with ever-changing rules. Like Fluxx, players start off with the basic rules: draw 1, play 1. After that, everything changes! There are now six types of cards:\13\
  * Keeper cards (possessions)\13\
  * New Rule cards (changes gameplay rules)\13\
  * Action cards (one-time actions)\13\
  * Goal cards (victory conditions)\13\
  * Creeper cards (undesirable Keepers)\13\
  * Ungoal cards (conditions in which everybody loses!)\13\\13\

Meet the goal to win the game. A constantly-changing and challenging, but light and ultimately fun game.

I purchased this one before finding BGG, and it's pretty random and chaotic. I won by changing the rules and then just happening to have the right cards in my hand to meet the win condition.  It was a fairly unsatisfying victory.

RATING: 6
This was my first Fluxx experience, and while it was fun enough, this sort of thing isn't for me. It wasn't even particularly a tactical game, since even in a three player game the situation changed so dramatically between turns that it was almost always a no-brainer as to which card to play (whatever benefits the current situation the most), so it almost felt more like an activity. My game also took about 15 minutes; I think I would've walked away if it'd been an hour. If there was a hard time limit, this still wouldn't be my first choice of fillers, but I'd be a lot more compelled to try it again.

Bought this on an impulse in my early board gaming days.  I feel bad rating this as low as a four, as I had some fun with it and still occasionally do.  The fact of the matter is, this is a filler - a light time waster with practically non-existent strategy or depth.  I don't think it's trying to be much more than that, so I'm not sure how much it can be faulted.  Worth a few bucks to just mindlessly play at the end of your game night at 3 in the morning when your group is in the mood to just sit around and talk.

Let's see what did I rate [GameId=258]? A 4.  Well I like this about twice as much as that so an 8?  No that doesn't work...  How about a 6?  I enjoy the additional complexity and the rule that makes you draw cards to replaces creepers.  It's truly [-]scrumptious[/-] madness.

An OK filler.

A breath of freshness in comparison to Fluxx, although it doesn't feel as though the rule change is tremendously significant.

While I can't speak for the entirety of original Fluxx decks, there is a nice aspect to the three decks published in Poland: every one of them provides a slightly different gameplay. The thrill of fending off zombies is very real here, and the occasional targets requiring the possession of said undead are a brilliant twist.

A fun game, when not taken too seriously. The addition of Creepers adds a nice touch to the base game, but it can make the game drag on for too long for the filler game that Fluxx really is.

Fluxx is a very chaotic & random Card game.  The cards determine everything from how many cards you can have, to how to play them, to how to win.  In that it can be a fairly fun light game in most situations.  It doesn't work well with impatient people, or people who like to always have a firm grip on how to play.  It can run very long.  I do like the Zombie version better than the original version.  The addition of Creepers adds a little bit (a smidge really) of tactics to the game.  But they can lengthen the game, and end the game with an everybody loses scenario.

I don't really care for Zombies and their mechanic in this game is to drag out the otherwise quick game of Fluxx making it take too long to be fun.  This occurs as zombies pop up in your play area *a lot*, are fairly hard to get rid of, and most endgame conditions require that you not have any...

It is random, but you can increase your odds of winning by playing smart.  So there it isn't just purely luck like some might think.  I enjoy the light hearted nature of the game, some games are just meant to be enjoyed and not taken so seriously.

Often gets on the verge of being too chaotic, with the amount of cards in play constantly altering the Goals. So you need to be pretty alert.

The designer hit the nail on the head with the Goals, weapons and items (all what you'd expect to see in a zombie movie). As a filler it's a winner. The wife will even suggest it too, which makes a change for a Zombie game!

Perhaps the strangest trick-taking game I have ever played.  It takes quite a bit of planning since the cards you win, are the cards you play with in the next hand.  Very unique, but trying to figure out the strategy is not easy.  I'm always a sucker for trick-taking games with new twists and this is one that really appeals to me.

An excellent whist variant (might be playable with a normal pack of cards?) which forces you to plan ahead by the clever mechanism of only allowing you to take 3 tricks per round, which then not only score but become your hand for the next round. Do you go for the score or to create that killer hand for next round? Really enjoyed this one.

A distant cousin of German Whist, where you build your hand for the final push by taking tricks during the initial phases. Pretty clever, in that your goal cards are constantly changing, and low, middle and high cards are all balanced. TT

RATING: N/A
Art in the cards is so ugly and the theme is so umconfortable to me (I don't like to wound animals even more hunt them to death) that this game remains unplayed along two long years of thousands of plays.

Probably that's the reason why I want to dislodge this game from my collection even I have the feeling it's a good trick taking game. A redesing would be a good solution to purchase it again under other theme.

Interesting 52 card trick taking game. There is a wild life theme pasted in but this could be played with ordinary 52 card deck. Scores vary a lot during rounds which means that comebacks are possible anytime during the game.

EDIT: After three plays rating up to 7.

I'm pretty sure that this just the kind of card game I like. There's lots of open information and definitely multiple ways of playing the game and one bad round is not going to kill you if you manage your hand well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent trick-taking game.  Since the cards you win in tricks become your hand for the next round, it creates a nice quandary of wanting to take high cards so you have a strong playing hand next round but needing to take mid cards because they are the ones worth points.  Can be confusing at first, but after 1 or 2 games the strategy "clicks".  I like it.

Production: Attractive, simple artwork on good quality cards.  The hoof/paw iconography is perfect.  I wish the different suits had their end-game point values displayed on them.  Play: Very interesting.  The essential mechanics of a) being able to only win four tricks, b) wanting to win footprints from different suits, and c) wanting to build one's hand for the next round all work together nicely for an interesting trick-taking experience.  Very novel.  (2+2+3) (1 play)

Interesting spin on trick-taking games. Has Mu-like fleches which make the middle cards worth points, but since tricks you win are your cards for the next hand, you also want high cards. Except you can only win four tricks, so you also want low cards so you don't win worthless tricks. Deliciously devious decisions.

RATING: 7.5
I like trick-taking games, and this one certainly is one.

The only issue I have is the way the final scoring is calculated. Here is how it is done now: the final hand is score depending on what colors you end up in your hand - that is all well and good, but the colors are predetermined in the directions (red > yellow > green > blue).

Since at the beginning of the game you randomly determine which color will be which trump in which round, why not do the final scoring like this: 1st trump > 2nd trump > 3rd trump > 4th trump. That way there is not an arbitrary point system at the end.

Otherwise nice trick-taking games, I especially like the idea of the placement of the paws and how they determined which number got how many.

I am a little torn on this one. If I was a better card player, I think I'd get a lot more from this game. I think it's a very clever little game, and another nice German variant on trick taking, but by the 3rd and 4th rounds, I felt railroaded into the resulting tricks.

The random order of the trumps stuffed me in the final round, but even so, I did feel choice was lacking. The game suggests two extra rules, i think I would apply them, but I think the game itself may be unsaveable even with these.

Which is a shame, as the theme, the graphics, and the scoring mechanism of footprints x animals is very nice. I enjoyed the game, and would play again, but I did not feel in control as much as I'd have liked.

An interesting card game where you play the next round with cards won in the current round; where in the first 3 rounds scoring depends on the middle value cards; where in the final 4th round the scoring changes; where you know from the beginning what the trump will be for all 4 rounds, even though from game to game the order of trump changes.  This makes strategy different from other card games I have played.  A good game for a nice change.

RATING: 4
Interesting spin of a trick-taking game where your tricks not only score points but also form your hand for the next round (except for the last which is entirely different).

It doesn't quite seem to work, however. The first few tricks in a round are usually devoid of points, and whoever ends up being in the position of having to take them is getting screwed. Conversely, later tricks usually contain more points, but who wins them seems to be up to fate more often than not.

While it will take a few more plays to ferret out the strategies, I did see alot of the potentials that were inherent to the game. I do feel like this game could be rated higher, but in comparison to all the other great trick taking games that I have, this one still falls into the "neat" category. It'll see occasional plays, but not as often as others.

Update: Repeat plays downgrade this one to a "meh".

Very different twist on trick taking. In the first three rounds you may only take exactly three tricks, and these become your cards for the following round.  Scoring in the first three rounds is based on number of pawprints acquired and on the number of different types of cards showing those pawprints.  The final round scoring is based solely on the types of cards acquired.

RATING: 7
The advanced rules make this an above-average trick taking game, but I think there may be a slight problem that can occur with the trump cards. Since the bears are worth the most points in the final round, it seems like the game becomes heavily skewed if the bears wind up as trump in the final round. One suggestion we had was to strictly order the cards for each game from highest to lowest - Round 1 - Bears, Round 2 - Boars, Round 3 - Muflons, Round 4 - Wolves. I do want to play some more to explore the strategies, though, and see if my concerns are warranted or whether it was just a case of first time players not understanding how to avoid one player dominating the final round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): It's a very basic trick taking game with a couple twists. There are 4 suits with 1-12 cards where cards 5-9 have 1-3 trail symbols on them. You play 4 rounds and scoring for the first 3 rounds is number of trail symbols times number of different suits you have trail symbols in. I liked clever rule where in first 3 rounds everyone can only win 12 cards because they became your hand for the next round. Once you have won 12 cards then rest of your cards are "void" but you still play them to tricks and they are given to the winner of the trick. Last round goes differently as you can win as many tricks as you wish and scoring is simply 1,2,3 or 4 points per suit.

There really isn't anything special in the game but at least after the first game it felt like an ok, simple, trick taking game with some interesting multiround continuity.

RATING: 7
I like the novelty of how the tricks you're allowed to win this round become your hand for the next round. But it can be a cruel outcome if you're forced to win tricks (particularly early on when 1-2-3 get led) with cards that are likely to be useless next round. So I'm conflicted, enjoying the trick taking element and the novelty, unsure how much skill plays a part and how much you're taken along for the ride.

Solid trick-taking game! The rule that you play your hand with the cards you won last round works surprisingly well. Different, but not very difficult, and fun!

A possible houserule immediately springs to mind: in the last round, instead of a predetermined point value for each animal/color, make it depend on the trump order. Let the first trump animal be worth 4 points, the second 3, &c.

A possible criticism is that your score greatly depends on the cards you get, and you don't always have much choice which cards you win. This makes it a bit random. It's therefore probably better as a quick, light game than as a serious gamers' card game.

Trump, Tricks, Game! has been in my small group of owned-but-unplayed games since I picked it up for next to nothing in May. I finally got it to the table and enjoyed it, as I usually do enjoy tricktakers with a twist. Here, the cards you win in each round become your hand for the next. Since you know which suit will be trump in each round, you can plan out which cards you want to take when, but you have to balance that with immediate point-scoring.

A different trick taking game where there are four rounds of which the only real trick taking round is the last. In the first three you are collecting animal 'tracks' which are in some of the cards. Every player can only take a certain number of tricks on these rounds since the tricks they take are used as a hand on next round. Each round has a pre-determined trump so you can prepare for that but on the first three rounds you get more points depending on in how many different suits of cards you have collected with tracks on them. It might even be a good strategy to avoid tricks on the first three rounds since you will end up with the last cards of other players if they have already collected their full allotment of tricks. I will certainly try this again.

I like that in this trick taking game.. you are trying as hard not to win certain trick as winning.  Since you can only win 4 tricks in the first three round and you are stuck with playing only the card you won in the previous round.  Leading the trick in this game could be really damaging and having lots of trumps could be damaging.  This has nice twist in the trick taking card game where inventing the new twist is getting harder and harder..

I enjoyed it, but it's a trick taking game -- to me, that means playing it over drinks, maybe in a bar.

Still, cool idea and worth a look if you like this style of card game.

RATING: 4
Trick-taking game with an interesting twist: the cards in the trick you collect will be your cards for the next round. But for some reason, it doesn't quite work. Nobody wants to earn the early tricks, because players thend to keep the point-scoring cards in their hands. Also, the final round often determines the outcome, as only then you get to keep all tricks. So it's all about getting the trump cards in the penultimate round, and then scoring big. A pity, as I really wanted to like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another clever trick-taking game built. The game is played over four rounds; in the last three a player can only use cards from tricks they just won (a necessary corollary is that in the first three rounds players can only win a limited number of tricks).

The rest of the game seems to have been designed with twists necessary to support this idea. The trump suit changes in a known order, so players need to look beyond the current trick. Moreoever, tricks are scored each round: in the first three rounds, 6/12 cards per suit are worth points, with scoring cards from multiple suits working as a multiplier.

Decisions are tough, especially for players in the middle who often have no idea whether or not they event want to win. I haven't played this game nearly enough to really work out whether there is enough control for the scoring to matter, so this preliminary rating should be read as enjoyment with some doubts about longevity.

RATING: 7
[Phalanx 'Auf der Pirsch' 2005 edition] {Animal; trick-taking; optimal 4p} AdP is a nice trick-taking with a twist that the next hand is built from the tricks collected in previous hand.  Therefore, people have enough information to plan a hand.  The scoring mechanic is also tricky - the last round is different from the first 3 rounds, which makes it very aggressive in the 3rd and last round.  Other than the system, AdP is thematic compared to other trick-taking games.

The illustration of the game is attractive - I like the animals!

Light trick taking card game.  I liked very much how the trumps, tricks, etc. rotated but the rotation was known.  So you had to decide what you wanted to take, so you knew what cards you would need for the next round, also the fact that you only could claim a number of tricks equal to the cards you would need for the next round created an interesting dynamic.  It's different than other trick taking games.

If you enjoy the genre, it's worth a try. I enjoyed playing it.

TTG has players make the cards they win in one round into their hand for the next round, which works amazingly well. The limit on number of tricks you can win adds some agonizing decisions on when to try to win and when to try to lose, even though those might not always work out. Cool amount of look-ahead for a TT game. Still, the rules are a bit unintuitive compared to something slicker like Sticheln, so it comes out much less.

It's fairly open in its information, so it's possible to track everyone's hands and cards if you're good at that, but it's hard to judge what will be a good hand in the next round.

This is a sick and rather strategic trick-taking game.  Take your tricks in the first three rounds very carefully:  You want all four suits and as many footprints as possible for maximum points, but you want as many of the next hand's trump as you can get, but you want the usual setup for a trick-taking hand of a missing suit so you can trump early and surprisingly.  You also want to be careful which tricks you take, because you only take enough tricks to form your next hand with the taken cards.  The fourth round scoring is absolutely different, and the tricks you may take are unlimited.  Instead of footprints × animalTypes, every bear you take is 4 points; every boar, 3; ram, 2; wolf, 1.  Just brilliant.

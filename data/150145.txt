Very random in the spirit of Wizard (and more random than it I'd say) with some pirate themed twists. Nice illustrations but the quality of the cards could be better. A nice addition in my trick taking games collection.

RATING: 7
A worthy variant of two VERY good card games, Oh Hell and Spades.  This game, thus, builds upon a very good foundation, lightening up the game up it seems with greater unpredictability in the play (with pirates, mermaids, and the skull king cards) and a 1-2-3 reveal bidding mechanic which I personally would drop in favor of the more traditional around the table bidding of Oh Hell.  

True, the traditional "tell us your bid" (going in clockwise order) does disadvantage the first few bidders because they have little to no information about the other players hands, but this is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the deal passes each round.   On the other hand, the "1-2-3 reveal your bid"in Skull King, is that really an improvement?  Not as I experienced it.

Excellent trick taking card game.  Wizard with a few extra twists which will become more fun with familiarity.  Interesting scoring which can reward negative nil trick play (score for the number of cards in hand x 10 if achieved), but this seemingly high benefit requires forgoing possible bonuses collected for tricks with the mermaid, pirate and skull king. Scary Mary very useful in achieving this.  Different also in that special cards can be played even if you follow suit.  So more flexible in that respect than my favourite game Wizard.

Surprisingly good filler game that has pirates, one of my favorite themes, fighting for tricks. There are a few rules to remember but after the first 2 plays you normally get to see all different combos and everything is clear. It will stay in the collection, which honestly surprises even me that bought it just to try it.

One of the best light trick-taking games. Even though there are trumps upon trumps upon trumps, the rules are quite easy to learn and the amount of decisions ramps up nicely with the card count going up in each hand. Card counting is discouraged because a healthy chunk of cards is always left out of the deal.

Fun, light, trick taking game that is best suited for mixed company. There's plenty of chaos in the cards due the various special cards and the way they interact. It plays quickly and rewards players that can consistently predict the strength (or lack of strength) of their hand. There's plenty of ways to catch up later in the game, too. It's always a fun feeling when someone realizes they are about to take too many tricks and end up scoring less than the player that took none. It's even better when every one at the table is trying to lose the remaining tricks because everyone bid wrong or because the majority of the players bid zero in an attempt to score a bunch of points. The dynamic of the game changes quite a bit if multiple players are trying to work around a couple of special cards in an attempt to take zero tricks.

Pretty good, but the Schmidt Spiele version is far superior. The mermaid card adds a lot to the game, and its not present in the English version (among other small changes to the cards).

A great evolution of Wizard. Adds new cards, simultaneous bidding, and a much welcome "zero bid" scoring bonus that makes you want to bid zero every round. I'm not totally sold that the simultaneous bidding is better than sequential bidding as it essentially means everyone is bidding first every round. It does level the playing field but I do enjoy the emergent information that sequential bidding offers. The new cards (Skull King, mermaids, Scary Mary) makes for an excellent system that keeps the same basic structure of Wizard but adds some uncertainty.

A lackluster take on Wizard, Skull King pointlessly overcomplicates the streamlined and slightly more enjoyable rules of the original: the resulting game isn’t half as enjoyable as Wizard, which is already far from being memorable on its own.

AVOID, not good.  2014. Trick-taking game similar to Wizard and Oh Hell (you must bid the number of tricks you think you'll take and suffer penalties if you take more/less tricks than your bid), but this one has special cards that potentially allow you to dodge and not take a trick.  It lasts 10 rounds (yuck!), and your hand consists of a number of cards equal to the current round.  If you've read this much you can probably guess that I'm not a fan of the trick-taking genre, but I might play it on occasion with certain groups.

It's decent, and I like the theme, but it's really just Wizard with a couple of extra cards to try and make the Wizard-ing more interesting. What it actually does is add a small amount of complexity fairly needlessly, spoiling the simplicity of the former and meaning you're constantly having to remember which special card beats which in which circumstances, plus the bonuses. Hmm.

The other thing that's not so great is the bidding phase (apart from the yo-ho-hoing, which is fun for about 2 rounds), as the simultaneous bids takes away one of the best aspects of Wizard/Contract Whist - the uneven bids. I might house rule this back in and see if it makes it worth keeping.

Components: So-so cards that don't clearly convey their function.

Experience: Similar to Wizard in that a player tries to predict exactly how many tricks they will take; and similar to Where's Bob's Hat with respect to the reward for taking zero tricks. With so few cards in circulation each time, it's very difficult to know how good my hand is. As trick-taking games go, this one is chaotic, but still fun.

[thing=150145][/thing] is another incarnation of Oh Hell/Rage/Wizzard/Contract Whist. Do we need yet another version of this classic tricktaking game?  Prior to playing this I would have said a firm “no”.  But having played it I now say an unreserved “yes”.   This is by far the best version of the game to date.  The interesting extra cards add enormously to the game.

A trick-taking game in the tradition of Oh Hell and Wizard. In fact, after the initial rules explanation, the biggest change seemed to be the simultaneous trick prediction. While that is still one of the big differences there are a few more that make Skull King a little more dynamic (but also a little more luck-based) than Wizard: there are a couple more special cards (somewhat akin to what they did with the Wizard anniversary edition, actually) that twist the standard rules a bit, and tricks are now scored in a way that allows for pretty big swings at the drop of a card. Whether Skull King improves upon Wizard is a matter of preference, I suppose. That it's more lively is a fact, however.

For me the big improvement versus wizard stems from the possibility for scoring high for getting zero tricks really.

Not "Grandpa Becks" version.

Skull King is the wizard slayer.  Like Wizard, Skull King Is a trick-taking game in the lineage of "Oh Hell," but it supersedes Wizard in every aspect.

Skull King plays much faster.  Skull King can be played in 30-45 minutes. Regardless the player count, Skull King only lasts 10 rounds. To speed up play, Skull King uses simultaneous bidding.  Simultaneous bidding has the added benefit of creating fantastic game moments when the group tremendously underbids l or overbids a hand. Those are the hands that are talked about days later.

Skull King works at more player counts.  At 3 players, Wizard is an interminable slog.  Even at four players, you couldnt coax me to play.  Wizard only shines at 5 or 6 players.  Skull King plays equally well at 4-6 players.  I suspect it is at least serviceable at three.

Skull Kung improved upon Wizards scoring system.  Instead  of receiving 20 points for making your bid and 10 points for each trick taken, Skull King gives players 20 points for each trick taken of a successful bid.  By increasing the risk-reward ratio, Skull King Had incentive higher bids, and disincentives "sand bagging."  Skull King scoring also offers a solution for the run away leader problem. Instead of receiving a mere 20 points for a successful zero bid, you receive 10 times the round number for a successful zero bid and -10 times the round number for an unsuccessful zero bid.  So in round seven, you could earn seventy points.  Two or three successful zero bids could enable the last place player a chance to catch the leader.

The last significant innovation is a "Wizard" hierarchy.  In Wizard, the first Wizard played wins the trick - end of story.  In Skull King there is a Rock-Paper-Scissors hierarchy of "Wizards", but in this case, pirates.  Mermaids beat all trump, but lose to pirates.  The chief pirate, the Skull King, beats the pirates.  In an added twist, the mermaid beats the Skull King

But wait, there is more.  Not only does the Skull King beat a pirate, but he receives 30 points for each pirate captured.  So, if you decide to stuff off your pirate on a trick captured by another pirate, you may have just given the Skull King a 60 point booty.  Lead a trick with a pirate at your own peril.  The Skull King must be careful to not celebrate too early.  The Mermaid receives a 50 point bonus for capturing the Skull King.  The new wrinkles of having different levels of "Wizards" and the bonuses have added a whole new level of strategy to game play.

For me, Skull King has made Wizard obsolete.  It's faster, scales better, more competitive, more nuanced and strategic, and much more fun.

The blend of trick-taking and betting makes this one of my favorite card games.  Skull King has always been a big hit wherever I've introduced it.  Each round grows more intense as you wager safety against big points.  The only way to score points in this game is to correctly calculate how many tricks you'll take.  You'll lose 10 points for every trick you are off!  But get 20 points per trick if you correctly calculate how many you were going to get!  The pirates, mermaids, and the Skull King himself add another dimension to the game.

I do like the scoring system used here - it's way better than the original 'Lupaus' or Wizard has. But the special cards makes the game a bit too complex which why the original game is better.

Skull King, is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. Special cards can throw off your best efforts, however, so watch how others bid and play carefully.

Skull King is an excellent trick taking game, where you bet on how many tricks you will win and only win points if you are correct. The rounds escalate with only one card dealt to each player and increase by one all the way up to round 10. Throw in some interesting special cards and trump powers and you have a winner!

-Theme
-There are simpler games out there

Haven't played it in a while, so my memories might be a bit iffy. It is pretty good. Love how it has a push-your-luck element to it with deciding how many tricks you're gonna take. I just looooove it when everyone either goes for 0 or really high numbers.

I feel Sushi Go is the better card game though. Yes, except for being a card game and having a point scoring system they are nothing alike, but... Sushi Go has easier rules. I'll still remember how to play Sushi Go in years, Skull King though I'll vaguely remember. It's also got simultaneous gameplay.

And you don't lose any of the exciting moments I mentioned previously. Instead of wondering what number of tricks the others are gonna take, you wonder if others will go for the same sushi or not. This creates the similar funny moments when everyone takes the same sushi.  And did you know Sushi Go's gameplay actually fits the theme?

Solid variant on Wizard where you simultaneously announce your bid for tricks won. I don't see why you couldn't do it Wizard style though. The game itself is fine. Lots of little exceptions to what beats what, but I didn't find it to be that fiddly. Even a couple of the cards that grant you extra points if you win them and guess correctly on the number of tricks you take say on them how many points you're given. The only downside to this game is the presentation, which is campy as all get-out. Otherwise I thought this was fun. It works well as a cheap, reliable trick-taking game for when I'm in the mood for one.

PROs: If you love trick taking games, you have to play this! I love the various card mechanics. The simultaneous blind bidding with the yelling of "yo ho ho" is super fun!

CONs: If people are not familiar with trick taking games with trump, this is probably not a good choice for an introduction to such games. The hierarchy of cards is a little bit strange in this game. I recommend printing out the player aid for the card rank.

Good trick taking game, similar to hearts.

The ranking of the cards can take a little getting used to, and the scoring is confusing at first but does add a nice level of depth to the game.

A trick taking game where everybody bets on how many tricks they will win. This is done by holding the fist in the centre of the table and yelling Yo-Ho-Ho and showing the amount on the fingers. Great fun but also luck based game play.

RATING: 8.5
This is the absolute [thing=1465][/thing]-like game for me. Much more interesting, faster and fun to play, as there's a pirate theme here, and quite strong, too. It rewards more tactical play and less strong hands, as there's not a single absolutely strong trump card, but rather dependent trump cards; there's also the zero-bid that lets you get away with weak hands! Yo-ho-ho!

nearly identical to Wizard, but with simultaneous bids and a few minor variations on the special cards.  With even more 'beat everything except other specials' effects, most of the regular trick taking is irrelevant.  It's just about judging the specials.

This was one of the first non-traditional trick taking games I played, and the first to have players bet on the number of tricks they'll take. It punishes you for overshooting as well as for undershooting, so it's quite tense. 

The card types can be a bit unintuitive and need some rote memorisation - pirates beat everyone except mermaids, who beat everyone except...etc. Still, once you get over that small hurdle it's a fun game, the cries of "arrr!" and "yo ho!" and such tend to flow, and it gets a little boost from quality artwork. Worth checking out.

1 play, partial game

This is a trick-taking game very much like Wizard, but with even more special cards and chaos to go with them! It's basically the same game, actually, but with:
- only 10 hands
- a super-Wizard (the Skull King)
- more special cards
- more scoring opportunities (treasure chests on some cards)
- simultaneous bidding (say yo ho ho! Bid on the third "ho" by holding that many fingers out)

Certainly there's skill in the game, but it sure felt random! I like the idea of fewer rounds, but never liked the 1-card hand ... why not deal out x+4 instead of just x (on round x)? And why complicate the scoring so much? It's probably better after multiple plays, when you're familiar with all the cards and scoring, but most people weren't having much fun with it so we quit early.

Interesting twist on a trick taking game where you score points based on correctly predicting the number of tricks you will take in that round. I found having to write everything down between the scores and guesses of number of tricks to slow the game down too much.

Not a fan of trick taking game so would probably not play again.

Wizard is currently the game that my parents adore.
Replacing the previous well played games, Haggis and gang of four.


Skull King is also for 2 players, and there is no absolute top card. Which made me very interested in this game.

RATING: 9
My favorite trick-taking game. 
Slightly more random than 'Wizard', but much more pace and fun and two ways to score high.
There's definitly luck involved, but a significantly stronger player will still win most of the games.

[Schmidt Spiele 2014 Edition] {Pirates; Trick-taking, blind-bidding; optimal 6p} Skull King is a fun trick-taking, similar to German bridge, in which you have to predict how many tricks you can take in a round.  And the number tricks increases per round.  Unlike German bridge, players make the bid simultaneously!!

The difference here is the inclusion of Action Cards, and different ranking of suits.  The action cards increases player interaction and makes the game more dynamic.  Another major difference is the scoring in bidding “no tricks”.  It is much more risky to bid no trick now, yet the score of achieving no trick is also tempting.

The card illustration is attractive but they do not help to remember the ranking and bonus of cards easily.

Skull King is basically Wizard with a few twists. The biggest is that bidding is simultaneous. There's also a skull king that beats pirates (wizards) and gets points for taking them. But there's two mermaids who can beat the Skull King, but lose to pirates. And there's a pirate/escape card (wizard/jester). Bidding 0 is also odd in that you get points equal to ten times the round number (100 on the 10th round).

The blind bidding is painful and wonky. At least in Wizard players later in turn order have a feel for how to bid their hand. In SK it's much more of a guess.

I'm not sure that I prefer this to Wizard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Skull King is a very good trick taker. Along the lines of Whist you start a round (in round 1 you have one card, two in round 2 etc up to 10) by saying how many tricks you'll take. It's not a bidding war and you do not have a partner though so it's simplified. The points for not taking any tricks follow the round number/amount of cards so it's from 10 to 100 points. This means the people that are behind will take this risky route towards the end. Risky because minus points are also higher. Lots of laughter is certain.

With Liberty, Columbia makes a playable wargame but there's some fiddly rules to remember (and 1.01 rules help but more work is needed and use the FAQ). The fog-of-war using blocks is usually excellent but there's so few blocks (25 a side) that it's less important here. The refined battle system (seen in some other Columbia designs) is elegant and sometimes brutal to the attacker. The map has subtle terrain features not obvious at first and it requires study to effectively use it. The differentiation in units (militia, loyalists, foot, guards, dragoons, leaders, warships, indians) contributes to a fine feeling of this period's warfare albeit at a strategic level. [Addendum: my rating has gone down as the game incorporates so much randomness with battle die-rolls, card draws, French Entry by chance, and game turn weather conditions by chance that play balance (and game outcome) sometimes hinges on the randomness of chance as much as strategy. The game appears to be quite brittle in terms of play balance (especially concerning the French). If played as published, you'll need to play it 2 or 3 times in a session in order to be fair to both players.]

I like the assymetrical aspect of play.  It is especially fun to play the British.  The ability of the Redcoats to land essentially anywhere on the Atlantic coast opens up play which otherwise would be fairly static.  Probably too much hinges on the random French entry (some rule fixes address this).  The rules are for the most part clear, but terse, and they could use a series of examples to clarify play.  Still, I enjoy this game for its strategic possibilities, and look forward to many more outings.

Played twice and did not enjoy the experience.

Deja-Vu mechanics already seen in others CG titles.
Washington's War give a better feel of the campaign.

I don't like the hex-area system in this particular title.

Probably In the trading list.

RATING: 6
Not one of the stronger block games using the Hammer of the Scots system. The victory conditions do not coincide with those of the historical war.  The game becomes whac-a-mole for the British.
The rules also have problems (especially on invasions) that do not exist in other games and thematically, it's not very strong.
If you want a fun block game, it is that, but it's not much of an American Revolution game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Similar to Hammer of the Scots, with some minimal changes: naval operations, forced marchs.

There is no siege warfare. The force pool (only 50 blocks) looks limited by economic constraints: maybe some more blocks would be useful: British do not have enough units to conquest and garrison major cities.
I don't like the prisoner exchange mechanic.

Gah!

The same basics as [i]Hammer of the Scots,[/i] a game that was interesting but annoying to play. Then, thanks to lazy design, we get hexes instead of areas. And too much map! What could have been an easy to play game turned out to be a rather pedestrian project, thrown together rather than carefully crafted.

I don't know how the Charles S. Roberts awards are nominated, but I am very glad it was just a nominee.

This game has more to give than it might look when just skipping thru the contents. 8 pages of rules are easy to digest, fog-of-war system that always uses the same set-up (not like the East- / WestFront games) as a starting point. But because of (blind-)drawn reinforcements the game develops into a bluff / attack / counterattack game that needs time and experience to master it. The British seems to be overwhelming until the French enter the war on the side of the Americans. In the games we played the Americans seem to use a strike-and-run tactic while the British used their overwhelming power to "free" some cities on the map only to face the problem of leaving troops behind to "secure" these cities. Definitely a game that will see some play over the year in our monthly game-day.

It is easy to understand why Liberty was poorly received when it first appeared.  First impressions are of drab artwork (box, map and particularly the cards) and a lot of air in the box.  Typically of Columbia, the rules are all there but they're poorly organized.  The game itself suffers from the timing of the French entry being too critical and too random, and from the prisoner exchange system simply not working.

Print off the optional rules and use most of them (I found that the turn sequence and vp tracks downloadable from the Geek were helpful too).  These fixes applied, the end result is a much more fluid and strategically interesting game than its close cousin, Hammer of the Scots.  There's a nice contrast between the two sides; the Brits powerful along the coast, but stretched by the need to garrison everywhere and desperate to land a decisive blow before the French arrive; the Americans picking their fights and with replacements popping up anywhere.

Not a too bad Columbia Blockgame, but ...
* Too few blocks to occupy the towns you want.
* Not much happens on the Southern part of the map.
* You often find yourself in the position that you don't know what to do.
* The game feels like a table with a too small cloth. If you pull on one end, the other end ...

However the exchange of prisoners is nice though.

After one play. I'm not much of a fan of block games, but this one covering the American Revolution is on a par with the classic AH title, 1776--and a lot shorter. My only complaint is that if the French arrive early, the Brits have a definite climb on their hands. Same for the Revolutionaries of the French arrive late. Their entry is handled by a die-roll trigger, which is easy to implement and easily tweaked.

You play the system instead of the "setting," so I never was able to get a sense that this was the American Revolution.

Attrition vs. the American side is too easy, and it's a game winner for the British.  

Just not a simulation at all, more like Wizard Kings played on a map depicting the 13 Colonies.

Great game on an interesting conflict.  It's the map that makes this one - the long American coastline and narrow strip of VP towns along the coast make for a very fluid situation, where marine landings can and do occur anywhere along the coast.

The Brits have overwhelming firepower, but must garrison the cities they hold, making it really hard to get those last 1-2 VPs to get to 30.

The Americans have to avoid battle when possible, counterpunch when able, and hope for French arrival :)

Outstanding game.

Great game, FOG of war not needed though; still figuring out British strategy.
To keep track of things, check out the draft of a one-page “notepad” I’ve put together that can be downloaded from: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/6719 It is a graphic jpeg file and I appreciate comments.
Notepad includes the Liberty standard starting positions, unit strengths, turn track and a labeled victory track. It also proposes a hex numbering scheme and a table to convert die rolls from single to double dice (more rolls means luck evens out). The nearly historical French entry variant is also included. Graphics could be improved but this gets the ideas across.

Liberty may not be a perfect game of the American Revolution, but it is one of the best offerings available.  The American Revolution is a difficult event to simulate in a playable game, though many have tried, with the war stretching out over nine years, multiple theaters of action and long quiet periods intermingled with intense activity, as well as political variables and the combination of naval and land campaigning.  Liberty captures the overall feel of many of these elements surprisingly well though with some (necessary, I think) simplification.  Having played the game at the Prezcon tournament for three years now, with a tournament win and a second place finish, I've found that doing well at Liberty requires a good deal of patience, maneuver and long term strategy; simply charging ahead aggressively, even with the Brits whose units tend to be superior to the American militia, is likely to lead to setbacks or at best short term victories that can be negated over time. It is possible to win a game without ever fighting a major decisive battle, an optimal "Sun Tzu" result. As the Americans, I've seen Washington with his main army surrounded and destroyed by the Brits and still gone on to win with French aid; with the Brits, I've seen Washington repulse the Redcoats in the biggest battle of the game and still ended up conquering most of the colonies and putting down the rebellion. With a relatively small number of units and simple card-driven mechanics for actions, reinforcements and supply, the game plays quickly and it is easily possible to get through the nine years in a three-hour tournament time limit.  The usual Columbia block-based fog of war system works well with the widely varying quality of both American and British units. Quibbles?  French entry really shouldn't be just based on a standard random die roll, but should reflect to some extent political events and military successes as it did historically; in tournaments such as Prezcon, this is typically dealt with by having a die roll modified annually for entry (11 on 2d6 in 1776, 8 on 2d6 in 1777, the standard game roll, and 5 on 2d6 thereafter - if the French never came in the Americans would have weak chances against a competent British player).  And port garrisons don't seem to do well resisting sea attacks that are accompanied by land units aboard ship, unless the defender has his major army in a port, owing to the immense firepower of the ships - certainly there were some big successful invasions by sea in the Revolution, as at New York and Charleston, but also other situations where seaborne attackers were repulsed by relatively small fortified garrisons, as at Savannah and again at Charleston earlier in the war.  But these issues do not detract much from the play of a very enjoyable and interesting game that never seems to repeat itself, with lots of strategic choices for both sides.

I am VERY disappointed in this game. I was looking for a game on this topic and read the reviews here at BGG and thought this looked like a good idea, plus I have never tried Columbia Games or a block game before.  I do not think I'll be trying a block game again anytime soon.  The system is WAY too simplistic for my taste.  If your top concern in playing time then this might be a good bet, but if you are looking for detail and insight to this epic event, then I do not recommend this game.  If this is what other block games are like, then I am at loss in trying to comprehend all the interest surrounding them.

RATING: 7
Strategy level wargame covering the entire American Revolution.  On this subjct I'd rather be playing Washington's War, but Liberty has its block game charms.

Unlike Washington's War, Liberty focuses solely on the military campaigns.  The blocks give the game a thick fog of war.  With the requirement to capture 30 VPs (minimum of 7 cities) with only 25 units minus captures, the game feels biased against the British player.  Perhaps captured units should be automatically exchanged like in Washington's War.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think repeated play has more or less settled the play-balance issue - there is one, but it's not *that* bad. The British do have to play a tighter game to win. There are definitely strategies for the British that appear tempting but are non-viable (going South; the game will be won or lost in the Northeast, where the big cities are). Once you've filtered that stuff out, Liberty works, and is interesting. Do make sure to use Columbia's "slightly less random French arrival" variant, though.

I still find it to be in the lower tier of Columbia games, however (which is still a 7 rating!) and I think that this is just because Liberty seems really, really lucky. Battles are small but very high-stakes and a quick turn of the dice and your chances in the game go completely down the tubes because blocks that are eliminated ("captured") are so hard to get back, and because the British particularly are very manpower-constrained because of the need to garrison and the ability of the Americans to pop up anywhere. It's not a game-breaker, because players have lots of tools for managing the risks, but it's still tough. You have to be careful.

The advantages of Liberty are that it is a pretty simple, playable, accessible game that is of quite sensible length (2-3hr, as my experiences is that the vast majority of games end well before the end of the turn track) and that provides interesting tactical situations and a fair amount of excitement. It's not a Columbia classic, but it's a fun game and good for a few plays. Of the three current "Hammer"-style games that they've done (Hammer of the Scots, Liberty, and Crusader Rex), I think it's probably the weakest, but the margin isn't great (I like Crusader Rex significantly the best).

This is a really good war game! I love the theme and it's captured pretty well here. I know people complain about the randomness but I like it! You never know  the french are going to arrive and the random unit draw pool, it makes every game different. And there is some complaints that the war in the south isn't so important but me and my father are always battling for those extra victory points in the south. This is a fun game that's definitely worth a try

A very solid Columbia block game. On the one hand, I really like the fact that, as the British, you actually need to hold all the recruiting towns to keep them from turning American again and spawning units; on the other hand, it REALLY stretches you thin, even when you've mustered pretty much all your blocks. At that point, you've probably got one or two big armies in Philly, New York, or Boston. And then, with the French, how do you hold the damned southern cities? Seems like playing with the optional/variant French entry rules works a bit better; they are such a game changer for the Americans that it seems the Brits really need a few turns to get a foothold. I liked the idea of the native american units, but I'm not sure I actually felt they were particularly useful; I'll probably need to try using them more effectively next time. In any event, a nice, open and dynamic, asymmetrical game.

Another fun and quick block game from Columbia. As per usual from CG, it is not meant to be more than history-lite, but it does provide some strat Am Rev flavor. The Brits move up and down the coast with powerful units, trying to catch those damn ragged rebels before they scurry away. The Americans do seem to have too many units, and they also seem to have too easy a time attritting the Brits, none of which seems quite right. Overall not as asymmetrical, nor as tense and balanced, as HotS, but then, few games are. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Impressions after a few plays are quite positive.  Good tension, simple rules. There are lots of tough decisions to make.

While the rules are based on the traditional rule set that Columbia uses in most of their games, here it works well. Getting a handful of high-op cards isn't necessarily a good thing since there are definitely times when you won't want to go first. Also, the fog of war automatically provided by being a block game feels appropriate.

In the goofball [i]Washington's War[/i] you get a completely chaotic narrative because of that huge mono deck and a PC flipping mechanism that feels bolted onto the theme. In [i]Liberty[/i] you're much more in control of your own destiny and the VP mechanism tied to individual cities makes much more sense. Plus, if things go wrong it's probably because you made a poor decision, not because you drew a handful of your opponents' events or you couldn't move a general because you drew a bunch of low ops cards.

Also, unlike [i]Washington's War[/i] which has the ridiculous possibility that the French never enter the war (gee, fun game for the Americans), French entry is progressively more likely to happen if you play with the optional entry rule, and I suggest that you do. So, you'll still get variation with the French entering the war almost probably somewhere between turns 3 and 5, and not an American player who's lost the will to live because Ben Franklin was too busy stoinking a French socialite to bother with that whole diplomacy thing.

As for those who claim that [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i] provides a more interesting and intense experience, I say bullshit. As someone who has played [i]Hammer[/i] too many times to count, I can tell you that [i]Liberty[/i] provides the more interesting experience by far. The map in Liberty is more open, and the river/lake movement along with the forest/marsh restrictions, plus forced marches, create some interesting movement dilemmas. In Hammer the game often degenerates into the "Mentieth Wall" and it becomes a slugfest. On top of that, in Hammer we tracked ops over the course of many games in our own little tournament and realized that a poor English hand in the first two turns dooms them 90% of the time. You don't see that kind of determinism in Liberty, nor do you get stuck with a bunch of useless events or the possibility of the British getting screwed because the turn ended early.

Anyway, the result is a game that's twice as good as [i]Washington's War[/i] with half the rules. Thumbs up.

I've found this game a bit of a miss. It has a similar feel to We the People (with a dependence on a key game changing event; Brits port hopping along the coast and hopeful withering battles), but isn't as fun or tight. It a bit more complex than its sibling Hammer of the Scots (via the naval & terrain rules & hex control), but without much more of a pay-off. 
The main trouble I have is "when would I play it?". 
Simple block game: I prefer HotS. 
Short, simple AWoI game: I prefer WtP.
Liberty falls between the cracks.

RATING: 6
A Columbia "block" wargame featuring the American Revolutionary War at a strategic level.  Both sides have only 25 units each, so the density of pieces is low.  The British begin with 15 points and must attack supply towns in an effort to amass 30 points at the end of any year to win.  The Americans have to either reduce the British below 12 points, or stop them winning by the game end.  Simple mechanics, but subtle rules.  The cards from Hammer of the Scots are back, and it works well.  Each side feels very different, with the British having to feed their regulars across the Atlantic, while the Americans harry and wait for the French to arrive.  After a couple of games, the balance appears to be very good.  Excellent game.

[Dagliesh & Kwasny] A respectable wargame which did not deserve its poor reception [in some circles at least]. Has minimal complexity, so it is useful as an introduction to block wargames. Suffers from the fact that it is very very similar to HotS but not as good. It leans too much toward simulation instead of being an exciting game.

Nice, easy-to-play yet interesting game. Only 8 pages of rules yet there's interesting decisions to make almost every turn. The US can play their clever, guerrilla "pop up anywhere I like" game, while the Brits have to maintain the pressure. However, the game can hinge upon a few high-stakes dice rolling and for the British, bad dice-rolling will sink your game. Not as interesting as Crusader Rex or Hammer of the Scots in that sense. Yes, HotS also has high-stakes dice rolling but the "nobles" victory conditions make it more interesting than just conquest of territory.

So far, this has proven to be a challenge for the British.  The game plays well and has me pondering what different strategy to employ as the British to gain the victory.  

However I rate it down on a few points
1. It is easier to disband and reform than to reinforce. That seems a bit strange, the supply cards are rare and golden
2. The overall production quality is not great
 a) Several blocks weren't cut square (b) Block labels are starting to show wear after only 3 plays.  (The fix for this is to draw blocks out of a bag)   (c) The unmounted card stock map is a bit flimsy
3. A few rules required discussion and agreement on principles. Left a bit unclear in definition.

I love the period of history and the game...  The Atlantic box is great and allows you to pounce on the shoreline in several places at once.  It lets you build up your units in secret much like a hand of cards.  The threat of naval invasion reminds me of playing the Union in Bobby Lee and adds suspense to the game.  I also think it's unique how forces can melt away before winter and rebuild anywhere with card play.  It makes a very fluid game with a feeling of freedom.  To its credit it plays quickly and is easy to get into, making it a great weeknight wargame.  I look forward to many more plays! I think it's interesting how the Victory system from Columbia Games feels different with each game.  Liberty feels very different than other games using the same system (Crusader Rex, Hammer and Victory) yet shares enough rules that it's easy to transition into.  I love the use of ships in the game.  This game plays shorter than Crusader Rex and Hammer of the Scots.   Good design in this one!

[1 play] Nice solid block game.  Mostly my problem with it is the French.  If they come on as soon as possible, I see little chance for the British to win and vice versa for the Americans.  It just seems like this could have been handled a lot better while still providing some variance.  [i]At least[/i] if the French are going to arrive the first round they can, you should have a round of warning so you can make a desperate lunge at the Americans in an effort to be in a more defensive stance against the French.

My favourite wargame. The perfect balance of asymmetrical forces with polar opposite objectives. Intricate game design that provides an appreciation of 18th century warfare.

One of Columbia Games rules light publications, and shines with the hex based system. Easy to play and difficult to master. I love the addition of warships/naval combat, but personally favour optional rules for French Entry.

Another excellent, fast playing block game from Columbia.  Not as compelling as Hammer of the Scots, but still interesting.

A very enjoyable game. The rules are easy enough, especially if you have any Columbia block game experience. It seems well balanced and can (should)  be playd in 3 hours or less. I like it better than Washington's War.

In comparison to Hammer to the Scots; overall Liberty has less battles and more positional jockeying. Liberty battles, in general, involve less blocks. Your card draw value is much less critical in Liberty than in HotS. Unlike in HotS, a whole handful of "3s" doesn't necessarily mean you will roll this turn, likewise a handful of "1s" is not the end of the world. Liberty plays faster because there are less battles, battles are smaller,  and not so many permutations to think through during the regroup phase. In HotS, a bad regroup can be devastating during the winter phase. On the otherhand, in Liberty if the French don't show up in a timely manner for the Americans, their fighting chance to win independence is greatly diminished (the 11, 8, 5 sliding entry roll fix is a nice optional rule, you’ll see what I mean when you read the rules).  Also because the whole eastern seaboard is on the map, there isn’t the whole focus on one or two choke points (like Mentieth). Players can swing to another part of the map to make trouble if they are stymied elsewhere.

Probably my favorite block game (at this time).  I love the theme and this game offers some real "meat" without moving into the "too complex to really ever play" category where so many AWoI games seem to fit.  The only thing that drops my rating (a bit) is a few too many "little" rules that are easy to forget or easy to play incorrectly at some point in a particular game (hexside limits, town control, river retreats, sea attacks, etc.)

This is a very solid game.  It is light in that you can grasp the rules very quickly; but it is indeed complex!  Retreats, Naval situations and battles are all tense affairs!!!  

This game is not Hammer of the Scots, so don&#039;t expect a clone.  This is a fine period wargame.  Spend the money and get it from Columbia Games.  Especially if you enjoy block games.

There is a strange Chess like flow in Liberty that I find intoxicating. While hardly the exciting dice fest that is The Napoleonic Wars, the charms of Liberty lie in what the game rewards. It rewards forces that mix unit capabilities and players who know when fight and when to run. In short, it rewards diligence, prudence, and intelligence. If you want a rollicking good time, play Fortress America. If you want a game that more accurately reflects history, go for Wilderness War. If you want a game that plays fast and easy, and rewards the careful and the shrewd, go for Liberty.

RATING: 7
A solid offering from Columbia, easy to play, with remarkably good historical value for only a little bit of rules overhead. More than a passing similarity to Hammer of the Scots, but less chaotic. More brittle than Hammer, and the game can get away from you on the last march of a year if you aren't careful, particularly around Boston, where ten-point swings in area control are possible. The vastly different strategies required of the British and American sides lends additional depth and replay value. Can stalemate if the two sides have naval parity, but can also be a fast-moving and surprising game if gamers play with some elan.

Good: Strategic - American Revolution - Easy

The plus:
-A very well themed game with a very good execution: nice comprehensive rules & exciting gameplay
-Easy to play, challenging situations-Excellent for newbees with some gaming experience and interests
-Time will only be a few hoursThe minus:-Production quality could have been so much better(box cover, cards(!!!), map, would have loved big blocks a la HotS / CR)-Only 1 scenario (in the meantime 3 additional have been posted)
-The Southern Front is a bit underwhealmed (okay, historically right but it would have been nice to have a little more action). Mind you, if you do not watch the South you can have a nasty surprise as British Player! a realy tricky theater but absorbes half of the board with only 20% of the action.

-I like the assymetrical forces and first players should play the English. The last game I played, the English went for the 30 VP's in 1777 in a desperate attempt to avoid the French (coming in 1778). A blast and it came down to the last die roll. I think it is a balanced game where both sides have good chances with compelling gameplay. Replay value is good but the immobility of the units are a bit of a worry (1 MP per unit) although you have the option for a Forced March. And all in all a wonderful result where gameplay is the outright strength.  

The 'bad' (
(these ar eall minor issues)
-Southern map is almost 50% of the total map but sees minor action. 
-I I am not really fond of the 1 hex move per round units. Okay, you have 4 cards per round so you will be able to move units bit it feels a bit contrained.
-The box cover is very plain. 
-The playing cards are plain ugly and a disgrace. Columbia should pay some attention into this.
-I would have loved the bigger HotS / CR blocks

If you are looking for a short easy and exciting wargame, look no further as this one has it all.

I have not touched it the past three years. Sold it.

I loved East Front and East Front II, so decided to try another block game. With this one, I just didn't feel like I was playing the American Revolutionary War. 

A bummmer, since there are so few good games (1776 and a handful of others} on the subject. I like heavy wargames, and, this one is an intro wargame with minimal chrome...and less history...and close to zero political dynamics. It fails to capture the American Revolutionary War that I am familiar with.

This title is one of my favorite block war games and favorite Columbia Game. The blocks and decals are really nicely done. The map is really well done with one complaint that its on card stock.

The American War of Independence. First impressions: This is an excellent block game offering from Columbia. Components are top-notch, rules are elegant and simple (a close cousin to Hammer of the Scots, although with some interesting new twists), gameplay is exciting, with plenty of interesting decisions to be made. Game might have a balance problem, with balance hinging on the random arrival of the French.

Too attritional to hold my interest (it is too easy to exhaust the American manpower reserves and combats are fought far past the point where one side would have broken off) and I didn't care for the powerful strategy of holding a "fleet in being" to smash small outposts along the coast.  The low hexside limits make for a situation that feels more like Wizard Kings than Hammer of the Scots, even if it does feature a nice tweak of the latter's wintering rules to force armies to unstack towards the end of the year.

Very good block game in the tradition of Hammer of the Scots.  The naval movement/attacks seem a bit fiddle to me after one play -- I don't quite understand why sea attacks cannot be supplemented by simultaneous land attacks (without resorting to the excuse that it would make the game too easy for the Brits if that rule weren't in effect).  After one play, I'd say it's not quite up to the level of Hammer because it's less richly themed but it plays easily and quickly and gives a nice strategic-level overview of the American Revolution.   It also suffers somewhat in my opinion by being the second best simple strategic-level ARW game since We the People is a bit better.

RATING: 9
Very fun game about the American revolution. I especially like the active part of the navies and the West Indies. I missed these elements in Washington's war.
The only bad point is the lack of dice modificators that is common to every Columbia games, so, when you're not lucky with dices, there's really nothing you can do.

A block wargame which doesn't quite hit as well as Hammer of the Scots did.  The board seems more claustrophobic, and wintering, for some reason, seems a lot more awkward.  Theme also didn't do as much for me.  (I understand much of this is unhelpful if you've never actually played Hammer...)

I love this game. It is an easy-to-learn simulation of the American Revolution, with the fog of war afforded by block games and just enough subtlely to make it interesting without being overly complex. It does a great job integrating the French and Indians, as well as naval warfare, and it offeres lots of options and replay value. An excellent companion to Hammer of the Scots and a great game to play when you want a wargame without a big commitment in time, space or learning cumbersome rules.

I have only played this one solitaire so far, but it looks like a real winner to me. I love the cards which determine the turn order of the players, and the number of actions available each turn (I have played several Columbia games, but not HotS, so some of these mechanics are a bit new to me). The combat and retreat rules make this a very tense design, and as a whole it is much simpler and less fiddly than, say, Pacific Victory. A game that entices one to play it.

RATING: 7
I got it in a math trade, mainly because I have a buddy who likes the Revolutionary War.

I'm curious whether this is unbalanced, I'm unlucky or I suck! I was the Americans, rolled abysmally, had a two-turn stretch where I drew no supply cards and lost early, despite getting the French on the first possible turn and controlling both of the West Indies supply points.

Other than an early victory against the Mohawks, I didn't win a single battle and really only had two or three battles I had a realistic chance of winning. It was almost entirely a choice of whether to fight a round and retreat or just retreat right away--and I was almost always the defender.

Initial strategy thoughts are that I spread out a little too much, used too much French power to control the West Indies and didn't concentrate enough in a couple of the big supply-point cities. The bad die rolling did hurt me quite a bit in a couple key battles that probably should have been draws, with me forcing the attacking Brits to retreat. I made one attack that in hindsight probably wasn't wise, as I understimated the strength in the location.

Still, it's an interesting game on a topic I have not gamed before. The rating could easily go up upon reflection or additional play, and I do want to play it again at some point. It's not on my "must play soon" list, but I wouldn't gripe about seeing it on the table.

I like the fact that it is reasonably realistic in a big picture sort of way. The Americans must bob and weave, keep the Brits guessing and be willing to retreat, while controlling just enough victory points to stay alive. Meanwhile, the Brits must overcome the tenuous supply situation and outmaneuver the opponent to bring his superior forces to bear, force combat and prevent retreat. Each side has a different strategy for controlling victory objectives that reflects the historical situation. 

I subsequently learned that we did get a rule wrong that may have contributed to the British win.

Tentative rating after only one play. Realized after two full turns that we missed a number of important rules. I like the concept, although the game didn't feel as tense as Hammer of the Scots. The prisonner exchange was quite innane; I see only a very limited set of circumstances under which both players would agree to a trade. Want to try once more now that I know better what is going on.

Just say. . "no".  This is a HOTS rip-off that despite the nice production value, doesn't capture the "essence" of the American Revolution.  The fact that the French enter on an annual dice-role is the first indicator that something isn't quite right (no scaling chance, no additional factors). . .when you play a bit, you find out that in fact the Americans can build up a "B" grade assault force, and take down British regulars with odds - didn't happen in the history I read.  That it doesn't try to emulate some kind of supply rules (the British didn't like leaving the coast because of this), political will (political control wasn't completely dependent on millitary control)or other variables in the conflict, it makes the theme. . .thin.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE block games. . especially HOTS, but this just doesn't create that struggling play for the Americans, or the powerful but frustrated British feeling.  There is no reason to play this over HOTS.  You're just moving blocks around. ..

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

Have I mentioned that I don't like blocks ? The system is very artificial. However the design is clean and the game is fun because of the strategic situation, which has always interested me. The French intervention rule is a problem though: too random, and fails to simulate the need for a major American victory (Saratoga), which should be a major driver of a good AmRev game (vs the British need to overextend themselves). It also helps that I won my only game of Liberty (as the British) when I captured New England, New Jersey down to Pennsylvania in 1780... it makes me want to play a *real* wargame on the American Revolution.

RATING: 8
Pretty easy to learn, especially for those who've already played Columbia block games, and one of their better designs, as it's easy to get into and therefore concentrate on strategy, movement and combat. I particularly like the prisoner exchange and replacement rules. 

As the Americans one must counter British replacements moving to take over too much territory while still maintaining sufficient strength to defend ground gained. As the British/Native-Americans, it's best to pour in replacements early, before the French can enter (which is starting at the end of 1776 by rolling more than 8 on two dice). 

This is one of Columbia Games' better-written rulebooks, and they made some clever twists with the rules, particularly with regard to rolling randomly per year for French entry, and aspects of how Indian blocks work (they fight better in their own towns, can only fight in forested hexes, are more mobile than most of their Anglo counterparts, and once eliminated are out of the game permanently).

After being on my radar for a long time, purchased used, December 2011. Rating could go up with more plays, especially after playing "Washington's War" in 2013 and being completely underwhelmed with that one. 

[Update: Dec. 31, 2013 - After more plays I'm dealing with much fewer rules look-ups and more game play, and on that basis am raising my rating from 7 to 8. With repeated plays the excellent combination of strategy plus tactics plus play balance and variety all come together in a very impressive way.]

A decent block-game effort on the American Revolution. If you try Hammer of the Scots stand up and fight tactics, you will lose, as eliminated units are captured and can't be re-drawn until prisoner exchanges happen. I played the Americans and just couldn't get the French to join in, so every captured unit hurt me, to the extent that I didn't have a draw-pool after a few turns. Boston seems a much harder nut to crack for the Americians than it was historically to me. Frustrating, but fun.

There are definitely a lot of interesting decisions here regarding card play (do you even want to go first in the turn?), maneuver and overall planning.

Jan 09: big jump in my rating after playing this again--and completely understanding the rules this time. Fascinating game. If you can "take" the randomness of the combat (1 unit can, but is unlikely, to defeat 4--similar to Civilization on the computer), this is an elegant design that captures the ebb and flow of the American Revolution.

Introduced to this game just recently, and didn't get to play a whole game, so I might need some more time with it.  First impressions are that it seemed kind of boring, there wasn't a lot of action, but I think that when my opponent and I quit we were on the verge of seeing French entry and as the British I was going to be able to bring in more troops.  Maybe with another play or two I could upgrade it from a 6, but we'll have to wait for that.

Every time I try a Columbia game I think the same "well, another block game just changing the conflict scenario, I am going to feel like playing same game one more time". but once I start playing I begin to discover those little details that makes every match a new story. so I have to rethink and say "Another fantastic Columbia Games production, using a solid system that adapts perfectly to any situation". I have enjoyed this title a lot. I recommend it to all of you that love easy setup, great replay possibilities and short time games. Best for two players but works fine solitaire if you accept there is not chance for surprise using action cards

[18 plays] My favorite wargame. I fully expect to still be playing this game on a regular basis 40 years from now (I'll be the coolest 80 yr old geek on the block) for a match against my brother-in-law or one of my kids, or one of my grandkids. I have yet to write an official BGG review, but this will be the first game for which I do that.

I admit that Hammer of the Scots may be a slightly better game for most people - however, my love for Revolutionary War history compensates so that I rate the two games pretty equally.

This game has a lot going for it. Tension, very careful management of your forces, good fog of war, and challenging terrain that makes good decisions citical.

Most recent play Aug '15. Very impressed that my high opinion of this game stands up each time even after years between playings.

Have now played 4-5 games of Liberty after 15 or so games of HOTS.  Liberty is a very good wargame, but I do not think that the game is as tight as HOTS.  The very large board is almost *too* big, as it seems that alot of the Southern part of the map is a wasteland, with little game action taking place.  It seems like 90 percent of our conflicts and battles take place in the New England area, which takes up only about 30 percent of the map.  There can be some excellent gaming moments in this game, because the English must control 30 supply points by the end of the last year to win.  This make the English player really start to feel like "the clock is ticking" as the years go by and forces aggressive English play.  The all or nothing win scenario can encourage a "rope-a-dope" strategy for the Americans in the last couple of years.  A couple of rules are ambiguous, but some FAQ research clears them up abit.  As with HOTS, I find the components less than stellar.  The board is the same "cerealbox cardboard" and the cards are basically junk.  They began falling apart after only 5 plays!  All in all, a good game, but with some minor flaws.

I had high hopes for this one as I find the historical period interesting and had great experience with Hammer of the Scots. But unfortunately I have to say that this game is rather boring.

In my opinion this is Columbia games weakest title in recent years.

Give me death.

Liberty reminds me of why I had been avoiding most dice based wargames for so long.  This game is so dependant on luck that I just didn't feel like I was needed in the equation.  There was not a moment through the entire game that I cared about.

First of all, this game is dry as a bone, the only personality that they achieved was the river movement and the fact that the indians can survive out in the wild.  The rest of it is just numbers and percentages.

What really pisses me off is the fact that you have troops that have to roll on a one.  This is just retarded, sure there is a one in six chance that you will get a one, but we all know how it works, you can roll till doomsday and not get a single one while your opponant will get snake-eyes.  I didn't feel like there was  a battle taking place, but rather just a couple shmoes betting to see who could roll a one first.  Lame.

To make this worse, any headway that can be made in a battle is pointless, due to the fact that you can just retreat.  This is fine, but ground doesn't really matter (I know the points in the cities matter, but they don't make a difference unless you are nearing one of the victory goals, not like a real front).
So, the only thing that matters are units.  But if one person is lucky enough to have supply cards they will just heal the troops that retreated.  This means that the game relies entirely on whether you are lucky enough to get suply cards. 

No thanks, I'll take Hammer of the Scotts any day over this dreck.

A cleaner, easier version of the Hots system. There is a distinct feel to the two sides.

See my comparison with Crusader Rex and Hots:

more strategic than hammer, less strategic than Pac Vic and i like it less than both -- not enough action, but it does a good job of simulating the Rev War (i think) -- i gave it a 7, so it's still a good game just less so than other block games i've played

Read the rules closely because there are some important subtleties, especially regarding retreat and prisoners vs. disbanding.  Hard to play solo, at least until you've played vs. an opponent.  If you can handle the additional minor complexity, play with all optional rules.

Block wargane on the War of Independence.  Similar rules to Hammer of the Scots, concise and easy to understand.  Map is a little unusual as its hex based rather than point to point however the map is very clear and looks the part.  The game playe very well with British inability to retreat onto Amrican towns being very important.  The theme doesn't interest as much as those Rcihard III, Hammer of the Scots nd Julius Caesar which is the only reason for the lower score

A nice light wargame. Have some new Imperial strategies I'd like to try sometime. Baseline French entry rule problematic.

Okay, I've done two solitaire games and so far am enthusiastic about replays.  Hopefully to include a real opponent in the near future.  The gameplay is smooth, and the results of the campaigns 'feel' historical.  This game may become a 10 rating as I continue to iron out some rules questions in my head.  The game would be a '10' right now if only the rules had included an 'extended' example of play.  Many wargames however could benefit from such a thing, but few include them.

Let me start by saying I'm very much a Euro-gamer rather than a wargamer, but I love the Columbia blocks system (and look forward to trying out GMT's version of block warfare at some point), and found Liberty to be a strong successor to Hammer of the Scots. Liberty feels a bit more freewheeling than HotS, its older cousin, The rules of HotS sometimes feel a bit overly constraining and even a tad fiddly to make the particular scenario work, while the Liberty rules seem more general and wide open. Liberty still does a great job of historical simulation, however, with the Atlantic Box mechanic, in particular, doing a nice job of recreating the coastal flexibility, maneuverability and firepower the British enjoyed, at least until the French entered the war. I think the British victory condition of 30 supply points is extremely difficult, especialy if the French enter the war early, but it's possible. All in all, I think I might give the nod of better game to Liberty over HotS, although I'm certainly in the minority on this as HotS has a substantially higher average rating here on the Geek.

I think Hammer is better than this one. After all i traded them both. If i ever buy a block game it will probably be Sturm Europa or Command and colors.

If you're a wargamer, you owe it to yourself to try one of the Columbia block games. Make your choice based upon the subject matter. They're all easy -- although the rule books make them harder than necessary.

Rules very similar to Hammer of the Scots makes this easy to learn, but the few differences results in very different play:

* Most units only having move 1 means it takes long time to maneuver units around - in HotS, groups were more mobile.

* Eliminated units being permanently gone ('captured' unless you can trick  your opponent into a prisoner exchange) means one has to be much more careful about not losing units.

* Not having winter builds, but only being able to rebuild units by a few supply cards, and by disbanding them, contributes further to a game where every step lost hurts.

In my opinion, Liberty is a tenser and more exciting game than HotS as a result of these differences!.

Played once and really liked it even though we messed up some sea attack rules. Naval movement/attack/retreat rules are a little tricky. I can't wait to get this one to the table again to see how much different it will play when we actually follow all the rules. ;)

Only one play so rating is preliminary. However I don't see this hitting the table again. When in the mood for a CG-game, there are plenty of others that I would rather play. Like Crusader Rex, Richard III or Hammer of the Scots which are all excellent games.

Another fast moving fun game from CG. Play becomes intuitive quickly, and it is well balanced.  I highly
recommend this one!

I like this game, but it's sorta frustrating.  Need to see a British win.  More plays needed.  Update 3/17/2017: Had to lower my rating (from 7 to 6).  We've played this three times and each game has resulted in a rather boring stalemate, with the American side winning by default in every case.  Very little actual combat, each game is basically 2 hours of armies retreating from each other.  The random entry of the French have a profound impact on how the game plays out, and with a 1776 entry (which happened in all 3 of our games) it is nigh impossible for the British to realistically threaten the American position, let alone win.  Hammer of the Scots, by comparison, is always a tense / dynamic / exciting affair.

Love the prisoner-exchange rule! After several plays, I think this might be the most balanced Columbia block game. The game is a very tense affair.

I'm not sure that Liberty is in anyone's "top 3" block game list, but it's undeniably a good time. The game's weather rolls, instantaneous recruitment, and uncertain French entry all combine into a solidly entertaining experience.  I also enjoy the additional challenge of hexside limits being in effect at all times, and not just for attacks. 

My guess is that the game isn't suitable as a beginner's entry into the block game series because of the unique hex control rules.  Here, hex control doesn't change until the end of turn, which has interesting regroup and retreat implications.

Another reason why Liberty might be not a good first choice for initiates: While there are definitely worse rulebooks in the Columbia games line (e.g., Crusader Rex), the Liberty rulebook isn't exactly an exercise in clarity - especially with the language used to describe sea attacks, sea retreats, and the details of hex control.

Note: The [url=http://www.columbiagames.com/resources/3021/libertyoptionals.shtml]"sliding scale"[/url] variant for French entry - with the target die roll starting off unreachably high and decreasing significantly each subsequent year - seems to be the most fair.

Update:

I continue to be impressed by this well-balanced and engaging game.  Rating goes up.

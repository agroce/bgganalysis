Even though I like Peptide slightly better, this is a really solid little card game. Chemistry knowledge isn't essential but it will enhance your enjoyment. That being said, I would like to see an expansion at some point that adds more ion and compound cards.

Nice drafting game where you are trying to build compounds and satisfy goal cards in the center of the table.  The extra action tiles are nice giving you the option to be able to pull more cards or different cards to help maximize your score.  Where the game loses a point for me is that even with all the additional items added in the game is still rather simple, and the stack of goal cards is very small and so guarantees that in higher player count games you will see them repeated and just gives it the feel of cheap extra points.

Kickstarted. Love the science behind this one, too. 

Update: Having played several rounds, this is one of the more accessible and enjoyable games in our collection. The passing of hands is similar to Sushi Go, but instead of building maki rolls you're building compounds. The science is strong with this one, which makes it both educational and fun. Easy to teach to newbies, but solid enough to serve as a strong filler for regular gamers.

Actually an abstract card drafting game comparable to 7Wonders, but the chemistry theme provides real educational value.  Just as Paperback has the advantage over Dominion by bringing literacy to the deck building genre, Ion deserves top honors for elevating the card drafting game to a new level.  Gaming no longer has to be a "guilty pleasure".  Scratch that 7Wonders itch and educate at the same time.

This is a great filler! It moves quickly, is pretty straightforward, involves some decision making, and has quality components. My only question or wish is that the game came with a list of possible compounds created when balancing with the given elements.  We recognized some, but it left us curious for others we could not identify.  One of the best educational games out there.

My wife is a teacher and loves this game.  Mostly because it's not highly competitive in a way that requires you to go after other players (IE munchkins).  Basically, you start with a hand of cards and try to build a compound from them.  It's really probably one of the better 'learning' while playing games out there with an educational component.

 - This is a great little card drafting game, much like Sushi Go. 
 - I really like the theme. It's educational without trying to ram what it's trying to teach down your throat.
 - Most, if not all of my friends prefer actually this to Sushi Go party, I think because it feels like it has more depth.
 - I probably get Sushi Go Party to the table more than this however, due to it's higher player count, and because I think the sushi theme and aesthetics are less intimidating than the chemistry theme.
 - I like the bonus compound cards as they can give you focus. I recommend playing with an extra card with larger player counts to give people more things to shoot for.
 - I really the like 3 bonus-action tiles. The limited, but not necessarily fixed usage count is a great mechanic that grants flexibility when you need it most. Sometimes drafting games can suck near the end of a round when you either can't complete a particular combo, or there's crap cards to draft. These bonus actions help minimise this.
 - The transition metals are cool, but I'm not a fan of the radioactive elements. These feel like they're not worth the extra complication when teaching what is otherwise a simple game.
 - I've rated this lower than I have Sushi Go Party only because the latter is more versatile. I enjoy this one more.

Teaching game that I randomly stumbled across on Kickstater and thought it was a neat idea. The designer has a lot of other ideas around (like protein building and covalent compounding) that also sound neat. I'll have to see how this one plays out to see if I'd like the others.

A set collection game where you are trying to make compounds.  It is a an educational game that teaches basic chemistry where you need to balance equations.  I found the game OK, but would not really be drawn back to it.

Simple Drafting/Match collecting game. If not for the theme, it would be forgettable. As it is, ist all right, but you do need the "expansions" in the box to have any meaningful decisions (the radioactive ones are the only extra cards I would call "optional", the rest is a must. But I would recommend playing with radioactive cards as well).

So far this is the best Genius Games game I've played (that doesn't say a lot though). I've played several Genius Games games before mainly because I enjoy science and look forward to it in board game form. Most of the time though, the games suffer from far too much chance and little strategy.
This time though, fortunately, the game is salvageable. For its short length, some good choices, strategy, and planning, this one's a keeper. Sure I could suggest other, *better*, card drafting games out there BUT...this one IS enjoyable and I do like the theme.
One minor tweak I make to the game when playing though is this: Treat all the special action tiles as -3 instead of the -2/-3/-4 randomness. It makes the gameplay more strategic (more than it was anyway) without taking anything away. Not sure what the purpose of that randomness was even for, it only introduced randomness for "randomness's" sake.

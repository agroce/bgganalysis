I played this one recently after having not played it all in over a year. Not a bad game, but not one I would ever suggest playing. I've moved on to other games.

RATING: 7.75
At first the luck of the draw seemed to turn us off somewhat but then again we kept playing because of the challenge of managing a seemingly helpless hand. However the randomness of the draw creates a constant changing dynamic that you must manage the whole game. Get creative, there are other ways to advance. 
Glad to have this one in our collection. When all else fails, "lost cities"!

RATING: 8.5
The mechanics bear absolutely no relationship to the theme but notwithstaning that this is an outstanding game. its all about risk management - its a game that very CEO of a bank should be forced to play against 3 decent players and if they cant won 75% of their games they get fired.

The 2 player game is too random for me. 4 best but 3 perfectly accepatble.

A favourite with the rest of my family but I get so frustrated with it when we play and there's a shed load of shuffling to mix the cards back up, that you just sorted into colour and number order so I resist its appearance at the table.

2009 08 28: Very good family game. The tension isn't as high as the 2 player game, but still good (and the multiplayer allows it to get to the table). Addition of artifacts, etc, makes it feel like a fuller experience.

Very good attempt to expand the two-player game for more players. Avoid the "Keltis Way" variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great intro game with enough decisions for the experienced gamer, but very simple game play. Perhaps better than the card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
From my interpretation, this sounds like it trumps Keltis in game play and design. And based on my forum question, it looks like it edges out the 2 player card game. http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/497945/how-much-different-is-lost-cities-the-2-player-gam

UPDATE: Well, this turned out to be quite a surprise! I played this as a two player game and it was fantastic! It definitely is better than the original as you can visually see how many points you have going for each expedition you are on. Also, the bonus tokens and abilities create incentives for focusing on certain paths. I also see how TBG can be played exactly like the original game if you wanted to by striping out the "doubles". This game is light, quick, easy to play - in fact, I think the rules are easier to learn and execute than the 2 player Kosmos game! The perfect leisurely game to play while watching TV in the background. I almost wish now that I purchased the game new instead of getting it in a math trade.

I haven't played Lost Cities:The Card Game.


Horrible art, and the most luck I have ever seen in a Knizia game. Certainly much more luck than Settlers of Catan; so if you don't like Catan, well.....

Having said that, it's not actually all that bad to play!

I am not sure why so many people claim this to be a watered down version of the card game, because I believe this to be much superior.  The Board Game allows you to play up to 4 different players, and you play with 2 decks of lost city cards.  You can advance your character along a path and see exactly how many points you will get during the advancement (instead of calculating in your head based on the numbers).  You are still playing a press-your-luck type game with hopes of grabbing high cards later on, but since you are playing with 4 players and 2 decks, there is a higher chance someone will discard a card you need.  The board is the same every game, but the special tokens are randomized, which makes each session a little different.  The tokens can cause you to gain points, jump ahead an extra space, or gain an artifact, which you score at the end.  All in all, this makes the game more fun and more gateway gamer friendly!

*And no more frustrating rounds of lost cities card game where your opponent picks up all of the high numbers in their hand and you were doomed from the start.

Uninspiring design. The 3 round game is too long for what it is. The player is too vulnerable to the whims of the cards to form any coherent strategy. Decent game, just not anything special.

A decent game but is missing much of the elegance and tension of the original 2-player card game. Points deducted due to sheer, aggressive ugliness of the art. Looking at the board is the visual equivalent of eating a paste of ketchup and coffee grounds.

More interesting than the card game. Nice vibrant graphics and simple game play. Still it feels a little dull in play and is not that fun. Will play again though. Typical family Euro.

RATING: 6
I'll admit that I picked this up because of its prize status and not because I am a die-hard fan of the card game.  That said, I do find that I like this better that its progenitor.  Why?  maybe its because it feels like there are more options.  Maybe because the play involves more players and hence is less scripted.  The game is still a card game - but with a large board to mark your score / progress.  Either way, its a step up for me.

RATING: 6.5
Take a generally dry mechanic and surround it with a point, and you've got a reasonably decent, modestly well made game. Amazing what happens when purpose meets simplicity.

Much like the original Lost Cities. More thinking about which colour to go down than Lost Cities has thanks to the chits that get put out on the board.
My opinion might change if I start doing less well, currently I've won 2 of my 3 games, and was second in the other.

Very true to the card game, but kinda defeats the purpose for me since it's not best with 2, isn't super quick, and takes a long time to set up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am torn because in some ways I like it better than lost cities but you really need 4 players as with 2 it is better to just play lost cities and with 3 all the cards aren't out.  Fast to play with suprising depth just like it's two-player cousin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
With 3-4 players, it is a very good game. With only 2, not so much.

We flip the treasure and point tokens over on the board as it doesn't make sense that you would know where the different treasures are located. We definitely prefer playing it that way.

After 5+ plays, I'm pretty sure I prefer the card game.  The boardgame version seems to lack the tension of its older brother.  I'm always worried about running out of time when playing the original Lost Cities.  When playing this incarnation, I find I'm trying how to "waste" my last five or six turns since I've already accomplished what I set out to do.

Really enjoyed this game, it is a nice way to spend time with others! the choices you make and the randomness of the cards conspired for me to make a nice mix of knowledge and luck. your anticipation of moves and keen observance are paramount in this one to being successful, just sitting down at it ensures you will have fun. This is not for those who have to control everything in a game, but if you are looking for nice thematic fun, then give this one a whirl!

RATING: 5
Qualifying statement:  While I have played once using the Lost Cities rules, most of the time we stick strictly to the Keltis variant rules that are in the rulebook because we like the shorter game. This is, in my opinion, a ton better than the original 2-player game. I'm not sure why, because the game isn't that different, but I do like it a lot. My biggest problem is the massive swings of luck based on the draw.  A player who lucks into a good hand and good draws will dominate, and never need to discard thereby blocking opponents from catching up. Yet there is still something fun in this game, as long as luck doesn't completely hose you.  Knowing which track to play on and when to play on it is tough.  I also enjoy the struggle to prioritize when it is more important to get moving, and when you need to grab artifacts or points.  Then there is the game of chicken players often play deciding whether to start a new track later in the game or holding back because there might not be enough turns left.  All in all, it's a decent game and one that I don't mind playing, I just wish there was a better way to mitigate the luck factor.

This is a more tense and fun game than Keltis.  Keltis by comparison feels "overdeveloped"; that is to say, the game was made shorter and easier (less tense) to better fit the criteria the typical German family is looking for.

If you've tried Keltis and thought it was just OK, try it again with the Lost Cities rules (including playing the full three rounds).  You may be pleasantly surprised.  (One tip to remember if you do:  Discards here are not the last-resort that they are in Keltis. Use them.)

RATING: 8
Right now after a couple of plays, I'm really enjoying LC:TBG.  I have played with two and four.  The tension is still there, but slightly different in this version than in the card version.  I look at this as a race game as you are racing to grab artefacts and to move up out of the red and into the black.  Once the fifth explorer goes across the bridge, the round stops.  It's a card game, but I don't think there is any more luck in this than in the card game.  In fact, I like the choices better in this.  The tiles, once flipped, stay on the board.  If you are not the first one grabbing up all the artefacts, you can plan and use these other tiles to your advantage.  For me, this is a big step up from the card game (which I have always found easy to play but only "okay").

The game looks great, easy to get into and I am finding it fun to play.

I love Lost Cities, but recognize it can get monotonous for many people. The board mechanics totally fixes that in my opinion.  Make sure that your group knows that this is a LIGHT game!  You ALWAYS ALWAYS have to play cards before you are ready to.  Just make a play and move on.  No matter if your next draw is now totally worthless... that happens to everyone.  Just make a play and move on.  This game shines as a light card playing game with board mechanics to make it feel like it has more depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't know which is better, the card game or board game.  The card game plays faster and seems to have a slightly better balance.  This adds in a few elements on the board that give you some bonuses, but the scoring doesn't seem as natural.  Either way, the game is too long for a filler and only so-so for a medium weight, I probably won't play it much.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm not crazy about this game...  the Keltis expansion seems to be far superior to it in terms of having more choices and options.   

Lost Cities seems to be a little too repetitive for me.   One round is usually enough.

Traded away since I've now got Keltis and its expansion.

This is a great gateway game as it's really easy to understand for non-gamers and they all have a shot of winning because of the luck of the draw (as opposed to, say, Puerto Rico, where a new player will probably never win) and that's a strength to the game. However, for me, that's the only strength as I don't really find the game that interesting as you basically just play a card and draw a new one.

I like this version better than the card game.  More variety, more ways to win, and a lot smaller chance of getting hit with huge negatives due to the doubling of all of the card values.

An excellent implementation of a previously used mechanic that enriches the experience over playing the regular card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lost Cities is a relatively easy game to pick up; the required three rounds seem to take awhile though, and as you're just doing the same thing three times over, somewhat superfluous. The idea is cool, though, and with three or four people the execution of your expeditions can be exciting.

I don't like that you have to play three rounds (it takes too long), but this is a fun, easy-to-learn game.

I think the original versions of the game (where you don't play three rounds) would be better.

RATING: 3.5
First I'll say this: it is probably an excellent game for children or to play with folks that don't like "gamer games". 

Personally, I find the depth to be quite shallow and the luck factor to be too great for me to really get my teeth into this. However, as a light game goes - this one does play fairly well and I there are certain situations that I would want to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rated "7" after one play. For now, I give a slight nod to the card game, which feels a bit more tense and forces me to discard more often. But, this is still a pretty nifty interpretation for the card game, and I can see where this is an excellent "family game." And hey, I play family games too! Not everything has to be some brain marathon.

After a bit of reflection, I realize how this game lacks the tension of Lost Cities the card game. If I owned this game, I'm not sure how often it would hit the table.

K, to appease HiveGod, I'll give a mini review for each new game I add to our my collection, at least.

Lost Cities, the card game is a favorite I our family. Just taught our 9 year old and she loves it. We've seen our friends playing the boardgame variation and heard it was fun. Just picked it up here on vacation and found that it is very faithful to the mechanic, yet allows us to play up to 4 players which is fantastic. Very happy to have committed to this purchase.

RATING: 5
Nice boardgame version of Lost Cities. Easy to learn and play family game and my spouse will sometimes play, which scores it extra points. Having 2 of every card reduces the tension but there's more variety in this version while retaining some scope for 'take that' moments. You tend to have to play your expeditions quicker and not worry about getting the right cards. As a gamers game I would rate it lower as its more for family play.

I was familiar with the card game before trying the board game.  I was (un)pleasantly surprised by how well the board game captured the feelings of tension and frustration that I love in the card game.  

It works with 2 but shines with 4.  We plan to try a variant of using half the cards (one set of each color).

Great family game and I really like the artwork which some have panned.  Have only played 2 player so far which set a good pace for learning the game - would like to see how much tighter the game gets with additional players.  In our first game I concentrated on victory points and my son collected a bunch of artifacts while I wasn't paying attention.  Yep, he won (to his HUGE delight!).
This is just the right pace/tension for a gateway/family game.  LC the card game is nice for it's quick setup and similar feel with the tension definitely ratcheted up a few notches.

My comments are strictly for the Keltis variation included in this game.

Lost Cities has always been dull and lacking in significant opportunities for strategy.  This board game fixes that in a few ways - by adding more players, including a second copy of every card, and sprinkling various power tokens along the scoring paths.  It's also much easier to track your score.  Lastly, the ability to start low OR high means that not all the players are working on identical goals the whole time.

This is a big improvement, and the artwork in this version is very nice.  Personally I'll be looking for a copy of Keltis, but this would make a fine substitute in any game collection.

This is a solid game. It has nice card play associated with an colorful board game . There's a good element of luck mixed with strategy. I knew my kids would like it. Its colorful and well done. The downside is that a max of only 4 can play.

Lacking the tactical depth and tension of its carded brethren. Even though it handles four players I found interaction to be minimal. Although this version ups the sense of theme, it ends up becoming nothing more than a friendly family game - which was not for me.

Components: Good looking board. The tiles are uninteresting and too small. The cards, although trying to convey that same magical progression as in Lost Cities, are a bit bland.

Experience: Interesting game. Similar mechanisms to Lost Cities, but with decreased math, and more personality ascribed to each exploration track. The tiles give me reasons to favor a certain track at a certain time. With 2 players, the end condition means one player might have some time to catch up before the other player can get another meeple across the bridge.

Are you ready to become Indiana Jones? List Cities gives you the chance. It's very simple to play (my 4- and 6-year old kids can play with a little help), as it is nearly all hand management and movement strategy (that's where the kids need help). The game is very good for all ages, and lend itself well to smaller-ish groups. 
That being said, I will mention that the "full-length" game takes quite a while, and can be hard for people with a short attention span. Fortunately, there is a short version you can play that's 1/3 the length of a standard game. You just don't get the back-and-forth you might otherwise get.

This is an excellent, light strategy game.  I love the simple mechanics of play a card, draw a card (although more often than not I forget to draw a card and later realise I haven't got a full eight in hand).  Only downside is that the concentration required when playing fast means the game tends to be played in silence.

Decided to sell and I'll look for the Lost Cities card game instead, which I've heard is better.

Reasonably good reworking of Lost Cities to make it multi-player. the bonuses for advancing along the track add some interest and playing cards ascending or descending help reduce the risk of a bad card draw.
But at heart, its the same amusing, but not great mechanism of "do I start with these or discard for better. But I dont want to discard that because my opponent wants it".
Meh.

The arrows greatly diminish the tension that makes the card game so good. With two players, you should have no trouble getting five expeditions into positive figures; to be fair, with three or four players, some of the risk to embarking on an expedition remains. On the plus side, the arrows and the alternative ending (five expeditions among all players reaching a certain point) do add some interesting tactical decisions. I prefer the original.

Players are explorers trying to advance as far as they can on five expedition tracks.  Wow, what a great surprise to finally play this in 2016.  I ignored this as I'd already picked up Keltis and the expansions, and thought this was the same game.  Not so - after five plays this is a stronger title than Keltis, I suspect.  Melding up in one direction (like Lost Cities) improves the game and brings the discard piles much more into play.  The random scattering of bonus chips makes the game feel different.  And the colourful presentation makes a refreshing change from the Keltis green.  Loved it - almost perfect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The randomized board tiles make this more interesting than the original card game, but it's a bit dry.  I really want to try the Keltis rules, because it would minimize the bad starting hands, but also make for much fewer "safe" discards-- which I think would also mean you're not always just drawing from the deck.

just know you will never get the cards that you want. this game knows what cards you need and magically puts them at the bottom of the deck. fast paced. 60 minute game. if you like lost cities a lot, I could recommend this game as a fan. if you just think lost cities is OK just stay with the card game. this is the card game with a bit more meat. So, if you want to expand your Lost cities street cred buy it, because it wont disapoint the fans.

I was very worried that the board game would not live up to the card game, but my fears have been alleviated. It's very much like the card game in appearance and at least half the mechanics, but different in feel and strategy. 

-It's harder to discard cards without helping your opponent because now you have more than one. 
-Double points for the researcher! Get him as far down the path as possible!
-Collect the most artefacts to gain a big fat bonus at the end of the game!
 
Lots more variety resulting in more decisions and deliberation. 
All in all I was unable to dominate this game like I do the card game and I lost. I lost at Lost Cities! This is great! A challenge! I can't wait to play again!

Played a 3-player.  Compared to [thing=50][/thing], this is equally as good - if not better.  There is something about having a board which tracks your "Investments", makes it feel more like, well ... a boardgame.  Not to mention, up to 4 players.  These two aspects, IMO, make it a slightly better offering on an already excellent & well established title.

This game surprised me, because I had no interest in playing it.   I thought it might suck.   It didn't.  Works great with 3 and 4 players.  The ability to chain combos on the board makes the sequencing of cards a little more interesting than the Lost Cities card game.   There might be a little more luck here, but that doesn't bother me in the least.   The production is nice looking and overall this already has more appeal to me than the vanilla card game.   It's hard to explain - there's not a whole lot more here, and yet the game is far more interesting in this format.

Seemed okay, but: 
1) Three rounds takes too long and feels too repetitive.
2) A terrible initial hand is hard to recover from.
3) It feels less tense than Lost Cities. Why?
3A) It's often better to rush to pick up treasure tiles before others. That means, unlike in the card game, you won't find yourself collecting colors for a while and feeling as much pressure about playing them.
3B) Tiles that give you immediate points can remove the tension of negative path spaces.
3C) Discarding cards seems to waste time, because playing cards almost always seems better, especially when everyone is racing for treasure tiles.

The awesomeness of the of the two player game expands to accommodate four.  This game does a good job of integrating cards and board together.  A lot of games with cards and boards usually feel driven by one or the other, but in this game, card play and board position seem to have near equal impact on each other.  It's the Yin/Yang of Card/Board games.  Wait, what?

Another weird thing about this game is that I seem to have a much better win to loss ratio when compared to other games.  I guess something about it speaks to the way I naturally think.

[b]Rating based on ‚Äì 10+ plays, 2 player[/b]
This is the 2-4 player board game based on the popular 2 player card game [thing=50][/thing], which is the inspiration for the re-themed game [thing=34585][/thing] and all of its spinoffs. [thing=66085][/thing] (later referred to as KdO) was the first game in the Lost Cities family I ever played and I really love it. It's beautiful, with a Celtic theme, there's a lot of variety, a race element, leprechauns...I mean, what's [i]not[/i] to love? Then I played Lost Cities and it was a bit of a letdown just because I found it was a bit too simple. There just wasn't enough going on for me. However, I was offered this in a trade and I jumped at the chance anyway. I wanted to compare it, and its exploration theme, to how KdO plays. Theme? What theme? It's a Knizia game so basically it's an abstract mathematical puzzle. :)  However, with that puzzle comes a heart pounding race through some gaudy jungle paths trying to discover up to 5...you guessed it...lost cities. Along the way you can earn victory point tokens, the right to advance any of your adventurers which can lead to some fun combo chains, and collect artifacts which earn you extra points at the end of the game. Initially I groaned when I read the rules and realised you had to play three rounds (the Keltis series is only one), but the cardplay is lightning fast so it clocks in at around 40-45 mins or so with 2 players. There is also an option to play the 'short game' which is only one round and has a shorter artifact track. This lasts about 15 mins in a 2 player game which is good if you need that Lost Cities fix, but the setup would be the same and it's a bit elaborate for such a short game.

Like the kids of a family that all share the same DNA, the three games resemble each other but all have their different personalities. I've played Lost Cities over 35 times and find it to be a simple, easy going relaxing game. I've never really felt any angst or tension but my win rate is really high (a little over 90%) so that might have something to do with it. KdO I've played over 75 times now and it's got a lot more going on ‚Äì you can play cards in ascending or descending order, you can move backward and forward along a spiral track to pick up points, you can move the Oracle to get more points, move your pieces strategically in order to get a leprechaun scoring bonus etc. - which gives you lots to think about, makes the game exciting and it's also different every time because of the modular setup. This game falls somewhere in the middle. Easy to learn and play, with the tension of trying to collect those artifacts before your opponent does, and not having the cards just at that moment to do so, and hoping the next card they play does not advance them...///whew!/// Then the game no longer ends just by depletion of the draw pile, but also if any 5 figures have crossed the bridges which means you need to keep your eyes on a couple of things. Tense moments indeed! I was initially worried that this would be too similar to KdO, and while we don't really [i]need[/i] it, we find it enjoyable with a different enough feel to keep it.

There is an official variant in the rules that allows you to play Keltis style in either ascending or descending order.  I've decided to stick to the basic ascending only rule on this one if only just to differentiate the games slightly. Luck of the draw is mitigated by a couple of things in this game ‚Äì first, if you don't get the cards to continue advancing down a path, then you can use the cards you [i]do[/i] have to advance along other paths and use the bonus movement tokens to advance any pawn; secondly, once you have reached the final spot on a path (the lost city), you can continue playing cards of that colour to advance any other pawn. As the tiles you can earn along the jungle paths are single sided, there is also the option to keep them face down on the board until somebody 'discovers' them by landing on that stepping stone. I haven't done it yet but it might be something for future plays. On the one hand you don't have that relentless pursuit for artifacts or the high point tiles, but on the other it probably would be just a random luckfest and remove the last (only?) element of strategy from the game.

Captures and converts original Lost Cities to a 4 player board game extremely well - as you'd expect from Knizia.  What we get is a really good game but it does lack a bit of soul and the graphics even have a washed out 'ghostly' look so that there is almost the shadow of a theme/story here.

Great first game - all really liked it when they got into it; not as confusing as it first seems; good for colour, picture and number coordination; more challenging and strategic than it seems - played with 6, 10 and 13 yr old girls and they got on with it. The game speeded up at the end with the girls desperate for each other to give up a card they needed. Bit of a diamond in the rough!

It has the flavour of LC for sure and I like that. However, I'm thoroughly convinced now that I hate when lengthy games try to balance for the luck factor by making you play it three times over and compiling the results. In the LC card game this works because the game plays quick. With the Board Game, you really feel like you have your fill by the end of the first round. Can't imagine wanting to play more than one round; problem is knowing that one round isn't enough to mitigate the luck in the card draws. Hmmm... Nice idea but I wish Knizia worked a little harder on using a savvy movement mechanic with a more decent board game.

Trash. I sold Lost Cities & kept this, but I should've done it the other way around. Lost Cities kept it tense. This game takes longer, seems to bog down, and is far less exciting to the point where after a few turns, I just never cared (after repeated plays). Although the board is nice to look at.

Update: Sold this. Just too simplistic & not enough excitement. Good game for youngters, though (or non-gamer families), but nothing here for gamers or even casual gaming adults

Everyone I play with loves this game.  It is very easy to teach and fun to play.  Not a deep game, but you know that going in.  There are enough choices to be made, even though the game is pretty luck driven.  There is also good player interaction in that you can rush someone along a path to stay ahead of you before they are comfortable doing so.
I have just gotten this game and have only played with 4 players.  Hopefully it is also fun with 2 players.

I spent a lot of time trying to decide if I wanted Lost Cities or Keltis.  I had read that some felt the Lost Cities board had "ugly" artwork, other thought it was fine.  Ultimately I selected the theme I thought would appeal to my kids the most.  I'm very glad we chose Lost Cities.  We get lots of requests for this game & while it's not actually educational about the different ruins my oldest is studying them this year so she spouts out tid bits of knowledge every time we play.  Only had 1-2 months & it's had over 20 plays.

Was on the fence about keeping this and glad I kept it long enough to play it. It's lacks a little tension of the original game towards the end, but it's a nice game of cat and mouse for timing. I think this is an excellent gateway game, and it ends up being less mathy which to me is a plus.

The Keltis-like variant where each expedition can be played ascending or descending is [i]not[/i] recommended.  It removes some of the luck, yes, but also removes a lot of the decisionmaking and tension.  And the tension is already disappointingly low compared to Lost Cities.

Love the mechanics of this streamlined game. So simple and effective to play. Gets a bit busy sometimes that you forget where you are on the board if you have all four of your figures out. Its part race, part treasure hunt, part card game. I like the way the game feels, mixing these mechanics together. Its surprising what a fun game this is. Not particularly deep, but tactical. The luck factor is high, and can be frustrating sometimes when you keep drawing cards you don't need, ending up with heaps of useless cards in you hand, but can't necessarily discard because an opponent will grab them. However sometimes if you are patient at the beginning and wait for some better cards you can catch up. But beware of waiting too long so that other players get ahead and grab all the good stuff. A good shuffle before the game and in between the rounds is essential. We play this game in 60 to 90 minutes with 3 players.

Played 5+ times. I wouldn't think of playing this with gamers. One for the family. A set of 3 hands takes about 90 mins. It is very luck dependant. Has some of the tension of the card game but more luck. Nov 09. *UPDATE* having now played both ways I prefer playing with the ascending / descending sets rule from Keltis. I am also tweaking my rating up to a 7 as the game has made for some happy family sessions which has to be rewarded. Jan 10

This is a pretty much perfect adaptation of the rules of Lost Cities to three and four players.  I don't think it's quite as fun with more players, but it's still a good game and I was surprised to see how well it adapted.  Two-player Lost Cities is pretty random already, though, and this one is even moreso.

A very good adaptation of Lost Cities for multiple players. It has the same basic card mechanics, but with added bonuses along the way. I was a little bothered by the randomness of the bonus tokens, but that's just part of the game. I think this would make an excellent gateway game.

Knizia does it again. Lost Cities was great, and this is better--not only because it supports more players, but also just because it's better. There's a race element, some set collection, less math, less luck, and more ability to control the endgame.

Very similar to Lost Cities, but I like the addition of artifacts and other tiles. The ability to play with more people is also a plus. I think I prefer the explorer meeples to the handshake cards as well. In general, it's just a little step above Lost Cities, which admittedly is chancey and has a pasted-on theme. This game also suffers from those problems, but it's a good family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is very similar to the original 2-player Lost Cities card game, but with a few additions that make it a fun multi-player game.  There is a variant where you can start each pile from 0 and go up or start from 10 and go down (your choice) -- I like playing with that rule, to avoid the problems of having a bad starting hand.

When teaching this to a new player, it's probably a good idea to point out that winning many artifacts isn't the goal of the game.  Playing the Researcher (double-score meeple) on the track for which you have the most cards is advisable, to try to get the maximum 100 points for finishing that track.  Also, you don't need as many cards in that suit if you pick a track with several "forward arrow" tiles.  Note that if you reach the end of a track, you can still play cards in that suit -- they will allow you to move forward one of your pieces on any other track!

A nice, light, card game at heart. The board game gives it a nice visual touch, and the wooden explorers are great.

If you liked the original Lost Cities, there little to recommend this one, but if you have this game, you can halve the deck, take the 5 Zero cards from one, and play the original Lost Cities (using the 0,0, and 1 cards of each suit as investment cards).

Two games in one!

RATING: 8
(10/10/2009) This is the 3-4 player version of the 2-player game. The 2-player game is in itself an interesting card game, where Bridge-like card playing tactics of finesse, ducking, the hold-up, and others come into play. The board game takes that and adds a spatial dimension by making it into a race game, as well as adding the dynamics of up to two more players. The five types of expeditions are the same, but now the cards advance explorer meeples down the path of progressively increasing scores. There are three rounds, just like the card game, and each round ends when five meeples have crossed a bridge that is on each expedition path. There are random element tokens distributed on the paths, such as extra points, extra movement, or amulets. The amulets are scored at the end of the three rounds, as the more you have, the more you score. Of course, there is a good chunk of randomness, on how the cards and tokens pan out, but the more skilled player will usually win. It's still a good, quick, satisfying game. Initial rating "8".

Aw, great‚Äînow I can take the same drubbing I get in normal [i]Lost Cities[/i] (at the hands of my beautiful wife) and have her chain combos on a freakin' board!

I won the first game as she was coming to grips with the new mechanics, then lost the second game soundly in what I expect will become my lot in this game...

[i]And all that gin back at the Explorer's Club does nothing to silence the screams of my men...[/i]

UPDATE:  What a great, tense game.  As much as I enjoy it as a 2-player with my wife & a glass of wine (fine babe + fine wine + fine game = fine time) it really shines as a 4-player... shines like the glint off a scalpel 'neath the harsh lights of an operating theater with leather straps and no anesthesiologist.  Maybe you can get a leg free and kick but no one's gonna hear you scream.

The card game is probably a bit better, though this can offer a little variety and can help players score visually. Also allows up to 4 players.

Mar09: I think it's a fairly faithful adaptation of the card game. The art really is gorgeous.

I think I still enjoy the original 2-player card game more just for it's beautiful simplicity and tension, but this does make a good adaptation.

Picking up the artifacts in particular was a good bit of push your luck. You wanted to hang back and play cards in the perfect order. But it often paid to surge up with sloppy card play and gobble the artifacts. Tough choices and a good game.

Although it also seemed to be a little too calculatable at times.  All of the marginal rewards were explicitly laid out.  What wasn't laid out, was what cards you were going to draw and who would grab the artifacts first.

I'll keep it around to try with the family for the time being.

Decent fun unless you get a horrible card draw. Recommend the "up or down" variant to help address that.

Very simple game with some moderate theming.  You play teams of archeologists.  You advance your teams up paths to one of four lost cities by playing number cards, four colors for four cities.  You can only play a card that has a higher number than what you've already played.  The farther they move up, the more points you score.  I generally don't hate playing but am left thinking I could have played something else.  Mostly play when someone else wants to play.  Good for non-gamers I think.

Luck of the card draw in the first two rounds was brutal for me my first game.  I got lucky enough in the third round to come back for second place, but I still had a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning of the game.  Update: The second game was better, as I had decent luck in the first round and great luck in the second, enough to make up for an unremarkable third round.  So maybe not to bad if luck isn't totally against you.

Like Lost Cities, but the decision tree is a bit larger, with a similar sense of risk/reward.  I like using the Keltis rules, as it makes card screwage less of an issue, and also forces you to pay more attention to other players regarding dumping cards.

If I'm going to pull a board out, I would prefer to play a game with some substance.

Initial rating: 5.0 (July 2013)

Regular game. It certainly retains The Lost Cities spirit, but it is too light for my taste. The decisions are fairly obvious, so it is mostly luck that decides if you score high or not. It has way more luck than the parent game, also a lot less tension.

The game components are nice and the game look gorgeous when all the meeples are on the game board. The game is pretty easy to teach, but the game time is too long for what the game offers.

Bottom line, I prefer the shorter two player game than this one, I would not refuse another play but I won‚Äôt actively seek more plays of this.

Lost Cities the Board Game is a family game that has you playing cards with incomplete information in the hopes of progressing your dudes along 1-5 paths. The paths are randomly seeded with bonus tiles(+ points, gain artifacts or + advancement) and shooting for the bonuses may have you playing cards to a line before getting the cards you'd prefer to play. I have been fooling around with a Keltis phone app for about a year, so I knew exactly what this was before I played it. This version has a few rules tweaks from Keltis, but I still use the Keltis rule of card runs going either up or down - mostly because it gives you a bit more choice in how to play. Other differences is that this version is played over three rounds and artifacts only score at the end of the 3rd round. It's not a terribly exciting game by any means, merely pleasant, just like the original card game.

The good: Easier to score keep score than the original Lost Cities and plays up to four.

The bad: This game really makes me feel tense when I don't get a good hand. I don't like the fact that an entire round can be ruined by the opening hand. Furthermore, the randomness of the tiles hinders the use of tactics.

However, I still enjoy it and it is one of my fianc√©e's favorites. For a 2p game, I would recommend playing the card game instead, but the board game is fun for 3-4.

I think I like Lost Cities: The Board Game more than Keltis, but I'm not sure why.  I don't really care about the ascending/descending card play, as you can implement that rule without a problem.  I guess thematically LC:TBG makes a lot more sense, though on the flip side the graphic design of Keltis is much more appealing.  It is probably the point structure of LC:TBG that I like - for some reasons that games tend to be closer (Keltis was almost always a blowout, with highly disparate scores), and having higher scores makes it feel like you're being more productive.  I don't know, it all looks pretty stupid when I type it out.  I'm hoping that the Keltis expansion can help to differentiate the two games for me.  If I was to teach some new players, I would probably go for Lost Cities: the Board Game.  Still not as good as the original Lost Cities though!

Update: When you add the expansion to Keltis, I would much rather play Keltis than Lost Cities: the Board Game.

Theme and decision-making is just present enough to hold my interest, though 3-round game is tedious due to the lack of depth, so we always play the 1-round variant (still use ascending only, as asc/desc variant feels too forgiving and adds too much to remember for the little ones).

Bought from Essen 2008. Even better than the two player card game -edition. Still light, still easy to play, still fun => I bougth my own copy right away. I've played this lately more (I mean a lot) AND we have a winner here! What a great game. This Rio Grande version is better one than the Keltis edition. RG-edition looks better, works better and there are short & long -game possibilities.

LC had better graphic design (also Keltis does have a more appealing graphic presentation even with its abstract 'theme').
The 'only advancing numbers' rule does create more tension than in Keltis but increases the luck factor just too much (unlike in the original card game where you didn't have such a serious disadvantage when your starting hand consisted of only high cards).
At the same time it's easier to discard cards in this one so that happens quite often.
Not a bad one but I definitely prefer the Keltis version - still quite tense and a lot less luck-dependent - over this one.

I'm a major Knizia fan, but this is simply a failed attempt at porting Lost City to a group game.  It doesn't really work, is frustrating and tend to make players bitter and antagonistic.  There's worst, but it's not a good game.

Happily and unexpectedly, I enjoy the Lost Cities redesign look better than that of Keltis.

The cards are of crap quality; everything else is fine. The cards work fine, though!

We use 5 poker chips labeled 1-5, plus a zero chip, and stack these in the center of the board in order with the zero on top. We remove a chip each time an adventurer crosses a bridge. The game would have benefited from an extra component like this to help keep track.

We have gone back to the 'standard' mechanic of only going up - you may only add a card to a path which is equal or higher, never less than. This has more fun tension and everyone else's situation is easier to judge.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play.  The boardgame captures the excruciating decisions in the two-player game, and then adds a race element which spices up the decision-making.  On top of that, the bonus tiles provide a layer of tactics.  I played poorly, but have been able to mull over my missteps and understand the shortcomings in my play.  While there is luck - any game where one draws cards does - luck does not dictate the outcome.  Like its two-player counterpart, Lost Cities: the Boardgame is about risk management and how you can make the best of a bad hand.  The boardgame takes the solid mechanic of the two-player game and spices it up with additional elements without getting in the way of the central mechanic.  Instead, these additional elements complement it.

An excellent and under-rated game on the Geek.  Many folks talk about the two player Lost Cities but I like this game better.  The great thing about the American edition is you can play with Keltis rules or Lost Cities rules.  (i.e. You can go with numbers going up or down).  You advance by placing similar colored cards on a track until you cannot place any more and score based on how far you advanced.  Very fun and very family friendly.  Keltis and by extension Lost Cities the Board Game was a very deserving Spiel des Jahres winner.  

I do play with a house rule where all the tiles are discovered as you go rather than flipped up.

10/2012 It's basically a 4 player version of the original "Lost Cities".  But the conversion doesn't seem whole hearted: There's way too many bits and pieces, confusing a rough graphics and a mash of tack-on mechanics.  A revised edition will probably play better.

While I get that "push-your-luck" is one of Knizia's tropes, it feels like there's maybe a bit too much luck in this game at times, although it is still fun.

Don't particularly care for this game.
I felt frustrated the whole time because you feel like you have almost no control on the cards you are able to work with and its almost always a let down when you draw a card. Other players expressed this as well. 
Plus, the added luck of what pieces you flip over on route to the wonder also compounds the frustration.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Players use cards to move their explorers up paths of different colors. The farther up each path they make it, the more points their journey is worth.

Played as: 2,3 player

Pros: Takes the Lost Cities card game formula and makes it playable for up to four people.

Cons: Lost in the conversion seems to be the tightness and pace of the game as well as the shred of significant interaction there was. The way cards no longer have an "either mine or yours" point value (due to multiples of identical value cards) makes the game feel a little more 'blah' and decisions become way easier to make.

Other: I still want to play with four players to see if it's a tighter game that way. With two, it was way to easy to move your pieces along; and three, there still wasn't a sense of stepping on each others toes. I also don't know if my feeling for this game is affected by my long standing burnout of the original card game.

Best Use: A way to let Lost Cities (the card game) fans play with more people.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/418675]Lost Cities Review: Even your girlfriend will play this![/url]

This game just doesn't fit my tastes.  However, I think in the right group this is a fine game to play.  I think that the board game, by adding additional people and extra elements on the paths, made an improvement upon the original card game for 2 players.  It is still a game largely based on luck.

In lost cities, the board game, you have some explorers and 5 different colored paths to choose for your explorations.  The cards in your hand, always 8, will determine with paths to go down.  The first few spaces on each path are actually negative points, so you only want to start a path if you feel like you will make it into some positive points.  There are two of each card, numbered from 0-10 in each color.  In order to progress along a path you must play a card in that color of equal or higher value than the last card you played for the path.  So you want to start your paths with low numbers and slowly place higher and higher numbers to progress along the path and give yourself enough room to get to the end if possible.  The other element is that one of your explorers is larger, researcher I think, than the others.  That meeple will score double points wherever he ends up.  So you want to get him all the way to the lost city on the path you start him on if possible.

This game is great for non-gamers, or people who want a high amount of luck in the game.  There are a few "strategies" to be learned, but those should be picked up within the first round of play, the full game is played over three rounds.

I give this game a 3 because I don't like luck-based games, at least not this much.  I will rarely, if ever, suggest to play this game.  However, I guess in the right setting, it might be the best option for the people involved.

Tried for the first time yesterday. As much as the board spaces with the tokens that flip and allow for combos is sort of cool, by adding a second card of each type, and simplifying the scoring, the game significantly loses all of it's ooomph. In the card game, much of the tension of play came from trying to weigh whether to skip a number and play a higher card or wait it out in favor of drawing or having your opponent discard it. Now it seems like the whole experience has literally been reduced to the luck of the draw, and the overall fiddliness made me irritated more than engaged. Overall, more bits + more rules = less thinking & strategy. I think I will stick to the classic two-player card game.

Another gem from Reiner Knizia.  Earn points by placing columns of colored "expedition cards" valued from 2 to 10 points in up to 5 separate columns.  But wait--each new card you place must have a higher value.  Feeling lucky?  Start with a wager card and double the points earned in your column.  Feeling really lucky?  Lay down 2 or 3 wager cards to triple or quadruple your score.  Then watch the draw deck dwindle as you wait for that one card you need (likely held by your opponent) to end up above 20 points for that column. End up below 20 points?  You go negative since every column you start has an expedition cost of 20 applied at the end of the game. Going negative with a wager card is bad as you multiply that negative score by 2x, 3x, or 4x.  That negative score likely erases all the positive scores in your other columns and you lose by some ridiculous total. Your opponent smiles.  You vow revenge.  You curse Knizia. That's a solid game my friends.

RATING: 7
In this 2-4 player game, the board shows five different colors of paths. There is a deck of cards, with the five different colors, with numbers ranging from 0 to 10, twice, in each suit. Players play cards from lowest to highest to move their token on the corresponding colored path. Each path space also contains the number of victory points, which get higher and higher as a player's token gets higher up the path. Some of the spaces on the paths have bonus tokens such as idols, or advance one of your tokens on any path further one step, or a number of VPs (5, 10 or 15). The first player to get to an idol removes it, and idols count towards your total depending how many of them you have. Play three games, and sum all idols and points earned to determine the overall winner. 

It's a fun game, and easy to learn. There are tough decisions to make and it plays quickly as well.

We played once and all agreed that while not awful, the experience was completely forgettable.  It struck us all as much more luck driven than Lost Cities.  With very few exceptions, all of us started down all 5 paths on all expeditions, and points were only lost a couple of times - and actually, those may have actually broken even or come out a little ahead thanks to the gains made on the victory point spaces.  Generally, there was no impetus whatsoever to discard cards unless you know your opponents couldn't use them.  Needing only 4 cards played to score some positive points pointed towards just throwing them down in your play area rather than giving them to an opponent.

All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but it won't be coming back off the shelf again.

What works well in a light 2 player format doesn't translate so well to 3 or 4 players. With more players, there's rarely safe discards so players are encouraged to play more in hope - just play the cards you get and hope for more of that colour later, and hoping you can avoid the colours of the player on your right. Resulting in less decision tension. In retrospect, the winner invariably received a lucky run of cards to maximise their suit, so this game resigns itself to braindead filler time territory, where it's certainly pleasant enough.

This plays very different from Lost Cities (the card game) but is still similar enough that it satifies my craving for it. This plays 2-4 players, which tells me that the game play is different depending on the number of players since the deck is finite. I wish I grew up with this game.

Quality colorful board game with cards and chits. Good feel. Quick plays for people that understand how it works. Still, pasted on Knizia theme. Awesome that a Keltis-like variant is in the rules.

I wish an expansion would be made for LC-TBG similar to Keltis:Neue Wege, Neue Ziele.

I will keep this if I can find people who like Lost Cities like I do. I find this a little boring for me as just a 2 player game.

RATING: 7
A good game, and I think it improves on the original card game in several ways. The spatial meeple paths are nice, and the reward tokens are interesting. Plus of course it handles 4p which is very nice.

Our first 3p game ran 90 minutes, but I suspect 60 is a more realistic target once you know the game. I would generally do a one-expedition short game with new players.

For me it is pretty good, but not great. My wife would not like it because much of the game is about holding back, delaying until you get the cards that you need, or at least cards which help guide what you should do. She is a proactive person who doesn't like to wait around for things to unfold.

Weight of 1.8 seems about right.

I know many people say the card game is better. I never played the card game and amazon had this on sale for prime day. Couldn't pass it up. I can't compare it, but it seems almost the same. Except for the large pawn representing investments. If I understand right, the big difference is you can invest multiple times in the card game, whereas in the board game you only have that 1. I don't understand how this could make the gameplay so drastically different. I find it does play well 2 player, and if more players want to jump in, there is now that option.

A decent family game of about the same complexity as Ticket to Ride.  Can be a bit too luck dependent at times and poor discards by a player can hand the game to a certain player which can be a problem with 3 or 4 players. I think I like the 2 player card game version of this game much better than this.

This game still feels like Lost Cities, but it allows more players and gets rid of the annoying end-game arithmetic (for the most part).  A lot of your game will depend on the luck of the draw, but it's still interesting managing your expeditions and knowing when to try to cause the end of the game (or at least, try to figure out when your opponents are).  Interesting game.

I like Lost Cities card game, where this version is a good implementation of a board game version.  The play is similar with the increasing value and not discarding to your opponents, however now allows three-four players.  I like the racing aspect on the paths as well.  I believe it improves Keltis.

The game isn't as quick and portable like Lost Cities and has a similar gameplay.

Update:  I wanted this to be something it was not.  Keltis is better as a light game or gateway game.  Funny how a few minor rule changes make the difference.

Old:  I like this as an intro game for people, except that I feel like it goes a little too long as a 4 player.  I feel like it needs to be 1 or 2 rounds.  Otherwise, it's beautiful and colorful and has the same enjoyable feeling of balancing risk and reward as Lost Cities the card game.

Finally I got to play this at my local meetup today. As expected it plays well and isn't too overly complicated so it was a SDJ winner. (Keltis) It feels exactly like Lost Cities but has more going on than the original game with the inclusion of bonus tiles. It plays a little bit differently because the numbers can duplicate and also the game feel more like a race game than the original game. I feel this is worthy to own if my Lost Cities gets traded in the MT.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I prefer lost cities, but this can deliver the same tough decisions from more than two. Frustrating when your stuck with high cards. I'll have to try the Keltis rules, but I fear that would make it too simple. Usually best to do the best you can and hope for a better hand next round.

Surprisingly good enhancement of Lost Cities card game that adds some more strategy to the game. Extra moves, special items and bonus points means that the game can be quite competitive when playing with more than 2 players. Yet it is still easy and family-friendly for any table. Not a great game, but a good light game.

Yep, the cardplay that makes Lost Cities so enjoyable and addictive is still there: the holding off and speculating of narrowing the gaps in the sequence, the silent kick in the pants when you draw the card value you've passed. But if you felt the pressure in the cardgame as the drawpile depleted, Keltis pushes you in the back for a couple of reasons: now there is a second game end condition to look out for and there are stones to pick up otherwise you lose points, and with others breathing down your neck for these means you feel more forced to jump large gaps in the sequence. But the more interesting thing about the boardgame variant is that there are a couple of things to overcome a bad hand: you can go backwards sequentially, there are spots on the board to move any scoring marker up and likewise if you play cards for markers at the end of that path. Add to this that the game is far easier to score than it's convoluted predecessor makes no surprise why this won SdJ.

Update: Finally played the Lost Cities edition and glad I waited for the theme is better, the board is functional for discards and drawpile (though alittle busy). Gone is the scoretrack to be replaced with victory point coins paid out during and at game end. Uniquely, scoring for the artifacts is catered for either a single or 3 games. Also reverted back to the original rules and play in ascending order only which greatly improves the tension and quickens the game and card play.

I find myself enjoying the play of this game more than the card game it was based on.  I just wish that the setup time wasn't quite so long.  It gets irritating having to fill out all the chits on the board.

But then again that's what I like.  I enjoy the fact that you get bonuses at random intervals, and how you can plan for them and it will effect your strategy and what colors you go for.  I also like that you can start your color in either direction, which really helps alleviate getting draw-screwed.

I actually got this game by accident; I asked my Girlfriend to goto our local games store (Mind Games Albury) to buy Lost Cities (the card game version) and this is what she picked up.

I was originally going to exchange it for the one I was after, but after reading a couple reviews online about the board game version, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I really like it. My Girlfriend and I love the artwork (especially the board, it looks fantastic!). She quite enjoyed trying to collect the right cards to advance along the different tracks.

One thing I didn't like about it was the fact that the victory point coins are different sizes according to their denomination (they are turned upside down after you get them to keep the scoring a secret, but because of the different sizes it's possible to sit there and work it out).

I wish there was a little more strategy involved, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit, and the Girlfriend loved it, which is definitely a plus!

A pretty fun filler game.  I originally rated this a 5 and had it up for trade.  After more plays (and changing the rules a little) I am upgrading to a 7.  The rules have you play or discard a card first and then draw, which we just could not get used to.  We changed it to draw a card and then play or discard.  This little change really improved the game play.  Over all good game.

The game is all luck at the beginning.  If you draw good cards then youll do stuff. Most of the turns involve trading cards in and doing nothing.  How is that fun?  The draw a card at end of turn leads to frustration and lack of involvement.  Negative points for playing also hinder anyone who starts the game with bad cards.  Unlike Catan, the game is pretty much settled at the beginning--- so why play?

Think Rummy mixed with archaeology. Manipulating your cards so that you can lay them out by color in ascending order is the trick to this game. As you play a card, you move one of your explorers down a path toward one of five fabled lost cities, scoring points in the process. This game is a fantastic gateway game with a really pretty board and components. It's the game that introduced me to the world of modern boardgaming.

Yes, if you really want to play Lost Cities with more than 2 players, you can play this, but otherwise it is not as good as the card game, which I don't like that much either.  My wife, who really likes the card game, did not like the board game.  I don't like the Knizia mechanic of bonus tiles you collect along the scoring track - it really adds nothing to the game and just helps the leader.  He added this mechanic to Carcassone: the Castle as well - I really like this game, but we always play without the bonus tiles on scoring track.

Luck based with less tension playing with four players than with two. The Keltis: Das Kartenspiel game is easily the best in this family of Knizia games.

Way better than [i]Lost Cities[/i], not only because of the nicer graphics but specially because of the strategy that the tiles add.  A lot more options, now it feels that players control the game, not that the game plays them, as the original did. Comparing with [i]Keltis[/i], they are esencially the same, but I think that maybe the more sober graphic design of [i]Keltis[/i] adds to its appeal and helps newbies to give it a try.

This is a decent gateway game with a tons of (bad) luck, some strategy, and easy gameplay.  It is not overly complicated and works well for a social game night with non gamers, or families.

It's just too easy to have a bad game because of cards drawn.  I don't mind luck as a determining factor in games persay, but going from scoring 50 pts in one and to 500 the next just shows how much card draw plays into the game, and not in a good way.

Basically, I have this in my collection in case I need to play a REALLY simple board game with non-gamers (or my parents who like it for some reason).  Otherwise I don't care for it at all.

The board game loses the frequent tense moments in the card game.  Leaving out the number values as a means of scoring essentially kills strong motivation to discard cards.  Now simply any 4 of a color (or less) can grant points.  The game is simply then an analysis of the tiles and determining if diversification or specialization is ideal and hope you get the right random cards.  I've lost interest after a few plays.

The Lost Cities card game goes multiplayer and some of the "ack, I don't want to play ANY card -- can I pass???" is mitigated a smidge. Decent game although I haven't brought it to the table in a while.

RATING: 8
If you like the 2p card game, check this.  Keeps the same tension and anxiety alive, but can play with 4.  Sweet!

Although it still works as a 2 player, I'd usually prefer the original card game if you've only got one other player at hand.  It seems with the boardgame that both players will successfully score positive points on all 5 expeditions, which detracts from the tension.  This isn't the case though with 3 or 4 players, which is the sweet spot for this game.

[9 plays] I enjoy the original Lost Cities. This board game version with the ability to play with up to 4 people is really cool.

I love the chit system that varies the scoring tracks from round to round. There are many variables to consider between the green chits, the bonus steps, and the blue extra money tiles. We play the official variant that you can play cards in increasing or decreasing order (per the Keltis rules).

I also love the artwork and theming of the Lost Cities version.

#68 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This implements Lost Cities into a full board game really well. You still have the struggle of drawing colored cards and playing them in order. But you're advancing people with those cards on colored tracks of the board to collect items that are worth various points. You can scoop some items from your opponents by advancing before them. It's still light and easy to learn. It just has a few more things going on than the card game. I like it a lot more.

It's like playing Keltis, except:
- 3 rounds, scoring artifacts only at the end of the game (keep track of # earned each round)
- all point values are multiplied by 5
- in the basic game you can only play cards in ascending order; a variant allows play in either direction.

Pretty colors and bits but it is a little harder to see what is happening at a glance. Also, I'm not certain whether I prefer the basic game, or the Keltis-like variant.

An excellent game for young children or simple minds, but terrible for anyone over the age of about 7.  One of my members in my gaming club saw this and picked it up based on the title without figuring out what the gameplay was about.  He realized his mistake and will be more careful next time.

Overall, there is nothing bad about the game, but there is really nothing to the game, either.  All you do is try to play low cards of 5 different suits in order to progress your pieces as far along the path as possible to score points.  The higher the card you play, the less likely you will be able to play an equal or higher card to move further along the path.  Extremely simple and incredibly boring.  I guess this would also be good for people who don't like to think when they play games, but those people tend to be boring, anyway.

[RGG 'Lost Cities: the board game' 08 edition] {Adventure; set collection, drafting, risk-taking; scalable} LC:tBG is a good conversion of the card game :) and it's an enjoyable family game. It keeps the tension of the 2p card game and supports up to 4 players.  

The rule is straight forward and intuitive.  It is easy to learn and teach.  The theme is marginally executed, even though it's an abstract game in essence.  The game is interactive enough to be fun - in the sharing of discard piles, collection of artifacts and sudden game end.  A typical game takes around 45 minutes and there is little down time.  Replayability is good due to the random card draws.  So far, I enjoy every game and don't feel bored.  I like this game!

LC:tBG is both tactical and strategic.  Players have to make meaningful tactical decisions in the luck of card draw and layout of the board to optimize their score each round.  It's strategic because players have to plan well how to collect artifacts for good bonus.  Luck is an influential factor but it's not a deciding factor.

The quality of game components is good but it would be nicer if player markers are provided.  The game board is nicely illustrated.  It is colorful but it will be nicer if there are more graphic variations on each path - it's pedestrian that all 5 paths look the same with color boxes.  The card illustration is not as interesting as the card game.  It just shows different size of the archeology sites while the card game presents an advancement of the adventure.  Umm, the victory chips are bad - if the rules intends to hide victory point, why they make chips of different size?

[Keltis] IMHO, LC:tBG is a superior game than Keltis.  It is more exciting to play cards only in increasing value.  It is also less luck dependent and more competitive with 3-rounds of play.

This was our first designer game and both my husband and I really enjoy it. It was very quick to learn, and we like the combination of card/board game together. I can see why so many experienced gamers often recommend this as a gateway - we look forward to playing with Mom and friends.

* Easy to learn and teach

Goodbye Lost Cities, hello the board game!  I love how this takes a 2-player game and makes it work for 4.  The paths will always be different because of the way the bonus tiles are laid out.  I also love the step bonus tile as it can really help you get out of a jam.  The artifacts are cool too.

I also think the board is quite nice to look at.

A little more than Lost Cities for 2-4: you can also score by collecting artifacts and by hitting bonus spaces; also extra move spaces are available. These extra mechanisms are on chits that are randomized for each round. Scoring is much simpler than Lost Cities, and coins are provided to keep score.

Very similar to Keltis, in which I prefer the theme and some minor gameplay elements - enough to keep this as a separate entry, but I've considered combining them. 

The hidden bonuses are interesting but I prefer having them open for all to see (as in Keltis) because it makes for more tactical decisions and less luck.

Decent entry/family light worker-placement game where you play cards in order to move your workers forward ans score points. Simple, fun and quick game, which has the addition of having the Keltis rules (play cards ascending or descending) and being able to play three adventures consecutively. Some light strategy elements and limited player interaction a lot of it comes down to the luck in which cards you draw. I feel that the mechanic where you can discard a card to the bank could have been realised better.

Only one play so far, perhaps too soon to judge, but I was disappointed. The components are nice enough, but the tension of the two player game was missing. I'm also not sure I like the tokens that need to be shuffled after every expedition and distributed randomly. It seems like something extra for the sake of something extra. Perhaps it's required to lessen the impact of a bad hand, but I think I might prefer the game if there were no tokens at all. Perhaps I'll try that one of these days.

RATING: 7
Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.

RATING: 7
I enjoy most Knizia games, and Lost Cities still rank relatively high on my two-player list. However, the ascending set collection aspect of Lost Cities makes the game moderately luck driven. It is true that if your starting hand is loaded with high cards, the game gets excruciating to play since card play does not flow smoothly and you get penalized for discarding cards that your opponents will gleefully capitalize.  With the two player game in Lost Cities, discarding high cards does not always backfire since your opponent may not have any of the requisite lower numbered cards to start the track and hence giving you the opportunity for clever game play to either pick up the card in later rounds or hide the card by discarding other cards on the pile. In this four player version, most of what you discard early will be picked up. Plus, discarding a card is essentially a lost turn which turns out to be a bigger disadvantage since there is a "race" aspect on each track to collect the artifact tokens. Hence, the ascending ladder game play in LCTBG just feels like the wrong mechanic for four players. In one particular round, I may have a favorable card draw and can easily place cards while in subsequent rounds, I can barely play any decent cards and my score swings wildly. Thus, players are being penalized for no fault of their own other than card draw. Extremely frustrating. Now, on the flip side, the Keltis variant offers players the choice of both ascending and descending set collection. This largely solves the frustration described above since players now have the latitude to play high numbered cards while waiting for a more favorable card draw. However, this comes at a cost: the tension for drawing and waiting for cards is essentially sacrificed. No one discard cards early and even during later phases of the game, only a few cards are ever discarded. In addition, the race in each track feels more competitive as most players have some ability to move down multiple tracks. Thus, the race aspect feels more contested. However, game play is significantly shorter as it is easier to get five explorers across the bridge instead of the original rules where it is more likely that players exhaust the draw deck. The wait for a better draw of cards is riskier. I am still on the fence as to which version is better for LCTBG. Perhaps different variants for different groups of folks.

Updated comment:  Downgraded to a six.  After finally playing Keltis rules and Das Orakel as well I finally saw the flaws in this game.  

My biggest complaints about this game are:

1. It's just too fiddly compared to other variations (Keltis).  Placing the tokens on the board, handing out scores, etc. adds nothing to the game.

2.  The scoring is over the top needless work. Keltis scores are about one fifth of this game.  There's no reason to have a simple game like this with scores in the hundreds with dozens of little chits to add up. 

Yes, you can play Keltis rules with LC: TBG.  The problem is still the scoring.  On a Keltis board you have a score track, here you have to deal with the scoring chits.  A hassle.  I prefer the artwork of LC:TBG, but I prefer the simplicity of Keltis.

******
Initial view:
Add me to the group of people who think this is the underrated gem and the 2 player card version is boring and overrated. More decisions, more tactics, more interaction. Quite simply, more fun. And it's a far better gateway game than Ticket to Ride. My rating is based on that - family gateway. Definitely not a strategic game nor, as usual of Knezia, does it have a strong theme.

Definitely thought the board game aspect of this was a good addition to the card game we already like. I was afraid it would feel shoehorned or fiddly, but it wasn't. I think the only part I didn't like what rearranging the artifacts/bonus tiles around every round. But other than that, it was easy set up and learning, some strategy but not too heavy.

Maybe something was lost in transferring this to a board game. Usually I like more complexity in a game, but here I'm not sure that anything was gained.

A very enjoyable surprise.  Despite loathing [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities]the card game[/url], this larger multiplayer version won me over.  There's a lot more discards to be had, and being able to play the table increases the strategy quite a bit.  The simple addition of randomized goals along the tracks, paired with a much simpler scoring system, make this game a much more enjoyable experience.  It's not revolutionary, but for a short light game, it's pretty good.

There do seem to be some differences in the game via the theme, the point values, and the tournament play, but taking away the "up or down" rule from Keltis takes a lot of strategy out of the game.  It certainly plays about the same, and the key to victory is, unfortunately, not something that players new to the game quite grasp -- the race element.  If another player gets farther along on the track ahead of you, you're going to have a hard time catching up and taking the tokens on those tracks.  Since the only way to get tokens then is to start another expedition, then it potentially puts you even further behind, since starting a new expedition costs you points.  It has some nice tensions, and it's easy enough to adopt the missing rule, so I figure this should get the same rating as Keltis.

A good game - exactly what you expect it to be.  Differences from the card game are: (1) easier scoring, (2) "bonus" chits that change dynamics of game.  

3 players is different than 4.  With 3, you reach the 5 men over the bridge end condition a lot.  With 4, you reach the end of the deck end condition.  I think it is slightly better with 3.

Not as good as Keltis.  Keltis sets the game for 1 hand rather than 3, and that is much better.

Fantastic family game. Lots of luck of the draw, but it plays fast and has lots of tension as the explorers one by one cross the bridges. Like the original "Lost Cities" card game, you always feel like you got a lousy draw, but somehow you have to make it work!

I like the feeling of progress as your explorers march down the path. It's very simple, I don't know why I like this so much, but it just makes me happy when I cross a bridge or grab an artifact or whatever.

The artwork is kind of garish and the scoring chips are a pain; too bad they didn't have a scoring track around the board instead. It's not like hidden scores matter much in a game this light with so few chances to screw your opponents.

I much prefer the Lost Cities rules to the Keltis rules. I find that forcing card stacks to increase  (instead of having the option of decreasing card stacks) adds more tension.

Not much of a game - its primary mechanic is unadulterated luck of the draw, with "not making dumb choices" coming in close second. Starting hands almost uniformly determine player progress in a round (there are multiple rounds, but each is a fresh start) because low cards are utterly kickass and getting dealt fewer of them means the player must either shaft themselves and start high or discard unusable cards, many of which are jackpot draws for other players. (One player's misfortune directly benefits his opponents.) Point scoring lazy, theme tacked on.

2009-03-05: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]¬†5¬†[/bgcolor][/b] Between the double deck, double the players, and unevenly distributed bonus tiles (i.e. the player who lucks into all of a certain color will do better than the others), this inflates the playtime, and deflates the joy of [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing].  I'm sorry to say it.  :(  I do think the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules are better:  Since the values of the cards only matter for sequencing (not for points as in [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing]), why not let a player choose her direction of play (which works quite well, and provides its own agonizing choices in [gameid=39704])?  ...and to play three rounds of a game that's already going to take several times as long?  No thanks.
If you're going to get this one, choose the look you like, then play by the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules; however, if your tastes match mine, play it once to convince yourself - and play it by the [thing=34585]Keltis[/thing] rules to convince yourself in 1/3 the time.

2011-04-09: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]¬†6¬†[/bgcolor][/b] This [u]is[/u] better playing by the [[thing=34585]Keltis[/thing]] variant that allows you to choose for each expedition whether it goes up or down.

2/12/09 -- Some pros and cons when compared with the 2-player original.  The objective tokens make a big difference in how the game is played.  Since the first player to advance along certain tracks will receive a bonus that later players will not, there is an incentive to respond to the other players' actions that is not present in the 2-player version.  This leads to some interesting dynamics between the players that can be rather subtle.  When playing with more than 2 players, you can also force tough choices on the other plays, sort of like you can in Ra.  For example, if I discard a red 5 that is of no value to the opponent to my immediate left, but is of value to the next player over, the player to my left has to choose whether to draw a useless card to keep it from the next player over or let him have it and go with the luck of the draw in hopes of getting something useful out of the deck.

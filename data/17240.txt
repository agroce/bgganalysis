RATING: 7.5
Fun dice rolling game which scales from 2 to 6 players well.  Everyone will have advice for the rolling player, but will have to be quite and hope that roller makes the wrong move. Very easy to learn and play.

RATING: 6.5
This is about as good as "roll-and-move" gets, which isn't saying much, yet still it's impressive in that the game has some strategy and control to it.

Essentially a set collection game, where each player rolls and then moves one of their own pawns (they have more than one, allowing for more options/control) or one of the guard pawns (depending if it can be moved).  When you have to move your pawn to leave a tile, you have to take it- this is good for some tiles, as they are positive points, but most tiles are negative points.  There are the coveted tiles that change negative to positive, allowing for more flexibility and tactics such as actually trying to secure that -10 tile, and then changing it to a positive tile.  

The verflixxt nochmal expansions (particularly the first one) are really must haves for this game- they add several tactical elements to the game which result in it actually having some moderate strategy as well as screwage.  There are also several variants that work well.  Basically I don't play this game without: Flixy, the orange exchange tiles, the worm tiles (all from Verflixxt nochmal), the green and red hats (from Verflixxt nochmal 2), and the variant for rolling 1's.  

Own the [boardgame=25645]nochmal[/boardgame] and [boardgame=31658]hoch 2[/boardgame] expansions.

Χαλαρό family game όπου ο κάθε παίκτης έχει 2-3 πιόνια και στη σειρά του ρίχνει ένα ζάρι και διαλέγει ποιο πιόνι του θα μετακινήσει. Στο setup φτιάχνουμε ένα μονοπάτι από πλακάκια πάνω στα οποία περπατούν τα πιόνια, με το κάθε πλακάκι να αξίζει ένα αριθμό θετικών ή αρνητικών πόντων. Αν είσαι το τελευταίο πιόνι που αποχωρεί από ένα πλακάκι τότε το μαζεύεις και παίρνεις τους πόντους του.

Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχουν και μερικά neutral πιόνια που μπορεί να τα μετακινήσουν όλοι οι παίκτες. Γενικά οι κανόνες είναι πολύ απλοί και το παιχνίδι κυλάει γρήγορα αλλά κρατάει λίγο περισσότερο από όσο θα ήθελα. Θα το πρότεινα αν μιλάμε για παρέα με μικρά παιδιά ή άτομα που κάνουν την πρώτη τους επαφή με το χόμπυ.

Αρκετά random αλλά καλύτερο από τον γκρινιάρη και το φιδάκι.

The game's simple mechanics but open strategy makes this a game I would easily play again, if not back to back. It gave me the same feeling I get from playing "Hey! That's My Fish".

i was banging out unplayed 2 player games with a friend on bsw when we ran into this one.  didn't look that great, but it got more and more fun as it went along.  there are some choices to be made too.  i've only played backgammon once, and i didn't really like it.  maybe this will make me like it more?  i have tried it face to face now.  i enjoyed it, i thought it was strictly bsw but i ended up buying a copy as a gateway type thing.  it didn't see enough play, so i traded it.  i think it's best online.

Having considered myself evolved now beyond roll-and-move games of my former life, this game just doesn't do anything for me. While the luck of the die is mitigated by having more than one piece available to move, a string of bad or good luck can decide the game quite easily. There's just too many other games out there that I'd rather play.

[i]Verflixxt![/i] is one of those games that actually plays better on BSW than it does on the table.  The long, snaking tiles are a bit cumbersome to compress.  And if you have just a little bit of O.C.D. (or in my case, more than a little), you'll feel the constant need to readjust the tiles so they fit together tightly after someone accidentally bumps them.

My little idiosyncracies aside, the game itself is an exercise in prolonged agony.  I truly mean that in a good way: how long can you afford to keep one of your markers on a good (positive-scoring) marker, before you've been forced to take enough negative ones to offset the benefit?  Can you postpone having to move a marker off the end of the board until someone else has had the opportunity to land on your tile and save you from eating its negative score?

Those types of decisions exist in plentiful supply, but your ability to deal with them is tempered by the random element of a die roll.  With luck playing a significant role in the game, [i]Verflixxt![/i] makes for nice filler on either end of something meatier.  The setup and constant adjustment of the table version knocks a point off of what would otherwise have been a "6."  Play it on BSW first, if you can.

Less light than you could think initially. The ideal number of players are 3 or 4 because you play with 3 pawns and there are more choices to make, with more players is too chaotic.

Fun roll and move. This game was highly regarded by my Secret Santa target a couple years past, so I always wanted to give it a chance. Was able to pick on up cheaply at our local game convention and haven't been disappointed.

This game was such a hit with one of my neighbors that they have borrowed it so I didn't have a chance to play it more this month. This is another one of those games where it is easy enough for anyone to play, but a ton of timing elements come into affect.

RATING: 7
I can see why this was once nominated for the SdJ. It has that apparent simplicity which will appeal to families but as you play you realize it's quite challenging.

To move along the tile track, you roll a die. But when you leave a tile and you were solo, you take the tile. A LOT of the tiles are negative points, so that's risky. But in the middle of the track, some of the tiles will turn negatives to positives. "Guard" tokens also complicate things which provide most of the game's interactive element.

This is a clever quick game that's well worth trying if you can get your hands on a copy.

Experience: Simple, but amusing. The decisions are few, and fairly obvious, but fun to make, as I budget my moves, so as to allow flexibility, to best take advantage of different die rolls. Lots of luck. I like it a bit less each time I play it.

The basic game is pretty stupid since when you know what to do (stay in the back on the good cards), the game just comes down to luck. The random setup makes the game a lot better because it can be good to get ahead instead of hanging in the back. But still, the luck involved is too big and there is no 'thrill' when playing it. With 2players it is comparable to Backgammon which makes the game ok.

A cute main mechanic, but when it is your turn there is a clear best move forced upon you by the roll of the die.  It feels like one more rule would make this a really good game.  Roll two pick one?  A deck of 1-6, and you have to use each number before you get them all back? (Rome chariot racing)

RATING: 7
Simple roll and move dice game.  Players are trying to navigate three pawns down a path of numbered tiles.  If you're the last player to vacate a tile, you take it and early +ve or -ve points.  Some tiles convert -ve to +ve.  Neutral pawns add some strategy to the game, and leave you with options of "treading water" on tiles that are too good (or too bad) to leave.  Excellent game.

That's Life is a game you'll be loving one minute and cursing the next. I had 2 fun games with my family recently. One player said "I hate this game!" while smiling, laughing, and asking for another round.  It's heavily luck influenced, but still provides you with interesting decisions each turn. Plus there are many opportunities to screw over another player, and this is what makes the game so fun and funny sometimes.  The game has great interactivity. It also accommodates a wide player range (2-6) which is helpful in a casual gaming situation, and it scales well. I appreciate Kramer's ability to design enjoyable games that can fit in at various difficulty levels yet always remain interesting and engaging.

RATING: 7
Idea: 
Move your 3 men from start to end and try to gather good tiles while moving. Amount of movement is rolled by die.

Mechanism:
Board has + and - and flip - to + tiles. If you leave tile when none is on it you get it, if someone is on tile it stays on board. Best tiles are protected by guardian tokens that can be moved out if any player has man on it.

To whom:
Fast to teach, good for youngers too, quick to play. Good addon game or once in a while game.

Interesting twist on the race genre, where tiles are removed from the track - scoring both positive and negative points.  We played with the "Flixxy" expansion, so I'm not sure how the game would be without the bird.  (2016 update:  It's okay without the bird.  It's a little slower than I would like, and it can still be frustrating, but it is probably quite a bit less random feeling.)

[thing=17240][/thing].  Kramer and keisling are two of my favourite games designers.  When Boardgame Guru got this old classic in stock I rushed in.  It is a lovely game which is easy to explain and plays in 30 minutes.  The game board is a line of tiles.  Roll a die, move a meeple.  If you are the last to leave a tile you collect the tile.  Some tiles are good, some are bad.  Throw in some Guards into the mix and there is good degree of tactical thinking to do. There is a fair amount of luck with the die rolling, especially when you only have one meeple left and you have no movement options, but if you can handle that then here you have a solid and entertaining family game which is also enjoyable as a 30 minute filler for gamers too.

A simple game that I seem to do very well at. Some will say it's too simple, while others will call it elegance. Like other dice games, there is an element of chance here, but it's really all about putting yourself in a position to have a good move available after the majority of die rolls. There's also a nice screwage factor going on.

Not my kind of game.  Die rolls rule everything.  The best moves for any given roll are blatantly obvious.  Occassionally there may be a small decision to make, but generally, it's always clear what the right move is.  You could get the same results sitting by yourself, rolling dice, and moving the pieces of your imaginary opponents - the game is that automatic.

[Roll & Move] Yeah, you roll a die and move pawns. However, the game isn't as stupid as it looks or sounds. There is a bit of meat to the decisions, even if the meat is pretty lean. And yes, there's a lot of luck. It's a kid's game, and it's pretty much the kind of thing that gets Spiel des Jahres nominations. Simple, interactive, luck involved, nice to look at. Not something  that'll have any kind of staying power, but ok once in a while.

Roll and move done right? Well, maybe? There is no denying that the game is a hell of a lot more interesting than many, many other entries in that mechanical category. Of course, it still relies on the dice and it's quite a challenge to apply any sort of meaningful strategy, but as an easy game for winding down it's quite okay although maybe a tad on the long side. It does feel a little older than it actually is, however.

This dice roller is brilliant.  The rules are simple, as are the mechanics (roll the dice and move a pawn), but the game is perplexing.  The few decisions That's Life offers are substantial and not as straight forward as they often initially appear (this game is all risk management).  That's Life is really a game about getting screwed, hence the name (you just hope that the other players get screwed more than you) - great thing is you have a chance to manipulate that they do.  That's Life is a wonderful, light outing that scales well, but plays better with more.

Great family/gateway game. Has a bit of feeling like Tutankhamen for tile collection except the last person to leave a tile MUST take it and there are both positive and negative score affecting tiles. Luckily there is also some reversal tiles that will convert neg to pos. unfortunately they will also convert pos to neg if you dont have enough negatives.

Anyway, this has been a pretty easy to teach game that ages 7 - adults have all enjoyed and picked up fairly easily.

This game is so simple and easy to learn/teach and doesn't sound like much when reading the rules, but it's a lot of fun and can even play up to 6 players.

The components are nice and the tiles are really thick. Basically you roll a die and move one of your pieces or a guard if possible and move them. The last person to move off a tile has to take that tile, whether it's a positive or negative scoring tile. There's also bonus tiles that you can get, that convery one of you negative tiles into a positive tile.

Everyone plays to the finish and you add up the points. It's that simple and doesn't sound like much, but like I said it's surprisingly a lot of fun. Lots of push your luck, screwing your neighbors and sometimes even forced to help them out.

Very cool game, that's fun for families and gamers alike.

luck-based game with stupid illustrations (if somebody aitting in his own pee after breaking the nightpot is your opinion of humor.. well.. mine it is NOT). reminds me a bit of malefiz.

This is the best roll and move games I've ever played.  Incredible depth, especially when playing with random layout.  If you haven't played this, go get it.

Play with several of the variants as well:

- Random Placement
- "1" lets you move backward (ignore the stay where you are, it breaks down the game)
- Tiles that everyone has past that didn't get picked up go to the end.

These variants make for a very interesting game and my rating reflects the game with these variants.  The straight game is still an 8.5

A light, fun family "roll and move" game that I enjoy because there is an element of skill and choice in what actions you take as you move yourself and other pieces around the ever shrinking track!

Play is improved with the wee bird from the first expansion. 

APR09 Dropped a point after playing again.

JUN10 Up a point. Played with 5 other "moderate" (as distinct from "heavy" gamers) in a 3-round competition, and yes there is some luck with the dice, but there was quite a bit of fun, light strategy too! Removed my copy from the trade list!

This is a lot of fun. I played both the "strategic setup" and the random setup and I enjoy both. Sure it's a roll and move at heart but you have a lot of options and you can screw with one another, always a plus. Sometimes there are even agonizing decisions. All in all, a great filler or gateway game that always seems popular with non-gamers and some gamers.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2011)

That's Life! is a good family game. The rules are pretty easy to teach and the gameplay is quick paced and fun.

The decisions needed to win are obvious (because they are so constricted). There is a lot of luck with the dice, you can mitigate it a bit, but luck is very prevalent in the game (a minus for me).

Bottom line, That's Life! is good for casual/family gaming, but it isn’t for me. It is way too light for my current tastes. I’m open to play it again if requested, but my desire to play it is very low. It has lots of chaos and luck. Easy game to teach and play. It is, arguably, the best roll and move game I have played.

After playing many games on BSW, I had to own a copy.  I didn't realize how BIG the tiles were until I opened the box... what a surprise!

A little bit of luck in the roll of a die on each of your turns, but when to move each of your 2 (or 3) pawns can be a bit of a brain burner.

Probably best played with 3 or 4... but the game still scales well for 2-6.  It's become one of our club's favourite light filler games.

This will probably see even more play now that the expansion is available.

RATING: 6.7
That's Life! successfully takes roll and move to the next level allowing for bits of strategy along with an ever-changing modular board.  While the roll of the dice adds luck, deciding your move is what this game is all about.  Taking advantage of the luck received from the die is important though so players must constantly strategize with each roll of the dice.  Very enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game with some interesting choices to be made.  Do you move your man ahead to favorable tiles, or do you instead move a guard to hopefully force your opponent to abandon a luck tile before you do?  Great artwork on the tiles.  Some strategy, but it is pretty simple to learn, and if you are playing someone that knows the basic concepts, there is probably too much luck.

RATING: 7
You role dice to move one of three pawns on tiles that can be negative, positive, or shamrocks that invert a negative tile to positive at the end of the game. If you are the last to leave a tile you must take it. You can also move special pawns that lock down tiles, but they can only be moved if they are starting on a tile with one of the player pawns. There seemed to be more strategy than luck. It is a fun, light, and quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I have no trouble with the luck - it's light, fast, and there are some interesting decisions.  But there was no great excitement.  

Often the game becomes managing the "waiting game".  You and someone else share a nice tile.  Whoever has to leave first won't get it.  So it's just a matter of whether you have an alternative move.

Or conversely you're alone on a bad tile.  Are your alternatives better than leaving the tile and taking it?

I'd play again, but it didn't jazz me.

Played with 3, 4 and 7. Very chaotic. At first it seems random, then it seems like there are emergent strategies, then it seems like holding on to those strategies is random anyway. Kind of a stalling game: pick your least bad option and hope for freebies resulting from the moves of others. Still, entertaining so far.

Ok game. Somewhat dissapointing coming from Kramer.
Game play is limited. Feels a lot like No Thanks. Luck factor is very high. Played it with five this left us absolutely with no control. 
I 'm thinking that I would like this more with fewer people. And the third pawn would give you a little more control.
the pitfall tile from the expansion adds a certain angst to it. With the expansion I probably rate this a point higher. Haven't played the expansion so I can't say this for sure.

A nice filler dice game where you basically try to move either your pawns or block opponents pawns from particular hex-tiles.  You score by collecting hex-tiles but not all are positively helpful.  With the expansion, I think I would like it if there was some rational setup or layout of the tiles like the base game (randomness just doesn't seem to make it feel like you have any attempt at predicting the probabilities).  I also like rolling the die possibilities rather than having card-dice in the expansion.  I do like the newer tiles added in.

Verflixxt's ingenious "disappearing" board  and its multiplayer action reminds me of "Hey, that's my fish" while its roll and move mechanic is reminiscent of Backgammon. It's a fast filler that falls a bit heavily on the side of luck but stays enjoyable nonetheless. It's one of these games that keeps the tension high, down to the very last move. Try out the variations!

It is a roll and move game, but the luck is heavily mitigated by the use of the guards. After 4 plays I can say that the game plays at a good speed, with a moderate play time. I will say that while playing with 6 is fun, I have to believe that this one is best with 4.

Players have multiple pawns on a  track of tiles and may move to a tile.  The last player to move off a tile takes the tile.  The player with the most points at the end wins.

RATING: N/A
Not your typical roll and move.

Light strategy that seems perfect for a younger after-school group.

A recent post on BGG suggested: I played this for the first time today and was a little disappointed to find that it was out of print. Until I realized it would have run me about $40. Seems a little pricey for a game which can easily be proxied with a standard deck of playing cards, a 6 sided die and a few meeples. 

BRILLIANT DIY IDEA (inspired from previous quote): Try a zombie re-theme using a deck of Bicycle Zombie cards. 1-10 Hearts and 1-8 Diamonds are negative. 1-8 spades (or clubs) are positive. 6 JQK cards are +/-. Use Jokers for start and finish. Use meeples for "zombies" (running pieces). PRINT rules from BGG and make sure the numbers (and set-up) are correct.

The zombie cards are just an idea since they are more colorful than regular playing cards.

ALTERNATIVELY: Use Rage or Uno cards that do not have suits on them. (Red and Orange can be negative, Green can be positive, and yellow can be good luck)

Fun to play and original, however VERY simple. The strategy to win is easy to crack: go as slow as possible, play as much as possible with the wooden guards to leave your men rock solid at interesting tiles. It becomes a total matter of luck if all players have found out about this strategy: then it just depends on your dice roll or whether or not you have the opportunity to move a wooden guard. Nevertheless, fun to play.

RATING: 6
A simple roll-and-move game is the biggest archetype of board games. Verflixxt takes that cliche and twists it into a surprisingly interesting game.

I like the game as it is, I've played it mostly with my wife. However, add stuff from the expansions and what you've got is rather fiendish game, well worth trying!

Indifferent.

Based on a few plays on BSW, not too bad for a filler, tends to drag a bit for a game of this type though.  Also, the dice seems to be playing the players rather than the other way round.

RATING: 9.5
A fun, luck management game. On BSW it is better with two or three people (I'm tend not to like waiting for others to move); it's fine with more when playing face-to-face.

Some deride verfilxxxt as being too luck based. I disagree. Luck does play a major part, but, particularly in a two or three player game, winning and losing are determined by the decisions one make.

A roll and move game with some twists. The players try to get as many positive points as they can taking the tiles and shrinking the track as a result. Not too much strategic, at least when playing with 6 players.

A largely random, entertaining family romp. **Update** When played competitively, this becomes a tense, tooth-pulling exercise (in a good way) where players stubbornly cling to valuable tiles at their own benefit and peril. Recommended.

This is a luck-filled, screw-the-other-players type game but I've enjoyed the few plays that I've had. I do think that it could wear out its welcome with more than just sporadic appearances, so I'll gladly play it with big fans of the game but don't feel the need to own it.

Roll & move game. Light and fun game. Not to be taken too seriously. The basic game is missing just a little to be really fun. Expansions give it the needed boost. Especially the first one with the bird, Flixxy, is adding right kind of randomness the game needs. As an added bonus the expansion boxes make game more portable. Whole game with two expansions fit into one expansion box...

With expansions the game feels a lot "create your own roll-and-move game"-set. It's quite modular system where you can add more stuff if you want and most elements seem to work well together.

Update (19.2.2007): Updated my rating: Rating is for basic game with the first expansion. Basic game is a bit on the boring side sometimes but expansion is making it a fun experience.

Update (21.1.2008): Second expansion makes the game even more fun experience. Recommended for those who like the game.

RATING: 7
This is a nice 15 min opener and can be enjoyed across all age ranges. There are small decisions to make - whether to race ahead and get tiles solo, or to maintain a Mexican standoff on a good tile you're sharing with others. And strategically, how many negative tiles can you afford to take aka how many highly sought after convert-red-into-positive tiles will you be able to win. It's still a dice fest, but it's worked well in its niche. The variants we play with and like are that the 1 can be used to go ahead 1 or stay still or go back 1, and that the game finishes when the first player gets their last token home. One variant we've tried and didn't like was to play with a set of cards made up of 1-6 plus a -1, playable in add-together combinations. Way too easy to move to just the good stuff, creating standoffs everywhere and lacking the fun that dice chaos presents.

RATING: 5.9
Quick roll-and-move eurogame; few and simple rules, depends a lot on the die roll and has a few "tactics" involved, but may also produce some laughs. This makes it a nice close game to squeeze in the last half hour, where everyone's brains have shut down and need something easy to play with.

The artwork is very funny and hilarious, showing the ups and downs in life and I really enjoy it; the components are of a nice quality - and very big, too. I do recommend it as a family game to play with casual gamers or non-gamers.

Egyszerű partyjáték, amit alapból hatan, de kiegészítővel (madárral), akár nyolcan is lehet játszani.
Vannak piros lapok, amik mínusz pontot adnak, ha te lépsz le róla utoljára, vannak zöldek, amik plusz pontot hoznak és vannak szerencse lapkák, ezek meg tudnak változtatni egy piros lapot pozitívre.
A kiegészítőkben van a madár, amivel ugyanúgy lehet lépni és van egy spéci dobókocka, ami azt határozza meg, hogy kivel kell lépni (saját babú, őr, madár)
Összességében tetszetős és gyors játék, kezdőknek is ajánlott!

RATING: 5
Some nice K&K tactical twists, such as deciding when to move your pawn or a guard, but it seemed to come down to who HAD to move their pawn but didn't really want to VS those lucky enough to have a choice - and there wasn't a lot of control over the decision. It was interesting enough for a few plays, but perhaps not enough there for adults and the subtleties could be lost on the kids. Also, terrible theme. Couldn't there have been a solid thematic hinge to the game? What's it all about, journeying through the twists and turn of life OR is it a statement. As in, "Hey, I paid full price for this cause one of these guys designed El Grande. Ah well, that's life!"

At first there doesn't seem to be much to this game as it's just a roll and move at the mercy of the die but as the game progresses it become evident that its about putting yourself it the best situations no matter the die roll.  Additionally, there is a press you luck aspect by taking  a few negative tiles early with the anticipation to get the lucky tiles to flip them to plus.  Intersting "abstract game"that doesn't seem like much until you play it a few times.

Inarguably the best roll-and-move game out there. Players move pawns on a table constructed of tiles with plus and minus points and tiles which can convert tiles from minus to plus. When their pawn is the last to move from a tile they pick up the tile. The innovation is the guard tokens which can only be moved if there is a player pawn on the same tile. Anybody can move them and they 'guard' the tile even if the last player pawn is moved from the tile. All in all a great game and different every time. There's also a bunch of official and unofficial variants to be tried.

If you're looking for something light and don't mind luck playing a large part this is a good game to play.  It was a little bit longer than I wanted it be and there are other games that I enjoy more, so this probably won't come out very often.

Quick dice game.  Better than most dice games since you have more choices but the last part of the game comes down to luck (go figure with dice).

Played several times on BSW.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A roll and move where you are trying to be the last to move off of certain spots but not the last to move off of other spots. So you have a bit where you are waiting out your opponents on the good spots and taking your chance that you can move quickly over the bad spots. Special "guard" pawns add a little wrinkle. The spots are supposed to represent good and bad events in life, and there is art to reflect this, but the drawings are a little weird sometimes.

Nice roll and move game, perhaps the best of its type.  Players get the tiles in which they stand if there's nothing there when they leave.  The tiles can be positive or negative.  You go through collecting tiles and then sum them up to see who wins.  I could rate this game better, but I simply don't like too much roll and move games.

A bit too tactical for my liking, I prefer some long term planning in my games, or some kind of "score now versus score later" decision making.

That's Life! --

Base game only: Played once; three-player.
With Verflixxt nochmal expansion: Played once; three-player.

Reminiscent of Cartagena, but uses a die to determine movement, so there is less control.

Two features which make the game shine:
• The Guard tokens.
• The restriction that tiles are only taken by the player whose token is alone on the tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun chance-based filler, though I often use less than the full quota of tiles for a faster game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A silly little roll and move game: players try to negotiation 3 pawns across life (represented by +ve, -ve and 4-leaf clover tiles). On your turn, you roll the die and move one of your pawns. If you are the only pawn to leave the tile, you take it. There are also several other neutral pawns (Guards) seeded on the board. You can move a guard instead of your own pawn IF they reside on a tile with another other player pawn. The player with the highest score when all have reached the finish wins.

The theme is completely non-existent. The artwork is horrible but it's good for a light laugh. Nothing more.

I recommend using the advanced setup rules for a less predicatable and static game.

Most annoying trait is that players sit back to claim the last few fortune tiles (which becomes a waiting game of dice rolls). While I haven't tried any of the variants, they might be what's needed to break this cycle? Nice components and a fun game nonetheless...can be hard to find anymore though.

Ok this game really comes down to luck, but it is fun to play along.  Now don't get me wrong, there is actually a game her, but there are many fun decisions that usually don't really add up if the dice don't go your way. But, I don't really care, it is a fast light filler.  Kramer's "preteen" version of Gulo Gulo.

RATING: 6
It's an "okay game" that I don't really think I need to own but keep because it's an "okay roll and move game". However, I would never want to play this again with people who have any AP because there's nothing to do on your turn and I pretty much know what I want to do when it comes back to me. Also, although it plays up to 6, I wouldn't want to for the same reasons as above.

Several plays on BSW only. A roll and move game, with a twist that makes it more interesting. Better (seems less luck-driven) with more players. The BSW interface ought to highlight each piece's ending location, to speed things up (you spend some time counting your moves to see where you'd end up).

Great artwork!

RATING: 7
[RGG 'That's Life!' 2005 edition] {Kid; roll-and-move, set collection; optimal 3-5p} That's life is a very simple game. It can be explained within 2 minutes. Children can understand the rule and manage the game easily. A typical game runs fast (would be slower with more players). Player interaction is fairly strong. It's fun as well. The graphic is cute and the components are sturdy. In all, it's a nice family / children game.

Though dice is used, it's not a simple dice game. Players have to decide wisely which pawn / guard to move. Some tactical options are possible, such as planning the route ahead, so that you can move your pawn more easily.

Variant #5 should be used to increase the excitement.  With the expansions and variants, there are countless ways to play That's Life! It's great!

[Expansions]
I like Flixxy, hats and risk tiles. They are great.

[Expansions Combo] 
The combos suggested by the author:
1. Basic game (without dice) with movement cards 
    Not much fun for me.
2. Basic game w/ dice + the two hats + risk tiles 
    Nice! It's good to try.
3. Basic game w/ dice + the two hats + risk tiles + Verflixxt tiles
    Even nicer! I love it.
4. Basic game w/ movement cards + the two hats + risk tiles + Verflixxt tiles
    Ok, but the game is longer than necessary.
5. Basic game + Flixxy (with the action dice and lap chips) + Verflixxt tiles + the two
    Also a fun game.

Engaging and fun.  Enough tactics for gamers to enjoy a light game while appealing to casual gamers.  Lots of variants, including random setup and I especially like the Pitfall variant!  Quality of the tiles is very nice.  The expansion raises this from an 8 to a 10.  I prefer to play that the luck tiles cancel out a negative tile, rather than turn it into a positive.

RATING: 7
Rating based on playing one game, and using the "strategic" expansions. The base game by itself would probably rate quite a bit lower.

With that said, the game was fun. It's just a simple roll-and-move, but the cards, the neutral character (Flixxy), and the guards add enough strategy and decisions to the game. The goal chips, which become more valuable as more people exit the board, also add a new twist on the game because you want to hang back and get the higher points, instead of just rushing off the board to safety.

Fun game, and would play again with the right mix of expansion modules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Liked it at first, but after a few plays, it seems pretty luck-driven. I have no idea what a competent strategy entails, and always seem to be left with nothing but shitty moves on my turn. This is alright once in a while, but starts to frustate me when it happens repeatedly. It starts to feel a bit like those old roll-and-move games where a bad roll lands you in the soup, and you feel like you suck at the game, when in reality, you just had a bad run of luck. 

On the other hand, it's one of my wife's favorites. She won't be too happy when she finds out it's on my trade pile...

Hey, a roll and move game, other than Backgammon, that I like!  No surprise, since there are certainly some similarities to Backgammon, but this has two additional things going for it.  First, it supports alot of players, and I generally prefer multi-player games over two player games.  Second, while Backgammon has a mild nasty side, this game has the additional benefit that you can screw someone else and avoid an unwanted roll at the same time!  I normally don't play nasty, but it just feels right in this game.  On the other hand, in the final analysis, it is a pretty simple game with ultimately limited appeal.  If overplayed, it could lose it's attraction.

Very nice startergame/filler. 

Try to reach the end wich as much points as possible. You have to pick-up the tile on wich you were standing when you move along. So you try to stay as long a possible on a possitive and make sure that someone else is last on a negative one. 

But wait there are some special tiles: they convert the negatives into possitives. And there are some guards who have to be moved first before you can take the tile. Guards can only be moved if there is also a player standing on the tile.

Wolfgang Kramer & Michael Kiesling; The board of this roll and move game is made of cards with number values from -10 to +8. The last piece to leave each card (each player has several pieces) must take the card. In the end, the player with most points (or least negative points) wins the game. The game has very few rules and lots of luck. Expanded by: Verflixxt nochmal (That's Life! 1st Expansion), Verflixxt hoch 2 ((That's Life Squared) is the second expansion to That's Life); other names: Verflixxt!, Sellaista, sattuuIlyen az élet!, Sellaista sattuu!

I have to give credit to this game for being a roll-and-move game with choices to make.  In the beginning of the game, the choices make for some interesting gameplay, but as you near the end of the game, those choices begin to disappear.  If the game could allow those choices throughout the game, I'd probably bump it up a point.

A "Disznós".

Aki azt állítja, hogy élvezi a "Ne mérgelődj, ember"-t (más néven Parchisi-t), annak kötelező kipróbálni, csak hogy lássa a különbséget egy jobb és egy rosszabb játék között.

Ez a Parchisi ellentéte: ahelyett, hogy egy mezőn egy bábu állhat, itt akármennyi. És nem azzal nyersz, hogy beérsz a célba, hanem ha több pontot gyűjtöttél. Aki ugyanis utoljára hagyja el az adott mezőt, az megkapja a rajta szereplő pontértéket, ami lehet pozitív és negatív is...
És még pár szabály... 
De inkább ki kell próbálni, mint itt olvasgatni. A humoros grafika biztosan feldob!

Roll the dice and move a pawn, but each player has multiple pawns, so there are decisions to be made.  Pawns move around a tile path, and the last player to move from a tile picks it up and scores positive of negative points, depending on the tile.

5 after 1 play

A roll and move game that works during the initial stage but starts to break down in the middle stage and becomes rather luck-driven in the late stage. This is due to each player having one pawn left at the end and there is really no options left then.

Artwork is average but funny. Game components quality is ok.

Sort of an interesting game with often unexpected outcome.  You basically try to outlast the other people when you end up on a tile that would generate more positive points for you.  However, poor play from some people can end up hurting you by giving the wrong players opportunities to move the guards instead of their own pieces, thus give them an extra turn so to speak.  Not too fond of the dice rolling, but it's lite enough to warrant more plays in the future.

Not really a deep game but it does cause some tough choices constantly. Just the kind of game I have no idea how to be good at.

Very straightforward dice game that is an excellent choice to play with non-gamers or older kids. The rules are easy yet allow for some fun push-your-luck and mild screwage.

El objetivo del juego es coger la mayor cantidad de losetas positivas y de suerte evitando las losetas negativas. Cuando todos lleguen al final del camino el jugador con más PV será el ganador.

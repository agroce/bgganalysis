This is great. The terminology sometimes makes it just a touch more obtuse than it needs to be, but the deck construction and the duels are extremely quick and engaging. Lots of interesting little decisions throughout. It also allows for some big moves and stunning reversals, which is always a plus.

二人用の格ゲーをうまくカードゲーム化できている。カード枚数が少ないため引きはあるもののある程度予想した上でのコントロールができる。手番ごとの選択肢は少ないながらも手応えのあるものとなっている。

Played the Japanese version owned by a friend. Essentially a duel card game with a deck construction phase and play phase. Each player starts off with picking 2 character from a set of characters from the game, each character had a pre-set amount of unique cards and unique ability. You then chooses a numbers of card from the two characters you selected to create your play deck. Afterward would be the play phase, you then try to get your opponent to 0 health. 


The concept itself is fairly similar to "Smash up" with an interesting layer of buffing elements, since you are selecting the cards for your deck secretly, you can purposely pick a "Long range attack character" and drafted only short range attack cards to surprise you opponent.  

Most cards have a very specific uses and are only effective if that scenario played out(appropriate Distance, health of yourself/opponent, etr etr)Due to the punishing nature of this, its a fairly challenging game and difficult to master despite that its only uses a small amount of cards.

bonus: The card's art and quality is excellent!

Confusing. Annoying. Doesn't feel nearly as streamlined as other similar games.

Compared to other fighting card games I own, this one is unique with the resource system and plays much faster. A lot less AP issues since the decks are so small and I like the ability to construct my own deck. Definitely a keeper.

My sole complaint is the limited availability of cards as right now it is a very small game.

The concept of constructing your deck right before a game is something I wish I thought of myself. The game also has these resource systems that make what seems like a simple game actually pretty involved. I also like how nearly every card is situational (and of course less situational cards just aren't as good) and a lot of the game is just positioning yourself to make them work.

I have no idea why the suggested first match / demo setup doesn't actually use the goddesses' unique abilities. It's like there's this text on the character card that tells you "oh, this character is rushdown / defensive / ranged" except it turns out that none of the cards you're given actually activate the ability that makes that true.

This one is to good, to unique and to beautiful to be this short of a game.

After putting the English text over the Japanese in a sleeve this game is becoming a favorite due to being easy to learn but needs time to master.  Quick games make it fun and the deck combinations mean you can have a different experience every time you play.

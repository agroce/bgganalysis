I don't know why, but this game frustrates the heck out of me. At this point I think I would rather swap this in our collection with Letters from Whitechapel, but I want to play it one more time first before I make a final decision.

Excellent, original and atmospheric deduction game. Meaty enough to get you thinking hard but still over in half an hour. Perfect for playing by email and very well served at the official site. Could have been a 9 if it wasn't for the fact that it seems to be unbalanced.

130929 I gave it to my sister.  Its a nice abstract 2P game but a bit heavy and I never got it played.  I thought her husband might have more luck getting it to the table.

100425 Fun interesting game.  Be ready for assymetric results.  Hard as heck to explain the rules in a way that makes the complextity come through but it really, really gets interesting fast (after the first play or so).  I like its a 2P optimized game without perfect information but there is a lot control.  And it really is +/- 30 minutes.

I've played several times now (which is easy to do since it plays easily within 30 minutes), and really like it! The most amazing part of this game, to me, is that the board is set up exactly the same for every game, yet every game plays out completely differently!!

Wow. At first glance, I thought that this would NEVER be any good... it just didn't seem "complicated" enough. Boy was I wrong. What a complex gem in such a simple package. It features a terse and simple rule set, there are a few choices each turn, and it has quick game play -- all good things, in my opinion. The key though, is that it has the ability to be a much DEEPER brain-burner than most might think. Certainly a beautiful design if there ever was one.

This is a most wonderful 2-player game.

My favourite game to play with my wife. She loves it as well. We're probably up to 30 games now, and each round seems to be more intense and intricate than the one before. We liked it from the start, but it took us several plays to realize how insanely deep and complex this game really is. Playing it can be very tiring, though.

As a child I was a big fan of Scotland Yard. I haven't played it for years but this game generates the same feelings of excitement. The pieces are of really good quality, the game plays quick, and the theme is rich. A failure for either player inspires an immediate "one-more-try" feeling, and the fact that it is so quick to play makes this perfectly possible on most occasions. No 2-player game before this one has caused us to play so many games one-after-another in the first few days. Girlfriend is a fan, so this is a big bonus. It's a shame it's only 2-player, but Scotland Yard is still knocking about somewhere so that can scratch the same itch with more players. All in all, very pleased with this purchase.

Beautiful design and quality components. The game starts to reapeat itself after a while. There are far better 2-player games out there.

I would not call Mr. Jack a game of deduction. It is a game of elimination. Let me explain myself... You are not collecting clues and connecting the dots between things that seem to be totally irrelevant at first. Instead, what you do is that every round you are just positioning yourself on the board so that you can eliminate part of the suspects on your list. Inevitably the police will have Jack cornered at some point but the question just is whether they can do it in the time given.

Now we come to the dull part. The basic premise is that the bobs have to eliminate 50% of the remaining suspects every round, and Jack is trying slow the process. For a couple of games this is fun but becomes extremely repetitive after that. There are no alternative strategies, cunning plays or any of that exhilarating excitement from being so close to capturing Jack but then seeing him slip through the net (here I am comparing Mr.Jack with another great game of the same theme: Letters from Whitechapel). 

Nothing is broken with the game. I just did not enjoy it very long.

I find it a little unfulfilling, the detective wins 95% of the games I've played and Jack only wins when you draw one of the better characters. I don't plan on devoting much time to changing this point of view.

This game has GOT to published.  The 250 copy edition is actually well constructed and the game itself is a tense and fun two-player.  In two games, it seems as though it's tough for Jack to win, but it would be fun to figure out how to counter that.  Can't wait to play this one again someday.

Played at le premi√®re le Printemps de Jeu in Bourgoin-Jailleu, France.

A good deductive game.  If the balance between Jack and the police was better, it would be one of the greats.

Update: No, I haven't played it again, but it's been brought to my attention that the above is the standard noob comment on this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this, but you need players to understand the basic setup and strategic goals. E.g. if your opponent doesn't know how to balance escape against staying hidden, how to run with Stealthy from the getgo, or even have a vague idea of how to setup a decoy, even the claimed 70/30 in Inspector's favor is generous to Jack. 

A great idea that is probably needs to be more deduction, less spatial positioning. Random setups, events and less turns would have helped. 

PS agree with Barnes. Turning a guy who disembowelled prostitutes into a cute character is obnoxious.

RATING: 7.4
A game of deduction and elimination which 1 player takes on the role of Mr Jack while the other takes on as the detective on the quest to find which character did Mr Jack impersonate.

With limited number of turns, the detective must be able to deduce the impersonator and move beside the impersonator and expose Mr Jack.  If the character is indeed impersonated, the detective wins the game.

Good points: Easy game to play with and players can take on different roles in the game to have a full taste of the game.

Bad points: Quite hard to remember the different privileges / powers of different characters at first.  The game can be boring if played many times in one go.

UPDATE: Didn't get it to the table again and it shuffled off this mortal coil.  I'm okay with that.  I thought the theme was good, but it wasn't deduction so much as elimination (you're not puzzling out the identity of Jack so much as figuring out how to split up the suspects.  The mechanisms just didn't do anything either.  C'est la vie.

---------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: I'm going to have to get this to the table a few more times, but my girlfriend has no interest in dredging this up and, while I'd like to get some plays in, I don't think I'm too disappointed by the lack of playing.

I guess I'd probably trade this one out for Ra or something.

---------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: My girlfriend thinks this is way too thinky (I like that part of it) and isn't compelled by the theme or "deductive" elements of it.  We've not played much, but, much as I looked forward to it, I would consider trading it away.

--------------------------------------------------------

I enjoy the dynamic at work.  I'll have to play more, but I do see the advantage for the detective.  There's a lot of thought here (maybe a bit much for my partner), but I enjoy that element.  Sometimes, though, it seems like Jack gets cornered and can't do anything about it.

Mr. Jack is a "must have" two player game with very little luck and a LOT of strategy.  It plays super quick, with very little down-time.

After 26 plays I'm working out how to best play the role of Jack, which is harder but well worth the effort.

The more I play this game the more clever it becomes.  

The artwork and components are beautiful and the whole game of cat and mouse is wonderfully conceived.  This game is fast approaching 9 plus for me.

This one stands out because it's so original.  It's nice to have a unique option to go to for a 2 player game.  And each side (Jack and The Detective) is presented with different goals.

Everything is solidly put together, the rules are simple to grasp, but there's a lot of depth in finding the right move.

If I have a complaint it's that the game can really encourage analysis paralysis and take a lot longer than it should.  It's just about possible to map out nearly every reasonable move and weigh them against each other and find the "perfect" move for a turn.  And with that option in reach it's hard to not sit there and try to do it constantly.

But if you can keep that under control, then it's a good game that fills a nice spot.

Nice pieces and board. Good sense of theme and enjoyable to play. It is a tense cat and mouse struggle of lying low and timing your run to escape the police if you are Jack.

RATING: 6
played about as good as it sounded in the rules.  love the art and general look, love having variable player powers that are actually variable.  not sure if it's just ultimately replayable, but there is an expansion that's due out and could shake things up a bit.  the detective being a 60/40 favorite isn't as big a deal for me because of the asymmetry but i still don't like it.

RATING: 5
This game is not bad, but I must admit that I was disappointed.  The game seems to play out almost the same way every time, and in the 7 games I have played, the Jack player has yet to win.  I have played both sides, and I have played with 3 different people, so it seems it is not just me.  Still, other folks seem to like it, and I am not to the point where I would turn it down yet.  It definitely could be a good family game.

RATING: 6.5
Understanding how to play this game well is key to it being enjoyable.  A first play that lasted 2 turns due to a misunderstanding of the lights didn't imbue the game with high expectations.  Overall, I think it is a very respectable game.  Deduction games frequently end up lacking any drive and the escape mechanism in this ensures that there is a unique clock that moves the action along.  And it works quite well for both sides.  Is it as good as the hype on it?  I'm not sold, but maybe I just am not very skilled at this type of game.

Look no further if you're looking for a good 2-player game! This one pits 2 players against each other - one trying to escape the streets of Whitechapel, while the other tries to use deductive reasoning (and a bit of luck) to figure out who the culprit is and capture him before he/she can escape!

RATING: 10
Excellent 2 player game. There's a lot of open information on the board, so there's is also some Analysis Paralysis on this game, as you need to plan your moves thoroughly. Each move counts and can be decisive, as each player only plays/moves a character 16 times at max during the whole game. The luck aspect is reduced as you only have to worry about it on the odd turns - 1,3,5 and 7. More experience is needed when playing the role of Jack - as the game isn't perfectly balanced. If you're playing as Mr. Jack and you're Watson you'll have a hard time, because he starts the game in a weak position.
The art work is excelent and add to the quality of the game. Highly recomended!
Sure it's an abstract game, but because each character has it's own especial action he can do, brings the theme more alive, for example: the inspector closes exits, so Mr. Jack can't escape, sherlock holmes can deduce if someone is not guity by drawing alibi cards.
One problem is to visualize your move, sometimes using Goodley, many characters move, it's not easy to visualize the game after the move, and then using your 2nd character movement, and if the 2nd character movement depends on the 1st, you get the ideia...

Clever 2er deduction game, dripping with theme and amazing production quality (although my board seems to have warped due to the dryness in Alberta). Since the initial setup is the same each game, I worry a bit about replayability but so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It's tough being Jack.

After first few plays my feelings are lukewarm. The game isn't much fun to me, I think I may actually play an abstract strategy over this, because this is what this game is for me - a logic, abstract strategy game, there is very little deduction here (if any). The calculations I need to process in order to make a move actually makes me more tired than enjoyed. Mind you I'm not a big fan of abstract strategies either.

Before playing the original Mr. Jack, I had already played and enjoyed its pocket edition, which I still like much better than the full game: actually indeed Mr. Jack feels too fiddly and puts itself on a higher difficulty level, which is ill-suited for the light atmosphere the game tries to create, as shown by the cartoony art.

Undoubtedly it‚Äôs a good deduction exercise but the game as a whole isn‚Äôt as fun as the more streamlined pocket edition is: moreover, unlike the latter, in Mr. Jack it‚Äôs more difficult to play as Jack than as the detective, which feels somehow wrong.

I quite like this abstract game.  It's rather devious and you always feel tense regardless of which side you play as.  I'm notoriously bad at playing Jack...so whenever I win it's a pretty big deal.

RATING: 5
Three games so far, all with me as Jack.  The first two lasted until the final turn, when the detective had it narrowed down to two suspects and basically flipped a coin as to who to accuse.  In the third game, I won within the 1st ten minutes (escape on the 2nd turn) due to luck, and it's hard to see what the detective could have done to stop it.

I was really keen to get this game, but right now it's a 6 with a downward trend.

Update:  Have played as the detective.  That's more fun, but  overall my rating goes down, as I predicted.

RATING: 8
Play as Mr Jack or the detective. Mr Jack is trying to escape the city without getting caught. The detective is trying to figure out who Mr Jack is disguised as and arrest him. What's cool is that the game plays completely differently depending on which role you assume. A clean simple rule set hides the charm of this game: Most of what's going on is happening inside the player's head: 'Does he know who I am? Does he see that I'm heading for the sewers? Did he fall for that ruse?'

A wonderful, quick deduction game that perhaps is a bit slanted against Jack, but that fact only gives me more resolve when playing Jack to try to squeak out a victory.  Easy to learn.

Another one of the few games that has totally mesmerized some members of my family.  It's amazing how many times it comes down to the inspector having two equally appealing suspects, and Jack having to trick him into letting the right (or wrong) one get away.  Such a simple concept, but the game just nails it.  Very, very fun.

From my 2007 BGG Secret Santa, good stuff! We're always looking for good 2-player games. After our initial trial game (me as Investigator, a very sleepy husband as Jack - I won the game soundly, unsurprisingly), we both agreed that Jack has a harder time in this game. That suspicion was confirmed by many reviews and comments on this site. Stats show Jack wins with experienced gamers 40-50%). We also guessed at two strategies for Jack: keep as many people visible as possible and play for the 8 turn win rather than for escape. Looking forward to more plays when Daniel is awake!

Mr. Jack is a fantastic two player game. It has strategy, logic, deduction and bluffing. It is elegant, tight and tense. The game seems to hang on each decision and the more I play it, the more depth is revealed. I usually enjoy heavier games, but for the 30 - 45 minutes a game takes, every moment is full.

Doesn't really feel like the theme fits this game - where are the bodies, who is the investigator player? Just some sort of collective mind?? Sorry, just doesn't work for me.

This is a tight two player game but there's not a lot of talking going on while playing. Played first two games within an hour, alternating sides. There's a lot of deduction going on in this game, so it has elements of CLUE and MASTERMIND on a larger board with a lot more options.

Made the mistake of NOT scanning or photocopying the sticker sheet prior to playing, because we were hot to play it immediately.

Was surprised at the size of the board for a two player game.  Not sure why but expected it to be smaller.

It's definitely harder to play Jack than it is to play the inspector, but I thrive on the challenge of playing Jack. The theme is great and I find that my wife and I are definitely into it. The expansion was a nice addition and provides a little more balancing for Jack to win as well. Like I said, my non-gamer wife loves it and picked it up pretty easily.

I generally don't like to have to play 2 games, switching sides, in order to feel like I've played a "complete" game.  But in this case, the game is short enough that I don't really mind.  It's pretty fun to try to out-think your opponent & set up situations where he can't divide the suspects efficiently.  It's really a spacial abstract in that respect, and I'm surprised it's as popular as it is because of that.  But I like it quite a bit and want to play more.

UPDATE: After an initial spurt of play, I've found myself with no desire to come back to this game. Part of it is the play-balance thing (I've never seen Jack win), part of it is the themelessness (almost to the point of negative theme), part of it is that it's just so dry. If I'm going to play an abstract, I'd much rather play a game with real depth like PUNCT or something else from the GIPF series. If I want something with a little bluffing and a little tactics, I'll take Duel in the Dark or Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. So down the rating goes ...
---
Fun and very clever. It's been billed as a deduction game, which it isn't really, it's more of an abstract tactical game - you do a lot more solving of movement mini-puzzles than actual deduction - but the tactics are quite engaging, and the game has good tension. At least, I think it does - after four games, it feels like it's *very* hard on Mr. Jack. I haven't seen Mr. Jack even close to winning yet, and if the imbalance really is severe, that'll sap the tension. 

The theme is alas a classic euro paste-up job. It's more than a little thematically annoying to be playing the role of Mr. Jack and to never or very rarely be able to actually move your own character, which can happen if the cards come out in an unfriendly order and the inspector always moves him before you get the chance (and let's be clear here, there is a fair amount of luck to this game, and it appears that Jack is especially subject to it). And it's a bit odd to see Sherlock Holmes or Dr Watson actually be Jack the Ripper. I feel like a game on this topic should be a little edgier - how did Jack the Ripper and pirates become acceptable themes for German family-type games?

2-player Clue for grownups. A very well designed game that is enjoyable both when the players are just learning as well as when they know all the tropes and patterns. I still think the detective has a bit of an edge, but that's gotten less and less true the more I've played.

I'm just not a huge fan of games where you spend a ton of time looking at all the possibilities looking for that one optimal move, and that's a lot of what Mr. Jack boils down to. You can easily win or lose based on one good or bad move, so you have to sit there and look through every possibility until you're satisfied you aren't screwing things up.

Neat game design, but it's just not for me, as I really prefer games where I can play with my gut rather than calculating out every possible move in the game.

It is a good game of second level deduction, as you have to figure out who Jack is based on the moves the Jack player did or did not make. Implying, of course, that the Jack player will need to make moves that implicate the wrong suspect.

Very nicely done.

However, there are so many movement and placement rules to track, sewers, eight special powers, lights, and adjacency, that new players, and even some forgetful older players, can lose track of this information, giving an enormous advantage to the player that does.

Also, the nature of the Jack crimes (serial killer who murders female sex workers), limits who will be willing to play the game (many of my friends would be uninterested).

RATING: 7
Call me humorless or oversensitive, but Mr. Jack's theme bothers me. It takes a horrifying part of history and makes light of it with cartoon artwork and frivolity. Such presentation is tacky at best. The Jack the Ripper connection takes what might otherwise have been a cool little asymmetric bluffer and makes it feel icky.

UPDATE: Played a few times and traded.  Not much there after a few plays for me.

Neat little asymmetric two-player game. The deduction comes in the form of clever placement, which is a nice change of pace from Clue variant deduction games.

I find both sides equally fun to play, which is a BIG plus! Also since the play time is so quick, it's easy to play two rounds and switch sides in one sitting.

The problem with this game is the luck factor is pretty high. Mr. Jack, especially if he's disguised as Ms. Stealthy, can win before the other side can do anything meaningful if the right characters come up at the right time. And all too often the game is over before halfway through the turn track just due to luck. Lame.

But, like I said, since it's short and has a unique feel I still dig it overall.

P.S. the art is too cute!

This game is an awesome 2 player game with a broad appeal.  Fairly easy to learn and it plays differently depending on the role you choose.  The only downside for me is the theme; I would have liked it better if it was strictly a Sherlock Holmes mystery, since my son is only eight.  (He hasn't played it yet.)

Fun 2 player abstract.  Not a deduction game really.  Don't expect Sleuth or Clue.

Imbalance is OK in a game, but this is beyond acceptable. After playing, I had a hard time figuring how Jack could ever win save for some fortunate confluence of events. It seems the game is just seeing how long you can keep him on the run, which is really just dumb luck anyway. 

The atmosphere is more Angela Lansbury than Jack the Ripper. Even the title is ridiculous - Mr Jack, your friendly neighborhood female mutilator. I'll stick with Scotland Yard.

[u]October 2008:[/u] I just won for the first time as Mr Jack and since it never happened before, I was starting to wonder if it was even possible for evenly matched players. I'm relieved because it was the only thing that was keeping me back from really enjoying this one.

[u]Nov 2008:[/u] Won for the second time with Mr Jack against my gf, so this time with an even partner (not a first timer)
I really like the game, it is fun, and has a great deal of thinking. But I still feel like game isn't very balanced and that prevents me from rating it higher.

[u]June 2009:[/u] I sold it away as since this last time I won as Mr Jack, Laur√®ne felt there was too much pressure playing Mr Jack and I agree that the game is not balanced and this is just too bad in my opinion and this has really prevented usfrom loving this game as we're more of competitive players. For thos who aren't I'll suggest this game easily, for those who are competitive, not so much. I'd say it woul be an 7.5 for non competitive players and a 5.5 for those who aren't.
As such, I'll rate it 6 (closer to competitive as that's what we are!)

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 6.5

RATING: 4
So-so puzzle-like game. Asking whether Mr Jack is in the light or dark is rather unthematic. Also 'Mr Jack' is a hopelessly lame title. If the publishers were too scared to even allude to Jack the Ripper's crimes then they should have based it on a Sherlock Holmes mystery, perhaps involving the mysterious disappearance of a pound note.

I bought this right off the bat during my early entry into the hobby. I wanted a two player for my wife and myself. 

I get it, I think, but it just didn't seem very fun. Remembering the different "powers" for each detective was a bit annoying, and what I hoped was light fun was instead well-decorated chess. Lent it to my sister and brother-in-law, and their reaction was mostly the same.

It now sits on my shelf unplayed, but I haven't totally given up on it.

Great two-player game.  Nice components (big for me) and good gameplay. I will agree that it is very hard to be Jack, but after a couple of games you start to figure out ways to make it last all eight turns. My wife enjoys playing this with me and so that automatically gives it a place on our gaming shelf. Wish it was more readily available in the US.

RATING: 7
I held off getting this game both because of its distasteful theme and because it has characters with special powers, which I usually don't like not only because it means more rules to remember, but also because it leads to confusion and often bickering over how different rules interact with each other.  We have the newer printing, which seems to have addressed many of these questions, tacking posts from bgg's faq to the end of the rulebook.  Read the rules and faq carefully and agree on what everything means BEFORE you play.  As for the theme, you can completely ignore it if you like; the game doesn't rely at all on the gruesome details and would work for any mystery theme.  This game can be very close, which is interesting, or someone can win almost immediately, which is rather anti-climatic.  However, the good news in that case is that it didn't take long and you can just play again.  Turns can sometimes drag while someone considers their options, but the game as a whole still plays quickly.  We were expecting the board to be variable set-up after learning the game, but that turned out not to be the case, so we worry this may become somewhat predictable after enough plays.  It has been fine for us so far though.  Most of the character's powers are well thought out to be useful in different situations.  The character tokens are similar to Fearsome Floors'; you have to apply the stickers yourself.  Be especially careful when applying the brown one with the arrow on it.  We didn't realize it would matter, and when we flip the token over (which you do during gameplay) the arrow is facing the wrong way.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the variable powers of the characters in this game.  The game also has plenty of tactical analysis for what initially looks like a light game.  Getting Jack to run off the board seems like a very difficult route to take.  Attempting to run off the board and failing usually means a quick game.  On the whole, it seems more difficult for the Jack player to win.  But it's not a long game, and there is plenty to think about, which is nice.  It's a fun game, but Roma fills a similar niche in my collection, and I currently enjoy Roma more.

So far I am enjoying this game. There is a good amount of tension as both players attempt to outsmart each other. My fiance hates playing as Jack. She doesn't think she is good enough at keeping Jack's identity a secret. She does enjoy playing the detective, but the amount of tension prevents her from enjoying this game as much as others. Maybe we will both be more comfortable with this game with a few more plays. I am sure there are plenty crafty moves just waiting to be unleashed.

I'm not sure how much of a deduction game this is as opposed to how much of a game it is of finding the clever plays given the current board situation. One player attempts to hide Jack the Ripper, the other to find him.

For the Jack player, this seems to boil down to trying to keep the suspects clustered together in the light, or spread out in the darkness as much as possible, as the detective player uses that as the main way to narrow down the field of suspects.

The main interest here seems to come from the variety of special powers, as each suspect has some ability to bend the rules.

Probably a game that requires equal experience for compelling play, simply because seeing that good move would be easier once one was intimately familiar with the characters and how they can be used.

I don't think I would play it regularly, but a decent little 2 player game.

I am not sure if Mr. Jack is a great game I am incapable of fully understanding, or a mediocre game which I am occasionally drawn to play. Regardless, every so often I do find myself drawn to play it, and it is always an interesting and fun experience. I do not mind the see-saw nature of the mechanisms. I do struggle to see longterm strategy, I am afraid. More play (and perhaps more skill) might see this rating rise.

OK, so what the hell is the deal with European designers and "cuteing" up subjects like Jack the Ripper?  I mean come on, the titular character is a serial killer that disembowels prostitutes!  Seriously, "Euro-cute" is getting close to the "super deformed" thing from Japan.  I hate it.  Anyway, MR. JACK is a reasonably interesting game that has both a threadbare theme and a threadbare connection to anything approaching the potential greatness that a Jack the Ripper game could offer .  Ripperologists will likely chafe at ahistorical characters like "Miss Stealthy" or the inclusion of Sherlock Holmes (which I thought was kind of cool) but the bottom line is that beyond the title, spare atmosphere, and cutie-pie artwork MR. JACK is really just a lightweight, semi-abstract deduction/bluffing game for two with a reasonable playtime given its depth and mechanics.  The characters (mutually controlled by both players) have fun abilities (the cop blows a whistle and drags characters toward him, Holmes can eliminate suspects) and there's some really interesting ways that the detective player and Ripper player can use the same abilities for entirely different strategies.  The endgame is either pretty brain-burning or a foregone conclusion but for a 30 minute game it's a forgivable sin, I guess.  It's the kind of game where toward the end you usually wind up forced into the One Move You Can Do To Possibly Win or just losing outright.  It's not a bad game at all, but it's thoroughly average on pretty much every count.

After a dozen of plays, I realize it's the opposite : exiting the map is very difficult for Jack ! This will depend on which character Jack is.
It's quick to play (about 20 minutes) which gives the opportunity for 2 opponents to switch seats in the same sitting.

October 2007 - Played our first night with the wife.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Wife thought there was too much thinking and didn't like it when she made a mistake that I was able to capitalize on.  Rating will go up/down depending on whether someone can win as Jack or not.  In both games we played, Jack was discovered.

I don't like it when my wife takes a random guess on one of the two remaining pieces.

Kids are pretty good at this one too.

Played as the detective and then as Mr. Jack.  Enjoy the game.  Can see what Darryl says about how the game could be anticlimactic if the end results in essentially a coin toss between two suspects.  Must be aware of the fact that two characters start off the game in a possible quick win position.

RATING: 7.5
Logic, deduction and planning are a real asset in this game and I appreciate that.  I think the only downside is that luck can be a significant factor - if the character cards come up at the right/wrong time that can be a huge help/hindrance.  Still, I think it has potential and I look forward to trying it more.

Played twice, once as Jack and once as Detective.  I like the concept, but felt like it was too short of a game.  On the first game, I was detective and Miss Stealthy escaped in the first round.  Apparently the game was designed with that possibility on purpose, but it was still frustrating.  Feels too random with the card draws.

This is the current brain burner 2 player game in my collection.  In some respects, Mr. Jack feels like playing chess.  Need to consider many possible moves, plus look into the future moves following the current moves.  I feel a lot of tension each round.  I don't think this will appeal to casual gamers.

Played this a few times, it's good for a quick session of fun. What I like best was that the characters have a good diversity of abilities, which gives this game a good overall sense of variety. It's not that difficult to play, very casual to me. I would rank this, for the theme (finding out who the killer is) above Clue.

Great game that immediately captured me with how clever the design was and how quickly you could play it (big bonus for me ).  A competitive 2 player game that is largely a logic puzzle that combines tactical movement, hidden roles, and logical deduction.
The new artwork is a home-run and does an excellent job of immersing you in the theme of being the paranoid detective leaving a nicotine-laden trail in his search for Jack or being Jack himself and slinking in the shadows looking for the perfect opportunity to slip away just out of the detective's grasp.
Hats off to designer Bruno Cathala, very good game!

I bought this because of the great reviews it has even though I generally do no like deduction games.  I am very happy I got it as it is a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly brain burning game that allows a lot of clever play.  The abilities of the characters are what make the game.  The fact that every other round a player gets to go twice in a row especially adds to the amount of danger present, and allows clever combinations.  Also, the "Jack can't escape when he was seen last round" rule makes choices difficult for Jack and the inspector.  For Jack, is it worth having all of the suspects in the light so the inspector cannot figure out who Jack is, and the reverse for the inspector.  The ability to plan ahead is essential, especially since half the time you know which character cards will be available in the next round, and you have to plan carefully based on the play order.  

All this, and the partner will play it!  What more can I ask for?

I've loved the few plays I've managed so far.  Really clever deduction game for two players.  It's very tough on Mr. Jack and the pacing of the game is really decided by their actions but that can also be seen as a strength depending who your opponent is.  Plenty of room for deception and double-think style gameplay.

Brilliant.

RATING: 8
Me and the wife really liked this game. Super simple and easy to play game. We love the deduction aspect and how it is a two player without the feel of "You screwed me over!". With the way the actions of the people take place it makes for a very fun game and one I will play a lot.

I love teaching this to my parents/family.  I think everyone's good for at least 2 rounds (one of each side).  Does it have a lot of replay value?  I don't know.  I like watching people "get" it, so my game may be different from what the designers intended.

This is a decent game which has a bit more luck than I care for in that you never know what characters are going to be available to play.  I also think it's too easy to move characters about via manhole which makes it pretty difficult for the detective depending on what characters are drawn.

One of the best 2-player games out there - it is a strategic cat & mouse game where the detective attempts to uncover Jack the Ripper, who is disguised as one of the characters.

Hmmmmm.  I don't "get" this.  Jack's side SEEMS impossible.  

It's almost like some games nowadays are like an inside joke.  Either you get them or you don't and you gotta keep banging your head away until you either "get" it or you hurt yourself.  For now, I'm interested enough to keep trying Mr. Jack.  Let's see how long that lasts.  

UPGRADE.  Oooooh.  Oookaaaay.  We weren't playing with the rule that adjacent characters are "seen".  This helps Jack considerably and diminishes a problem we had with revealed and "obsolete" characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty sure Jack is 0/8, which has kept this game on the shelf.

I need to find a regular partner for this one and work out the balance.

I remember feeling the same way about Twilight Struggle, and OH BOY was I wrong.  Hopefully the same can be said about Jack.

I have played this several times now.  I definitely enjoy it but it seemed much harder for Jack to win (in my first game I was the detective and won in 4 or 5 rounds).  Once I get to play more, I'll see if it is as good as I've heard from both sides.  But the expansions I have may help.

Mr Jack is one of my favorite two player games. There's just so much to think about when it's your turn whether you play the Inspector or Mr Jack. But the best thing about it: It has kind of a narrative arc. In the beginning, Mr Jack tries to hide it's identity. Once Mr Jack's identity is discovered, the game can develop into a wild chase.

It's just a lot of fun. The only thing you should be aware of: There is the potential for analysis paralysis since you are confronted with a lot of options each turn.

RATING: 8
A clever tactical game of hide and seek. My only gripe with it is that there sometimes really isn't much you can do, either when playing Jack in the first few rounds, since roughly half of characters will be in the spotlight anyway, or if you get a bad draw of available moves in the latter rounds when playing the Inspector, when all you can do is move the characters you know are innocent anyway. Nevertheless, this is a very interesting game and the components are also top notch, so I can thoroughly recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellent light game with lots to think about - components are good as well. Easy to explain in 10 minutes but interesting gameplay. Very good (cartoonish) artwork which does however strike a slightly odd note given the (real)subject matter. Will pick up the expansion.

RATING: 7
Solid two player deduction and movement game.  Eight characters move over a cartoon style game board depicting Whitechapel in the 1880's.  One of the characters is the notorious Mr. Jack, known to the Jack player.  The other player is trying to deduce who Mr. Jack is, and nail him by moving another character to his position to accuse him to win the game.  If Jack can survive eight turns, or move Mr. Jack off the game board - he wins.  Nice simple rules, spiced up by each character having a special power.  First half of the game is deduction (which isn't that hard) and the second half is all about movement and position.  It's a nice two player game, however The Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has it licked in gameplay.  (Production warning - the Alibi cards tend to "glow" their colour which ruins the game somewhat.  Take a black marker to the edges to disguise them more - you do need to do this!).

I got this as a present. It is really good although after a couple of games I kind of felt that it was not quite the gem I thought it was. Can't really put my finger on it, but it has been said, that it is hard to play strategically because of the random character availability. That might be it. This is not a flaw of the game though. It is nice. I plays 45 minutes which is a great time for a two player game, has different roles, which I like, has different objectives for the players, too. Personally, I do not quite like the look of the game. I'd have preferred a super dark gothic look, but I can see why they choose differently. Try it!

Fun deductive 2-player game.  Game has 8 characters, one of whom is secretly Jack the Ripper.  One player is trying to catch Jack and the other is playing Jack trying to avoid detection and hopefully escaping the district.  Neat game, but perhaps to prone to analysis paralysis.

This is a 20-minute game that has a hefty amount of deep thinking.   The secret ingredient is that it plays almost like a miniatures game, moving characters and using special abilities.  Good stuff.  The initial concern is that the game seems to favor the Detective, but with experience the win ratio is something like 60/40 in favor of the Detective (per online stats).  Turn 5 is often pivotal for the Detective.

I have a bit of an emotional tie to this game so that gives it a bump in the ratings. Thinking back I remember to when I first bought the game thinking it was expensive at $45 MSRP I think. Then I traded and re-bought which usually means I really like the game. The era of game development that this fits into has passed. One of simpler rules, nice components but not overproduced and an emphasis on accessibility and function. Which is a shame because I'd love to see more games like this than ones that are overwrought with rules and sub-systems. I like that it focuses on a single mechanic (trying to see or not see Jack before he escapes) and just does it exceptionally well.

RATING: 7
This game reminded us of an easy-ish Mastermind.  

The game is slightly more challenging than it originally appears, but the challenge is weighted in favor of the Detective.  That isn't such a horrible thing necessarily as it does add an extra layer of strategy for whoever is playing as Mr Jack to outwit and/or outlast to prevail.  I personally like playing as Mr Jack more for just this reason though I have yet to win. heh

The design of the game is cartoony goodness which I really enjoy, and I appreciate that they added stickers for the people tokens on the board rather than just plain old wooden colors.  It really helps you get into the world of Mr Jack.

Because of the character design and challenge of playing as Mr Jack, I'll play this game on a semi-regular basis.  It's a good quickie before you move on to a more serious title later in the evening.

Good two player deduction game.  I don't feel the game is balanced properly between Jack and the Investigator but it certainly doesn't detract from the fun, especially if during your sessions you take turns being Jack and the Investigator.  There is some deduction involved with the game and despite being about Jack the Ripper the game is fairly cartoony and light-hearted since there is no actual killing being done in the game.

A grand game overall, but being the investigator gives me a special thrill. There's nothing I love more than giving an overblown, melodramatic speech and unmasking Jack.

"Through careful analysis, the light of justice will always pierce through the fog of misdeeds! Miss Stealthy, I accuse YOU of being Jack the Ripper!"

It's super fun when I can divine who Jack is because of my opponent's behavior, even if there are lots of suspects left.

Great deduction game.  It's much lighter than most, yet reatains the deductive reasoning mechanic that I enjoy.  Just when I was thinking that it was lopsided toward the good guys, I won playing both sides against the same person, who is no dolt, and both games were close.  There are multiple paths to victory for Mr. Jack, which makes up for the lopsidedness against him very nicely.

RATING: 5
It's like two person clue and surprisingly strategic, and perhaps overly so. For a couple's game, it plays very quietly, as opponents must carefully position themselves with each move. The game feels fairly balanced between Jack and the Detective but I think the Detective holds a slight advantage. Its a pretty good strictly 2p game, and fills a good niche for when I'm tired of playing 2p card games and need a board game fix.

Clever cat and mouse game that seems unbalanced against poor Jack.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One player is the Detective, and the other player is Jack the Ripper. There are 8 characters on the board. One of them is Jack, but his identity is unknown to the Detective. Both players have partial control over all the characters. To win, the Detective must accuse Jack within 8 turns. In order to do this, he must correctly deduce Jack's identity, then get another character to Jack's location. Jack wins if he escapes the city, if he remains unaccused after 8 turns, or if the Detective falsely accuses the wrong character. Jack may only escape if he was not witnessed on the previous turn. Through control of the characters available, their positions, the careful movement of street lamps, manhole covers, and roadblocks, the players play a cat-and-mouse game of risk, bluffing, and wit.

(As of [b]3[/b] plays) An abstract strategy game with a well-developed deduction theme pasted over it. Early plays have a lot of Analysis Paralysis going on, but that improves once the patterns involved in movement and light start becoming apparent. Similarly, the imbalance in favor of the Inspector will gradually be eroded with experience.

Cute little 2-player deduction game. One player is the detective & has to hunt down Jack the Ripper by working out which of the other investigators he's impersonating.

Mr. Jack is an awesome two player game.  Rules were well written.  The cards icons were very easy to remember after the first game.  Set up time was quick so the game may be played several times in one sitting.  

The investigator tries to figure who Jack is impersonating before he escapes.  Jack will try and walk away to commit yet another heinous act.  I highly recommend it. [url=http://im-smiley.com][img]http://im-smiley.com/imgs/evil/evil005.gif[/img][/url]

I still want the original version. - I really enjoyed this, but I'm thinking along with others that the game favours the detectives over Mr Jack. But it is still a nice game, with a smart central mechanism of being seen or unseen. Will play again soon. *** Am finding it very hard to split the last two suspects. I'm beginning to think the pudding is a little over-egged. Too many people, too many abilities, too many access holes. I'm thinking that maybe Jack needs help, maybe the ability to cancel an ability once a round, or every other round. Still I have won as detective and lost as Jack. Hmmmmm....

I had high hopes for this one; me and my GF both love puzzles and deduction. However, this one fell flat. We played it around 5 times, and I don't expect it to come out again. 

Maybe it's the lack of randomness. Maybe it's just not as much about figuring out who, as it's about figuring out clever ways to move guys around.

Note, however that this is not a bad game. It's just not what I had hoped for.

RATING: 7
Do you  like Scotland Yard or Incognito?  This is a 30 minute game for only 2.  Cleverly done; and beautiful, sturdy pieces.  Very Nice.  Replayable.

Also, I am very impressed with the number of tactics one can use to mislead and escape, or seek and capture.  I discovered I had to constantly change my game plan, because my opponent did an unexpected move or I couldn't get the card I wanted. This fexibility creates exciting game play.
 
Cons--I think it is very hard for Jack to win, to the point that it seems unbalanced.  I will have to play this a few more times to see, but it is not uncommom for Jack to be captured on round 4.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ingenious game of cat & mouse where the light is at times your shield or your curse.  To escape, Jack has to be invisible; to lower your chances of exposure, you have to try to stay in the light with as many other suspects as possible.  Therein lies the challenge, when and how to break free.  My two complaints about the game is that for Jack to escape, a fair measure of luck is required in the available characters when the opportunity would be there, and for Jack to outlast exposure, there is no reason for the investigator not to take a gamble to expose him.  At that point the odds depend on the number of unconfirmed suspects.  We find the ending anticlimatic when it comes down to a gamble.  The rest of the game though has a great feeling and packs a whole lot of tension for such a minimalist design.

Finally played for the first time as both Jack and the investigator.

Somewhat interesting, but I'm struggling to get the strategy.  Since the various characters are usually always within 3 of another character, you really need, as Jack, to wait until the odd turns where the Jack character is not available for your use.  You want to use the other characters to move away from Jack so that he is not seen, and then on the even turn where you go first, you can move him out.

That also means that Jack needs to hug an exit.

In both games I played, Jack was known within 3 turns, but was able to escape because when he was discovered he was already next to an exit and Jack moved first the next turn.

Not a fan of the slightly cartoony artwork.  Would have preferred something a little more realistic.

Jury is out on this until I know how to correctly play both roles.

UPDATE: of course I forgot that Jack could wait out the inspector, so now it becomes a little easier as Jack since you could try to clump things up so that everyone is near everyone else.

Downgraded to 4 since I think things are still slanted in the Inspectors favor, although I don't feel there are multiple paths to victory for Jack, and really only 1-2 ways to play him.

RATING: 7
Fun.  The beginning games proved hard for Jack.  I want to play this a bunch more times from both sides.
Jack came close in a number of games and then I finally won one as Jack.

Game play is quick enough yet I always feel like I actually did something without a lot of luck.  High replay value and high desire for replay.  A great game.  Too bad it's only 2-player.

My wife had an interesting reaction to the game.  She grinned a few times while I explained the rules.  But then after we played it twice, she said she thought the game was "cute", but felt too much like playing chess.

Crafty little game that's perfect for family play.  The street lamp mechanic is really nice and feels new, which gives this short game a fresh feel.  It's one of those short, simple games that can be played on a deep level with adults or a fun level with kids (my 8-13 year olds all enjoy it).  This game has the fun of a secret identity and the fun of being sneaky against your opponent.

This game doesn't seem as deep as I thought it would be.  Many games play extremely quickly - over in a few turns.  The biggest surprise to me was how quickly suspects are often eliminated.  A tough game for Mr.Jack, but an enjoyable 2-player deduction game for either side.

It has been said a lot that this game feels like mastermind. I beg to disagree. The deduction part is so simple that the game is mostly one of forcing your opponent to place the pieces in a configuration that is optimal for you. Therefore to me, that game feels more like an abstract movement game than a deduction game. That being said it is a truly excellent movement game, and the theme meshes in quite well. You can try a lot of different tactics: to bluff your opponent, to setup a complex position, to block some pieces... The assymetry is well-balanced and it is really fun and challenging to play on either side. Thanks to Hurrican for the brilliant idea of taking this micro-edited game and bringing it to a wider audience.

A clever, asymmetric game for two players, with the Inspector trying to apprehend Jack before he can escape the city in the dead of the night. The game focuses on the struggle between the two players to uncover Jack's identity or keep it hidden, using the various witnesses and their special abilities to further their goals.

After four plays, I am finally getting excited about this game. The key to the game is the ability to play Mr. Jack. The inspector's main job is to capitalize on Mr. Jack's mistakes. There are layers of intricacies to this game that only become apparent after multip[le plays. It seems to be the best two player hidden role game I have played to date.

I never really had any interest in this game but then I won it at a convention.  I was just going to trade it away or sell it but when my gf saw it she said it looked really fun. So we broke it out and played it and like everything else, she was right.  It was fun and I think we'll be playing it alot more.  Good, quick, little deduction game.

RATING: 7
Mr. Jack comes off as somewhat of an abstract with a well-integrated theme (Although, I wish they didn't go with the cartoony art.) It fills my need for a sleuthing game and it is easy to teach and creates tension for both players. The "luck-of-the-draw" when it comes to the four characters that come out each round means this game will never be truly strategic nor highly skill-based. But for a non-meaty abstract/Euro hybrid, Mr. Jack is very satisfying.  And who wouldn't want a game about a prostitute killer evading capture?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Packs a lot within a quick game. can get very tense with every turn making or breaking the game. I'm usually not a fan of deduction games, but this one was highly engaging and demanded multiple plays. Could cause some serious Analysis Paralysis  for those susceptible.

Brilliant deduction game.  The variable powers, varying victory conditions, and relatively quick playing time with good depth all add up to a winning design.  The fact that Mr. Jack is for two players increases the score for me, as I love deduction games, but most require a rather large gaming group to be successful.  I can see the game play getting stronger through repeat sessions as the strategies, and clarity of the character powers should become more intuitive.  Amazing it took so long for this design to get a publisher.

Da jeg f√∏rste gang st√∏dte ind i Mr. Jack blev jeg en lille smule skuffet over, at der ikke var tale om et deduktionsspil i mere klassisk forstand. Det havde v√¶ret min forventning. Det var dog alligevel et spil, der takket v√¶re tematikken tiltalte mig og deduktionsmomentet er bestemt ogs√• tilstede, n√•r man f√•r dykket lidt dybere ned i spillet i forhold til at kunne forudsige hvilke muligheder man selv og ens modstander vil have i forhold til de personer der er tilstede nu og i den kommende runde m.m.m. Og takket v√¶re denne m√•de at implementere deduktionsdelen p√• er spillet ikke t√∏rt p√• samme m√•de som f.eks. Sleuth. Et spil der kun bliver bedre med tiden!

After one play as the detective, I love the game.  Simple rules, but fairly tense deductive gameplay.  Definitely more tense as the killer!  The characters are well-balanced, with some becoming less powerful as the game goes on while others become more useful.

After more plays, the game has not gotten boring or repetitive.  I like the fact that there is just one bit of luck - which four cards come up after shuffling every two rounds is crucial.

won at auction. received 5-4-07. Two games produced a mixed reaction. First game went to the last turn last player before victory was determined. Second game ended in two turns with a fake out and then run to freedom at night with only two suspects left. Need another play or two to see if the game often ends quickly or if the game we played was a fluke. Two more plays. I think that the rating is correct for now. The game is fun but can be very luck dependent.

Truly an excellent game design that is based on one of the most infamous serial murder sprees in recorded history.

The White Chapel Murders exemplifies the maxim that truth is stranger than fiction, and actual horror can be just as revulsive as anything imagined.

Look at the pictures of the butchered victims of the "Ripper" if you doubt this veracity.

Dracula by Kosmos is an excellent 2 player, deductive game with a dark theme. But Dracula is fictitious, and so are his victims. The women who were disected by the the White Chapel killer were real people. If this game was called "Mr. Jeffrey" (Jeffrey Dahmer) or "Mr. Richard" (Richard Speck) would the game enjoy the popularity of Mr. Jack? Remember, the attitude of Mr. Jack is comedic...the images of the characters, real and fictitious, are a burlesque, they are mere caricatures of the people represented; the effect of this treatment of the theme is a trivialization of the historical event.

There is a line that some gamers feel uncomfortable crossing. Mr. Jack, IMO, crosses that line.

This is an excellent 2 plater deduction game. Loads of fun for gamers to families. It may take a few plays to pick up on some of the startegies in the game. Also, I can see some people may have issues with AP, but that should pick up with a few plays and not be to bad of a problem.

The game looks great and the components are very well made. With big thick cards, wooden tokens and a nicely detailed game board. If your still unsure about the game. You can try it online for free at hurricane games.com

Many thanks to my friends Raimond and Mats, for introducing and getting me hooked on this game. I love it.

I part with my fellow geeks here.  Pretty game, but my experience after multiple plays with multiple players, is that the game is broken in the detective's favor.  We went so far as to allow selection of cards by Jack, and still Jack can't win without a mistake by the detective.  I think the expansions were meant to fix this, so perhaps if you're willing to sink more $ into the game it may be ok.  As is, it's only good for the initial novelty.  Should be a fine kids game.

A brilliant game that's a lot of fun to play with my wife. Don't pull it put too often, as not much changes from game to game.

A modular board and/or random setup would probably improve replay value, but likely at the cost of balance.

The components are nice and the artwork is fun which really adds to the overall experience.  Nicely done!

Mr. Jack is a 2 player game in which one of the players is the Detective and the other is Jack the Ripper.

This medium/light game takes about 40 minutes of play and has a set of very simple yet deep rules.

The goal of the detective is to uncover the identity of Mr. Jack and the goal of Jack is to either escape from the game board or to not be uncovered in the game‚Äôs 8 turns.

For 2 players.

Mr. Jack is a cute but intense tactical puzzle game of bluff, positioning, and lookahead.  It's not really a "deduction" game.  It's a game of "if I do this, then she'll have to do that, leaving me with this move, unless she knows that this character is innocent, in which case . . . ."  The interaction of the characters' abilities and the lamps and the sewers and the turn order and the adjacency rule creates some wonderfully complex situations.

Unfortunately, Jack faces long odds if the detective plays flawlessly.  Fortunately, achieving flawless play as the detective is damn hard.  The game's enthralling even if Jack is usually caught.  As Jack, if you can force the detective to make a 50/50 guess at the end, you're doing a good job.  If you can subtly bluff him so that he chooses the wrong suspect, then you're doing an outstanding job.

The "Jack flees the board" victory condition is like the temple connection win in Attika.  A good player can almost always prevent it if he devotes enough attention, but doing so will slow down his investigation, buying Jack time.  The threat of escape is crucial to the game, even if it never actually happens.

Wow!  Great 2-player game.  Played 6 times in a row with the wife.  Great tension and quick play.  Best 2-player game out there.  Easy to learn and deceptively tactical play.

Although the rules are simple, there can be several difficult descisons to be made per round.  Do not play this game with people prone to "analysis by paralysis".  A quick 15 minute game can turn into a 45 minute borefest.  I played with a buddy of mine who plays poker a lot and the game went forever.

Mr Jack is a deductive game for two people that manages to balance mechanics with theme in a marvelous way.

Each piece of the board adds something to the game. More than that, each turn adds to the tension on both players. 

At its best, the game becomes a thriller movie.

A game I didn't take to at all at first.  It just seemed to be over too quickly, and too easy for Jack to win.  After repeat plays the  strategies become more familiar and there's much more to the game.  Still a quick game, but in a good way once you have the hang of how the characters powers work.  This one will grow on you.

Chess like brain-burner of a game. There are very few moves that make up a game of Mr. Jack (you will pick and move 16 characters through the course of an entire game, IF you play the full 8 rounds). But there are SO many possibilities for your moves. I don't like how intensely you need to concentrate. I don't like how you must think through the consequences of an entire round before making your first move; its almost like both players sit for 10 minutes when a round starts thinking about all the possible outcomes and then you spend 60 seconds grabbing and moving the 4 characters around. 

So what is good then? I love the challenge of escaping (much harder for Jack to win, especially when new to the game). There is LOTS of room for some sneaky, clever plays. This one rewards repeated play as there is so much information to consider when making your moves. I love the subtle deduction that goes on (if Sherlock was Mr. Jack why did he move here instead of here? But is that to make me think Lestrade is Mr. Jack? etc.). I like how some seemingly insignificant plays can have a big impact if you come up with a good strategic play.

All in all, not fantastic, but fun and a keeper. I will play from time to time. Mostly, though, if I have a partner willing have a drink and a conversation over a slow thinking man's (or woman's) game.

Occupies a very nice bit of ground where theming, mechanics, production value, and strategic depth intersect. Remains to be seen if this game will have staying power or be a gimmick game that burns brightly for several plays before losing its luster. I sense it will be the most fun learning tactics and secrets in tandem with another new player. Hopefully my wife will enjoy it.

Mr. Jack is a good 2 player game.  One player is the detective and try to find what is the identity of Mr. Jack.  The other player is Mr. Jack and try to escape in the darkness or survive for 8 turn before the detective catch him.

2007 acquisition.  Good little game that doesn't take long to play and you can easily play a few games in an hour.  We've only played 5 games of it and we found that the player who played Mr. Jack appear to have a more difficult task of escaping or staying undiscovered.  Perhaps, this would change with repeated plays.  Certainly you'd need to think harder about your moves as Mr. Jack.  Do you plot to escape the crime scene?  Or do you attempt to stay undiscovered?

Overall, we don't mind the game nor the theme and will try again if we need a short game to fill in time.

While I basically like the idea of this game, the execution of it is too simple. It's too easy to uncover Jack, but sometimes you can't catch him because the cards you draw doesn't allow you to play the pieces you need or vice versa when you're Jack trying to escape. So the game is ok until the endphase in which Jack is uncovered when it becomes too luck dependent for ambitious gamers.

A very nice little deduction game for two.  The board and pieces are very attractive and the gameplay is very accessible. It bothers me a little bit that they didn't indicate where the pieces start on the board. It wouldn't have distracted, and it would ceraintly speed up the set up. (I have cut small bits from the sticker sheets and applied them to the board.) 

The game plays very quickly, and it works really well. If you can survive the first couple of rounds (as Jack), your task gets a little easier, but not much.

As a rule, I generally don't care for deduction games, but I quite like this one.

Fun, simple game - almost abstract, but with variable character powers. The fact that you don't actually have any control over which characters you'll get to move on each turn is actually a great, surprisingly suspenseful mechanic. I'm not sure why they felt the need to call it a Jack the Ripper theme when they don't actually use it much, though.

A one-on-one deduction game with area manipulation. Mr Jack is quick and satisfying. Often play multiple games in a row, but after several matches with the same individual, the same strategies begin to crop up. This is a very fun game where sometimes you feel powerless. More often then not, both sides will enjoy playing each time.

Excellent marriage of gameplay and theme (okay, the subject is a bit morbid, but if you like, imagine that Jack just ripped the "do not remove" tags off of mattresses... it doesn't really matter what he did in terms of the gameplay), and a very creative new kind of mystery game. Others have described it as a combination of chess and Clue, and I think that's very apt. Like most games, it took me a game or two of "what??" before it all fell into place as to what I was supposed to be doing. At that point, a game can go a few directions for me; "Ah, okay, now I get it... Let's play something else now." or "Ah, okay, now I get it... We'll have to play that again sometime." or "Ah, okay, now I get it... Let's play that again!"  This was definitely in the latter category for me, and I immediately created several games right away at http://mrjack.biludi.de/ and I'm now waiting for the box version to arrive. For something that seems so simple and is set up the same way every game, it can play out a remarkable number of ways. A brilliant and very clever design and a really fun game!

Mr. Jack is a clever, 2-player deduction game that is fast, fun and challenging.  While the rules are simple and the mental gymnastics required aren‚Äôt overly taxing, it still requires clever movement and ability combinations in order to be successful.  The detective player may have a slight advantage, but it is only slight.  My matches have all been tense, and haven‚Äôt been decided until the final turn or two.  In the hands of a clever player, Mr. Jack can be quite devious and slippery, and catching him will take all of your skills as a detective.  Indeed, the real "Mr. Jack" hasn‚Äôt been reliably unmasked in over a century -- and the detective here has only 30 minutes or so to do so!

RATING: 8
Very good asymmetric game, a brain burner where one player tries to discover the identity of Jack the Ripper and capture him, while the other attempts to escape or remain undiscovered long enough. It seems a little unbalanced against Jack's player, though. Also, I'm not fond of using a real murderer for the theme, but fortunately the game does not deal with the murders, and the lighthearted approach makes it bearable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
fabulous option for 2 players!  Asymmetrical to the point that the two players are really playing two different games, even though they're going by the same rules.  The Inspector is playing a deduction game, while Jack is playing a bluffing game.  The deduction aspect has built-in book keeping so no pads of paper on which to scribble little notes.  Jack's game is mostly trying to throw the inspector off the trail, while trying to keep the number of characters with alibis to a minimum.

I really want to like this game, but for some reason I just find it irritating.  Some people claim that there is more to the game than the inspector just trying to split up the suspects and Jack trying to keep them bunched together, and apparently at some advanced stage of the game some kind of bluffing happens.  I have a hard time believing that, and in any case, the game isn't interesting enough to warrant the amount of time it would (apparently) take to get there.  A serious dud.

Great game. I love this game. A combination of strategic positioning and deduction skills; like Chess meets Clue.

Light enough to pick up and play quickly, but complex enough to require some real decision-making. Random elements add just a small bit of luck but greatly increase replayability.  Definitely a little tougher for the Mr. Jack player, but that works well if you have a more advanced gamer who could use a slight handicap.

Certain winning conditions (such as escape) are very difficult, but keep things interesting.

Probably my favorite 2-player game.

This is a really great short two player euro game.  It can be a little bit of a brain burner, as you consider the different possible moves each person might take under different circumstances to figure out what you can do to best improve your position.  It reminds me of an abstract game in that regard, but the theme here is very strong.  The special powers and the "terrain" are very thematic.  I haven't played enough to know if it is balanced for jack vs. good guys, BUT its so short that if it was unbalanced you could each play both sides.  There aren't that many great short deep 2 player euros --- this game fills a pretty unique niche, and it fills it well!

A quick playing game of strategy and deduction.  One player tries to eliminate suspects, while the other tries to move the pieces to make the first player's task more difficult.

Game pieces are of excellent quality!  There was a problem when they cut the cards as the card's color is visible on the sides (a bad thing).  They suggest placing the deck in the box so the side is not visible.  This solution works quite well.

I think I might be in the minority for this rating, but hear me out. I personally feel this game is really skewed in the detective's favor. Within the first round or so the detective has already eliminated half of the 8 suspects. I understand this is supposed to feel like a cat and mouse chase, but I feel that both players should really have equal chance of winning. Now after more plays, my opinion may change, but for now, it might be a little while before I try to bring this to the table again. I personally feel this is a game you should try to get on sale if you're interested. I don't think I would feel so burned if I had waited to get it on sale.

Very nice artwork, by the way - but the board material is too thin, which is kind of a letdown.

Great tension packed in 30/45 minutes of deduction game. Playing the role of the Detective or Jack the Ripper will grant different feels to the game. I enjoy detective work better where LL prefers playing Jack.
Played more games as Jack and the game gets considerably more challenging.

I like the idea of the suspect mechanic here, and the use of pools of light on the board to reveal identity, etc. There isn't all that much to it though, really.

RATING: 7
Fun game - not necessarily a deduction game, but rather more an abstract placement game.  Theme and cool components and a nice board certainly helps.  You're essentially trying to move each piece such that it will flip over, while the other player moves each piece so that they all stay colour-side up.  But theme makes it much cooler.

Fabulous components, pretty easy to explain, and a quick playing time. Unfortunately I rarely play two-player games so this never gets to the table. I have some concerns about the fixed set up and how that affects long-term playability but since I've only played this 7 times in a year that's not exactly a real world concern. I wish that the board had some markings to make set up easier.

I think that you can be screwed as Jack from the get go, depending on who Jack is.  However, the game is short and it seems that it has lots of interesting decisions that are made each turn.  It also seems like it could descend into a lot of AP since you can analyze the hell out of what options are available.

Awesome hidden-character game. Two player game. T√∫ eres o Jack el destripador o el detective y debes o evitar que te atrapen o atrapar. Si pasan 8 rounds y no han atrapado a Jack este gana, si Jack sale de la ciudad por una de las salidas tambi√©n gana. Lo interesante es que en cada round tanto Jack como el detective, mediante una mec√°nica de selecci√≥n, pide la ayuda o representa diferentes personajes. Jack puede mover tanto el personaje que en efecto es Jack (solo ese jugador lo sabe) como otros personajes para confundir al detective.

First played August 23rd, 2007.  This is a quick learn <5min) and a medium quick play (30min) as a two player game.  One player plays Mr. Jack and tries to escape and the other plays the policeman and tries to catch Mr. Jack.  It looked too simple to be true.  I thought that it would be pretty easy to capture Mr. Jack (who I played) however once we got into it, I realized that it can be a bit more tricky to figure out.  It reminded me a bit of Scotland yard, however for two people.  I liked it enough to play it again to see if my initial thoughs were correct, however I don't know if I'll play it beyond the 2nd play with so many other choices out there.  It does have a good mix of luck and strategy for what the game is.

This game .. great!
I had to admit i was a bit sceptic, but it all worked out fine. 
Its a great game. Some games they give a name and when you play the game you think... why did they name the game that way? Its just.. another cardplay.. with a name that is not realy related to the game at all. ( the feeling i had when i played Spy, it sounded very interesting, but once you played it .. just another card game in wich you have to collect cards...)
But with this game its different. When you play this game you can realy put yourself in your role. You as Mr jack trying to escape! or as the inspector tryin kick his ass!  I think this is a great game. I prefer boardgames over card games and me and my boyfriend where always looking for a nice game for the 2 of us.. And with this, we found one!

In the end though, I think my wife summed it up best: "It's just not fun."

A fun deduction game for 2 players. I think that it's a little difficult for Mr. Jack to win with the rule where he can't escape while "illuminated". It's far too easy, with the manholes, for the detectives to have somebody next to the last two characters not deemed innocent. Regardless, this is an imaginative implemenation with great components and doesn't play very long.

Some things about the game I didn't like is that if the right setup happens, the Jack player can win very easily. In the first game I played, I was the good guys and as it turned out Miss Stealthy was Jack. She got away on turn 1 because the Jack player had the card to move her and I didn't have a chance to move the police barricades. Incredibly frustrating and has affected my opinion of the game ever since.

I really like it - it's fast and above all - fun.  That's why it's so different from other deduction games.

EDIT: With experienced players I'd say the detective wins on 60-40 basis.  He has always (almost) a possibility to guess as his last resort.

EDIT2: The game too often falls in the same tracks (i.e. Jack staying visible very long/whole game because it is most efficient).  The Extension does not remedy this.  'The Carriage' (despite its merits) - neither.

Sold.

'Mr. Jack in New York' seems much better.

Very good unique little bluffing game that is themed quite well (read theme works together with mechanics nicely), no reason to play Clue ever again howver Clue utilizes deduction where as here it barely exists as this is more based on the process of elimination and puzzle solving (well I guess Clue is also the process of elimination).  

Elimination is exactly what you are trying to do as the detectives and exactly what you want to prevent if your Jack.  This means it becomes a tactical game of manoeuvring where the detective's job is to try to separate the characters into two equal groups so the max number can be eliminated, Jacks job is to stop this of course. One of the best parts of the game I think is how Jack can bluff the detective by a clever move at the right time leading to a planned 'mis-direction' which can even win Jack the game. 

Mostly tactical but neat tactics, outstanding components, chaotic which is a little unusual for a 2 player game, strategy mostly obvious and even more so for detectives but some decent choices to be made with the characters and their accompanying powers and a little planning to be had as well. I like the diminishing lights, movable barrides and movable manhole covers and the movement option the manholes provide, all neat stuff.

Nice short playtime makes this a great filler for two for weeknights

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 7 => 7.5 Really a great two player game and an especially good couples game, very easy to pick up and play as there are no cumbersome rules and always FUN to play. So far the best game I've played by any designers named Bruno...

RATING: 4
This game did not inspire me like it obviously inspired a lot of others.  I don't particularly care for the theme and I think that the deduction part of the game is less stimulating than Clue and Scotland Yard which are the only other deduction style games I've played.

One of the big pluses for me though is the fact that my wife will play it with me and it is much easier to win with the detectives.  This means that I can play as Jack and the two of us can actually have a competitive game.

UPDATE: Bumped my rating down to a 4 because last time someone suggested playing it I actively campaigned for something else.  I can see why people like it, but I don't enjoy it at all...

We have the 10th Anniversary edition released in 2016. The game has an excellent Chess like feel (obviously only in spirit, it is nothing like chess) with one way to set up the board each time, and each character having their own unique abilities. I loved this game, Bruno Cathala has a way of making games that are simple to learn, but brimming with complexity once you get beneath the surface. Fantastic game for two players!

Some folks call this "Clue for grownups".  At it's heart, though, it's not a deduction game - it's a movement game.  It's executed very well.  Just the right amount of stuff going on for a game of this length.  It also creates a nice sense of drama (for both players) as it builds to the end.  

Can be prone to a bit of analysis paralysis, if your partner is prone to such things . . .

When this was being taught to me, it was described as a cat-and-mouse game with deduction.  And that is what it is.  I had been looking to play this game for quite a while before I was able to find someone who had the game (with them) and had the time to teach it to me.  I was not disappointed.  I played as an Investigator--now I would like to play as Jack.  Update: I've played as Jack.  The game is now in the CABS library, but rarely am I in a situation where I have exactly two players, and there are so many two player games out there.

Two-player game featuring eight suspects wandering around the Whitechapel district, one of whom is really Jack the Ripper trying to escape the area before being caught. One player knows the identity of Jack, the other player tries to discover his identity and then catch him.

Having played a few times, I find the game quite enjoyable. It plays quickly, there is a lot to think about, and the artwork is nice (if a bit out of character for so grim a theme). I can't really conclude anything about game balance yet, but my games all ended with fast and convincing detective victories, which makes me worry that perhaps balance isn't quite right. Still, a nice if not overwhelmingly marvellous game.

A deduction game where you don't need to deduce anything.  Very elegant design, though I've yet to play a game that Jack wins.  Fits in to an awkward category for me - too long to be a quick game, but doesn't satiate my gaming desire more than something quicker, so it's up for trade.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2012)

Mr. Jack is a good game. The components and gameplay are very nice. You can explain the game under 10 minutes and play it under 30 minutes, still it is deep enough leaving me with a satisfying feeling after finishing it. Due to this, the game lends itself to multiple consecutive plays, almost always, we play this twice in a row but exchanging roles. Also, we often comment what mistakes or what plays we did during the game. Good stuff.
 
It has some luck of the draw with the characters and Sherlock¬¥s power and this bothers me a bit, but as the game plays so quickly I don‚Äôt mind much. I‚Äôm concerned about the game balance, in most of my games, the Jack player has lost and when I play Jack, I feel I have a lot less control. I¬¥m also concerned about replayability (thus the rating), so I bought the expansion to keep things different every play. 

For now, I plan to play this again soon.

Current Rating: 6.0
[hr]
2014-05-06

I still haven‚Äôt played with the expansion because I feel the base game still has a lot to offer. The replayability is no longer an issue for me, every game feels different and the decisions are not obvious.

My opinion of Mr. Jack continues to improve. It is true than winning as Jack is harder, but it is possible and VERY satisfying.

I will continue to play Mr. Jack in the near future and perhaps its rating will continue to rise. 

Current Rating: 6.5

Excellent, quick to play deduction game with decent gameplay too (i.e. unlike a number of other deduction games, it's not just a puzzle game with some bolted-on and largely irrelevent player pawns moving around a board).

Harder to play the Jack character than the Inspector character (mistakes by the Jack player are quickly punished), but certainly possible to win as either.

Good production values too - a winner. Alongside Schotten Totten, it's my favourite 2 player non-wargame

What is all the hype about this game?  The deduction is the rawest form of binary splitting... and the detective player should have no trouble figuring our who Jack is within 3 or 4 turns, max.

The rest of the game is all in the luck of the draw... Jack draws the right cards and avoids capture, he wins.  If the detective player can get the larger movement characters he can close on Jack and win himself... might as well flip a coin when Jack is discovered.

I own most of the Kosmos two-player line and, as a two-player game, Mr. Jack is inferior to nearly all of them.  There is just no fun here.

Regardless of play, Mr. Jack is definitely not worth its suggested list price... and probably not worth playing more than one or two times.

Vaguely reminiscent of Scotland Yard. Everything just feels natural and right--sign of good design. "Pick-a-role" works really well (better than e.g. 2p Citadels) because the roles are so well constructed and you use all eight over two turns. Plenty of opportunities for clever moves. At time feels like a light abstract, like Hive or Chess with hidden info. I miss the periodic revealing of "Jack" in S-Yard, and I don't think it will entirely replace it, even for two.

I am not fond of two player games because they tend to be one-sided--once a player has the lad itis hard to catch up, but I enjoyed Mr. Jack.  While Mr. Jack won all three games I played, it could have gone either way each time.  Jack escaped early twice and the other player did not predict that it was going to happen.  The best part was that the game only took about half an hour--more games in a short period of time means more opportunity to win.

A fixed version of Cluedo, in a way. This 2 player only game is a great head-scratcher as Jack tries to remain unindentified. Highly recommend playing this in sets of two with each player playing both sides - that way you can see who catches the other the quickest. Oh, and must mention the gorgeous artwork and the really thick card stock of the components.

This game has me thoroughly intrigued for the moment.  I like the chess-like mutual positioning of the 8 characters with respect to their unique 'special abilities' and 4/4 complete turn rotation.

Great deduction game with tons of replayability...just genius. Very fine components--simple yet very high quality. I love the tension of being Jack. Hang out for the first few rounds and then later try to set up possible escapes while getting yourself into the dark at the end of a turn. The characters' abilities make for some great combos, especially if you are skilled at bluffing. 

My wife routinely destroys me in this game, so naturally she thinks it's a blast.

I started this one out at an 8, but over time I have found it not to sustain interest. This is NOT a deduction game. It is a clever movement game, where the winner will be the player who can more cleverly move the right people into the right position to reduce or increase the suspects identified. I thought this would be a good, light game that I could teach and pick up with anyone, but nobody I have introduced it too has much of a desire to play it a second time. I would not turn down a game of Jack, it is quite clever after all, but I don't feel the need to own it any longer.

Interesante juego de deducci√≥n.

Un jugador es Mr Jack y el otro es el detective, tratando de descubrir cual de los 8 ocho distintos personajes es Mr Jack.

En cada turno los jugadores ponen a los candidatos en la luz o en la sombra, el detective tratando de eliminar algunos candidatos y Mr Jack tratando de confundir a su oponente y escapar. Cada personaje tiene un poder especial que puede ser usado para ayudar a los jugadores.

Est√° bien, bastante diferente a otros juegos.

Interesting deduction game.

One player is Mr Jack and the other one is the detective, trying to discover which of the 8 different characters is Mr Jack.

Each turn players put the candidates in light or in shadow, the detective trying to eliminate some candidates and Mr Jack trying to confuse his opponent and escape. Each character has a special power that can be used to help the players.

Good one, very different to other games.[/color]

Good, but not great, two-player filler.  I have always thought Mr. Jack as Miss Stealthy is overpowered, and can lead to an easy Turn 2 win.  Otherwise, the edge goes to the Detective player, I think.  Haven't tried the expansion, which may address some of these play balance concerns.

Rating based on about 10-12 plays.  (Dropped from initial 7 to a 6 because of concerns about play balance, as stated above.)

RATING: 4.5
The wife and I absolutely love Letters from Whitechapel, but it is rather involved and takes a while to complete (plus, we like it better as a game for more than 2 people, anyhow). So, for these reasons, we were in the market for a somewhat lighter and possibly quicker 2 player game that might be similar to LfW. I picked up Mr. Jack because of the similarity in theme and on the game shop owner' recommendation/testament to its popularity.  Unfortunately, after a few playthroughs we remain unimpressed.  For one, it dones't seem to have as much deduction strategy involved as we had hoped for.  Regardless of what you do as the detective, the options for suspects are narrowed down significantly and independently of your actions in the first portion of the game, which just seems wasteful.  Yes, the strategy does become more important throughout the rest of the game, increasingly so, however, it feels like the game is doing a lot of the mechanic for you in this regard.  For example, the pieces and suspects are all placed onto the gameboard in the same spots everytime, never varying.  It feels very inflexible for strategy buffs like us.  
The art is good, but the game board is pretty darn small, which provides the players -- especially Jack, with not as many options as you would like to have available to you.  Whereas London feels huge in LfW, Mr. Jack makes London feel like a city block surrounded by a wall.  

I'll be honest and say that we still need to give it a chance and play it for what it is rather than judge it against what it's not (LfW), but for now, this is going on the "meh" list. 

Oh, one more thing, since the tone is much more cartoonish and playful in Mr. Jack, I could see this being a great game for a family with young kids or teenagers.  THe strategies involved are basic enough for them to get down well and the theme is suitable, as opposed to the much more macabre feeling of LfW.

Initally was not impressed when I opened the box and one play. There wasn't much; eight character tokens, alibi cards, character cards, a witness card, turn marker and board. The game does get better with more plays. You really have to know how to play the different character advantages and really know your movement options durring play (the manholes) this game becomes really challenging. It starts off as a cat-in-mouse game with trying to confuse the inspector then it is an 'escape' out of town. It seems like a really simple game but it is fun playing Jack or the inspector. Overall - I like this game. I really think my wife will enjoy this game (which is why i wanted the game in the first place).

This is not really a deduction game at all, since half of the possibilities are usually eliminated on the first turn.  In fact, I was disappointed that it was so easy to figure out who Jack is.

The components are nice, making for a very thematic game.  I like that it plays quickly, and is made for two.

It seems interesting and quick deduction game. In our only play in Essen it seemed that it is pretty easy to know who Mr.Jack is by dividing the set of people in half. However, Mr.Jack has a turn too to spoil this tactics. So we might have overlooked some rule or tactics of the game. But the idea of the game is fun. People move in town, lamps are turned of and Mr.Jack announces each turn if he is visible (next to a lamp or other person) or not. By this information it is decided, which person is Mr.Jack.

Chess like concept, the best introductory game it comes to my mind.

The Good: Very nice board and components. I liked the artwork on the board. It is fairly short, did not overstay it's welcome. There is some very light deduction to be done. Each character having different abilities really helps this game a lot.

The Bad: The strategy is not intuive as it takes a while to get your head around it. It seems to me that this one is too difficult for beginning gamers and too light for experienced gamers.

One of my favorite two player games.  Really a neat design. The game favors the detective a little, which makes it rewarding when you win as Jack.  One character is by far better than the rest (the officer who can blow his whistle and bring characters to him, in addition to moving.  Might try a house rule...he can move OR use his ability, not both.)

Found a copy at HPB and grabbed it. It's a neat game. Somewhat feels a bit easy at times depending on who you are. Being the inspector is more fun I think than being Jack. Usually I find by around the 6th or 7th round it's obvious what's going on and becomes a race on who can accomplish the goal.

Wow, I just don't get what everyone else is so happy about with this game.  The deduction is blatantly obvious.  My first game was over in three minutes, and was most unsatisfying.

Meh. I like the art, the material, the rules, everything. However, the asymetrical difficulty is too steep and a bit annoying. The most logical and tactical player will always play Jack, because otherwise, he would never loose. I find that once the policeman finds out about possible tactics, it comes down to luck of the draw to determine if Jack is lucky... I wish it was more balanced between players.

Very nice game. At the begging very thrilling but after some games emotions are down. With two experienced players usually catching Mr. Jack is more matter of psychological observations then the game play itself. About 50 plays before recording.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Original game, but deeply flawed.  The most enjoyable part of the game is the potential for escape, and Mr. Jack simply cannot effectively escape in the this version unless the detective makes a serious error.

More importantly, the best strategy for Jack is to place everyone in the light, and that is simply not that much fun.

Mr. Jack New York is the what this game should have been ,but is not.

I've played it twice and really enjoyed it both times. It's definitely one of the most unique quick 2 player euros out there. The only reason I don't rate it higher off the hop is that I suspect that the game would grow old within a half dozens plays. Also, there is no reason that it needs to be $40. The components are just too much for a game like this. [b]7[/b]

RATING: 6.5
This is a light two-player deduction game with various random elements to change the playout of the game.  There is an array of suspects, each with their own special abilities, but the control and allegiance of these characters may be in doubt for most of the game.  I will have to play more games to see how replayable it is.  The simple fixed setup seems to require the randomizing elements to maintain variety, but it's unclear how often random draws may affect the outcome of the game.  Fortunately, it's faily short.

I really want to like this and I somehow I do like it, but... this isn't the bulls eye. Deduction element isn't that big (I love the genre) and there are some abstract elements included - but in the good way. For me, the biggest problem is that I've seen too much situations where Mr. Jack can't get out of the board (other player has to make some mistake) so Mr. Jack only goal is to keep enough suspects on board -> meaning that in the end police has to make 50/50 - 33/66 or guess or so. These games aren't that funny...

Summary: good looking game, some component issues, fun to play every now and then, enough luck included.

I wasn't expecting to like this 2 player deduction game but found it rather interesting and challenging in seeking to out-think and out-guess the opposing player.  Knowing each character has a special power, that Jack can only escape when its dark, and that each character will only come up for play 4x in a game makes for some interesting dynamics and planning ahead.  The green character in particular is potentially deadly as Jack with her extra space on a move and the ability to move through shadowed spaces.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
5 plays.

Nice original, asymmetrical cross between chess and clue, with a pinch of bluffing (and almost no deduction).

Playing Mr Jack is slightly more difficult (40 % wins, on mrjack.biludi.de/), but that gives some challenge.  Sometimes, it makes me keep the game in my closet, though, as we fear that playing Jack is actually hopeless.

The strategy seems to be quite limited (the inspector tries to roughly split the suspects in two groups [in the light or in the dark], while Jack tries to put them in the same group).

A great deduction game for 2-players where neither player needs to write anything down. The game offers interesting decisions for character movement by incorporating semi-random character availability and special powers. I find this combination to be a perfect balance of strategy and luck.

Many have criticized the game as favoring the inspector. Am I the only one who prefers to play as Mr Jack? As Jack, I have won far more games than lost. Two of those losses were 50-50 shots in the 8th round. Thus, I consider them moral victories!

Right about when we started learning about boardgames, [GAMEID=21763] started getting a lot of buzz.  Plus, it seemed like it would be similar to [GAMEID=1294], which she really liked but didn't work for two players.

Unfortunately, we are probably in the minority, but it didn't really work for us.  Part of the problem was one of expectations.  We were anticipating a game like [GAMEID=1294], where it would be mostly deduction-based.  And that is part of the game, since the detective player does need to identify the secret identify of Mr. Jack.  However, in practice [GAMEID=21763] played more like a tactical, positional game almost more similar to an abstract game like [GAMEID=2083] than to [GAMEID=1294].  It's a deceptively analytical, brain-burning game.  It's also a very reactionary game---it's hard to develop any long term strategies, since the useable characters are shared by the two players and they vary randomly every two rounds.  And while each of the characters does have a special ability, some of them seem much stronger than the others and it takes a lot of experience to be able to use the more subtle characters effectively.  All in all, it was definitely a lot more brain burn-y that we thought it would be.  

Also, it took a long time for either one of us to win as Jack, which also didn't help.  Most games ended up with Jack getting caught or getting to the end with basically a coin flip decision.

It's one of those games that I can appreciate, but probably will rarely hit the table due to the mental energy involved.  Most nights, by the time we get home, we're just too exhausted to play something this involved.

I need to play a few more times but my initial thoughts are very positive.  I feel there is a slight advantage being the detective, but who cares that is all part of the challenge, and the rules even with the FAQ and errata need some clarification.  However, the board, mechanism, ideas, theme and special abilities of each card ensure I will get this game out again at the earliest opportunity.

A nice premise, and some nice, even original, ideas, but it just doesn't quite hang together. The influence of the character draw is just a bit too much for my taste, especially since Jack escaping and making an accusation both rely on getting the right character at the right time.

I'd play again, especially with someone just looking to give it a try, but I don't see the need to own it or go out of my way to play.

We've given this one 4 plays so far, and not untio the 4th did we have the Jack player win. But now that we have I can say that this can definately be a tough game for either player. I had originally thought that the Jack player had it worst, but now I see that it's just that the Jack player has to learn "the ways of the force". I also see that the Detective player must be aggressive.

This one's a winner in my book, and I'm definitely glad I was able to get a copy.

You're dazed, bewildered, trapped in a world without time, where sound collides with color and shadows explode. You see a gaslight up ahead -- this is no ordinary gaslight, hey where did it go?

RATING: 7.5
I think this game is a lot of fun.  There is a luck component, if you narrow the lists of suspects to two players and have to guess or if the card choices that flip up don't work well for you.  However, there is still a decent bit of skill and its a fun 20-30 minutes.  If you are concerned about balance, you can play both sides.

I enjoyed playing Mr. Jack online, enough to buy it myself.  My wife tends to enjoy deduction; however, it did not quite come together for us and although somewhat enjoyable, there is not a burning desire to play it again.  Might need to play it again to see if something clicks for us.
Update (Nov 2013): no real desire to come back to this in the end, played it a few times and have had enough. Time to move it to a new gamer.

You move characters around a board and determine if the Mr Jack can be seen or not.  By manipulating the light and moving characters and using special powers, the investigator may deduce who Mr Jack is.

Good 2 players strategy game.  Very good quality components.  In spite of this, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped for.  I suppose it's because it is not so much a deduction game as I thought it would be.  However, I do enjoy the fact that it has a bluffing element.

RATING: 6
[Played 17 times]
A nice games featuring tactical decisons, drafting (between eight characters with different powers), different victory conditions and a bit of luck & bluff; deduction is fairly minor (and "obvious").
Simple, but not banal. Quick.
Fine artwork.

UPDATE (rating downgraded from 7 to 6): Jack's chances to flee are so slim that his best choice is to keep two characters always suspected (more likely both enlighteed) to force a random accusation in the last turn, effectively turning the game into an elaborated maneuvering to decide the winner with a coin flip. Dissatisfying.

Great 2 player deduction game! GF loves this game, and almost always beats me. 

One thing that I think could be better is setup. The setup is supposed to be the same every time, and I understand that it is to keep things balanced... I still think that new placements would spice the game up. I hear the expansion helps to do that with new characters as well. 

We've had fun with it and the short play time makes it easy to get to the table.

Girlfriend and I read a review in the paper of Mr. Jack Pocket, so we went to the game store to pick it up, but it had sold out (due to the review in the paper). However they had the normal version of Mr. Jack, so we picket it up. But as it turns out, it's a completely different game than the pocket version. It's an abstract with a theme. Didn't like it very much. It was too dry.

Although this is a pleasantly quick and reasonably interesting bluffing game for two, there is such a severe disconnect between the theme and its presentation that I felt quite a bit uncomfortable while playing it. Whether the Whitehall murders are a good subject for any game is debatable, but using this horrible piece of history for a very light game seems tasteless, especially when the aim for one player is to have ‚ÄòJack‚Äô successfully escape the law. Whimsical illustrations and a couple of fictional characters push it further into what-were-they-thinking territory for me.

The strangest thing about this is that the theme is so abstracted that the (quite solid) mechanics could easily have been transferred to a more appropriate subject. As things are, I‚Äôll avoid playing this and just shake my head in disbelief every time I read that people think of this as a great game for children.

Fills a definite void in my collection; that of the non-card based light filler game.

Good clean fun dismembering prostitutes. I'd like to try it with a chess clock. I have no interest in playing it with anyone who takes a long ass time figuring out their moves cause that just kills it for me. A few minutes at most per turn is about all I can handle.

Going with your gut is usually more fun even if you end up making a bad move once in a while, it also leads to more interesting situations and a more dynamic feel to how the game plays out. (I'd say this is true of almost all games really, but here it's just SO apparent and integral to it being either a wonderful experience or a dull exercise in school like tedium)

It's interesting how your taste in games evolves over the years. That evolution, admittedly, is not linear. That is, it doesn't necessity progress in a consistent fashion. There are ebbs and flows. Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Dominion--these are some of the gateway games that brought me into the hobby, but very soon, I tired of playing them and looked to slightly more advanced fare (Stone Age, Vikings, Kingsburg), and then Puetro Rico and Caylus, etc. But what's so investing is how your feelings about games wane over time, how they seem to change almost regularly. Well, mine do anyway, and I'm in a phase right now where I enjoy lighter games--or at least light-medium. As a 2 player, Mr. Jack fits the bill quite nicely. The reason for the aforementioned explanation is this: we played Mr. Jack for the first time about 2 years ago, didn't care for it, and traded it soon after. It was just sort of "meh" at the time. I was interested in the changes in the 2016 edition so I investigated it as much as possible. You see, Mr. Jack is a game I really want to like. I love the theme (history teacher), the art, the fact that it's 2 player, etc. So, I was a bit disheartened that the game was a flop the first time. I CAN TELL YOU THOUGH, the new edition seems to be a whole different game. I'm not sure if my tastes have waned again, and that's all it is, or if this game has seen a massive overhaul. I think it might be a bit of both, because this game is awesome! The one nitpick I have is the fact that the "innocent cards" are printed a bit off-center in my copy, creating some inconsistencies between it and the expansion. That aside, I can't recommend Mr. Jack highly enough. Simple, beautiful, compelling and it only takes about a half hour of your time.

It's a good gateway into cat and mouse style deduction games. As a middle of the road game, it gives a little taste of many different elements. Its quick and easy gameplay allow gamers to asses their enjoyment in what they did or did not like about it, which they can then use to maybe find another more niche deduction game that's more closely tailored to their likes. Did they like or dislike the character powers? Did they like the length of play? Do they want a tougher brain burning scenario? I found that these questions helped lead me to other great games such as Specter Ops, Letters from Whitechapel, Fury of Dracula, and Sleuth. In addition, i love Mr Jack's theme, and its artwork is done in a cute cartooney way that makes this game accessible to everyone.

Feels like an adult version of Guess Who.  There are difficult decisions to make but it feels impossible (or at least like too much work) to determine what is a good move.  The even numbered turns are especially painful since all of the character cards are put back into play making the next draw of four a crap shoot.  I find it very difficult to win play Jack.

The game is solid albeit repetitive. Nice sturdy placard character cards.  Clean rules.

RATING: 6.5
It's probably the best 2p deduction game there is (haven't tried the new Phantom of Opera remake, maybe it's better) with simple rules and nice components. It's bit too serious and chess-like for my tastes, but there can be some fun moments and cool last minute escapes too - if you're fan of this genre you'll probably like it a lot more!

RATING: 8.25
Excellent 2 player deduction game, with no need to trouble too hard over remembering who has been cleared (because the innocent are flipped up).  Very tense as Mr Jack ties to avoid detection and flee the city, with the detective trying to narrow down the suspects and block the different avenues for escape. I can tell that this game will be quite tactical.  Great production value too.

Rated 8.5 after one play - can see my wife and I getting a lot of play from it.  Moved it back to 8 after a couple more plays. And back to 8.25 after 7 plays.

RATING: 6
Beautiful 2-player board game where one person is the inspector and the other is Jack the Ripper. 
 Players take turns moving a collective group of suspects, each with unique abilities, around the board. The Inspector is trying to figure out which citizen Jack the Ripper actually is by strategically organizing the citizens into groups in a process of suspect elimination while Jack tries to keep things as un-enlightening as possible for the inspector in hopes of either escaping when no witnesses are around or after the 8th round of investigation. 
 A fun enough game, but biased towards the investigator's success, which is a bit of a deterrent for me to want to play this game often.

I cheat to play this. When only one guy is coming over for gaming, I have this set up on the table before he gets here.  Then I make him play it before presenting other possible games for the evening, completely circumventing the game selection process.

Gets a 9 instead of a 10 because I don't have a constant urge to play it, but I really do wish I had the chance to play it a lot more often.  I expect to still actively want to play Mr. Jack many years from now,

Played three times - and many more will follow. Excellent suspenseful deduction game - reminds me of a combination between Scotland Yard and Ghosts.

Two plays. I think there is a pretty good game here, although it won't become my favorite.

RATING: 8
One of the best two-player games out there. Wins points for longevity due to either side playing completely differently and the draft mechanic means clever play, luck, and bluffing are needed to best your opponent.

Two small gripes are the component quality (the play cards wear and scuff very easily) and the board has no indication as to how and where starting items should be placed (meaning you need to refer to the rulebook if you don't have it memorized).

Un des 2 joueurs incarne Jack l'√âventreur, lequel s'est lui-m√™me gliss√© dans la peau de l'un des 8 personnages sur le plateau. Bien s√ªr, il connait l'identit√© de ce personnage, et son but est de fuir le quartier au plus t√¥t, en toute discr√©tion. 

L'autre joueur est l'enqu√™teur. Il tente de deviner sous quelle identit√© Jack s'est cach√©. Mais il n'a le droit de porter qu'une seule accusation pendant la partie ! 

√Ä tour de r√¥le, les joueurs d√©placent les personnages, et leur font utiliser leurs talents sp√©ciaux, de mani√®re √† les placer soit dans des zones d'ombre, soit dans des zones √©clair√©es. Lors des appels √† t√©moin (√† la fin de chaque tour de jeu), l'enqu√™teur peut innocenter les personnages visibles si Jack n'a pas √©t√© vu dans ce tour, ou les personnages dans l'obscurit√© si un t√©moin quelconque l'a aper√ßu. 

Discernement, intuition, logique et sang froid, seront n√©cessaires pour chacun des 2 participants.

Still like it after a couple of plays more.

I enjoyed the plays I had of this game, but it led to too much analysis paralysis on both mine and Meg's parts.  To play well you have to plan ahead to the next turn, and consider possible moves for all 8 characters, and then weigh the pros and cons of each.  It was fun, but also took a really long time.

RATING: 9.5
An excellent deduction game. The finest I've played.

Update: quite possibly my favorite two-player game. 

Update: This is a great game, surely to climb the ranks in BGG. It's a wonderful struggle with a tough opponent and way too easy with somebody inexperienced. 

11 April 2008: Great game. Recorded 31 games, actual count in the 50s. Teaching this game is painful as it is extremely easy to beat newbies. Actually, the teaching part is easy, it's the look you have to see as you escape with jack on the 3rd round that is difficult. 

UPDATE: Still a great game. Entering "Finals" of Mr. Jack with snaketongue. First player to win consecutive games wins tournament. Jack and Inspector switch of course. 12 May 2008 M: W1I S: L1J to be continued ...

A surprisingly quick victory: 13 May 2008 M: W1J S: L1I

Update after about 50 Plays (bgg count not accurate): one of my all time favorite two-player games when I have hour to play: one with jack and one with the inspector. Great deductive logic exercise with a ton of bluff between two equal opponents. Will gladly play any time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Players work to either expose or hide the identity of Mr Jack through role selection and processes of elimination.

Two-player only.

Pros: Good mix of deduction, bluffing, role-selection, and strategic positioning. Simple to learn, but there's still plenty under the surface. Excellent, sturdy components should hold up to repeated play. Satisfying ending where Jack either gets away or is caught as opposed to counting points.

Cons: Enough to think about that the game could drag on longer then it needs to. All the added mechanics might be too much for a casual non-gamer to enjoy a surface-simple deduction game.

Other: One game has left me feeling like I have plenty to learn here. 

Best Use: The best two-player deduction game out there at a medium weight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Possibly the most enjoyable two player game I have played. While the gameplay takes some liberties (why are Jack and the detective moving the same characters?), the game as a whole (the artwork, the characters, the game of cat and mouse) does a great job of conjuring up the theme. Despite the special rules for each character, it's not very complicated and moves very smoothly.

It can be frustrating: You can try to plan ahead, but you'll have to make do with the cards you get and your opponent will probably screw up your plans!

RATING: 7
Is quickly becoming my favourite 2 player game. Has the exact right length, allows for multiple plays in a row while remaining fun, and the ever-changing card order ensures different gameplay each time. Jack as a hard time though - even if you play (near) "perfectly" and do not try to escape, your opponents Holmes' card  from a few turns back may hand him the game. For now, I don't think it's a huge problem though, and I will keep enjoying Mr. Jack for it's deceptive plays, and the myriad ways of manipulating your opponent's mind....
In fact, the only problem with the game I foresee is the fixed setup, and the fixed characters; perhaps leading to repetitive openings and/or a stale game experience over time. I therefore look forward to trying the extension / expansion should that moment arrive.

Several plays in (twice as investigator, once as Jack), I haven't seen Jack win a game, nor come particularly close - 6th turn is about the best so far.  I will need to read some strategies and see if I can improve that ratio.  "Staying in the light" seems to be the key.

2-player deduction game where Jack is trying to escape or last 8-rounds without being caught.  There are 8 different suspects and after each round Jack must explain whether he is "in the light" or "in the dark".

A deduction game?  Just what my collection needed, I thought!  Short of a random copy of [b][GameID=1294][/b] lost somewhere in my parents' garage, I couldn't claim any games of this genre in my collection.  A match made in heaven, right?

Wrong.

I played this a few times (so, understandably, not a large test case), and found it painfully dry and predictable.  Person hides here, then there's an accusation.  Person hides there, another accusation.  Repeat until game ends, which usually can't occur soon enough.  Guess I'll be on the lookout for another deduction game...

Played once. This is a two player game where one player is trying to secretly get one of the eight characters on the board off of the map, while the other player is trying to figure out which character the other player is trying to get off of the map. Each character on the board has special powers, and only four of them may be moved each round.

This game has neat mechanics, and is amazingly stressful (yet fun) to play. I look forward to many more games :-)

Looks like a tense deduction game, but how balanced is it?  
The first five games, it felt like the ripper was at a big disadvantage; but in my most recent game, I realised that if the ripper doesn't try to escape, and spends his moves keeping as many characters seen as possible, then the advantage swings to the ripper.  That's disappointing, since the winning strategy is now somewhat in discord with the theme.

Easy to learn, quick to play and nice cat and mouse 2 player gameplay. I like it and it isn't hurting my brain as much after a few plays :)

We're liking this more and more each time we play. I traded Galaxy Trucker for this and Guillotine, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

My wife gets this game much better than I do. I like the game even if I'm no good at it.

Undeniably fun. But take long breaks in between playing this repeatedly with the same person. Once you get good at reading the body language and facial clues of your opponent, the game is no longer playable. When playing with my wife, I already know who Jack is after 2 rounds. I know in what ways my wife plays greedily during certain stages of a game. She will favor certain character picks in specific situations and she will always go for that play style. When the game mechanics can't prevent you from making an educated guess and ending game WAY early, you have a problem. So enjoy sparingly.

LOVE this game. Excellent 2 player strategy game for serious players. No real luck element at all. Plays somewhat like chess in that you'll want to plan several moves in advance to gain a better board position.
The game does seem to favor the inspector over Mr. Jack, but, if you understand that going in, it doesn't ruin any of the fun, and when Mr. Jack DOES win it is a huge victory.

A two player game, where one player is Jack the Ripper (Mr. Jack), while the other player is the detective. There are 8 different characters on the board, and Mr. Jack is one of them, attempting to flee the board. The detective tries to deduce who is Mr. Jack. Each of the characters has special abilities. Each turn, Mr. Jack declares if he is "seen" (beside a lamp or adjacent to another character) or "unseen". From this, the detective can try to deduce who Mr. Jack is, and the game ends in a maximum of 8 turns. This is a fun game, easy to play, and is fairly quick. However, it is very difficult for Mr. Jack!

A very good two-player who-dunnit-deduction-tactical game. Cluedo meets chess- can't believe I wrote that- Has an abstract feel by making the players think ahead and weigh different options of movement, but ironically it also has a very strong theme in the victorian ripper myth. Little downtime as both players can think ahead during the other players turn.

RATING: 7
Man, this game made my brain hurt! I don't think I'm usually susceptible to "analysis paralysis" but I definitely succumbed to it here. 

The game consists of 8 characters, each with a certain ability, one of whom is Jack the Ripper. The "Jack" player must try to keep Jack's identity hidden while trying to maneuver Jack off of the game board; meanwhile, the "Inspector" player is trying to determine which character is Jack and be able to capture him before the end of 8 rounds. Players take turns moving 1 of 4 available characters each turn, alternating 1, 2, 1 characters.

There is so much to keep in mind on your turn with this game: what characters are available to move, which will/may be available next turn, what abilities will help you or your opponent. Of course, the plan to you form can be quickly destroyed by your opponent's move.

I don't see the depth at all in this game. Admittedly, I played once as the detective, but I don't see any way, other than through an amazing amount of bad luck with the way the cards come out, that Jack can win. Just isolate the pieces between light and dark and eliminate them accordingly. In most cases I would think it should take 3 turns to find Jack - 4 if you're really unlucky. I'll give this another try to see if I'm missing something, but I doubt it.

Although Mr. Jack doesn't really involve asymmetrical play, it does require very asymmetrical thinking. Its gameplay is a great idea, but poorly executed. Because of how the odds are stacked against him, Jack is impossible to win with. As a loss for Jack is unavoidable, this game is broken.

The gameplay is a nice system, and had promise, but should have been better implemented. The designers should have play-tested more.

Quite engaging game.  One player is the detective, one player is the 8 suspects.  I compare this game to chess because there is many options and much strategy in this little game.  I still have not played as the detective, and I still have not won as Mr. Jack.  I will one day, this is my decree.

A good game with a deduction elements for two players. Jack (the Ripper) tries to escape and the detective on the other hand tries to make good moves that reveal Jack's identity. Asymmetrical game that works quite well - even though I feel that Jack's player is at disadvantage. Plays usually 30-60 minutes.

Update (25.4.2008): There have quite often been boring endgames as there is only two potential Jack's and he is unable to escape. Then last rounds are played so Jack tries to keep both under suspicion and detective tries his best to avoid that. Usually these end so that detective makes 50/50 guess to win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As far as detective games are concerned, Mr. Jack is a one-of-a-kind: instead of asking question after question until reaching a conclusion, this quick, tactical and cut-throat duel between Jack the Ripper and the inspector requires both players to move the eight pieces on the board (seven authentic roles and one usurped by Jack, each with its own special ability) once each turn before Jack says if there are "witnesses" or not (i.e. if he's next to another piece or to a street lamp currently working). Jack will win if the keeps hidden for eight turns or if he avoids the police cordons and quits the scene.

Mr. Jack is a deduction game where deduction itself is the end rather than the means: the amount of information disclosed every round will depend on the positioning of the pieces on the board - positioning the pieces to squeeze or deny as much information as possible is actually what constitutes the biggest challenge in the game. The way characters are drafted to be moved brings a healthy dose of luck but players can still use each move very differently (even by choosing the characters in different order). 

The learning curve of the game is clearly steeper for the Jack player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great deduction and bluff for 2-players: traditionally the hardest number to make this genre of game work. A very rough ride if you're playing Jack, and therefore a little frustrating, but the production values are excellent (perhaps a little TOO good for an otherwise swift game) and there is plenty of repeatability in playing it both ways.

If you are dedective you win 70%, if you are mr.jack you win 30%. (If both players are experienced) This seems game is a bit unbalanced but you can use its benefits as well. You can be mr.jack if you are more powered/experienced than your opponent. Then you can have a 50% 50% winning probability ratio game. If game be totally balanced you cannot have a 50% 50% winning ratio game with a player weaker than you.

Details will come later. Easy to learn/teach rules, hard to master, entertaining and deep 2 player game.

Erin's copy.

Lightweight, and imbalanced. Does not really satisfy "hunger for a game", but fills time for 2. For fairness you need to play twice, swapping the roles, because the detective has a large advantage.

[b]Mr. Jack[/b] is a two-player game.  One player is the investigator and the other player is Mr. Jack.  The goal of the investigator is to reveal the identity of Mr. Jack before he escapes the board, or before the end of the game which consists of eight turns.

I think [i]Mr. Jack[/i] is okay, but I find that winning the game as Mr. Jack is much more difficult than winning the game as the investigator.

RATING: 8
It's a favorite theme of mine and I was also attracted by the game award nominations and postive comments on BGG. 

"Mr Jack" is a good 2-player match-of-wits. Not deep, but clever, it's a good example of a game that's well thought-out and does not pretend to be more than what it actually is. 

Still would love to see a 'Jack the Ripper' game that is more thematic and more based on the actual history (perhaps one already exists and I'm just not aware of it), even though with its characters and how they affect play there is certainly theme to be found in the game. 

Purchased September 2008. My son Trevor rated it a 9 as of October of 2009 (when he was 10 1/2). Raised my rating to an 8 in July of 2012, because every time I play this game I love doing so.

Update (31/03/17):

Played 2 games with 6 year old, once on each side. Found the gameplay quite dull and predictable, especially with the same starting setup each game. The game can end really abruptly too by the detective just randomly nabbing one of the remaining few suspects. While the game plays fast, it just feels too scripted. Dropping it by 2 points and considering selling it off.


Interesting game but just doesn't grab me that much. Wonder if the expansion will help add more variety to the gameplay.

I am impressed at how good this game is! It is quite difficult to plan an escape by Mr. Jack. It is equally as difficult to plan to catch Mr. Jack. A very well balanced game and its fun to try playing either side (Jack or detective).

Great theme integration.  The two sides are both fun to play.

I like the victory conditions, but it can be a little annoying if the game is decided on a 50/50 guess at the end.  I'm fine with it now, because how you play up to that point makes a huge difference.

I think I need to relax more with this one.  I seem to "lose it" making bad moves in this more than any other game I can think of.

It's a lot of fun - just tense fun :devil:

RATING: 7.5
Prelim. rating after 2 plays.  More plays needed to verify that the asymmetrical nature of the game doesn't lead to one side having an unfair advantage (which is brutally tough to balance out during playtesting, which is why these sorts of games almost never work 100% - this looks like it might be the exception, though).

I don't get to play it much because the spouse's not a fan (it's too gamey and requiring too much look-ahead), but it still impresses me. I can see how it might get samey after a while, as you run through your checklist of things to check for as the detective and use the same tricks to set up threats as the runner. But it's a lot of good decision making and concentration required for 30 minutes.

Pathetically overrated. Wife and I found it dry and boring. Had more fun with 'stop thief' and 'Scotland yard'. Great looking parts, but this is a cheapass game concept that should be sold for $8, not $45. This is a perfect example of why you should never let BGG rankings decide your purchases. Seriously, this sits one number ABOVE Avalon Hill's CIVILIZATION. That is reason enough to delete BGG's entire numbering system, as it is obviously broken.

After liking the "Mr. Jack Pocket" so much. I decided to give its bigger brother a try. This game doesn't deluse either. It is a bigger bolder version of the same principle.

Un gioco semplice ma profondo e longevo, oltre che di brevissima durata. Ben calato nell'ambientazione e con un meccanismo di scagionamento dei sospettati - basato sui lampioni accesi/spenti - molto originale. Si diverte Jack, che tenta di fuggire cercando di lasciare all'avversario pi√π punti interrogativi possibili, e si diverte l'investigatore, che lotta contro il tempo alla ricerca di indizi. Aggiungono pepe al gioco le abilit√† personalizzate degli investigatori. Uno dei migliori da giocare in due.

If you're looking for an excellent 2p deduction game, with a rich theme, quick playing time and good components, Mr. Jack is NOT it! It's an excellent 2p game, with a rich theme, quick playing time and good components, however it has little to do with deduction. Mr. Jack is all about positional play, bluffing and tactical creativity. It's still a very good and quick game which is always a pleasure to play. I highly recommend it!

The police are a bit more advantageous but that's really not a problem. Not every game should be same for both sides. It's more fun to play Jack trying to get away under pressure of the stronger authorities. The joy of success will be enormous if you are able to run away with Jack.

An interesting discussion about game theme came up on the forums a few days ago - that's definitely part of the problem with this game for me. I don't mind war themes or related, but serial killers is kind of a turnoff, whether the game is cartooney or not. How about bank heists instead? Mechanically, the game is interesting, but I prefer LotR:tC to this as a special character power 2P games.

I've played this several times now and it's a great little game, very girlfriend/wife friendly. I'd say the strategy boils down to the inspector wants to keep 50/50 in light and dark each round and jack wants to keep as many characters in the same state as Jack each round.

Very clever 2 player game of bluffing & deduction. The random elements in the form of the cards help the game to avoid becoming too chess-like & thinky.

Each side plays extremely differently, and virtually demands that you exchange sides.

Very nice artwork & components.

WARNING: Bevelled edges on character cards have been cut from the wrong side, meaning the coloured backgrounds are slightly visible from the side when stacked together. This doesn't affect the alibi cards. My solution is to print & sleeve my own versions of the cards, although it's possible to just hide them / close eyes while shuffling/choosing.

Disappointly, the emphasis in gameplay is more to do with anticipating spacial situations, with deduction taking a small part in the process.

It's a good game but I don't like this kind of games.

I share Mr. Houjix's opinion: [q]Mr. Jack disappoints me. I love the idea of a quick game of deduction and bluff. That may be what Mr. Jack is billed as, but it certainly isn't what the game actually is. Under the hood this is just a mediocre [not my opinion] tactical maneuvering game with zero deduction and almost zero bluff in it. In fact, Mr. Jack is most closely related to games like Chess and Hive. It's about processing tactical permutations. I really dislike those sorts of games. [‚Ä¶] I can appreciate the uniqueness of the design but the gameplay is lacking for me, and that bums me out. For a short two player game of tactics and double guess Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation [‚Ä¶] is vastly superior.[/q]

The game has more in common with Mastermind than Clue. In the games I have played, it does not require more than a couple of turns to determine who Jack is and from that point it becomes an exercise in tactical movements. The seed is here but the plant just didn't sprout. On the plus side, if you enjoy Mastermind (or games of that ilk) this one gives the 'code setter' something to do during the game.

Waiting to get around to my first play...

Update: 02/03  Cracked it open.  The boy and I played 10 times.  His last victory was a stunning last minute move with the chick that saw "Mrs. Jack" skipping off in the early morning haze.  Really, really fun little game.  Games go by fast, set up is easy, and the ruleset didn't need referencing after the third or fourth game for the special abilities for me or boy.  I'd suggest this.  Considering getting the expansion to change up the game a bit too.  I'll be looking for a deal on it.  $25 bones for five new characters seems salty.

Update:  Rediscovered this game, and really enjoy it.  Great component quality.  Sets the standard for thick cardboard.

Great asymmetric two-player game, which I've played far more online than physically. The two sides feel very different to play and there are lots of tricks to master. Too bad so many games come down to the detective having to take a 50/50 guess though.

Surprisingly good deduction game for two players. Some interesting decisions built in. Reminded me of Scotland Yard from my youth. Plays much faster and for two. Not a bad little addition to your collection, especially if you only have one other person to play with. Likely to appeal to your significant other as it's a light game. Great production quality as well.

A great deduction game I really have fun with.  Its the perfect thing to play when its just two of you and you only have an hour or less.  The expansion works very well with the base game, and I think it really adds to the randomness and allows for more replayability.

RATING: 7.5
7.5 - I think the pocket game is more fun. The game play is a bit slower, it's much more difficult for Mr Jack to not show his hand and frankly the art isn't that attractive. It's fun, but between the two the small footprint, varied setup, and quick play of Pocket I'd rather play that one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great, great deduction game! Tense to the last minute.

A bit hard to the investigators, but that's just the nature of it.

Based on our games so far, I consider:

Escaping as Jack>Winning as the Investigators>Winning as Jack at the end of the 8th round.

I count these as 3 glory points, 2 glory points and 1 glory point... in my head, of course! Too bad this game is best played when you play it just two or three times in a row (I wouldn't make an evening out of it).

Brilliant. Our favorite two player game.
Meaty but quick. Lovely bits and highly thematic.
By now the 8 characters are kinda old friends of us.
Gets better as you go further trhough its long learning curve. After hundreds of board plays and over 1000 online plays, I don't get tired of it.
It's pretty different playing Jack or the inspector. And yes, it's unbalanced, the good guy winning around 2/3 of the times, so you have more responsibility when being the inspector and it's more challenging when playing Jack.
Deep strategy, bluffing and fun (watch out for A.P. though).

I generally like deduction games and I've always had a soft spot for Clue.  Mr. Jack boils it down to a 2 player battle of wits between Jack and the detective(s).

At first glance, it appears Jack does not have a chance ( I personally have not yet won with Jack, but with more practice...)

Excellent and simple components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Good game.  Only one play (half an hour or slightly more) and it seemed like Mr. Jack gets the short end of the stick unless he lucks into a nearby exit early in the game.  But it's pretty good.  Don't really know if I like "character powers," as I dislike that in most every game I've seen it in, but the game flows once everyone knows what the characters can do.  I just wonder if there's an even tighter and simpler game hiding in there somewhere that doesn't have to rely on most of the special actions.

I would rate this one higher, but I think that the re playability of it is probably a bit low after 10-20 times. Still an enjoyable, easy to learn 2-player game that finishes quickly.

RATING: 5
Seems like a whole lot of to-do over not-much. There just isn't much compelling to this game - same layout each time, then first turn you get to move 2 people and that reveals a whole bunch. Then subsequent rounds have less and less to cover. Seems many plays boil down to a quick escape by Jack if he isn't totally bottled up tight. Anticlimactic as all get out. Most importantly, this is not a thief/hunter game - this is a puzzle game, which may explain why so many people like it. I find it very fiddly, a terrible learning curve (i.e. it takes many many plays to become proficient with the Jack strategies) and a bad gateway game, as well as bad for children.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
this game has a cool flavor, despite the presence of some ahistorical characters in the game. that said, this game's premise promises more than the gameplay actually manages to deliver. i really like the movement and the variable powers of the various characters. i feel like these help create the opportunity for some clever play. unfortunately, i feel like the ability to only move characters whose cards come up severely hampers the player playing jack the ripper. sometimes, due to the game opening position of the characters, and the luck of the draw, the jack the ripper player will have a rough time defensively positioning himself and not throwing the game to the investigator player. actually, this is true for every turn of the game. 

so basically, the whole game rests on flawless play by the ripper player, and the luck of the draw as far as what character cards come up. i fail to see the challenge for the investigator player at all. the investigator player can play suboptimaly for most of the game and still win, whenever the ripper character makes a mistake, or when the cards limit the ripper's defensive ability too much. i feel like a much more satisfying two player deduction game would be scotland yard.     

update: man this game is terrible.  there's barely a game here.

i don't get this one at all. it requires the player playing the detective to stare at the board for a LONG TIME calculating all possible permutations of all 4 character's movements this round and which character's would be visible THEN they have to work out all possible combinations for the upcoming 4 character...all before he makes his 1st move!! if he makes but 1 little mistake BAM!! and jack can escape

meanwhile the player playing jack can do NOTHING but wait..and wait..and wait..or do exactly the same calculations as the detective

it's odd cos this should be exactly the kind of game i'd expect to to enjoy - instead each time i try it i HATE IT.

i firmly believe it is not a good game. it seems however a lot of people disagree - as of yet i am unable to reconcile this disparity

RATING: 7.8
This game is a brain-burner. Lots of possibilities to think through on both sides, and each turn can feel like solving a puzzle. Because of this, it can suffer from excessive AP. 

It may take a few games to wrap your mind around how to play Jack, but once you do Mr. Jack seems to be pretty balanced with both Jack and the Detectives holding their own. The randomness of which characters come out each turn, combined with the order in which you chose the characters to move, can be brutal to your strategy.

RATING: 8
Interesting game with a nice deduction element laid over a spatial relationship game.  Special character powers add to the interesting choices to be made each turn.

RATING: 8
Very clever 2-player puzzle/detective game full of "aha" moments!

Beginners think it's terribly hard to win with Jack, but that's false.  The game is pretty balanced once you know what you're doing.  (See the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/261489]strategy article[/url] by FerrumEtBombyx.)  Newbies make mistakes like trying too hard to escape with Jack instead of keeping all the suspects together and visible.

The only real downside is that often the detective must guess between the remaining suspects in the end, so all the cleverness by both players can come down to a matter of a lucky/unlucky guess.

But sometimes Jack can arrange things so that in the final turn the Detective knows for sure who Jack is, but can't reach him to accuse him - leading to delightful wails of anguish from the Detective player!

RATING: 8.5
An excellently designed and executed game with good components.  Quick and tense, my 13-year-old son likes to play very much.  A two-person version of "Clue" that works; it has tension, mystery, luck, deduction, and a feeling of options slowly narrowing down.  I agree it is harder to play the "Jack" side, but I find that bluffing is the best way to outwit the detective.

I heard a lot of good things about this game and was excited to try it with my fiance. She's not as analytical as me, so I wasn't sure how she'd like it. She enjoyed it fairly well and I enjoyed it a lot. The mechanics of this game are pretty amazing, I must say. 

Gone through quite a few plays since acquiring this game and it is just so much fun. Deduction is always a fun mechanic. Sometimes it can become pretty obvious who Jack is, but catching him is difficult. If you think you know, do you make the bold move and confront him early on?

Initial rating after a few games. I really like this. It is deduction light, but there are some fun decision to make. The rule explanation took about 3 minutes to my wife, and then she beat me twice. That's a good sign. May be my new light 2-player of choice. 

After more plays this is still fun, but its kind of chaotic and not really deduction.

RATING: 6
I really like the speed of this game as well as the theme and artwork. A lot of smart thinking is required as well, which I enjoy. We are having a very hard time being successful as Mr. Jack. In fact, other than the first 3 games or so when we were learning the rules, Mr. Jack hasn't made it very far at all before being caught. I have not been able to wrap my mind around the thought process and strategy needed to win with Mr. Jack. Hopefully either my opponent or I will figure out how to be more successful with him, otherwise I fear this game could have a short existence on our game shelf. All in all though, I do enjoy it and wish I was able to play more.

Disappointing. A quotation of Reiner Knizia comes to mind, whereby the last twenty percent of game design are the really hard work. Obviously Bruno and Ludovic did not spend too much energy beyond those 80 % to save a nice basic idea.  In short: the imbalance between the two roles makes this game really pointless.

Surely you could turn this into a really good game by introducing clever house rules, f.e. a scoring mechanism for consecutive games, rewarding Mr. Jack with (not linear) increasing points for each round he doesn't get caught etc. But I prefer games that work fine without self-made improvements. thoia's comment (see below) says it all. Vastly overrated!

The game has one issue - it is relatively (in fact much!) mroe difficult to play Jack than the Investigator. That is because if an Investigator made a mistake, he still have few more rounds to win the game. 

Jack is having only one mistake available to be done and in most cases that mistake will mean that the Investigator wins within next 1-2 rounds.

A game of cat and mouse, bluffing and some deduction. I'm told it plays quite like a two player version of Scotland Yard, and therefore more fun for the player who's not Jack (Mr. X). I found it quite chess like, okay, maybe checkers. Good fun and proving to be well balanced. Positive factors are the easy rules, quick playing time and high player interaction. Initially I was concerned it wouldn't have the replayability my wife and I have got out of Hera and Zeus, Carcassonne the Castle and other two player favourites, but thankfully it does play differently enough each game due to the distribution of character cards during the game. I do quite like it. Rates a bit higher for me because it plays quickly. Would make a nice gift for gamers and non gamers. I'm just not tiring of this. The balance is very even.

An extremely short deduction game for 2 players.  The art is beautiful, and it plays intuitively.  Player alternate activating characters on the board, one player (the dark player) knows who Jack the Ripper is and tries to get that piece to escape.  The light player is trying to deduce which character it is, and catch him.  The game, however, seems to end before it has even began, and usually by the end of the 1st turn, 50% of the characters have been eliminated.  The victory seems a bit less sweet because of it.  Lots of potential, but just fell a bit flat for me.

I really anticipated playing this, but it fell flat for me. Too much thinking for a 20-minute game, and I felt like I was arbitrarily moving pieces around according to arbitrary movement rules. Really hard to wrap up all the possibilities, and a complete brain workout. The brain-burn involved seems so much denser when you compress it to 20 minutes of game time. 

---------------------

I'm still not liking Mr. Jack right now, but I'd play it against somebody who doesn't over-analyze, because it's quick and pretty with a good theme. Definitely a game that emphasizes thinking on your feet (the moment the character cards are revealed at the start of the turn).

-------------------

After my 4th play, I understand the game and like it now. This game might sell itself as a deduction game, but the dominating part of it is actually abstract strategy. There is deduction involved in Jack's bluffing and the detective's picking up on tiny movements and inadvertent comments. But to do well in the game, it's all in the character drafts. You want to leave your opponent with the fewest options possible, while properly handling the spatial elements on the board. That's the very essence of abstract strategy. 

The asymmetry is very well done. Jack can only escape when he is not witnessed, but it's easier to keep Jack in the light. This buys the detective time, and gives him the option of narrowing down the investigation or ensuring that Jack cannot escape by witnessing all suspects. But as time goes on, it gets progressively easier for Jack to slink into the shadows as the lamps start turning off.

There are a lot of games which are inherently abstract mechanically, but get ruined because of a completely unnecessary theme that doesn't fit at all. But Mr. Jack is the rare abstract strategy game where the whodunnit investigation theme makes the game more enjoyable and satisfying. In contrast, Mystery Rummy - Jack the Ripper hurts its own gameplay with its theme.

==============

theory described it best.

[q]Mr. Jack is a game that:

1) masquerades as a deduction game
2) is actually more of a spatial reasoning game
3) until you both become very good at it, at which point it returns to a deduction game [/q]
I got to (2) on 3rd play, just started realizing 3) during 5th play.

Some interesting dynamics from's Mr. Jack perspective:

1. Getting a large number of people eliminated early isn't bad at all, and might even be better. With many, there's the risk that the Detective just gets lucky and finds Mr. Jack in the smaller (maybe only 1) group, but with few, it's easier for you to choose who to protect.
2. Do not go for escape unless you can guarantee it with your character definitely coming out next turn, and you going first (even then, it's difficult because Detective gets last move right before). Nothing's worse than having 2-3 characters able to escape, but not doing so, and letting the Detective know who isn't Mr. Jack. Corollary: might want to keep people in the light after all (which is easier anyway) and go for the shadows only when trying to escape.
3. Each character has 2 states to track: position and status (light/shadow). Characters on display will change their position. Status can usually be changed for anybody, especially shadow -> light. Sergeant (and to a lesser extent, the master of disguise) is the only character that can change other characters' positions, which makes him the most powerful, in my opinion.

An excellent 2-player game. Unique because it has you assume one of two distinct roles (Jack the Ripper or his pursuer) as opposed to each player trying to outwit the other in the same fashion.

[9 plays] This is extremely well done. Gameplay is fun, can make your head hurt deliciously, and is very straightforward. Rules are great, components are excellent, and the artwork is nice. Definitely the best 2 player deduction game I have ever played.

After playing several times, here are my initial impressions:
* Jack is at a slight disadvantage, perhaps 70/30 as others have said, but I don't mind that kind of challenge a bit.
* Escape should rarely be the primary goal for Jack, concealing information for as long as possible is the highest priority - escape is a crime of opportunity, particularly if you can set it up in the second half of the game.

Tried to get it from Neuroludic...sold out. This 2-player game sees one player as a detective and the other as Jack the Ripper. Jack is trying to elude capture by turn 8 or flee the board. The detective is trying to find Jack by narrowing down suspects. Not a true 'deduction' game as it's all about process of elimination...which can be hard for both players as every character has a potential to be moved by the other player! The characters and their abilities make for tactics and replayability. There's plenty to think about and the game moves along at a nice clip.

But there there's a little disconnect with the theme as it's strange that the Jack player has no control over his/her character. An original game.

So what's the matter with me? I love puzzles. I love deductions. Yet this clever two player game of deduction is just a flat tire under the engine of my passion for such things. Production values are excellent. The theme, although a bit gruesome, is not a turn-off for me. I'm just not excited to play Mr. Jack. After one play, I thought this would be my favorite decution game ever. A few more plays though, and I just didn't feel the tension. Despite the rich production and theme, the game ended up simply feeling like an exercise.

I'm not usually a big fan of two player games, but this one has really piqued my interest.  Although it has few mechanics and the rules and gameplay are simple, the tactics that each player employs can create a pretty substantial challenge.

I've only played it once, but I just don't get what all the excitement is about.  The graphics are also a bit too cartoony.  The game appears to be a real challenge for the Jack player.  I wouldn't be against playing the game again, but the game seems overrated.  Play first before buying.

Nifty design, but in the end I wonder why I should be playing this instead of a two-player wargame. You've got the same things: Units with different abilities and the goal of out-manouvring/outbluffing your opponent. Only that wargames are bigger (and better).

Plays fast without any hiccups in the middle. Fairly easy to learn, just pick up and play out of the box. Each card says what characters special abilities are on the card, whereas most games you constantly have to refer back to instructions, which I hate. Great 2 player game, our first lasted about 30 minutes.

Cool game, how's the replay value though I wonder? That's the only possible weak spot I can see so far.
[hr]Sadly I don't think it holds up, found interest waning by 3rd play and I suspect it'd get worse from there. There's some depth to it and it's a well made game, but once you get how it works it's just a little too samey and that drastically reduces the fun factor for me. Not sure if expansion helps.

I think my main problem with it is the static setup. I don't think that's really a problem automatically, but the static setup and same 8 roles leads to my problem with the game

Still a cute, fun, and unique game which takes some serious thought, I'd recommend just about anyone give it a try!

This is a totally enjoyable system, but after winning both as Jack and as the cops I'm not sure how much more I want to play it.  It is a fine game and totally worth playing someone else's copy, but not overly intriguing.  There are a couple tricks to movement that once you learn make the game easier.  Part of the fun of the game is figuring out how to move the pieces around effectively.  

I will say it is a clever system, and I enjoyed playing it, but I just can't see a high level of replayability here.


I'm a bit concerned about the set up as Ms. Swift can win on turn one if she is the Ripper. 

UPDATE: Little did I know that through some oblique twisting of the rules no one is allowed to escape on turn one.  According to Ben Vogel: As a condition for escape, there must be no witness to Jack on the preceding turn (the "Jack unseen" side of the card would need to be face up from the previous turn.) Since the setup rules specifically indicate that the witness/no witness card begins the game with the "witness" side up, there can be NO escape on turn one.  GOOD TO KNOW.

I think this game can suffer from analysis paralysis. But if you don't think through your turn properly a simple mistake can cost you the game. So, it plays longer than I expected and wanted it to. Aside from that, it is an excellent 2 player game.

RATING: 9
This is among my favorite 2p games.  There's a surprising amount of depth, and less luck than you'd expect in this game.  There are eight investigators on the board, but one of them is the killer.  One player represents the killer, but both players move all the characters.  After four characters are moved, the Mr. Jack character announces whether the killer is in the light or dark, which allows the investigator, if he played well, to eliminate some suspects.  The main reason I think this is such a great design because the killer must take on different strategies depending on which character he represents and on the order in which character cards come up.

A fun deduction/elimination game for 2, which both my wife and I like.  Nicely produced - the board and counters look great!  Certainly makes you think, but it can be very frustrating at times as your choices of cards and actions so often don't seem to match your desired strategy.  Seems to favour the Detective player, but the game is not so long that you can play twice, and swap sides, in a single session. [Somewhat like the kids' game Scotland Yard.  Shorter and simpler, but more random, than Letters From Whitechapel.]

It's a silent game, something I'm not usually fond of. But aside from that, at first the game feels unbalanced against Jack. As you play, you see that it's not. But games begin to play out the same way, with too many wins and losses amounting to a coin toss. Variable setup would have been nice. But it's interestingly asymmetric, and I like the theme.

Mr. Jack fell a bit flat for me, which might be partly due to unreasonably high expectations on my part.  It really wasn't at all what I expected.

Need to play it again, but it's a style of game that I struggle with strategically -- sometimes that's a good thing, but in this case I think the struggle was more frustrating than engaging, mainly because it's not a long game or a particularly heavy game.  I fear that learning the strategy just won't be at all rewarding.

Edit 12/04/09:  Rating of 6 after another play... it's not that this is a bad game, or even a mediocre game -- I would guess it's actually very good.  Unfortunately, as said above, I struggle with this type of game and it's more frustrating than fun for me at this point.

with Mr Jack Extension - Not a big hit when I first played with my girls and their cousins.  I appreciate the gameplay and design - very well thought out.  Hard to find good two player games.  Even though it wasn't a hit I bought the expansion because I felt they would eventually come around.  Now that they are 13 and 11, I brought this game back out.  After some reservation, they tried it and loved it!  We played this a half dozen times in that one night.

Mr. Jack just broke into my top three 2-player games of all time. Yes, it was that good. While the price is up there for a 2-player game ($43 MSRP but cheaper at some stores), it is well worth it. The game is very high-quality in every way (more to come), but as good as the quality is, the gameplay and strategy steal the show. Play as Mr. Jack or the Detective. Move in and out of light and darkness according to whichever is most advantageous at the moment. Take special care to utilize the character skills wisely or you may get burned (as I have many times!) by your opponent.

The artwork immediately caught my eye. The board is incredibly detailed with a fun, cartoonish, yet realistic feel. The character and alibi "cards" can barely be called cards because of how thick and sturdy they are. The characters aren't just faceless tokens, there is character depth and storyline (bolstered by great background descriptions of each). The map itself is perfect to facilitate a balance of strategy and player advantage (with strength spots and weakness spots for each character which must be accounted for on both sides).

The gameplay is very simple in construct, but there are innumerable tactical plans which may change at a moment's notice. The entire game revolves around the witness card. If Jack is "seen" (i.e., in the light), the witness card must indicate as such which then eliminates the chance that Jack is one of the "unseen" characters, and vice versa. These characters are then tagged as innocent. This goes until either Jack escapes the city, remains hidden through the eighth round, or until the Detective makes an accurate accusation. Sound simple? Not so fast. With each player "playing" the part of two of four randomly selected characters each round, a strategy of illuminating as many characters as you can that round may be quickly thwarted by your opponents moves. Then you add the character abilities on top of that. For example, John Smith moves a streetlight (and thus the illumination it provides). Sir William Gull can switch spots with another player (got me several times last game!). Or Sherlock Holmes can eliminate an option by drawing an alibi card. I won't even get into the manholes, police cordons, or the failing streetlights. You've got to experience it for yourself!

Overall, this is one of the best 2-player games out there. It's quick (20-30 minutes), there's some luck but mostly strategy, replay value is very high, and it's a blast! I highly recommend this one and give it a solid 8.5.

Nice 2 player sleuthing game. If you're Jack you manipulate stuff so that you remain free or hidden, messing with your opponent's brain. If you're trying to track Jack, you do the opposite by gradually clearing other suspects and fencing in your opponent. A much harder game than I originally thought. You actually need to use your brain to manipulate the characters and objects. :) Although it's a fun game, it doesn't seem to tickle me fancy. I'm not sure why... if it's because it feels slightly unbalanced - playing as Jack is definitely harder. Or simply because I get more kicks from other 2 player games. Still, it's a decent game.

Sheer.  Gaming.  Brilliance!  Let the gushing now begin...  Mr. Jack is a simple game to learn yet presents an agonizing challenge to both players as they try to out-wit, out-bluff, and out-sneak one another.  And it's so well put together - I can't imagine how much play-testing went into figuring out the placement of every space and character on the board, and the details of each character's special ability.  Having said that though, the game is ever so slightly easier for the detective player than the Mr. Jack player, which means that I usually play two games at a time and switch sides with my opponent, the winner being the player who can last longer as Mr. Jack.  [Edit: with experience, it becomes easier to win as the Jack player, and it appears to be a much more balanced game than first impressions reveal.]  I don't give it a perfect 5 for enjoyment because it can become quite a brain-burner, frequently requiring a bit of waiting time while your opponent ponders all her/his options.  And I also don't give it a perfect 5 due to the minor issues of the fact that the edition I obtained was printed with a couple of small errors, and the somewhat disturbing "Jack the Ripper" theme.  My infatuation with this game is evident by the number of posts, and responses to other posts, that I have written in this game's file.  Have a read through my compiled FAQ (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/194998) in order to answer the many questions you will have after reading the rather imperfect rules.

[Hurrican 'Mr. Jack' 2006 edition] {Agent; deduction, angel vs devil} I am a fan of deduction games. I like games such as Sleuth, Coda, Code 777 etc.  However, it's difficult to design a good deduction game with nice interaction.  Nonetheless, Mr. Jack attracts me a lot with its theme and mechanic.  Thus, I bought it without much hesitation.  I am not disappointed.  Mr. Jack is an elegant game, which is satisfactorily designed and tuned. It is eligible to be a masterpiece of design.

Mr. Jack is a decent mix of bluffing and deduction. It's fun, engaging, interactive and thematic. The random factors prevent a solid strategy but it's tactical enough that player have a handful of decisions each turn and plan how to escape or catch.  Besides, it's highly replayable. However, it takes some time for the players to understand the power of each character.  In all, it's a very nice 2p game.

It's more difficult to be Mr. Jack; esp. for the first few games. Therefore, it's more challenging and fun to be Mr. Jack.

Probably the best two-player-only game I know.  Very well thought-out and addictive.  It's a brain-burner, and that's what I both love and hate about it.  Like chess, it requires a fair amount of "If I go here, then my opponent will probably do this" predictions, and while satisfying as a logic puzzle, this can lead to long turn times with the wrong people.  Might be good to use chess clocks if you're playing opponents who leave time for naps between moves.  But the variety of characters and inherent randomness (Jack's identity, the witnesses who pop up on a given round, the Sherlock clues) give this a lot of replayability and make it an engaging diversion.

RATING: 4
Less deduction than abstract piece movement game.  I would argue that the player imbalance (at least at the start) in favor of the detective is a good thing.  It's easy to play one game each way if you want, and it also can serve as a bit of a handicap if needed.  Lastly, it keeps it from being hyper competitive like many other 2 player abstracts (which I find can make such games too intense.)  The quicker the better for play in my opinion.

Also, way too slow... common theme with all my opponents (and probably me.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Love the concept and the theme.  The game was a bit disappointing at first play, but perhaps I was expecting too much.  I definitely like it, just not as much as I thought I would.  Will definitely play it again though.  Good replay value.

RATING: 5.25
Interesting deduction game, but I feel that it is too simple and repetitive to be really good. Maybe with the expansion it would spice it up, but currently it is pretty bland.

Maybe if I played against some really good opponents it would be better, but it is pretty boring as it is.

RATING: 5
My first encounter with this game was not very good.

I played Jack and got quite far. During the very last turn the police had to catch me, there were only 2 persons left that had not been proven innocent. My opponent could just randomly accuse one, which IMO is kinda lame, but in this game Mr Jack was unmasked 'because I'd said something suspect at some point during the game', which is REALLY lame.

Not a bad game exactly, but not my thing.

Very interesting two player 'sort of' deduction game.  Man do you feel the pressure when you play as Jack.  Definitely needs two playings, one on each side as the pressure lessens if you're playing detective.  Jack almost made it away, but my opponent was too smart. :D

RATING: 7.6
It took me a few plays, I've found the love for this game. Interesting decisions and double bluffs abound.

Enough strategy to make it fun without so many options that AP rears it's ugly head.

Update: Once you play this enough, you get to a point where you can extrapolate all of the possible outcomes for each character. The plus side is that this makes the game much more balanced and interesting. The downside to this is massively increased playing (and thinking) time. To the extent that this now gets significantly fewer plays than it used to. I still really like it, but often don't want to invest that amount of time working out permutations.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[gameid=21763] is a deduction game with an interesting theme. The theme initially attracted us to the game and the cat'n'mouse play is fun for a while. On player takes on the role of Mr. Jack, hoping to avoid detection. The other player takes on the role of the investigator and must determine who IS Mr. Jack, before time runs out or he runs off.

You would think this would be straight up my alley. A thinking man's game, except, it isn't. I brain burn my way through the game as the investigator going back and forth, becoming more and more frustrated as the answer eludes me.

Playing as Mr. Jack is much worse, because I cannot get a grasp on how to play. Should I feint and run the other way? Bluff my way through? I have no clue how to approach it, I have no desire to work it out and I become even more frustrated at my inability to get anywhere.

I admit, I am probably not the target for this game, which is also why it has left our collection... and I know there is a good game in there - for the right people.

RATING: 5
Out of the 4 games I've played so far, I haven't seen Jack win once. I know others might consider it to be too soon to make any of the following statements based on that number of plays. Maybe our players are just too good at deduction. You start with 8 characters and that means you can deduce Jack in as little as 3 turns if the cards fall right and you know what you're doing. That depends on the luck of the draw for the characters you can move. Once you're found out, it's over because there's no place on the board you can really run away and hide because of the sewer movement.

So the whole game comes down to trying to choose roles to move tokens in such a way that you remove as much of an influence from your opponent as possible. Both players are trying to do that, so who wins depends on luck of the draw. That's fun for the first few times playing, but then things start to become clear on what's going on and it becomes old.

It seems the best technique for Jack is to cluster everyone together and wait for the 8 turns to pass. Mostly you need to have the card of the person you want to remove from the light. It takes too many actions to remove all the tokens and lamplights from around them. It's easier to remove them directly, but that depends on luck. You can easily put people back in the light with almost any card. You can move next to them, shine a light on them, swap spots with them, make them come running to you. So it seems that the investigator wants to cut the remaining suspects in half and push people in the dark and Jack wants to hang out with everyone under a lamplight until sun up.

RATING: 7.5
What a fun game!  Best played in "pairs", with each player taking a turn as Jack, but fun solo as well.  I'm constantly learning new things about the game, and how to use each character.  I like when players reach Level One - figuring out how to divide-and-conquer to learn Jack's identity.  And then one reaches Level Two - inferring which character maybe Jack, or what alibi cards a detective may have, based on the way characters are moved.  Fantastic bits, too.

I really like the design.  Fun, but a little brain-burny.  As the Jack player, one bad move can cost you the game, which I don't care for.  In particular, I've had a few games where one player failed to notice a move using the sewer tiles, and it cost that player the game.

Mr. Jack is a lovely little two-player deduction game. The components are nice and the atmosphere adds a lot to gameplay. For some reason, every time I play I make a small little mistake that costs me the game. I say this because the strategy at first seems deceptively easy, but you have to stay alert to all the details on the board. One wrong move and your opponent sweeps in to claim victory. I initially had rated this lower, but once I discovered the strategy was more complex than I realized, I became rather addicted to this game--especially because I rarely ever win! I'll get the hang of it one day; until then, it's just as much fun losing.

Great quality components, beautiful artwork that contributes well to the atmosphere. Solid fun, I also haven't managed to win as Mr. Jack, but holding out as long as possible is rewarding as well. The only thing this game needs adjustment in is the position of Miss Stealthy. If she is the one Jack disguises as it might occur (depending on the four characters of the first round) that the Jack-player wins at the start of the 2nd turn, without the inspector having any chance to avoid it. That shouldn't happen. Gets + 0.5 because it is a really fast game which usually doesn't take more than 20 minutes.

London detectives versus Jack the Ripper!
Jack is trying to escape the city but must remain incognito to do so. The detective is organizing a search party and is trying to narrow down who amongst the area's people is actually Jack.

Uses a line-of-sight mechanic to determine who can or cannot see Jack, and the players must logic out which of the characters (that they both have a chance to control) is the murderer.

I disliked the theme and almost forced myself to buy this game.

After a few games the reviews seemed to speak the truth as this became for me a smart, fun, fast and full of agony 2-player game.

After a few more games (25+) though... the experience degraded and it became boring to play.

It's decent as 1vs1 light experience, but there are a lot better games for that. Especially if you consider that it's unbalanced towards the detective.

I should have listened to my hunch...

RATING: 8
This game deserves merit for the attempt at what it is but there was not enough good effort in actually trying to make it a functional game.  This game is way too lopsided to be fun.  Play Jack and you have get to run around hoping you don't make one minor mistake.  Play the detectives and you get idly laze about, half paying attention and eventually be handed the victory.  The various characters are great with their own individual effects on the game, very keen idea and certainly that's where the game lies but it's not enough to make this something that stands out.  There's needs to be some sort of balancing mechanic or system that allows the Jack player to maybe have more control over which characters move.  Not sure how this one would be fixed but it's just not what is should be as it is.

UPDATE: After a few more plays and including the expansion characters and the alternate starting position I've really changed my mind on this game. It's a lot of fun now (granted there were many changes to make it so) and I really get a kick out of going through this one now.

Very interesting two-player deduction game.  It's surprisingly well-balanced for both sides, and short enough for each player to try each side consecutively.  The components and artwork are also really nice.

After playing a couple of times, I really considered this game to be poor.  As a rare outing to another genre I found this to be disappointing.  As the detective you can win in two moves.  The challenge of the game is to be Jack and stop this from happening.  To be honest I think the more you play it the better it becomes, I may have to revise my Rating after a few more games.

RATING: 6

This is a clever little deduction game where the main objective is to force the murderer to split the characters into revealed (in the light or next to somone) or hidden. Every turn the murderer must tell you if his character is revealed or hidden. Then the players move two characters and employ their special abilities. The asymmetric nature of the player abilities makes for some interesting choices. It's easier to stay revealed early on, but lights start going out as the night wears on, and if the murderer ever starts the turn hidden, he can make a dash for one of the exits.

The game is pretty fun. Initially it seemed a little stacked in favor of the detective, but I think with good play you can keep the detective puzzling over two or three characters until the last round. At which point it's in the detective's best interest to randomly accuse one of the characters left.

This is an interesting asymmetrical 2-player deduction game.  It really encourages the player to get into the head of the other player and use logic as well.

It's a great game to play with someone multiple times in order to really explore the full potential of the game.

Very nice! A little of the best part of Clue, but with some extra oomph from the position of characters, the order in which players and characters move each turn, the need to balance information hiding with the opportunity to escape  -- and then there's  luck of the shuffle every two rounds! It's light enough to play with my 9 year old, but every now and then some very careful thinking can be pretty helpful!

RATING: 6
One of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the 8 characters on the board. This player knows the identity of this character and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns). The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack. But he can make only one accusation during the game!

During each turn the players move the characters, using their special powers, placing them either in shadow or light. At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare if Jack is visible (in light, or adjacent to another character) or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. This continues as the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.

I had hoped there would be more deduction in the game, but it's okay.  The police player wants to split the unknown characters into 2 equal size groups if possible between Lit/Shadowed, and Jack wants to lump them into as large of a group as possible depending on Jack's status of Lit/Shadowed.    The rest is guessing, bluffing and tactical movement.

"It's very hard to win as Jack" a friend of mine said while setting up what was to be my first game. And that evening Jack won twice.
Luck certainly plays a part in this game, but I felt certain suspense every time I had to pick a character. The atmosphere, greatly helped by the artwork, is just brilliant. And it plays different from the other games in my collection. A breath of fresh air that deserves a place on everyone's table, even though the game may not play very intuitively for most nongamers.

Perhaps, I only have two plays thus far, but this game feels simplistic. Yeah, and its tough to win with Mr. Jack. In both occasions I have played, Mr. Jack could be deduced by the end of turn 4. I realized that who is moved and when is more important than actually moving Mr. Jack. I believe in this game, bluffing is essential, though once someone is eliminated, they no longer contribute to the game play as much. I am currently ambivalent about this game. I need someone skilled to play Mr. Jack for me to appreciate playing Jack.

RATING: 5
Wow, what a fun little game! I usually go for heavier stuff, mostly wargames, but this seems like a really excellently-designed light game. Everything just "fits" in terms of the characters' abilities, the flow of the game, and the components. Definitely a find in the filler game category. It's worth noting that the game doesn't really play out like a "deduction" game a la Clue, despite the theme. The gameplay is much more tactical in nature - how can the investigator split suspects between light and dark, and how can Jack foil those plans?

Update: Still fun, but not quite worth the hype it gets around here, IMO. The game develops a certain "sameness" after a few plays - while the card draws enforce some variety, you don't really approach the game with any new insights after the first few outings. I'll stick with my "7" on this one.

Update 2: Haven't pulled this out in years, and don't miss it at all. Dropped to a 5.

Totally awesome two-player game. I love how the special abilities of the characters make the game so deep. There are so many possibilities. This is a truly deep game, but it doesn't feel like an abstract because you can feel the theme through the mechanics and the special player abilities. I also love the asymmetrical aspect of the game. Although it is easier to win as the Inspector, I would much rather be Jack. However, I'm just glad to be able to play this excellent game.

Interesting game but seems fundamentally flawed.  I was Jack in the game I played and Jack was the Sargent.  Given the ability of this character and the luck of the draw, I never got a chance to move him.    This seems like a huge obstacle to winning.  To be fair I should give it a couple more plays but given my space and time constraints, that's unlikely to happen.

I definitely liked the strategy of deciding which characters are most advantageous to play on your turn.

Furthermore, the game just didn't draw me in enough for me to feel like it is worthwhile to dive in deeper.

RATING: 8
A nice games featuring tactical decisons, drafting (between eight characters with different powers), different victory conditions and a bit of luck & bluff; deduction is fairly minor (and "obvious").
Simple, but not banal. Quick.
Fine artwork.

UPDATE (rating downgraded from 7 to 6): Jack's chances to flee are so slim that his best choice is to keep two characters always suspected (more likely both enlighteed) to force a random accusation in the last turn, effectively turning the game into an elaborated maneuvering to decide the winner with a coin flip. Dissatisfying.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nifty design, and has some elements that will draw in players who aren't keen on deduction games.  While deducing who Jack is is a central part of the game, it's just as important to know which character to use on your turn, and how to manipulate the board to either hide from the police, or locate Jack.  It seems to be very easy to deduce who Jack is, at least by the fourth turn, and it quickly develops into a game of cat-and-mouse, but the game plays quickly, and offers a nice, tasty challenge.  I only wonder if the games will become fairly repetitious over time.

Game includes good components, eg big,good quality cards.Some say that the inspector has the advantage, but i haven't played it enough to experience that.
The game is strategic and has also a bit of luck (just enough) to make it fun.  Most games end up really close.

Very interesting two player deduction game (for one of the players at least) 

Just few issues I have with this:
1)Easy to make so big mistake early on that it's allmost impossible to win.
2)Very very unbalanced sides.
3)I don't think I have ever goten a game done with my GF so that she has not got totally mad for me! The situation is actually goten so bad that I am afraid to take this one on the table with her.

My Fiance and I like this game, the theme is perfect, but it seems hard to get away with murder (probably as it should be) A lot tougher to be Jack and win. Good quality pieces, great mechanics, good artwork, and tons of strategy that constantly has to adapt due to the current situation. Perfect filler game for a quick fun session.

Bonus for being designed for 2 players. It's a pretty simple and fast game, and didn't seem like much at first. We've since each developed our strategies a bit and games last (slightly) longer as a result.

RATING: 8
Oh this is just so nice. Verry good two player game, with much brain use, and logic involved. Nice nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the 8 characters on the board. This player knows the identity of this character and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns). The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack. But he can make only one accusation during the game!
\13\\13\
During each turn the players move the characters, using their special powers, placing them either in shadow or light. At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare if Jack is visible (in light, or adjacent to another character) or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. This continues as the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.

Interesting game. I rate after one play and revise later if my opinion changes, but usually I can tell if a game is likely to rise or fall after more plays. With this one, I could see it going either way. The level of randomness seems like it could doom this one for me (especially as I'm a fan of 2-player Scotland Yard, which scratches the same itch with no randomness after the setup). On the other hand, figuring out how to best use each character's ability seems like it might lend a nice level of depth to the experience, a big plus in a game with this short of playing time. One thing I can definitely say is that I was favorably impressed with the components, and would not hesitate to buy another game from Hurrican.

I played this at Euroquest and really enjoyed it. I like deduction games and I really like that it's a board game and one playable between two people. Probably the best way to play and declare a winner is to play it twice - once as each side and use the turn differential of finding/escaping Jack to determine the winner.

RATING: 10
I love two player games where the players have different goals, and I love games where each character has a special ability (see: Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, Heroscape)--thus, Mr. Jack was a no-brainer for me.  The game art is among my very favorites.  People that complain about the lack of deduction in the deduction element are kind of missing the point.  It's not really a deduction game in the usual sense.  If you think of the number of revealed players as a scoring track, Jack is trying to keep the marker on one end, while the detective is trying to move that marker to the other end.  Anyway, we'll see how this holds up after a lot of plays, but right now I'm excited about it.

For a logic/deduction game, this one is reasonably fun.  Unfortunately, I don't really like logic/deduction games (for an exception to the general rule, see Timbuktu).

We found the choices in game are simple and don't require deep thinking - contrary to what we expected from deduction type game.

Adding to the fact that game itself is not much special and component quality is poor. Sold.

It reminds me of Clue, only far more challenging. Sometimes too challenging, in fact.

De speurtocht naar Jack de Ripper is nog nooit zo kort geweest.

In dit spel voor twee spelers gaan 8 detectives op zoek naar jack de Ripper, maar al snel blijkt dat dat waarschijnlijk √©√©n van hen is. HEt is de taak van de speler als jack de ripper uit de handen te blijven van de detectives of het gebied volledig te ontsnappen. De speler met de detectives moet Jack juist te pakken krijgen.

Als spelidee een erg goed spel en het is ook goed uitgewerkt, maar toch bekruipt mij een gevoel van eentonigheid.

Game of bluff and deduction. The heavy Jack the Ripper theme is more Disney than horror, so the game is very kid friendly. The goal is to get Mr. Jack out of London before your opponent figures out who you are. And then the roles reverse, and you try to discover which one is Jack before your opponent can escape. Cutecutecute.

It's clear that this game is heavily slanted toward a detective victory, so the challenge is in winning as Jack.  This is a beautiful game, simple and quick to play, and is full of strategy, bluffing, and deception.  Short 2-player strategy games do not get any better than this.

A much better deduction game than Scotland Yard, but it's only 2-player. The odds seem really stacked against Jack, but there are a few simple strategies that should be pretty obvious from the start for each side. Light, very quick, and entertaining. I definitely see the need for the Extension and/or New York since the base game may get stale/repetitive.

Really nice deduction game. Wife loves it. Good solid 8 atm but may go down later on. Would be sweet if it could handle more that 2 players.

Yuck. Too easy for the detective. Takes a good "Jack" to have a decent game, but I'd still rather play something else.

Not sure what all the hype is about for Mr. Jack.  Maybe I'm just not into the 2-player scene, and the whole move and guess mechanic didn't satiate my taste in deduction games.  Some of the characters have interesting abilities, and while it plays quick, I didn't really see the replayability of the game, especially if you play someone constantly, I'd imagine you can read their movements when Jack is impersonating certain characters.

Not something I'd ask for again.

I happen to very much like the deduction aspect of this game. Attempting to throw the inspector off your trail is equal parts frustration and thrill.

A nice light little game. Clever design. The good news: from now, you won't have to feel obliged to play that awful "Clue" with your kid anymore...

RATING: 9
A nearly perfect game- short, challenging, and varied. The beauty lies in the fact that the strategies of the Investigator and Jack are so different although they both use the same characters turn after turn, which themselves have cleverly varied powers. The only issue lies in small loopholes and shortfalls, such as Watson's relative uselessness, or Sherlock, Ms. Stealthy, or Goodley's slight overpoweredness. All in all, one of the greatest games I have played and one I would recommend to anyone, beginner or expert.

It is very rare for me to research a game so thoroughly before purchasing it to only wind up detesting it after a few plays.  Mr. Jack is theorectically a good game, yet I would have to disagree wholeheartedly.

After playing two sessions, I was left VERY unfulfilled.  Not only did I feel the game was laughably unbalanced, but there was no way the Jack player could ever make it to turn 8 without being uncovered or accused... yet alone escape!  Unless the inspector is not very bright or extremely unlucky, Mr. Jack has NO chance of winning due to strategy.  It is ALL luck!  

I played nine sessions total as Jack and in the end won once due to simple luck - the conditions were set up perfectly for me to escape.  I thought maybe my "strategy" was flawed and gave the inspector side a try and found I could even not pay attention and still win! 

I am not at all whining... I am simply stating my perception of a game that I really wanted to like.  I love the theme yet this really falls short on all accounts.  I understand that the dark theme would make some people uncomfortable, but that is no excuse to bubble it up with cartoon renditions.  Simply put, the artwork does not match the theme whatsoever.

Some of the components such as the game board and the character pieces are just nice, but for the price of the game, the quality is significantly lacking.  The character and alibi cards are way too thick and show wear just after a few plays... and I take excesively good care of my games at all times!

I do understand that I am a minority in that I am one of few who didn't find Mr. Jack loads of fun, but I think I gave this game many chances to justify the pumped up reviews it got here.

A cartoonish abstract deduction game.  One by one, eliminate the suspects and catch Jack before he escapes.

Brilliantly designed, fun theme, but rife with analysis paralysis.

Thank you Secret Santa (from my wife - crystallr - and I)!!!

I like the deduction combined with the chess-like strategy.  To clarify: I see the major goal of the detectives as making sure that all players are covered, similar to protecting your pieces in chess.

Ever want to play Clue but you only have two people present?  This might be the game for you, although I could see it being "played out" quicker than other games.  It's ok, I enjoyed it, but I'd rather call up a 3rd friend and convince them to come over and play some Clue.

I wasn't really into the game.  too quick, too much of a brain burner and not really that fun.  Should actually list 3 plays (but I don't remember when the other two were).

I dont know if I love or hate it for turning me into an AP king. 
I feel like playing chess, while behind a board of Mr. Jack, but I guess I like it for that. 
Easy family game that is full of hard decisions to make.

Uno de los jugadores representa a Jack el destripador, y el otro a los investigadores. Jack deber√° intentar escapar ya sea escondi√©ndose hasta que llegue el alba, o saliendo de la ciudad. Tras cada ronda se determina si hay testigos de sus cr√≠menes o no los hay.

When I opened the box at first, I thought: "Wow, this looks like a basic 2-player version of Cyclades!"

But my score doesn't result from me having expectations that were too high. I might have to play this more than two times to give a more precise rating. Right now, my experiences are that the game can be over way too fast, when there hasn't been really any back-and-forth, and that I'm really missing something like a glory counter so that you can track how many glory points each player has. We used Munchkin bookmarks or ten-sided die for that effect.

RATING: 5
After two plays I'm not sure. I like it, but the game can go rather one-sided if there is a lot of card action early on. Our first game was very interesting and a bit of a brain burner. There was lots of back and forth before I finally was whittled down. The second game started with me having a majority of the temples, using some tricky card play, and basically dominating. My opponent never had a chance. We need to play more to see what normally happens during a game. If it's not so one-sided, I may rate it better.

Lots of decisions, tight gameplay, and a short duration makes this an area-control game which I can love. Nice components help too. A really good 2-player battle.

Reasonably good light game that plays really quickly.  It's as much about tile placement and card play as it is about wargaming.  There's a lot of luck in it but a fair amount of strategy, too.  A good one to take on holiday for a quick evening play.

I have some doubts about the game which appear to be echoed amongst owners. You can explore to find new areas or fight to take areas off the other player [you also get the impression
that two players is 2 too few for this title]. Clearly fighting is better as it may causes a gain as well as a loss. Constant war ensues. The three types of God card represent Ares, Poseidon, and Zeus, which correspond to fighting, exploration, and everything else. So its best to draw the Ares cards if you feel eliminating your opponent is a good idea in a 2-player game. Some of the Ares cards allow you to attack twice instead of once, which breaks the tit-for-tat sequence of sequential attacks. You may have two such cards, which presumably allows three attacks, and if Zeus doesn't stop one of them, this can cause an eventual win. Thus the boats [the same miniature as in Martin's game Tyros] don't do a great deal except when they get involved in the land battle due to a card. It is a wargame, it is somewhat interesting, its entirely dependent on cards drawn, it helps if advancing due to a successful attack sets you up for the next one, and there is a intriguing see-saw of fortune. But would anyone play a second game, or even a first game all the way through? If the answer's "yes", this is another reason to take them out as quickly as possible.

Not a bad light wargame for two players that you can easily squeeze into an hour. There is some luck of the draw with the cards but that seems to be eased a bit by the fact that none of the cards seem too powerful. I especially like the way the voyage action allows for you to not discover a tile. The three different actions seem to be fairly balanced.

Good two player game. Great for travel. Nice graphics and figurines, but the instructions are poorly written. Excellent game mechanics. Cards could use some clarifications. Definitely a game that grows on you the more you play it. I would suggest playing the game the first time without using any cards especially when introducing it to non-gamers. An excellent game with great replay value. Excellent value for the money. I&#039;m sure this one won&#039;t collect dust.

This game has great pieces and production especially for a two player game. However, the strategy is very bland. The cards make the whole game and most of the cards are useless. The worst part of this game is that so many rules are completely ambiguous. Nothing worse than a game where the rules are incomplete, even after reading the FAQ. Too frustrating to be worth it.

Kosmos two player with interesting choices between getting god cards (with powerful aids), or armies, or exploring. Seemed a little long as there seems to not be as much incentive to explore. Who ever does it gives up in the armies and cards portion and only gains a city. Maybe its about striking the right balance. I may need more plays with this one.

It looks like it&#039;ll be good, but then it&#039;s just too... something, or not enough... something.  The see-sawing back and forth isn&#039;t really that exciting, and... it&#039;s hard to describe, but this game just... lacks.

Borrowed from a friend. Only had a chance to play once before returning it, but it is fun. Short (which is good), good for two (which is my main gaming group #). Easy to learn, games are close, and feels like there's at least a medium-ish amount of re-playability with the God cards.

Tried this on the "Spielefest" fair in Vienna. Not bad, although the luck factor is too large, especially for a two-player game. Whoever got the first temple pretty much had the game in his grip. And why, oh why, is this only a two-player game? The theme and mechanics could easily be adapted for a multi-player game!

i'm not sure if it's a game thing or a play style thing, but i always play this game with the same opponent and our games seem to drag with quite a bit of back and forth.  lots of nice things going on, but it doesn't seem quite right.  i might still enjoy playing it some more with an interested opponent.

As the 2004 GM at the WBC for this game, I enjoy playing Hellas.  However, its not the first two player game I reach for when I want to play a two-player game (mostly because I'm not a big wargamer).  The looks are deceiving here - it may look innoculous but its a true wargame inside.

RATING: 4
One of those games I'm just not sure about. The first play was miserable; after I got the rules straightened out in my head, things got better, but there's either something missing in the game or how I'm thinking about it. I'll undoubtedly try it again sometime, but it's not high on my list of things to do.

Really wanted to like this a lot but ended up finding it OK but a little dull.  It looks lovely but the game seems to come down to whether your luck out with the cards/tiles you draw.

RATING: 6
This game plays rather strangely. It's a area control game for 2 players. You spread your forces to control more land, you grow weaker 'coz of the spreading, thus making you more vulnerable to attacks. You are attacked, you lose land, and your opponent gets more land, but becomes weaker also because by doing this he expanded his regions, then you attack, he loses land, then you become more vulnerable again, etc, etc.... you get the point.

Initial notes:

- Carc-hex-sonne meets Risk without the dice.
- Power cards thrown in as well
- I like the setting and the pieces.  Reminds me of Attika, which is a superior game.
- Once one player achieves a "critical mass" of units on the board, it's very hard to overcome that advantage without resorting to god card draws.
- Card texts, rules are pretty bad.  Great Wiki article (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Hellas_FAQ) penned by Russ:

No, no, no. You have to be lucky when drawing the cards, and if things go wrong you will have no chance to recover. It would be less painful to just draw a card and see who has the highest. The hidden information aspect makes the game even worse.

Another Kosmos 2-player (geez, I have alot of those!). This game is odd. It's 1/3 tile placement, 1/3 light wargame (ala Risk) and 1/3 card driven wargame. And it plays in about 40 minutes. Not too bad, but not quite what I thought.

RATING: 7
Very, very light war game, that plays very quickly.  Actually,  more of an exploration and war game; it takes a bit of thinking to balance your priorities correctly.  I like that combat is not too chaotic, but just chaotic enough with the cards.  Gathering cards is almost always useful, since I've rarely run into a card that I could not use in a couple turns, usually less---definitely not a resource to be ignored during Burst of Strength.

I like how the ships and exploration work, as well.  Having the majority of ships in an area really does keep your opponent out, which is all in all a good thing.  Otherwise your opponent will be able to strategically maneouver and get a valuable city more accessible to his armies... 

Portable in a way that most war games aren't.  :)

Too much luck to be a perfect game, but it is a lot of fun and very quick. You can play a few games in a sitting and the luck (all in the god cards) will tend to balance out in a best 3 of 5 session.

Interesting in that the board changes the game boundaries and the cards change the rules. Like Diplomacy in that the higher number of pieces win the battle.

Seven is a tentative rating, after our first play. This has been sitting on our shelf for a while, unplayed - we just haven't had time to learn a new game lately. We played without reading any of the FAQs or collected rules questions on this site (we're very flexible about making rules decisions on the fly), but I've since downloaded the files, and I think they will make a big difference. There is a considerable amount of ambiguity in the God cards - when to play them, issues of precedence ("does that one take effect before or after this one?") - but our first game was enjoyable and I would be willing to play it again sooner than later. My suspicion is that there is a lot of game packed in this little box once you know the rules inside and out and that it will grow on me. Not unlike Babel in that way, which is one of my favourite 2-player games. We waited for quite a while to buy this, only after having over a half-dozen other Kosmos 2-player games in the collection. Perhaps it was the theme that didn't appeal to me, or I was getting it confused with Hera & Zeus, which I know I won't like (I'm not a fan of the Stratego-type games).

Orignally I rated this game as a 5 after three plays. After 6 plays I rate it as a 2.  This game seems like a great concept that just doesn't satisfy.  The game is very dynamic and cards can wildly change the game.  Strategy in this game is nearly impossible.  I really wanted to like this game but don't.  It will be going to the bottom of the game chest (with flux).

This game has the worst most incompetently written rules I've come across in a Rio Grande game and is a blemish on their record. The game is simple enough in the end, maybe, after you download one of many FAQs here collecting all the players efforts to quiz Rio Grande on rules clarifications. That they haven't reissued it with a complete rules rewrite is gobsmackingly pathetic.

I'm not sure how much of the mess is in the translation from a German original (I know some is) and how much is carried over form poor German rules, but either way while I think this game can be salvaged and is a nice little entry into the Kosmos range of two player games (different to most I've tried) there is NO WAY I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a game. The sheer frustration of the first game(s) is something you have to amortize with later plays, and no a cost I'd sink into it if I had forewarning.

En algún sitio le describieron como una mezcla entre carcassone y risk. Es un poco como el tres en raya. El juego no tendría final, si no fuera por las cartas. No obstante, me gusta bastante, porque es rápido.

En cada turno el jugador tiene tres opciones: reforzarse, descubrir nuevas ciudades o atacar (por tierra o mar). Después puede redistribuir sus tropas. Gana el primero que llega a 10 ciudades. No es un juegazo, pero para entretener un rato, sirve.

Can be terribly fun and/or terribly frustrating.  There is definately the classic wanting to more than you're able per turn, but if random card play wrecking your plans is not tolerably stay away; if wrecking your opponent's plans with random card play appeals to you, you should enjoy it.  If you fall somewhere in between, you may or may not enjoy it.  After about six hours of play, for me its a keeper!

As my husband said after our first game, "It's like a boring version of Cyclades." It's hard to disagree. Whereas he played very aggressively, attacking me again and again, I played very sheepishly, voyaging or reinforcing my troops on every turn. I actually won with the help of a couple of Poseidon cards without ever having launched an attack. Not a good sign for what is ostensibly a light, tiny war game.

OK game.  I play most 2-player games with my wife and she didn't like it.  Too much swings on getting a few of the double-move cards and being able to play them; i.e., counter your opponent's counter-spells (Zeus "void" cards).  There are other games I would rather play than this.

Neat little game I thought, not great, but nice, and good for a violent little game when you are having a hankering for somthing Risky but don&#039;t want to invest the time in those &quot;classics?&quot;. Interesting choices, and yes, the cards are powerful, but they are a known quantity and not very many different kinds, so you can&#039;t complain too much since you should have some sense of your opponent&#039;s capabilities. Not in the same league as Knizia&#039;s LotR: Confrontation game, certainly, but solidly in the second tier of pretty good, but not great, Kosmos 2-player games.

I really love this game. Unfortunately, no one that I've ever played it with shares that opinion so I don't get to play it very often. I love the different options that the game presents. True, voyaging without discovering new land can be annoying, but I have found that it happens far less often if you make sure that you have two placement options open before voyaging. Overall, a very enjoyable two player game - if only you can find someone else to play it with you! :-)

I think I'll need 2 or 3 more plays before having a final verdict on the game. Right now, I like the idea, the mix between cards, the exploration and the simple combat but I'm not sure if there aren't some game breaking strategies (like being the first to have a temple) or drawing more Zeus cards and letting the other do the exploration for us...

In the end, I didn't feel like going back to it...

Nice, short two-player explore & expand game. The god cards are fun but very powerful. I didn't like the the equal number is enough to win rule and zero losses in combat for the winner. It makes it quite abstract.

Very pleasant surprise. We normally play the 12 city variant if one player gets 10 and the other has 8 or 9 cities. My wife normally suggests this one which was really unexpected. That might change now since she has worked out how to beat me at it continually :(

A good game that mixes area control, special card abilities, and tile laying mechanics.  It has more depth than most people credit it.  It rated a 7 for quite some time, but I found my interest waning and it rarely gets played now.Not to give too much strategy away, you'll need to balance military actions with exploration, and draw draw draw those cards!

Nice tile laying game mixed with an area control war game for two players. The tile laying and strategy mechanics mesh well together, neither overpowers the other. The theme and game mechanics however could be better meshed. The use and mechanics of boats are especially good at killing the theme.

The added god cards are a nice touch and help to mix up the game play, but do not interfere with the core strategy elements, offering a fairly deep experience. 

Greek and boat minis are great (if not a little too easy to tip over). Hex tiles are nice and big, but the separation from the punch boards leave them with little nubs on some edges, not allowing for a flush fit during play on some tiles. Cards are not bad, not great, but not bad.

I liked it for what it is, which is a short tactical game with great components, but my son disliked it and my interest in it isn't enough to push at playing it often.  The cards, I feel add a nice touch, but with draw luck here and on the tiles it can be very tight in trying to pull out a win after multiple bad draws.
Overall:  This game is worth a try to see if it is your cup of tea for something quick!

RATING: 6
This is a solid 2-player game.  There is a good amount of strategy mixed with a good amount of luck. It seems like timely (lucky) card draws will probably decide the game most of the time between two evenly matched opponents. 

Some may be put off by the battle rules, but they serve to limit the chaos to the cards. I think if there were only one deck, rather than 3, I would not have enjoyed the game as much. Because of the 3 decks, even though the cards introduce a fair amount of luck....players must be wise enough to draw from the deck that will produce cards they need. (The decks each have different emphasis.)

The game has a decent blend of exploration mixed with calculated attacks and card play gambits; but my first game played overly long because of a series of unsuccessful voyages by both myself and my opponent which slowed the midgame to a crawl. I need to play it more to get a better grip on the mechanics and possibilities, but haven't had the urge to do so, and ended up selling my copy, the first time I've ever gotten rid of a Euro with only 1 play.

This is one that you have to stick around for...the first game left me terribly underwhelmed but I knew there was a lot good there.  I felt it was hampered by some kind of vague rules and too much of a runaway victory.  Playing it again, with a greater understanding of the rules, expectations regarding card play, and a better sense of the flow of the game...and I loved it.  This is one of those games that just hits the spot when you only have two players and want something mildly wargamey without being 3 hours long or way too complex.  Great blending of exploration, combat, cardplay, and territorial domination.  Opa!

Not bad at all for such a compact little game. The soldier minis really should have a larger base though they didn't tip over that often. Some of the actions could need a bit more explanations as the effects of "god" cards can really mess up strategies.

The first play of this game fell really flat for me.  Where it feels like a solid game, it seems that something is missing.  I want to say it's missing the fun, but I'm not sure what would make it more fun.  Dice combat?  The combat is my biggest complaint here.  Perhaps if it were changed to > instead of = , in terms of the number of troops needed to conquer...  My second complaint is that the bases on the Greek figures are way too small!

My first impressions of this game, which date back to the aftermath of a Spiel long since gone, were quire favourable. The artwork is nice and bright, and the wargamish aspect struck a chord with me although I couldn't quite put my finger on why it did. For all sorts of reasons the game never saw much table time thereafter, but when it eventually did I was forced to revise a great deal of my then favourable opinions. Instead of an interesting game it was, in fact, downright boring with the score see-sawing all over the place until one player manually adds his victorious new land tile. It is very difficult to conduct a campaign of brutal warfare and win that way; instead the game continues until one player cannot keep the other from winning. That is an unsatisfactory way to proceed; it's not quite winning by not losing, but viewed from a different angle, it is. Hellas appears to derive much of its unpredictability from the cards with special powers, and these do not add sufficient variety to make it stand out from the crowd. In that respect, Fjords is the better game as it makes do with less (even though the latter is game-technically not a good title either, see my comments over there). 

Immediately thereafter I decided to let the game go; it would not be played again at my table anyway.

[b]Update[/b] As part of an Alphabet challenge to play every game in my and another gamer's collection in alphabetical order, Hellas hit the table. I stand with the above criticism, and have lowered my rating because it better reflects my opinion of the game. Especially at the time of writing there are better confrontational games for two available.

RATING: 7
Rating hasn't solidified yet, but I had my first play today.  At first it was a haze getting through the rules (not that they're poorly written) and strategies were unclear.  Then suddenly, like a door creaking open, we both realized the potential of the game especially when mixed with the card play and numerous options for how you arrange your troops.  In a few quick turns I had lost by 2 cities and my reaction was "Wow."  This is an impressive dominance/wargame on such a lite scale. Those who think the cards put too much luck and chaos into the game, I recommend the variant (suggested elsewhere) where you choose your cards before the game starts and you ONLY get those cards for the entire game.  The only weird thing: the ships have no part to play whatsoever in marine combat.

RATING: 5.5
Some good ideas, but the core-ruleset leads to a very static game. To alleviate this, players have access to very powerful 'god-cards', allowing them to perform actions that are vastly more powerful and way harder to defend than they'd normally be. Gameplay hinges on acquiring and utilizing these powerful cards, and while that's an interesting idea, the inherent luck of the draw will screw players over, leading to frequent unfun situations. I prefer the more strategic and (in my mind) superior design "Fjords" by the same author.

Truly this is an unplayable, broken game. A game with a deck of cards where EVERY SINGLE CARD requires correction and/or clarification, and it's not entirely certain what the corrections should be since on that scale you can wind up with significantly different game play.

Good news and bad news on this one.  It is a lot of game in a small box.  I think it would be good if you are trying to introduce war games to a new player.  The rules are slim and work well.  It is also good for a game on the go.  Good for taking back to the family on a holiday.  The only bad is obvious.  If you are really in to war games, you are probably going to play something more rich in theme and rules.  So it will probably not get a lot of plays.  But if you are looking for a solid war game with easy to each rules this is a good one.  I appreciate games that I can get beginners to play, so for me it is a keeper.

In the land of ancient Greece, called Hellas, the people waged power struggles for control of the many valuable islands. The combatants faced each other over land and across the seas. In these battles with sail and sword, the combatants venture forth to discover new islands to fight over. To aid them in their battles, the combatants often seek the favor of the Gods.

I really want to like this one, but I think there may be too great an advantage to an aggressive attack strategy.  In the (4; admittedly few) games I've played of this, the player who attacked first and frequently was generally able to dominate the board. A defensive strategy only appears to be viable with lucky tile & card draws allowing you to bottleneck your opponent across the dolphin.  Voyaging should be profitable, but the attrition in ships and the constant need to burst to replace them will leave you behind the aggressive attacker who gobbles up your Greeks and ships each time he conquers a city.  Also, could use some clarification in the rules and card interaction.  Lunchtime Game of the Week, 04/06 - 04/12

I love the concept of squeezing what comes close to being the most compact and quickest 4x game around. It is abstract and the illustrations and components are better than colors.

This is an enjoyable mini-war game.  I like that there is actually no dice rolling which I half expected before looking at the components.  The game play is very streamlined and there's a lot of 'take that' elements, if you like that sort of thing.  You can essentially defend your opponent to death by doing multiple voyages to get cities which can be interesting but usually some offense is needed.

TRADED IT!

I wouldn't agree with comparing it to Risk light, it's less of a war game and more of a out-manuever your opponent with a bit of luck sort of game. I find it interesting that you only have 15 Greeks (land units), and as you reach the goal of controlling 10 cities you are forced to leave others less defended... making it harder to protect what you have as you near victory; nice balancing effect. It's quick, compact, and even has a light "meaty" game feel... making this lil' 2 player gem hard not to love and keep in a backpack. The power switch of unbalanced cards and the fact that the winner of a battle losses no units are my only gripes.

[ OK, I've owned it for many years now, and I think I have some to the conclusion that the neat bits in a handy box can not make up for this mediocre game. ]

Interesting game with nice components, but the cards are poorly worded.  In our first game, my girlfriend and I encountered rules problems with three of the God cards!  If I can find some sort of errata for the cards, I will probably upgrade my rating.

UPDATE - I have actually downgraded my ranking, after further play.  The game seems too random:  long-term strategy plays little part, and some of the cards are far too powerful.  The game seems to boil down to who can draw the powerful cards first.  The great bits can't cover the dull game play or the poorly-written card rules.

Broken.  There are simply too many situations where your opponent quickly gets to 10 cities, and you can do nothing to stop them.  I've never had a game last more than 10 minutes, and that's playing slow.  We tried playing to 12, but then it simply goes back and forth ad infinitum.  Just bad.

This is definitely the tiniest solid wargame I have, and it's a tile-flipper!  Tile-flippers are fun.  With the need to spread 10 of your 15 guys across the board to win (with a 3-guy stacking limit), it becomes very difficult to break far enough ahead of the opposition to keep such a lead.  A lot of the time, it feels like that equilibrium can only be broken by the luck of good card draws, or the luck of finding more temple tiles, which provides an advantage in increasing your might.  That, or one player flubs a decision or two, of course.

* Played 25+ times. Interesting tactical war game. Very short for a war game (most games under 40 minutes) and nice rolls of momentum back and forth. Much "cleaner" game than I thought: easy-to-understand rules and lots of opportunity for clever play. And a modular board to boot! Down from an 8 because the god cards add a great deal of luck to play and can severely skewer any strategy employed. Back up to an 8 because the bad playing I had hasn't repeated itself as we become more aware of what the cards can do. [BuyF. Sell.]

First impression was very good.  Lots of ideas here for me to explore.  It really helped to read the FAQ and rules summary on the Geek to 'get' this game.

Love the feel and ambition of a random map euro wargame in a small package.  It's also a big hand management game which it another mechanic I like.  Card artwork is great.

Wanted to love this. The components are great (the islands look amazing) and I feel there's a great little game in there somewhere, but the rules are unclear and there are so many unresolved little inconsistencies; whilst the game on the whole feels too much like a tit-for-tat exchange rather than a meaningful campaign. Not sure why it's two-player only - I think the mechanic would work fine with 3-4.

Hellas is a constant tug of war, a continuous struggle to explore, conquer and defend until one of the players gets to 10 cities. The basic rules are very simple so the game relies on the help of the Greek gods to spice things up and introduce a bit of dynamism. Unfortunately, the cards also open a few holes in the rules. Since the card effects are crucial to the game it is pretty much mandatory for both players to know them beforehand in order not to make any stupid mistakes.

Hellas is a short game, and thanks to the huge card effects it is almost entirely tactical in nature. Consistent as it may be it also makes the game feel a little limited in scope.

Arrived from Boulder today (12/20/02) via UPS. Played frist game 12/28/02. Really loved the first game. Tense, close, see-sawed back and forth. Lots of tension with more to do than you can do each turn. Lots of interesting decisions in a nice, compact, delicious game. One of the better games I've played lately.
2006 - though I've seldom played it the past few years, this is still an excellent game. Games are tense and generally close.
2007 - have played the game twice in January. It has made me realize how much I really enjoy this game. Why has it not gotten more play? 
Perhaps the small box makes people think it's a cheap/simple game. Wrong! Hellas has a lot of good strategy and requires planning to play it well. A white-knuckler IMO.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly, this was drier than I expected, and strong on numbers and tactics.  Game also develops faster than you expect, so you can't afford to fall behind at all or it will be over in a second.

It's a big wargame wallop in a small package, and I like it.  Rating will probably rise after a few more plays, our first game was not particularly a good one but I think that was due to less aggressive play on one of our parts.  Will update as we play more.

Not as great as I remembered it. What still worked for me was the Risk-esque like war (where the further you spread out the less soldiers you have to work with) and I think the options that are available to you work as well. But I was sorta pooped on this game by the "God Cards." Hellas is a highly tactical tile game and players slowly and steadily build towards their end goal of owning 10 cities. The problem lies that two equal players will generally match each other on the game front. Thus, the winner is the player who randomly grabs one of the more powerful (chaotic and sometimes unbalanced) God cards. Either the 'make 2 attacks' or 'void other player's God card' will cinch the win. There is more to the game than that, but whatever subtleties remain, I don't think I'll be taking the time to figure them out. Great idea for a game but I think the card aspect should have been tweaked. Could have been a great game but ended up being a so-so one.

I found this game a bore.  I had heard all the comments stating the initial feeling of being underwhelmed, but Hellas never offered much after a couple plays.  I was so excited about a quick playing, two player, card driven war game that I really wanted to like this but I can't.  Maybe my patience is thin, but I couldn't imagine working through this game again when there are so many titles that offer so much more.

Nice ideas with the difficult decision of either exploring a new tile or move and attack. The game feels like a small cousin to Cyclades, in some ways (and a much quicker playing game at that). Cards provide  players ways to use the Gods to help them vanquish their foe. The problem is that the game begins to feel so very back & forth (swingy) after a time. I hate the 1 for 1 attrition as in many other euros.

Rule ambiguities lower the rating for this game a little. I liked the game but sometimes it was tough trying to figure out what a particular rule really meant. I guess I am getting better with the rules but still until at least one more and probably two more plays the games rating does not change.

Accept that luck will be a factor in this game and you will have fun with it.  If you try and control it like A&A or Diplomacy you'll hate it.  It's only a 2 player game and only lasts 20-35 minutes so it's not meant to be a serious strategy game.  The god cards are strong and random but the greek gods were both powerfull and fickle!  Just relax and enjoy it and it's a fun game.

Four plays. An intense tug-of-war in the Aegean, sometimes quick, sometimes drawn-out. Artwork and little soldiers are quite nice. It is important to be familiar with the card decks in order to be prepared for what your opponent might throw at you. The only down side is that every game feels kind of the same: buildups followed by card battles until finally one player is hobbled and the other strolls off to the finish line.

It quickly became one of my favorite 2-player games, but I haven't felt the same will to play it lately. There is some luck of the draw, of course, but you can be prepared to counter it if you know the cards. The real flaw is that you have a hand limit and can't discard cards to draw others - you have to use them. So, bad luck when drawing cards punishes you twice. Very nice components, just one minor gripe about the small Greeks which keep being knocked down.

Excellent little game.  It has the tile-laying aspect of Carcassone with a battle aspect, like risk (no dice, though).  Very fun.

Some really clever and interesting stuff going on here, and a very novel combination of mechanisms. Unfortunately, it's really dry, and the only thing that keeps it from being scripted is the God cards--and they're crazy unbalanced.

The board position is very close to a stalemate.  It seems that the cards are the power, and the player who draws the most (and best) cards (without getting too weakened on the board) can get the victory.  Enjoyable game tense and close.

I won, because I played more aggressive than my opponent.  I can easily imagine, that two aggressive players can play forever. Controlling and holding 10 cities with 15 soldiers is a real tough task. There is always a &#039;hole&#039; in the cover.
On the other hand, as the outcome of a battle is easy to calculate (ratio decides), it is also somehow dangerous to defend with full strength (3 soldiers and 3 ships): if the attacker arrives on land route, he needs 3 soldiers (via sea +1) to conquer; the defenders soldiers are lost and the ships are changed into ships of the attacker...
All this, if not one of all those powerful cards turn the outcome anyway into something totally random.

Hellas was one of the top three "finds" of 2007. As much as I'd love a weekly game group that enjoys deep games, the truth is that I most often have opportunity to play 2-player games with my wife... and she does not prefer conquest-style games.

Hellas gave me a TASTE of conquest-style games in a format that my wife could enjoy... although not as much as me. I loved the theme (ancient Greece), I loved the feel of ancient conquest, I loved the exploration of new islands, and I *mostly* enjoyed the components. The lil' dudes kept falling over so I did something I rarely do... I defaced my components by gluing pennies to their base.

My wife did not enjoy the game quite as much as I did, but she enjoyed it enough that it can hit the table every now and then -- enough to scratch that "conquest itch".

First played June 14th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (~5min) and quick play (~30min).  We read through the rules and played away.  We ended up playing twice however I didn't really figure it out and it seemed whoever had the temple majority was going to have the advantage.  I'd like to play this again before recommending it.  It seemed too one-sided.  Update: we played again with the correct rules and it still seemed one-sided.  Perhaps we're playing it wrong, however it seems you can't recover if you lose the battle of having the most temples as all three games were one-side victories with the temple owner.  Which means the pendulum seems to swings to far on the luck side for me.  I enjoy it, however would enjoy it more if it were more balanced.

RATING: 2
Two-player game of Greek island conquest. I was quite disappointed in this game. To me and my opponent, it felt like a mindless attack back-and-forth kind of game, interspaced with a bit of exploration and the occasional reinforcement action when the dead piles got too big.

Also, as others have commented, the cards determine *everything* in this game. If your opponent has a crappy Ares card, your 4-on-3 sea attack will succeed, if he has a good one, you've just lost 4 greeks. Sure, you might have a Zeus "counterspell" as backup, but so might he. If I wanted an interesting game of instant speed spells and counterspells, I would play Magic, rather than this dry, repetitive exercise.

In addition, the wording of many of the god cards, not to mention the interaction of those cards with others leads to a multitude of rules questions not covered by the rules. Not good.

In short, there is no way I can recommend this game.

One of the better games in the Kosmos 2-player line.  Some might not like the large luck element in the card draws for each player, but it does guarantee that each game will be totally different. The play on how to minimise your opponent's luck makes this game a fascinating exercise.

A very light, very quick area control game with powerful cards and random tile draws to mix things up. Ahem. Let me re-phrase that. A too light, too quick area control game with overly-powerful cards and heck of random tile draws to mix things up. Game feels pointless and unsatisfying.

RATING: 5.5
There are at least three ways in which the game is "broken": (1) The temple cities are overpowered (1 extra burst of strength action) and create too much incentive to attack; (2) Voyaging is too random (twice in a row I got unplayable cards, and then other times you can pick up temples (see (1) above); (3) The God cards are too random (e.g. either they are useless, or they singlehandedly throw the game).  It's still a reasonably fun filler game

RATING: 5
A lot's packed into a small package, literally and figuratively: a bit of tile placement, a bit of direct conflict, a bit of exploration, a bit of card play. In fact, it has quite a few if not most of the components of a light wargame. Component quality is pretty good for the price, and, laid out, things are pretty attractive. The Greeks are a bit tippy, but that's more or less acceptable. The fact that the ships only help with exploration (unless affected by a card) is a little odd at first blush. The thing may go on a bit too long even after a victor is clear or at least likely--I can see this stalling out at 8 to 3 a bit too often.

A great game.  The cards do have a lot of influence, but that matches the theme (powers of the gods).  I have not yet found any tactic that is unbeatable.

A little gem. May be a bit luck dependent because of the gods cards, but the ancient gods were capricius :) so the theme fits very well. Excellent components.

I like it's tile laying mechanism, which makes it a different game each and every time we play it. Plus combined with the civilization/battle theme it's very appealing to me. It's not a wargame in classic meaning of the word, but it still needs that "agressive" like aptitude to play good this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting game, with a taut battle to control ten cities.  Players have only 15 soldiers to work with, so as you reach for victory, you are stretched super-thin.  Three different card decks feed special abilities into the game, making the combat and exploration dynamic and different each time.  See my review (co-authored with Mark Johnson) on the Games Journal.

RATING: 7
It's an abstract strategy game with enough hidden, random elements to make it less predictable and more thematically fun. There is a thick layer of tactics and strategy underlying the game, in choosing when to expand versus attack versus build up reinforcements, and when you do expand or attack, where it would be best to do so in order to protect your cities with distance rather than your limited supply of soldiers. But the God cards throw in a good deal of uncertainty such that you cannot rely solely on pure math to win; you must make tactical choices to outmaneuver the God cards, or just take the risk and hope your opponent doesn't have a card that will wipe out your armies. Lots of replay value here and the plastic soldiers and ships help elevate the game quality a notch or two. The rule-book could use a lot of help, however - its descriptions of attacking by land versus water make the two sound entirely different, but they're really not!

I'm already planning on buying another set to have a 4-player game of this. Just set the winning condition to 6 or 7 cities instead of 10, and it shouldn't last forever.

Hybrid game : "wargame" with an euro gameplay ! Not so easy to grasp in the first few games (you have to learn how to deal with the cards, it's not easy to build the hand you need), but worth the patience. After the learning stages, games are really tense with lots of back and forth action, great satisfaction to try strategies, and a very good thematic feeling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Let me start me by saying the five rating is perhaps a bit harsh.
This game is way better than balloon cup for instance.
However because each player only has 15 greeks and ten ships the game takes too long for what it is. since the limitation of playing pieces and the rule to take a ship away after exploration makes the game longer.


There is nothing epic about the fighting so it should move quicker.

Some cards are way better than other cards. 
After one play I have to say that if one player gains advantage early on it's hard to beat that player.
Games can be decided in one big battle and some luck with your cards and opponent cards is needed there. Allthough you could claim its through carefull handmanagement.

2 De mayo is way more interesting than this one.

I thought, that I was bying a good light wargame when I bought Hellas. Well, it is a light wargame but it isn't a good one. The worst thing in Hellas is, that you have only one action in each turn. Other stupid thing is, that when the war is declared, winner doesn't loose any of his/her troops. These two rules doesn't fit to the game, I think. Someone might like Hellas, but I didn't; my opinion is, that the game is quite boring.

Interesting two player area conquest game where first to 10 cities wins.  One can either explore and settle new cities or fight your opponent and take over his/her city in a turn.

Likely, this game will take a couple plays to figure out solid strategies.

RATING: 9
One of these little games which I find much better than their average rating. I think that this comes from a natural tendency in players to attack the opponent (which is very easily done in this game) and the rules not indicating that it is crucial to instead explore so as to find the 10 cities that should be conquered.

It is not epic, as there is not much story/flavorful memorable events, but some events in a game typically do have a strong impact and allow the players to talk about what happened during the game, which is nice. In other words, the game is full of tactical fun made of strong surprises.

Something great and not found in all games: the tension is already present in the first moves and lasts for the whole duration of the game: there is a constant feeling of emergency (attacks are quite easy, so the need to reinforce is strong; winning makes the troops spread thin; there is a need to defend, but exploration is needed too).

Nice game of direct confrontation (attacks) and tile laying (exploration).  I appreciate seeing the map grow into a layout which is always different and brings different situations.

The cards add surprises to the game, and it is nice to try to be prepared for them.  They also sometimes work in delicious combos and sequences.

The rules are quite simple, with only a few easy key points that must be remembered.  However, the way the God cards are played is often ambiguous; the BGG FAQ files solve lots of problems, however. A key point to keep in mind is that the god cards are not typically played like in many other games: instead of playing the card and following the instructions, you typically instead play the first step of the card (do an attack, start a Burst of Strength,…) and then play the card so as to keep doing what is lists. This explains many of the official rulings from Rio Grande games.

Attacks by your opponent are almost always possible, which creates an interesting tension.

Some players complain that the game drags and that it is hard to get 10 cities because of so much back and forth fighting.  This is because sea travel is actually a very important part of the game: without enough sea travel, there are not enough cities to be conquered.  This is yet another instance of a game whose rules do not contain enough advice about basic strategies.

Some players complain that the god cards have uneven powers.  I'd argue that it is so easy to get god cards that a bad draw can be compensated quite easily.

Intense from the beginning on, because of the constant need for attack and defense (need for both players to expand and damage the opponent), and also for exploration, with the additional effect of getting stretched thin when getting closer to the victory condition of 10 cities.

Enjoyable randomness (thanks to the cards), with many ah-ah! and nooo! moments.

A nice mix of spatial considerations, of hand management, of risk management, of planning,…

A nice idea and I liked the look of this one. However, the god cards were too random and seemed to unbalance the game.

Traded.

RATING: 7
After one play this shows real potential.  I agree if similar strategies are followed than there may be periods of stalemate where cities are taken in a tit-for-tat basis and it may suffer from a runaway leader (though with a limited number of soldiers a fast advancing army will leave itself stretched - so I can perceive the possibility of snatching victory from the claws of defeat).  However, I believe with repeated play this will provide a good 2-player experience.  It certainly is atypical in comparison with the other 2-player Kosmos series requiring deeper levels of thought and a greater complexity of choices and combination of actions.  A highly involved game the player who has the greater manipulation (many will argue luck) of the god cards will triumph but it appears at this early stage that it is a battle worth fighting.  My opponent requested that we play it again so that is a good sign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a good game... much more than I thought it was at first glance, very addicting.  Rules needed clarification, though, as did cards.  I agree with another comment stating that it might be best to teach newcomers Hellas by playing a game or two without using the cards.

A very nice, simple wargame.  So far the game seems to hinge on positioning and reserves (both on the board and in your hand).  I enjoy the way gods will swing battles, open up the board, and the like — It goes well with the Illiadish theme.

Ken:
Lightweight and easy-to-teach title with strategic decision-making and tactical reactive play.  Offers many options for something of its size and weight.  God cards may be a little too overpowered, but are available to both players.  Regardless, a relatively quick sale, as if I'm in the mood for this, I'd prefer something with a bit more depth and breadth.  Games also resulted in tremendous margins of victory each play, which does not a keeper make.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Underrated game in my opinion, its small but it packs a punch. Short, but very cutthroat in a good way, game models attacking, exploring, lines of supply in a fluid but abstract way.

After a lot of plays on our holiday, I can safely state that this is my favorite of the Kosmos 2 player family. The apparent randomness and luck caused by the cards strongly decreases after several games when you roughly know what to expect and can make plans.

It takes at least 2 plays to catch on.

Voyaging is my favorite part.  Your ability to lay a new tile is not just luck of the draw, you need to look at the board, judge where you are likely to get a tile that fits and position your boats there to get a majority in that area.

Monitoring how many Ares and Zeus cards your opponent has in hand is critical when planning attacks.

Another neat thing about this game is that its very possible to claw your way back to the lead after falling behind.
This is because everyone's production capacity remains the same throughout the game despite how many cities any one person controls.  Also if you are down to 1 or 2 hexes you can power up quickly by grabbing some more ARES cards to defend yourself with.

May try re-labeling the cards to make them clearer in meaning.

03/26/03 Received. I wish the Greek soldiers had come with larger bases. I got tired of them falling over. So I glued them to thin, translucent, plastic Bingo chips. This doubled the diameter of their bases. 
Hellas is a very nasty "take that" type of game. I like that. The vast majority of Euro/German type games are not wargames; this one is. Except for the occasional "voyage" action everything else one does is: build up ("burst of strength"), then attack. In my games the Poseidon deck (that mainly helps with voyages) is rarely drawn from.

A la tête de deux cités grecques, les joueurs vont organiser des expéditions afin de découvrir les archipels alentours pour s'y installer, mais aussi aller reconquérir des villes adverses. Chacun dispose pour cela de 15 légions et de 10 bateaux.
Le reste du jeu est constitué d'hexagones qui vont former petit à petit des îles avec des villes et des temples, et de 48 cartes divines réparties en trois catégories (elles aident à la conquête, à la découverte de terres inexplorées ou fournissent des bonus divers et variés).

Maybe, just maybe, I'll give this one another go. I'm ok with games that are totally random. But when the score in this one is 8x8 - totally plausible unless both players make something stupid - the game can drag and be frustrating.

RATING: 7
Nice design with a challenging mix of strategy and tactics. I have some amount of frustration with the cards, both with the randomness of the draw (stuck with two of the same card in my hand that I can't use) and not-always-well-spelled-out rules especially regarding interactions between cards. But it worked for me nevertheless. looking forward to playing again. The cards that allow you to essentially take multiple turns are very important.

Another really good game from Benno.  I mounted all the pieces (Greeks & ships) to 1/2" counters to make them easier to manage.  My only complaint about this game is I wish they would have made the tiles and pieces bigger.  More of a 'full sized' effort would certainly make it easier to play.  In the end this is just a really fun, quick game.  I like a best of 3 series.

Maybe I should have given this game more than two tries...but I just couldn't muster up the enthusiasm.  The game was boring and repetitive, hallmarks of too many games in the Kosmos 2-player line.  The third in the series that I've owned and eventually traded, and I fear there will be more to come.

RATING: 6
A little bit hard to know how to play properly at first due to the confusing part of the rule. One can think a lot in each turn, but plan don't go too far because of various god cards can change a lot. Actually, i think this game is not bad and has a strong theme with it. Although it looks like a wargame, it actually a card game oriented game, recommended to someone who want to have a light 2 player card game with a pinch of wargame feel.

A nice, tight, German-style light wargame.  It may carry the action point limitation too far.  It's not just that you can't quite do everything you want to do in a turn -- you can't even come close.  Of course, the opponent is under the same restriction, so I probably need to adjust my ambitions.

Hellas is a good game for when you want something like Samurai Swords or Twilight Imperium but only have one opponent and less than an hour.  The board expansion mechanism is clever, and the plastic units are high-quality.  (I agree with the earlier comment about the soldiers sometimes falling over, though.)

UPDATE: simply a bit too much errata for what this game offers. I was on the fence for a while, but...Sold! Better 2-players out there.

Rating could rise, buty I see I'm going to have to get over the combat model first.  It's just a little odd for me, frankly.  But more plays are always needed, and I can see this being a good, tense, two-player with a lot of decision points.  It's also very innovative and unique; I'm curious to see where it takes me.

Possibly the longest to play in the Kosmos 2-player series. Each side must explore the lands and oceans in the archipelago and control temples and cities to gain victory. 3 decks of cards generate much of  the options available and allow for surprises. Like this summary the game plays a little too long for my liking.

Fantastic 2p area control game. I love how this game manages to combine deterministic combat, creative card play, and the balancing act of fighting a war with exploration into a short filler game. There's a lot to like about Hellas. As there tends to be in these sorts of games, there can be some tit-for-tat actions going on, but on the whole, you'd be hard pressed to find games that are this short while still feeling like a full game.

Really no fun at all. There is no consistent strategy that can be tried. In any moment you can steal easily a land-hex from your opponent and the other way around. It seems that whatever you do is not so important. At the end, winning the game does't leave the feeling you have done something good... very likely you have used some tricky tactical moves or just have had luck with the cards.

An interesting, short two-player wargame. The tiles and tile-laying rules are almost identical to Fjorde, and the combat system resembles Farlander.

The main goal and turn actions are a bit different but the atmosphere is similar to Fjorde, in a good way. The bits are nice, even though the soldiers are easily toppled.

Used to play this one quite a bit with a friend of mine.  Eventually it devolved into a bluffing game -- does the other player have the card that will swing the battle his way, or not?  Stopped being fun after that.  This game is the definitive "4" for me -- I could be talked into playing it again but wouldn't suggest it myself.

RATING: 3
I feel this should be better than it is. The God cards are a lovely mechanic, but the fiddly war/invasion ideas just slow down the gameplay, and the ships are not even properly incorporated in the rules (surely they should be a part of the over-sea invasion?). 

Hellas is also my nominee for the game with the worst parts -  all my little men keep falling over! Surely this should have been a big-box game?

I thought I'd like this game more than I did.  I mean I really like the ancient Greece theme and I found the tile artwork to be visually pleasing.  The playing pieces were adequate but the Greek miniatures were a little unstable and would have been better with slightly wider bases.  I wasn't that fussed with the artwork on the God cards.  In fact, the cards were the least impressive component for me.  Only one play but this game just didn't have that initial spark for me to want to delve deeper into its strategies.

The rule book is maybe not a good translation, but in any case, as evidenced by extensive Q & A, there are many questions about how to interpret some of the rules.

On the other hand, I felt from the very beginning that somewhere under the surface there was a good game here. And over time as I've ironed out my rules questions, I've come to like this game quite a bit, and consequently my rating has gone up more than once. 

It also helps that the tiles are gorgeous and the soldiers and ships pieces make the game extra attractive. 

Some find that the game boils down too much to taking and re-taking territory, ad infinitum; however, I feel as though the god cards imbue theme into game play, as in written Greek history, many battles see-sawed back and forth, with the gods intervening at critical times to tip the balance. I suspect this is what the designer had in mind by creating three different types of god cards that can be played decisively. That is, it's possible for players to decide this game through battle, but chances are that the battles will go back and forth, and that it's through card play (god cards) and voyages (to take over unclaimed territory) that the balance is ultimately tipped in favor of one side or the other. 

In my own plays of this game it appears to me that the player that uses the most god cards is most likely to win. In this way it is characteristic of the late Mr. Delonge's games: there's more going on than first appears. Consequently, the more I play it the more I appreciate its tactical possibilities.

Simple game mechanics, with some very subtle maneuvers required to win. The way the ships are used to control the waterways (you can only expand at a new tile placement location where you have the majority of ships on adjacent tiles) is "missed" by most beginning players. The majority of temples allows you to make 4 actions, rather than the normal 3 ... so battles for temple control is very important, also. Definite replay value, fun and challenging makes this one over an 8 rating.

RATING: 6
This has no spousal interest at all, being too confrontational. It's a game driven by card acquisition, with the result hinging on whether you have the right cards at the right time. Ok for the occasional outing, but lots of fiddly rules that hampers that occasional outing.

Clever 2-Player Back-and-Forth Area Control Tile Game in Greek Myth Setting! The winning condition is be the first to control 10 cities. Abstract, but with a great and different feel in gameplay.

Ok - Hellas.  I have played only 2 games as of this writing, and both have been very different.  I can definitely see it being a good game, but it's got something of a niche audience:  players should be interested in the theme, players should be interested in combat, and of course, appreciate chance.  I can see myself really liking this game in the future, but I believe it will take more plays before that'll happen.  Still - I'm always happy to play and would love to try it some more.. so that's good!

Risk-like dominance game using effect cards instead of dice. Nicely made components though a little fiddly in play. Variable setup, tile draw and placement will provide some replayability,thought and potential fun,as will the interation of the god cards. The problem with effect cards with text on first play is a)difficulty in anticipating what you will get/your opponent will play b)pace is slow. In Hellas part of these  problems are resolved by a) the backs of the god cards gives some idea how they will influence play b)cards drawn can only be placed in the hand after turn ends. First impressions: After playing so many family friendly games, I forgotten how offputting games permitting a combatitive attitude like this one can be. I appreciate the design but I feel whoever slaps their opponent the hardest will win.

Like the balance between the card play, tile placement and conflict.
It is more subtle than it appears as a glance.  
The game looks to be about keeping the balance between reinforcing, attacking the opponent and exploration. That is between keeping your position to the point where you can make the big push to win. 
Defense is hard since you have to build choke points and counter attack positions. 
Offense is all about taking the initiative and and forcing the opponent to react to your moves rather than developing their plan. 

I can see how the game can drag if both players focus only on one aspect, since the game is about balance.

My first impression is that Hellas is  a good small wargame that can be played under 60 minutes with no heavy setup like memoir'44 or other wargame. The gods card are too powerfull and we will have to test a variant limiting the god cards. Still it won't come out of the closet often since there are several good wargames that I rather play. The only positive point for playing again Hellas is the relative small playing time.

Ma première impression de Hellas est que c'est un bon petit jeu de guerre qui se joue en moins de 60 minutes et qui ne demande pas un placement fastidieux comme Memoire'44 ou d'autres jeux de guerre. Les cartes dieux semblent trop puissantes; nous allons tester une variante pour limiter le pouvoir de ces cartes. Hellas n'est pas le style de jeu qui sortira souvent du placard compte tenu qu'il existe plusieurs bons jeux de guerre. Le point positif qui fera que nous le jouerons de nouveau est le temps de jeu qui est relatiment court pour un wargame.

There are a lot of neat elements at work in this game - the modular board construction, the variable nature of the god cards, and some tactical maneuvering as well.  Each play brings up interesting questions:  Do I voyage quickly building up my cities?  Stock pile soldiers in my current cities?  Build a hand of god cards?  The modular nature of the setup ensures these other elements differ from game to game.  There's a lot wrapped up in this small package.

Strange game with fairly odd mechanics.  There are a lot of different ways to win, so I'm not sure if there is ever a best choice.  The cards seem to mix things up a little too much really.  I'll stick with Battle Cry for a light 2 player wargame.

To get the most out of this, you have to be quite familiar with the cards, which are central to the play. The winner is likely to be the person who is able to manage their hand the more skilfully: the sub-Risk-type tactics are almost peripheral.

I like the hex tile map building: similar to Fjords, with a nice simple wargame element added.

2 problems (which make me wonder if they even playtested the final version, and compel me to give it a lower rating):

1. The game is seriously hindered for newcomers by terribly unclear text on the cards.  This is really annoying and disappointing.  A game of this simplicity should NOT have so many rules holes and ambiguities.

2. The little plastic soldiers and ships are cheesy quality with small bases, causing them to fall over too easily.  I think it might have been better to use wooden cubes for soldiers and long wooden prisms for ships, or some such.

I created the [[Hellas FAQ]] wiki page.  Read that before playing!

I like the strategy of both placement of tiles and Greeks/Boats, but with the randomness of the God cards, and the power of them, even the most carefull player will lose.  Im sure there is a better game in this box some where, but it remains to be seen if I will search for it.

RATING: 4
The English cards are confusing - many rules are open to interpretation. The end-game can drag on for ages, depending on the cards each player draws. I'm not overly impressed with this. I've played it enough to know that it doesn't really work for me. It tried to like it, I really did. It gets an extra point for trying to be a meaty game in a small box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card game, a wargame, a tile laying game and an exploration game, mixed together with high results and playable in less than an hour.  Players' scores are normally very even.  That's why it becomes a kind of a race for getting the right cards that will allow them to do their winning move, at the same time that they have to avoid the runaway of the other player.  So, it's kind of a [i]steal the wallet[/i] game, because the objective is to be as close as possible of the rival, until the right moment to do a card combo that can grant the victory.

It starts out promising. Nice components. I like the exploration, but that doesn't last long before the game ends. The combat rules are very wonky, giving the aggressive player a decisive edge. The game either ends too quickly, or both players get stuck in an obnoxious tit-for-tat. I like the premise of the game a lot, I just don't like the rules. I may play it again if I discover some interesting house rules.

RATING: 6
People seem upset that the cards seem to determine the game more than the on-board strategy.  Well, expectation is a prison.  The game seems to swing between well-positioned attrition and wild streaks of fortune.  There are multiple distinct avenues to victory, though I recommend trying to minimize your "front" with the enemy.

The no-luck combat system is a bit annoying.  (How can there be no luck in combat?)  I wonder if anyone has comes up with something to replace that.  It reminds me a lot of Tongiaki, although this game is for two players and is set around the Greek islands instead of the South Pacific islands as a multi-player game. There are a lot more options, making this probably a better game. The Zeus, Poseidon, and Ares cards really make things interesting.

RATING: 7.5
A light fun euroized war game.  Leave it to Franz-Benno Delonge to put some confrontation in his design.  I'm not sure that there is any strategy to this (outside of the conquering strategy vs. the exploring strategy), but it is a great tactical game.  Fun card combos and positional elements.  Of course, at its root it relies on cards so there is a huge random element of what cards you get.  I do have two complaints about the game, one is that your hand can get tied up with cards you can't use, there should be some way to discard (which is one of the reasons why I dislike Wyatt Earp) but fortunately the game doesn't exclusively revolve around this and the are some creative ways to get rid of the duds tying up your hand.  The other complaint is minor, but it is annoying that the bases for the greek figurines are too small, they have a tendancy to fall over.  Overall though I think this is a wonderful little two player game.

Hellas stands out from the Kosmos 2-player games as it is not a simple card game, but a very tactical tile-laying area control game with some direct conflict. Gameplay is a careful balancing act of exploring, defense and offense. Gods cards add some randomness in the mix, giving benefits like extra turns or extra actions. The artwork and bits are really nice, as well.

Hellas (or "Hell Ass", as I prefer to call it) is a very neat idea that suffers from being a little overly simplistic.  It certainly deserves credit for taking an ancient Greek mythology theme, combining elements of exploration and conquest, and putting it all together in a simple little game that plays in under an hour and fits neatly inside a small carry-on bag.  I find myself really wanting to like this game more, yet I feel like something is lacking, particularly in the way both the ships and the soldiers are utilized (and the god cards too, I guess - perhaps it is just about how it was all put together).  I'll have to see if there have been any rules variations suggested, and if not, maybe come up with some of my own.  And, for crying out loud, WHY COULD THEY NOT HAVE MADE THE BASES ON THE SOLDIERS JUST A FEW MILLIMETERS WIDER?!?  I feel like I spend half the game trying to get those blasted things to stay on their feet.  As an interesting note, my only playing partner for this game (my wife) has lost every single time we've played.  I have no idea why.  Also, I wonder how Dynasties would compare to this game?  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6/10

Sort of a mixture of civ-lite and wargame with a (significant) pinch of MtG. The exploration and warfare mechanics are fun, but what makes the game shine is the card play.

EDIT 26/5/2011: Card play is paramount, you win and lose the game on the cards. This is not a "Dudes on a map" game with cards, but a card game with dudes and a map.

RATING: 6
[RGG 2002 edition] {Greece, war, exploration; tile-laying, utility-cards} Hellas is a thematic lightweight 2p war game. It is not a casual game and I think it is more suitable for gamer couple.  It's quite confrontational and dynamic. Players compete to settle ten cities by exploration or conquer. It's not a typical filler - a play runs around 30-45 minutes. The FAQ is absolutely necessary before playing.  It clarifies some important point about the rules.

Hellas is a tactical game with limited strategies. Sometimes, what you choose (or can) is highly influenced by the God cards in hand.  Some of the God cards (Zeus and Ares) are more powerful than others; therefore, a good draw may give a player more advantages, which cannot be easily countered. In addition, the God cards break the rules so dramatically that players can ambush a player with a hand of good cards; therefore, it is difficult to prepare for every situation with resources on hand. I think there is a long learning curve here to understand the game and how to use or prepare for the God cards. Till now, I haven't experienced this game well enough. The rating may change after more plays.

Apart from the miniatures, the components are so-so. The illustration and color tune of the cards are not my favor.

A good two-player wargame for gamers (I wouldn't suggest this one to non-gamers). The different god decks are very unbalanced which is kind of sad (Poseidon cards don't get used that much). However it's the same for both players so it doesn't matter that much.

tl;dr: clean design, not my style

I don't play many 2 player games because I prefer the dynamics that you get by having 3 or more players. But every now and then I do play games 2 player. I do have [thing=35677]a[/thing] [thing=28143]couple[/thing] of games I really like with 2 though.
This games pits 2 players against each other to discover and conquer the world. The first player to control 10 cities wins. You can get there by just exploring, but that would make for a very boring game. You can also take over cities by plopping more (plastic, ugh) unites there and playing cards to improve your chances. This makes the game more interesting, but it's not something that gets my juices flowing. At least not in a way that I seek out.
It's a very clean design, and if you like this style of game, you might really dig this, but it's not for me and the fact that I never felt that I, as starting player, had a chance of loosing didn't help. The other player seemed to always be playing catch up to counter what I did on my turn and get to the same level as me.

A fun LITTLE wargame-ish game.  Drops the randomness of a tile-laying Eurogame into a diceless Risk-like game with a short playtime and a small footprint.  Three mini-decks of mess-with-your opponent or improve-your-odds cards add some random tactical choices (oxymoronic?).  A bit of a stressful game as it begins to slide down to the end of the game and you can see it coming and STILL can't stop it.

4/3/11: This ended up being exactly what I wanted it to be: A very intense, compact (and therefore good to take on trips game). We didn't much care for the bits and might switch them out for wooded cubes or something less prone to falling over.

5/18/12: A few more plays and the game has lost luster. It feels artificially restricted during play which means loses (or even wins) somehow feel cheap. Still, looks nice but I fear it does not have long for this world in out collection during our next major pare-down.

This one was okay.  It really is a conflict type quick war game.  It's very abstracty, and there is a lot of luck in the draw of the cards, which kind of kills it for me.  But it is interesting deciding to attack opposing cities, or explore for your own new ones.

Hellas is as much 2-player wargame as can be packed into 30 similar plastic pieces, a handful of hex tiles, and a deck of cards.

Hella is intriguing after you get the hang of it, but the ultimate lightness of the game doesn't warrant the learning curve.

RATING: 4
Hellas is high in direct conflict and is more akin to a Risk than to many Euro games that are less confrontational. It is true that the game itself features card play like other Euro designs, but the luck of the draw is quite strong with this one. I don't exactly mind conflict but even then, I feel this is a bit on the high side. Players try to wrest control of city states in Hellas by playing cards and moving around army units. The biggest downside to this game comes from the back and forth using the god cards. While on one hand, the god cards provide variety, the power of the cards can feel somewhat unbalanced. Cards that allow multiple voyages are really potent as I have won the game with card play that allowed me three consecutive vovages to win the game. A bit too powerful. I don't think there is a need for me to revisit this game.

A truly great 30-45 minute game. I love the card play in this. It feels similar to Nexus Ops but is lighter and quicker and so is perfect for weekday evenings.
You keep it quick by voyaging lots, then fighting for the last 1 or 2 islands.

The hex map building (similar to Carcassone) works fine, the tiles are well-made and attractive.  But the rest of the game really isn't that fun.  Combat devolves into a *take that* trumping using god cards regardless of numbers or preparation.  I'm not sure what a good two player game looks like but this isn't it.

I liked Hellas a lot more on my first play. I still enjoy it, but the cards sometimes make things unclear. Seems somewhat limited in depth, but still a good quick game to play

A great light wargame which blends card play, tile placement, and "supply line" strategy. Numerous replays reveals that it is just as easy to win through voyages if you have the right mix of cards for defending against attacks. While there is luck involved, this game is very well balanced

Since this is essentially Fjords with a miniature wargame grafted on, and since I love Fjords, I should like this.

Sadly, however, it strikes me as something of a broken game, mainly because attacking one's opponent (and drawing Ares cards) seems far-and-away more effective a strategy than choosing to explore instead (and drawing Poseidon cards).

Too bad the designer is no longer with us.  Rest in peace, Franz-Benno Delonge.  You've made our lives richer.

Once both players know how to play, the game is a little long.  The back-and-forth can get tedious.  That being said, it has alot going for it, the components are very nice and the premice appeals to me.

Bloody knife fight.  Not a nice game, but a fun one.  My only complaint is that it seems extremely hard to come back once you get knocked down a peg.

I played this only a couple times so in all fairness I guess I could have missed some of the game's finer points (assuming there are any, which didn't seem to be the case when I played), but overall it just failed to arouse any interest. Particularly disappointing because on some level the game out of the box can be perceived as a little 30-minute "build-a-civilisation-and-fight" type of game. Not so- the game is too abstract to evoke any of the thematic appeal and the card mechanic could have been done so much better- here it seems imbalanced to say the least.

Kosmos 2 player game; In the land of ancient Greece, called Hellas, the people waged power struggles for control of the many valuable islands. The combatants faced each other over land and across the seas. In these battles with sail and sword, the combatants venture forth to discover new islands to fight over. To aid them in their battles, the combatants often seek the favor of the Gods. This is a card game, a tile-laying game, and a light war game, for two players.

I've played three times with a PnP version, as I really wanted to try it before consider buying it, but the gameplay always goes into a loop of: attack a city, gain the city, wait for the other player to attack again the same city, recover it, and so on. There should be a home rule to avoid this situations.

Very nice 2 player game- the card play is excellent, and the  subtle attacks- which are never huge battles- are so numerous you rarely have time to go on a Voyage. Recommended for the 2 player household!!! The tiny Greek men fell over a lot- I glued small metal washers to the bases and made the game much more enjoyable without worrying about pieces falling over!

Manages to push all the wrong buttons for me.  Deep analysis is suddenly thwarted by wacky card play!  Whee!  Also, seems *very* dependent on card draw order. I think I took this game too seriously at first, and now I can't hit rewind.

RATING: 7
Fun little game of ancient greek empires, simple rules, cute little bits and solid componants, quick play time but still good thinking game. Have thought about getting another set to see how it will play with 3 or even 4 players instead of 2 although the set up would be tricky with 4 (unless theer were 2 adjacent dolphins. Useful as a game for people who get knocked out early from a big game.

RATING: 7
Very tentative rating.  I have been really excited about this game for a long time.  Finally got it and Allison didn't like it at all, which makes it a little tough for me to evaluate it.  The FAQ is essential, and there was a lot more chaos than I expected (even after reading that it was chaotic).  I'm still optimistic that it'll be great with a different opponent.

Acquired: Cardhaus clearance.

I like risk - to a certain degree. Games are often too long and Hellas seems to be a perfect fix for that. It is a quick area control game with a modular board and action cards that can shake things up, so that it is not too thinky. Clever game, even if the rules are not clear in all cases.

As with all the Kosmos 2-player games, this is a fun light game. This one is the most warlike of them, with soldiers actually attacking to control territory in a light, simple way.

This one seems to me to suffer from a "snowball" effect.  It seems that one fortunate event can really turn the tide of battle and the party on the receiving end of that event really has a difficult time recovering.

Part of the Kosmos two-player line, which I tend to enjoy, but this one is a war-themed game which I tend to not enjoy generally so each time I consider it I choose something else to play (I got it as part of a big order when I was on a 2P Kosmos trip). Note: has lots of German text on cards and needs paste-ups or replacement cards to play in English.

after my first real game, I lost and the person who won still didn't really understand the game or how he won. It seemed to be all over before either of us really knew it. I think it's a nice mini game, but needs further playing before i reassess its rating. 06/2004 haven't played for 6 months or so, am a bit worried it's shelved. 11/2004 had another playing with sean. didn't overly excite me this game either...will give it another crack soon..seemed to take longer to play than the other 2 player games in my collection...have played since and it seems it's a see-saw effect until someone just snatches victory..i kinda expected more from this game, esp with the god cards which seemed appealing at the time

One of my first run-ins with a frustratingly incomplete rulebook.

Lesson learned: In any game, all card text should be 100% clear, accurate, and complete, or - minimally - rulebooks for card-driven games should include a card almanac to break down implications of specific wordings and address potential card interactions.

It's a decent, simple 2-player wargame, but Hellas is also prone to considerable amounts of luck with the Gods cards.  A lot of give and take, inching your way towards victory.  But ultimately, not a whole lot of tension.

After 1 Play: An unpleasant back-and-forth feeling prevailed throughout the game.  There seemed to be little room for interesting decisions apart from when to use the god cards, and then the quality of the cards drawn still seems far more important than how well one plays them.

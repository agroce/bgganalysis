This game looks really fun!  I bet if I bought it I'd actually play this Tom Wham game, unlike Planet Busters and Awful Green Things, which I really intend to play at some point...[update] Won Dragon magazine version on Ebay, waiting for it to arrive.  
[update] Game looks really fun, but have not gotten a chance to play it yet.  The book has lots of cute colorful histories for the different encounters, but I don't want to spoil it by reading them ahead of time.

Totally forgot about until saw an image here. Played with my best friend at the time (who I am lucky enough to still be able to see) and read and re-read Dragon #51. Great little medieval-Tolkienesqe fantasy adventure game. Don't know where I ditched this one - hope it is still in circulation out there somewhere. Love the similar Tom Wham Elefant Hunt which I found in near-mint condition at my local used book store not too long ago.

I loved this game [i]so much[/i] in junior high that I borrowed my friend's copy (from Dragon Magazine #51), photocopied the parts, pasted them on cereal box cardboard and hand-colored them with felt-tip pens!  Played this one all to hell; for some reason we were fixated on the wastrel and would spend much of the game trolling the wastes in hopes of encountering it.

[b]35 years later:[/b]  Mocked up a new set from the files here on BGG to see if this was as fun as I remembered, and it is!  The kids liked it, charmed by the chit-pull mechanism, Olliver J. Dragon, and the way you can send your encounters to go harrass other players.  I just might put some time into making a deluxe PnP version...

[b]After 2 modern, grown-up plays:[/b]  The biggest issue with the old school/original version is that there's no reason to travel around the map—your best bet is to squat in The Walled City and roll every turn for a 1/3 chance at a treasure, only ranging out when you find an Imperial Treasure you want to cash in at the Capital.  To fix this I'm working on a deck of Quest cards that send you thither and yon in order to score swag.  (So every "Treasure" result on the exploration charts is actually a card draw, except for a "6" in the Mines of Zerta—you earned it slogging through there!)

Also, stumbled on this idea elsewhere, but it makes perfect sense:  [i]Treasures never go back into the Treasure Pool—they leave the game instead[/i].  Recycling them dilutes the pool and makes it less likely that Imperial Treasures will be drawn, thereby extending the game.  And this baby [i]wants[/i] to be short & sweet.

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  Played a raucous 6p game with my RPG group using the deluxe PnP version (one-inch chits on an 18 x 24 map) and the Quest deck was the belle of the ball!  Everyone LOVED the little stories they told.  Now it's clear that the Lost City needs its own encounter matrix,  but nothing so weak as a mere d6 result.  I'm thinkin' a one-page roll-your-own-adventure [i]flowchart[/i]...

RATING: 7
Played more times than I could imagine when my friend got it out of Dragon 51. I never could find the issue, but I bought the Best of Dragon Magazine box. The box version is different -- they somehow managed to change the game just enough to change it from "the most fun you can have with chits" to "this is dull." I wish I know why they felt they even needed to make changes to the best game that ever came out of their magazine. That version rates a 4.

RATING: 7.2
This is a silly game.  Sort of an overly complicated Talisman type of game.  But sometimes this sort of game is just what the table needs.  And I have a soft spot for Tom Wham, so this is a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great way to package epic-scale quests into a little and unassuming package. Curiously, despite its quaint graphics and jokey humour, probably the best quick game to deliver an RPG experience of a fantasy world adventure. Enjoyable but hard to keep up if you fall behind. Randomness also an issue for those who don't like it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Way WAY ahead of its time.  It's a dumbed-down D&D and it does it in a typically tom-whammian cute style.  You could build an RPG from the basic blocks you have here, and you'd be just fine.  This was published by Dragon magazine a long time ago, and was in large part why I decided to make games of my own one day

Dragon 51 original version.  Classic beer and pretzels adventuring - light hearted goodness. The artwork is great of course. I don't like it as much as Dungeon! or Magic Realm, but it's great in its own right.  It begs for simple expansions and flavorful mods. Love the Darlene map too.

Ahead of its time in so many ways, a remarkable accomplishment for a magazine game.  Along with the original Arkham Horror, was the core of my gateway kit in college, and still good for that usage now.  Beats Talisman cold, along with every other "run around the fantasy kingdom" design other than possibly Mystic Wood.

This game looked silly, and I suppose it was fairly whimsical, but the swashbuckling role playing adventure  at its core was never overshadowed by the light fun. It felt like a board game in the world of Princess Bride but with more killing monsters and looting. Add to this the pages of additional rules to increase complexity, variety, and theme and this little gem shot to the top of my playlist. Well worth tracking down a copy.

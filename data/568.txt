Probably my favorite game. Takes concepts from traditional games and inserts just enough uncertainty to make bidding and playing a matter of instinct rather than a puzzle to be solved, which I find makes the game a lot more fun. Plenty of agonizing twists. Great rising tension as the hands tick down.

The rules say to start with ten cards the first round and work down to one. This makes no sense to me. Since the 1, 2 and even three card rounds are almost always gimmes for the first player it should be the other way round. start with one card and work up to ten, this way the tension from bidding builds.

I liked this one but the wife didn't.  
I'm a bit of a fan of card games or anything that packs down small so Rage gets points from me for that alone.  Good game play IMO although a little chaotic at times.
I'm not sure how many time this one will get broke out but I'm unlikely to trade it.

All right, now *that* was fun. You never can tell what's going to happen, and trying to predict how many tricks you will take is not as hard as I thought it would be. In our first game, we all bid 0 on the last trick; I led a null-trump action card -- and the other two players had Change Rage. Grr. UPDATE: It might say so on the box, but a two-player game this is not. Much too hard to bid your hand.

Trick taking goodness. I have always enjoyed trick taking games and Rage has a unique (at least to me) twist to it. Your hand size goes up by 1 each hand, starting at a 1 card hand in the beginning. I really enjoyed it with 2, surprisingly.

A trick taking game, very similar to "Wizard" but with six suits and action cards.

It's actually quite a nice game. I wonder why I haven't played it more...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The finest trick-taking game I have ever come across.  The diminishing hands is a genius move and makes the game just the right length.  The challenge of bidding the exact number of tricks to take is also quite enjoyable.  Unlike others who dislike the randomness added with the chaos cards, I actually love it and think that it adds great moments where players are forced to fly by the seat of their pants and improvise mid-hand.

If I were to offer criticism of the game it would be that sometimes you just can't catch up.  You may reach the later rounds and the leader will have a lead built up that is insurmountable.  Also, you have to be prepared for others to mess up your plans.  If you are someone who plans things out and gets frustrated when things don't fit that plan, you will get discouraged.  This game is about making a plan and then being able to think on your toes if/when someone throws a monkey wrench in your plan.

RATING: 6.5
Two plays (7-p and 8-p).

Enjoyable trick-taking game. A little more chaos than is usual for the genre, which is fine by me - the amound of luck seems to be bumped up a notch, which may distress some, though. Went over well with a group of folks who had never played a trick-taking game before. Nice that it scales up to 8. Some of the colors are hard to differentiate, especially the orange and red.

On its own, as a game: blech. But it was my son's first tricktaker and he like it. So, for that it gained a point (up from 3). 

Without dealing the whole deck, and having such small hands makes it a bit random. At least it's a precision bid game. Menos mal. The bonus and 'mad' rage cards are absolutely awful.

Imagine playing a cross between "Oh, Hell" and "UNO" and you have a pretty good idea of how this is played.  I find that six suites of 15 cards makes it too hard to count cards most of the time.  Probably best for larger groups.  We remove most of the "action cards" and pass on the bidding to make it kid friendly which has proven to be a good way to introduce trump games to my six-year-old.  Overall, I'd MUCH rather play "Rook" or "Oh, Hell".  If I want a game of uno, I'll play uno.

Games that are completely dominated by randomness (luck factor) bother me.  Some strategies will play out better than others... OVER 10,000 GAMES.  I'd rather not.  Yuck.  There are far too many good trick taking games to waste much more time with this one.  Wizard, Euchre, Hearts, Spades, Rook, Bridge, and Mu and More to name a few.

RATING: 6
A trick taking game that supports a large group, and that's really where the game shines.  Random, but fun -- why do you think the game's called "Rage".  There's more sophisticated trick taking games out there, but how many go to 8 players?  The game is better, as some have suggested here, when you play the hands in reverse order, with the first round being 1 card and the 10th round being 10 cards.

After one play: Based on  "Oh Hell," but with the addition of extra cards with special powers.  One might argue that these destrategize the game.  One might also argue that the hands where you play very few cards are annoying and have little opportunity for strategy anyway.  Definitely somewhat enjoyable, though.  I'm not sure what I think yet; need to experiment further.

I love trick taking games. Whist, Contract Bridge, Spades and Hearts are all among my favorite card games. A key ingredient is that you can reasonably predict the value of a card based on its rank, suit and the number of other cards in that suit within your hand. Rage appears to lack that key element. There are simply too many cards in the deck relative to the number of cards in your hand. Even in the first round of the game you have less than 10% of the deck in your hand. This causes bidding to be largely a matter of guessing. This is worsened by the fact that not all of the cards will be in play. A 7 of a given suit may be the highest card in the suit even though there are 9 higher cards in the suit in the game. I honestly do not understand the high rating of this game on BGG.

Thanks to Fundex for my first copy, a freebie door prize.  Since then, I've bought at least four more copies for various games and prototyping.  But Rage itself is a fun, easy to learn trick-taking game.

I haven't played many trick-taking games that I didn't like, and this one is as fun as any other. The really interesting aspect of this game is the mechanic of dealing one fewer card each hand. That last hand is the most fun because only one person can take the trick, and everyone's got to make some kind of bid. If you like trick-taking games, this one has a unique twist that makes it loads of fun.

I am a little old fashioned. I like games where trump is changed or the goals change like in Wizard (for trump change) or The Dwarf King (for goal changes) but a game where trump changes in the middle of a hand is too much chaos.

Not a huge fan of trick-takers; I realize that there is a certain skill that folks who play a lot of them develop, but it's a skill I lack and as a result playing this game always feels very random to me. Sometimes I do very well, other times abominably. I'd rather play something else.

Is [i]Rage[/i] better than Oh Hell/Blackout?  I dunno...  The action cards and two extra suits add an element of chaos and high-screwery to the proceedings, which, with the right crowd, could enhance the whole groaning/cackling fun.  On the other hand they actively reduce the amount of skill that can be brought to bear.  So... more fun, but with less skill.  Perhaps this is the "party game" version of Oh Hell?

Fun trick taking game that is super easy to teach and play.  My only problem with it is that once you use a special card, you are out of the running for the trick.  Its been my experience that this game plays much better with large groups, as I played 2, 4, 6, and 8 player games of it during a weekend.  The 6 and 8 player games were the most enjoyable.

A trick taking game that largely depends on your ability to accurately predict how many tricks you will take.  It's difficult because it's rather easy to change the trump or to beat a high card, you there are always enough cards left over that other people's hands are an unknown quantity.  Probably longer than it needs to be for what it is. (1 play)

First played July 11th, 2007.  It's a quick learn(<5min) and quick play (~45min for 3 players).  If you find yourself thinking that it's all luck, you will want to think agin.  There is plenty of strategy in this as it has a good mix of luck/strategy for this trick taking game.  Wow, the first game was awesome and I find myself wanting to play again.  It's a variant of up-and-down the river or oh hell.  I like the action cards which make it a nice twist.  Also, with up-and-down the river, I find that bidding is not as intense as this game.  Rage does a good job of penalizing you for going for zero since you only get 5 points instead of 10 for any other made bid.  I'd highly recommend giving this a game play and consideration in playing in your rotation of game plays.  I haven't had this much fun in a while with a game.  Don't let the cheap "Phase 10" box scare you off.  Don't play this with two, it's just too unpredictable, fun but way too unpredictable.  Perhaps play with less cards?

Initial Rating: 3.5 (December 2011)

On 2011, I still liked most of the new boardgames I played, however I hated Rage since the very beginning. It is possible the game explainer made a mistake, but I remember the game was very boring and it didn’t make much sense. My desire to play Rage is very low so I’m not sure if I will ever play it again, but if I do, I will come back to write a proper comment.

Current Rating: 3.5

I played this with co-workers during lunch for a couple years, almost EVERY SINGLE DAY, yet I never got tired of it.  It fit our group perfectly, because we had 6-8 players every day looking for a 40-minute card game that rewards bidding skill, but still has plenty of blind luck and 'take that' moments to be funny.  Then, 3/4 of our card group got laid off or driven to quit the company.  Coincidence?  Talk about RAGE!

Reading the rules, I thought this would be a blast.  My family has played "Oh Hell!" (we call it 10 Down) for many years, and the new action cards seemed fun.  Usually chaos in a game doesn't bother me so much, but the unpredictability really hurt the gameplay.  I'm not sure I need to play this again.  There's also too many suits/cards, making it hard to shuffle.

Commercial variant of Oh Hell that doesn't improve on it in any way: extra suits, trumps, special cards and a looser bid structure all make the game more random. You can of course discard those extra elements and play as close as you want to your Oh Hell version of choice. A better idea though is probably to grab a standard deck for that and reserve these cards for other games:

I like the idea of shrinking hand size as the round goes on. I guess this also makes the game more luck-based (and less brain-burning) than other trick-taking games, because there are always unused cards in each round. For instance, if the trump color is red and you have red 14 card, you have a good reason to wish the card to be the strongest card. This does not happen in Die Sieben Siegel or Sticheln, where a pre-determined set of cards are dealt to the players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Think bid euchre with more suits and chaos cards that can really change things up.  Its a fun varient and the chaos or RAGE cards do things like change the trump color, remove trump entirely or give or take points away from players.  A fun game and a great alternative to playing euchre with the family.

Oh Hell on steroids. A trick-taking game where the object is to win exactly the number of tricks bid; failing that, win as many as possible. A six-suited deck, random (and changeable) trumps, and some bonus and anti-bonus cards set the game apart from its ancestry. The game plays very poorly with two players, and the mechanic of reducing the number of cards dealt, with the bonus cards, means that strategy happens pretty early on, and the endgame is almost all luck.

Very basic whist/spades clone. We played the other night 2 player and had a quickie blast. Stupid fun. Oh hell. Obviously meant for more than 2 players...

We don't bother reshuffling the deck until it is needed, which adds some slight strategy. We prefer the simpler Amigo Spiele rules, which are cleaner and never leave dangling untaken tricks. Jokers are always the highest card in the suit - 16, or 17 if it is the 2nd Joker.

Rage is [gameid=1116] for a large group with added chaotic effects. If you're going to play this, try it without the special cards and with fewer people (i.e., Oh Hell!). A better game in the same family is [gameid=6688].

The 0-15x6 Rage deck can be used to play many other games. Publishers need to learn that suit symbols are better than merely using color. The distinction between red and orange can give pause under the wrong lighting.

More chaotic version of "Oh Hell!". Great game that should be rated much, much higher; lots of interaction, tension, laughter and gasps. Everybody seems to love this game, even the total anti-gamers.
It's not a disaster when you get lots of weak cards because you get the most points for correctly predicting the number of tricks you are going to win in a round. Lots of luck for sure, but also many interesting decisions to be made and people who estimate their hand's potential better will definitely score better in the long run.
I think 3 to 5 players is ideal for this game (with 4 being my favorite), 2 is unplayable and 6+ is just too random.

Fundex version has the BEST rules and I suggest playing with them (even if you have Amigo version already).

I'm rating this as a "game system" like a poker deck for it's ability to play many games, not just itself.  The regular game (which I haven't tried) doesn't look so great.

Deck of cards numbered 1-15 in 6 colored suits (+ some special cards... ~14)

A must buy for any aspiring game designer.  Copies of this game are dirt cheap too.  I've heard of game designers buying this in bulk for prototyping game concepts on.

The chaotic trick taker, not to be taken too seriously.  I prefer Wizard though.  Really the only thing that bothers me about this game is the potential changing of the trump, I can get behind all the rest of the silliness.  Maybe I would like it more if they had named it "You Bastard", which is what someone will declare every trick.  I'm keeping it around though because it sort of works with 6 as a party game.

Though I really prefer card games with plenty of strategy (such as Mu), I figured Rage would be a good filler for some light fun at family gatherings. I figured wrong.

Unfortunately, the chaos factor introduced by the change trump and cancel trump cards make bidding for tricks a complete shot in the dark. If chaos is your thing, then join the Rage. Else pass and stick with Wizard.

A trick taking game with several variants, one of which is essentially 'Up and down the river'. The only real difference to playing this game with a normal deck of cards is that several special card types are added that change the game considerably. A fun game but not for serious trick-taking fans as the chaos factor is quite high.

RATING: 7
Solid trick-taking game, even if it has an odd flow of progression to it. The fact that you start with 10-card hands and move down to 1 card in your hand through 10 rounds feels kind of awkward. At first it feels completely random, because trying to predict the amount of tricks taken with that many cards can be very difficult. Around 6 or 7 cards, it starts to feel pretty balanced, but by the end when you have 3 or less cards in hand, it feels very random again. I still enjoy the game for what it is, and I like the special Rage Cards that can throw a wrench into things, a la the designer's other game, Uno. I think I would prefer to play with the rule that guessing the number of tricks correctly gives you 5 points instead of 10 also. Makes for a closer game.

Rage is a trick taking game taken to its bare naked form. The only thing it adds to the basic mechanism is the prediction of tricks and decreasing hand size. It works well, and it's fun, but I think there are more interesting card games. Rage still qualifies as a decent game.

RATING: 7
A variation on Oh Hell, one of my favourite classic card games, that provides a bunch of random events to mix it all up. You can't take any card game that allows you to change trump, or make it no trumps, mid-trick too seriously, especially if you're foolhardy enough to believe that you can accurately bid what you're going to win when there are 6 suits and half the deck is missing. Nor if it has cards that just add or subtract points from the trick-taker. Once all the vibe is taken into account, what you have is a chaotic game that's fun - it allows you to participate in a roller-coaster of yes, somehow it all worked out brilliantly, over to no, who could have expected the Spanish Inquisition, in the space of one trick! It can be enjoyable if you take it as it is, right down to the one-card, final trick finale that can make and break the winner. Good family stuff.

The main reason I bought Rage was that a deck of 0-10 in six suits can be used for lots of other games, but it turns out the game itself is decent too. It's actually very similar to a standard-deck game I used to play with university friends, which we knew as "Blob" but I now realise is a version of Oh Hell. I'm a big fan of trick taking games and while I thought the special cards would add irritating amounts of chaos, they're actually rare and interesting enough to work fine

A chaotic trick-taking game that's *too* chaotic.  You can play the odds in a general sort of way, but you'll end up getting hosed in all sorts of arbitrary ways.  Card counting is useless (which for me is a "pro," but will be a "con" for players who like that sort of thing.)  If you're in the mood for a non-serious card game, and don't care much about the outcome, you'll probably have fun.

Trick taking game with six suits with 16 cards each (0-15) and special action cards. 10 rounds with decreasing number of tricks 10-9-8-7... and you are trying to predict how many tricks you win per round to get a bonus. Trick games for me are about skill and in this game the amount of suits, numbers and especially the special cards make this game too random.

RATING: 6
A trick-taking game like Wizard played backwards: the deck is 6 suits of cards 0-15, and a few specials. Dealer deals 10 cards to each player on first round, then flips over a card (trump). Each later round, hand size decreases by 1. Start by bidding on the exact # of tricks you will take. Must follow led suit if possible. The special cards do different things like: add/subtract 5pts, draw new card to possibly change trump, or make the hand no trump. There's also a Joker (wild) card. You get 1 pt per trick taken, a 10pt bonus for meeting your bid exactly, and a 5pt penalty for under/over bidding. After 10 rounds, most points wins!

This is yet another trick-taking game. If you like those, you'd probably like this. Having played Wizard first, I think I like that better: you have more knowledge/control as the game goes on and your hand size increases. Here, it gets to be increasingly random instead. Still, not a bad game at all.

[Amigo Spiele 2000 edition] {trick-taking, bidding; optimal 4p} The game play is somewhat similar to Oh Hell!. It's more chaotic than other trick-taking games because of the dramatic function cards.

A mediocre trick-taking game which is more luck than I'd care to have in a trick-taker.  It's not terrible, but there are a bunch of special cards which screw things up unnecessarily.  I'd take most any trick-taker over this one.

That said, everyone should buy a Rage deck.  Why?  Because you can literally play about 25 games with it.  For $5 that's one hell of a deal.

I found Rage to be pretty disappointing. I guess it's just a family-weight version of Wizard with some special cards that add an element of chaos, but randomness is not what I'm looking for in a game of this type. There are just too many good cards games out there to waste time with this disappointing mainstream offering.

Really bad version of 'Oh Hell'.  Take 'Oh Hell' (a free card game that can be played with a normal deck), add a bunch of crazy cards that take all the skill out of it and make it chaotic and you have Rage.

RATING: 9
Great card game. You can pull this out for almost any kind of group. Has enough strategy, luck, & or randomness to make it fairly close right up to the last card. A lot of people were looking for this game & willing to pay some decent money to get a copy, until they finally reprinted it.

RATING: 7
Aptly named trick taking game. This is a variant of Oh Hell, on the lighter side of the trick taking spectrum. It can be a of fun if you don't take it seriously. There are many cards that cause trump to change in the middle of a hand, so bidding is pretty much a crapshoot. I like it best with 6 or more.

Can also play Sluff Off! (a.k.a. Die Sieben Siegal, Die Steven Seagal, Wizard Extreme, Zing!) using the 5 suits with cards 1-15 in each suit and some poker chips.

Can also play Sticheln like so:

Three players: Cards 0-8 in green, brown, red, blue and yellow 
Four players: Cards 0-11 in green, brown, red, blue and yellow 
Five players: Cards 0-14 in green, brown, red, blue and yellow 
Six players: Cards 0-14 in green, brown, red, blue, yellow and violet

Least objectionable trick-taking game. It appears to be pure luck at first, but empirically speaking, some people are better at Rage than others. (I have played this dozens of times, but mostly in the days prior to me recording plays on BGG).

RATING: N/A
Based on the widely-known card game Oh Hell!, players use the deck of zero through fifteen in six suits to bid for a particular number of tricks and then subsequently take exactly that many. Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand. Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards. There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.

In its raw form, this game is a lot of luck and chaos. Many rule variations can be used, leading to more luck-based or more strategic games.

This is an average trick-taking card game, where you predict the number of tricks.  It is very similar to Wizard, which I have played too much, so this game gets rated 5 by virtue of its similarity only with less interesting graphics.  For gameplay though, they're pretty much the same.

RATING: 4.5
With the way I play (described below), I'd rate it a 6.5.

An interesting light game. Instead of using the whole deck for play, I use the various action cards, amount of suits, and length of suit to fine-tune every game depending on number of players and desired strategy level. For example: for a 4 player game use 4 suits 1-9, 1 change rage, 1 out rage, and 2 wild rage for a more strategic twist.

The 6-suited deck with numbers 0-15 is also very handy to have around for other games that need 5-6 suits or suits that need to be slightly longer than a typical deck of cards.

RATING: 2
Doesn't seem like enough cards are dealt out which makes the game extremely random. You might as well not even look at your cards to make the bid... that's how awful it is. I don't need to play this one ever again.

Playing hands with very few cards are not fun and indeed felt rather strange. Perhaps it is better to play a fixed number of hands with say 6-8 cards each. Changing of the trump family is also random and uncontrollable luck. Player interaction is reasonably high. Game component quality is ok.

Raucous fun with the right people. It's a trick-taking game with just a step above Uno in complexity. The Rage comes from winning tricks you didn't want to and losing tricks you really needed to nail your bid.

A fun variation of "Rook" that changes things up by the use of a few specialty cards.  Rating would be higher if it weren't for the last few rounds that simply come down to seat position.

RATING: 6.25
This was my first trick-taking game other than Hearts and King. The decreasing hand size and trick bidding aspect keeps you on your toes each round and makes it comparatively better then the other two games mentioned. The card art might be a little garish, but it's just a minor gripe. Plays best with 4p onwards.

Verdict: [b]6.25[/b]

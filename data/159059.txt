Rules need an edit but after several plays, I have it down.  A fair amount going on as an exercise in efficiency and resource allocation.  Fun and feeling of accomplishment as you build your Abbey.

RATING: 6.5
Not bad overall. Like many games, it feels like a mashup of several mechanics without a sufficiently original heart. The components are hit and miss - the wooden resources are marvelous, the extremely tiny cards and cardboard chits are not. It plays too long in general and feels fiddly. So a fairly solid effort, but not something I'm going to put into my collection.

A nice game about building an abbey. You have to get resources and place workers. The solo mode works well. The theme makes for a light atmosphere. Is it religious? Maybe, but for me it is just another theme and here the theme is actualy implemented very nicely.

Yesterday evening I've played a 2-player-game using the pnp-version of King's Abbey. Very interesting, really good. After three more games (2 and 3 players): Very good game.

23.02.2016:

Schönes Spiel. Erfordert viel Konzentration und sorgfältige -zugleich flexible- Planung, trotz Würfeleinsatzes. 

Voll planbar ist das Spiel nicht. Es gibt doch einige Zufallselemente. Welche Unglückskarten, welche günstigen Ereigniskarten sind im Spiel, wann kommen sie? Wenn die Wikinger kommen: Habe ich passende Würfel, oder habe ich sie eben nicht. Welche Gebäudekarten von all den vielen kommen überhaupt ins Spiel, kann ich sie dann kaufen, oder kommen andere mir zuvor? Würfel fallen nun einmal, wie sie wollen. Da das allen so geht, gleicht sich das meist aus, zumindest wenn man einen Würfelturm benutzt, der heimliche Manipulationen beim Würfeln verhindert. Bei aller Planung kann am Ende ein ungünstiger Würfel das Spiel entscheiden:
Der Rückstand von 13 Punkten in diesem Spiel sagt allenfalls, dass es sehr knapp war. D hatte 140 Punkte, ich habe 135 Punkte zunächst erreicht. Da ich aber einen 5-gleiche-Würfel-Auftrag hatte, den ich nicht erfüllen konnte, weil ich es nur auf vier gleiche Würfel gebracht habe, bekam ich 8 Punkte abgezogen, hatte als nur noch 127, statt für den erfüllten Auftrag 8 Punkte zu bekommen, womit ich 143 Punkte gehabt und gewonnen hätte (Hätte, hätte ….).
Wer sich darauf nicht einlassen kann, dass man im Laufe des recht langen Spiels viel zu überlegen hat und am Ende doch an einem einzigen Würfel "scheitern" kann, der wird von dem Spiel eher frustriert sein. 

Mir macht das Spiel Spaß, obwohl es viel Optimieren und anstrengend ist. Konzentriert man sich nämlich nicht die ganze Zeit und versucht nicht, das jeweils Bestmögliche zu machen, kommt man im Zweifel erst gar nicht in die Lage, wegen ungünstig fallender Würfel zu verlieren.

Let me say it in my bad English:
Nice game. Requires a lot of concentration and careful –but also flexible planning, despite use of dice.

The game is not full plannable. There are a few random elements. What calamity cards, which positive event cards are in the game, when will they come? If the Vikings come: Do I have matching dice, or not. Which building cards of all the many ever come into play, may I buy them, or get others them earlier? Dice now even fall as they want. But that’s the case for all players, at least if you use a dice tower which prevents clandestine manipulations at dice, so that may be balanced. Despite all planning an unfavorable dice may decide the game:
The residue of 13 points in this game, says the most that it was very close. D had 140 points, I have reached 135 points first. But since I had a 5-same Cube mission that I could not meet, because I have only made it to four identical dice, I got 8 points deducted, so I had only 127, instead of getting 8 points for a fulfilled crusade, when I had won with 143 points (had, would ....).
When you don’t like, that you have a lot to think about during the rather long game and in the end may "fail" at a single cube, you may be rather frustrated with this game.

I like the game, although it is much optimizing and exhausting. If you don’t concentrate namely all the time and doesn’t try to make the best possible each turn, you even may may not get in a position to lose because of unfavorable falling dice.

Lo definió Yamakasi como un troyes vitaminado y es bastante correcta la definición. Es un juego de colocación de trabajadores en el que los dados son las acciones posibles. Hay construcción de edificios, defensa de enemigos comunes, obtención de recursos.. Es un juego que te da para pensar un buen rato.. aunque en nuestra primera partida, daba la impresión de que se iba a sufrir más de lo que realmente se sufrió. Se juegan 9 rondas y cada ronda tiene 12 fases. Creo que es sólo apto para jugones. Mezcla muchas mecánicas de varios juegos y queda un producto elegante.

Not a good dice Euro. The game is a long slog and gets really repetitive really fast. I do like some things, particularly the resource-management aspect of the game. I like that unlike Stone Age, you know how many resources your dice will yield BEFORE you place, and I loved the "trade tokens" which really do present an interesting "puzzle" to solve on each one of your turns.

However, I hate the incredibly stupid "Crusades" deck, which simply is not balanced for the two-player game (when "sharing" is simply not worth it for either player). Because there are few ways to reroll, and even fewer ways to manipulate dice for the Crusades, any player who draws an easy-to-complete mission is at a huge advantage to a player who draws a monster 5-die Crusade that they are never going to finish on their own; the player with the easy mission will begin building her engine a full turn or two early while the other player falls behind. 

Turn order is also way too powerful, as it gives a huge point-scoring advantage to the first player when fighting Vikings, and gives another advantage when choosing buildings to purchase. Add to that the random "Everyone loses a building ha ha!" event card mechanic, and this game goes from "not THAT bad" to "truly terrible."

RATING: 6
The King's Abbey is a mixture of several mechanisms seen in other games combined into what is at its heart a dice-placement game. Players must erect buildings with resources gathered in the style of Stone Age, manning them with peasants that you have baptized, while making your way up the clergy,completing crusades, and protecting your abbey from raiding vikings. Sounds like a lot and it is indeed a bit too many things packed in one box and can be a bit overwhelming a first. It is still a good game but one that could have used a bit more editing in my opinion. I would play again if asked but it didn't leave me wanting to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love a good resource management game, so this looks right up my alley. Can't wait to test it out. 

Update: I've had a chance to play this several times and greatly enjoy it. There's a good deal of tension throughout each turn as players strive to not only build their abbey, but keep ahead of the threat of Darkness that worsens with every step. I especially love the ability to assist other players with Crusades, thus allowing the ability to negotiate for part of the rewards. The promotion of citizens from just sitting in pews to a usable workforce is a fantastic mechanic as worshipers earn the right to help expand and improve your abbey. 

The only oddity is the alter. It gives a decent boost to fighting the darkness and has been the very first thing built by all players in every game. Perhaps we need to try something different, but the cheap cost and big payout in the first turn buys time to allow you to use resources elsewhere later on. Personally, I'd like a bit more debate about should I or shouldn't I, but that's a nitpick. There's enough depth, even with 2 players, that keeps it on regular rotation with my game crew.

I acquired this through the Kickstarter campaign, but just got to looking into the game recently, and just played my first solo game. This game doesn't disappoint based on the info provided during the Kickstarter. It is very unforgiving when it comes to Viking attacks - you WILL lose buildings. Getting used to this last point will make the game more enjoyable. I look forward to a multiplayer game soon.

Worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys. Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the "darkness" becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round. After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!

2017-08-28 : First play. This game is a smorgasbord of mechanics taken from other games. There's the Vikings straight from Troyes, the resource gathering from Stone Age, the animal/grain farming and feeding from Agricola, the defense from Kingsburg and the events from Unfair all put into an engine builder. Because of the disparate mechanics play doesn't flow as smoothly as it could, especially the first time, but it all works. Not spectacular, but not bad either. The only real negative point is the font size / text color choice so cards 50% bigger would have been ideal.

If we played it correctly, allowing the start player to hold on to start player can be an issue in a 5 player game.
Update:  Looks like others also found this to be an issue.  A suggestion is to preclude the start player from selecting the 'first player' on their first turn;  thereafter if it's still available they may select it.

Very nice mix of mechanisms and a good balance of in-game motivations.  Borrows from several games, but implements those design elements well and makes for a generally thematic experience.

It's a little too linear without enough arc, which might make the game feel little longer than it needs to be.

Rating based on one 4P game so far.  Very good worker placement with dice, including plenty of options to mitigate bad rolls.  Lots of interesting choices.  The game is considerably long (3 hr first game), so I don't foresee playing it often, but many of the actions are simultaneous, so it never felt like it was dragging.

This games feels like Agricola in the peculiar way that you spend an enormous amount of time simply trying to survive where I would rather thrive.  (In Agricola, one has to work vigorously to just feed your family, and in King's Abbey, one has to build up against the forces of darkness.)  

Thematically, the game's religious undertones doesn't really work for me either.

Although I have played this game only once, I didn't enjoy it at all.

During rules I was worried this was just going to be Agricola with dice, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but wouldn't excite me much. Instead I found it to be a not too bad tableau builder that gives you a little more control than Agricola does. It's very light on interaction, which normally I'm not keen on, but for some reason that didn't bug me too much.

I'm so stoked for this game. Dice as workers, resource management, group challenges, great bits. If you haven't looked at it yet; do it now!
Played it twice in Jan-2016. Super fun WP game. The only knocks are the size of the building/tower cards (too small/hard to read), and the cardboard tokens have a cheap, squishy layered center which leaves the token edges sharp. Otherwise, this is easily one of my top two WP games, with the other being Empires: Age of Discovery.
UPDATE: My copy arrived, and the cardboard tokens don't have the squishy center of the other copy I played. So it may have just been an issue with that particular copy.

This is a very euro-y euro. And by that I mean it feels like a lot of euro designs were thrown in a blender to make this smooth euro with lots of mechanisms. 

It has dice placement / multiple worker placement phases / contract fulfillment / tech tracks. 

I think it deserves a bit more attention. There are some stuff that I wish was a bit more clear and some possibly broken combos but we'll see in repeated plays if that's true.

A little too fiddly for what it is but I can't bring myself to rate it below a five because there are some good ideas here. However, the rules presentation leaves something to be desired and there are a lot of little things to remember over the course of the game ("When I'm a priest, I can do this but when I am a bishop, I can do that instead"). I kickstarted this so I have all the  add-ons which are cool but I still might put it up for trade/sale since it really isn't grabbing me like I hoped it would.

A game that would have benefited from more development and more streamlined mechanics. I understand that this is the designer's first game, so I hope he continues designing games and improving as a designer as time goes on.

The King's Abbey is a game that I'd describe as advanced Stone Age. It's a dice worker placement game where you can place in different resource-gathering spots, divide the total pips by the quality of the good, and get that many goods. These good are used to build a wide variety of special-power buildings. While feeding your people was definitely a thing, the main goal was to try to keep your military up with the "Darkness level", and while the game provided built-in ways to increase your military, you tend to use the cheaper ways up early and have to struggle to buy more expensive ways later in the game. I didn't like the start player mechanism, as the start player space was advantageous enough that it was a no-brained for the player who was already going first to take it every turn. The game does run long, but for those that like resource-crunching and struggling to stay above the rising tide of Darkness, it can be enjoyable.

This games looks great but it is way over complicated for its own good. I backed this on Kickstarter and they had it in stores before they got the backers their copies. Poor score for game play and their fulfillment.

Played once solo, putting my rating as 7 as a placeholder for now. Seems like a fun game from my solo play. Really like the variability in how it can be played. You can adjust the event deck to your preference of difficulty, start the darkness easy/hard, add expansions, etc.

Playing solo I got a lot accomplished and had dice left over in later turns, but that just means I'll adjust the event deck to make it more challenging.

This is all what you can expect from most Kickstarters: the project has been rushed, so a lot of unclarity about certain cards, buildings,... (already 3 pages of rules-questions on 25/02/2016), poorly written rules (haven't read them myself, but this is how the owner of the game expierenced them) and a mediocre game, that offers in fact nothing new. Luckely for Nico (the owner of the game), it's more of a mediocre+ game, as all works well together. 
But we've seen it all before: Vikings you fight like the black die in Troyes, the resource system from Stone Age, die as worker placement like Feld has done it a couple of times (Castles of Burgundy or Bora Bora) and a touch of Ticket to Ride (buildings or crusades give you plus points if you complete them, but minus if you don't).

What you certainly don't wanna do is play this with AP-players (really NEVER do this, unless you like SM). 12 phases is a lot and as you have to decide which and how many die you wanna keep for putting down on the central board, even 'normal' players need some thinking time.

A game I quite enjoyed after the first play. It lasted DOUBLE the time I would have liked it to. I don't know if I were to own this game if I would ever play with more than 3p. FAR too long. lasted about 3.5 hours for 1 who had played before and 3 who hadn't. After the game was over, however, I immediately wanted to revisit it and play again. I didn't, but it got me thinking that it would be a great 2p game for Ron and myself. Interesting options with the dice and different buildings to come out. Feeding the people isn't that challenging to do and very manageable. Bits are awesome and I think there is a lot of promise here. If I could bring the game play down to 90-120 minutes it would be perfect for me. Faster in an hour play with 2p but I think it is possible. The rules are a B*tch to get through and I am sure to teach as well. It is a game I wouldn't want to be teaching a lot.

This is a fun building/defending game that offers lots of options and is very open. Players are required to improve their defenses/enlightenment as the Darkness increases each round. Also, players must feed their peasants. What's refreshing with this concept is failure to feed or defend is not devastating as it is in some games (e.g. Agricola). Failure means losing one peasant and 2 points, both of which are easy to regain.

My plays have so far all been solo and have taken roughly 90 minutes to play. Scores have ranged from 71 to 107 points.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a game I had looked forward to for a while. We ordered it from KS some time ago, but never got round to playing it. We've finally crossed that hurdle!

To start, the box is a good normal size so will fit with others on the shelf. It is a little heavy as it has a lot of components within. Being a Kickstarter backer, I believe that the only difference we have from normal is the Defense Shields, the Darkness Tracker, the starting player meeple and the Clergy Training Token. The components within are all fantastic quality. The KS price was an unbelieveable $39, which is amazing considering the amount of components and the quality of everything within. The sideboards are thin, but have a nice linen feel covering which makes them feel quite sturdy. The main cards are great quality and of normal size, so normal sleeves were fine. The building cards are nice and sturdy, but are quite small. They can have a bit of writing on them, which can make it tricky for people around the table to be able to read them when it comes time to buy buildings. From playing the game, I know that these need to be placed on the player sideboard. So I know why they need to be the size they are (or we'd need hugely bigger sideboards), they just feel a bit small. 

The rulebook is nice quality and is quite detailed. The player aid cards show all the difference phases in the game and the rulebook does explain them in good detail. I still have to admit that I found it a bit intimidating getting started in the game. Trying to explain the game to others, it can be very easy to try and explain everything to them - which is a mistake, as it will take forever to do so. 

Getting setup is no picnic, it will take a while to get all the little pieces in place unless you are like we are and seperate player starting bundles into bags beforehand and keep everything logically seperated in their own bags. There are a lot of difference pieces here and it will need someone to be able to be on top of things to explain every part easily to other players. 

The game itself follows a great theme. You're building up an Abbey in the Middle Ages, working with the problems of Viking attacks and general problems of living in the time. While you are men of God, you also want to be able to defend yourself and your flock! There's also the spread of your religion to be considered, at the point of a sword through the Crusades - very important that you take the time to send your monks and villagers to do their part there! All the time, you're trying to build up your Abbey's defenses and internal buildings while improving the level of your church leader - it's a busy life in the Abbey alright!
In game terms, this means that there's a lot of things to focus on and so decisions to be made. You need resources to build things, so you need people to gather resources - who will need to be fed, so that's more resources needed. It's like a typical resource gathering, worker placement game and we likened it to the game "Stone Age" - except that it is more complex and has more going on within. 

It has a good balancing act with dice. You start off rolling 9 normally. But high rolls are not necessarily better than low ones. Certain abilities can only be triggered with 1,2,3. Others with 4,5,6. Resource gathering can only use 2 dice maximum (so you normally want high here), but for Viking attacks - you need to be able to match the Viking dice that corresponds to your player position, so you don't know ahead of time what number you need here. So a balance of all 6 numbers can be ideal. I found dice to be a good mechanic, though you can get a bit unlucky as in all dice games.

On your first games, the initial turns will take a bit of time. After that, players can go through the 12 parts of a turn quite quickly - especially since some parts of the turn, the players can do at the same time (it would take forever playing consecutively at some points). The player aid keeps the game moving and everyone knowing what's happening at the current phase. As the turns go on, Abbeys get built up further with more buildings and people. But I still feel it doesn't get into the position of "analysis paralysis". As villagers are moved to working in buildings, they generally stay there and work there forever - so the amount of decisions doesn't get out of hand later in the game, which is great. 

Still - I think time to play can be a bit long, though. 2 players was fine, though it did take us a few hours on our first play. I'd say 3-4 players would introduce a great gaming experience. I'm not sure if I'd commit to playing with 5 players, especially if a few were new players. I'd say it could easily push well over 3 hours with 5 players, which is a bit long for a single game for most people.

Overall, I think that Kings Abbey is an excellent game. As I mentioned, it feels very like an advanced version of "Stone Age" - with many more options and things going on. The amount of pieces have a good balance between introducing a lot of strategy/diversity, against the negative of "token fever" everywhere. Component quality is A1 and artwork is just great. Despite a couple of little negatives, this is a game that I really enjoy!

enjoyed the first play.  I think this game will take several games to get used to the 12 different phases for each turn.  They are thematic and everything makes sense

Followup plays ... really like the crunchiness of the game.  Multiple paths.  Beautiful and great components.

There's way too many things going on each round and it doesn't flow smoothly.  It feels like the designer is trying to put too much stuff into one game, as if he's trying to put all the mechanics he liked from other games into this one thinking it will make the game great but it just makes the game feel clunky and unoriginal.

Another dice-as-workers (this seems to be the hot new mechanic these days) and resource gathering/conversion game. The game works well enough, but I am not sure that anything in here makes it stand out from a very crowded field of similar games. 

Game play is too forgiving for my taste and though the game frequently threatens players with penalties (not feeding workers, not able to fight Vikings, not enough defense against darkness), in reality the penalties are mild and easily avoided. Also, building out one's player board with the most expensive buildings all the way to capacity is just not that hard.

Thematically it grated a little that the game treats defense and attacks from Vikings as completely unrelated. Building up a good defense can be interesting given the several different ways to do so, only to be deflated by the totally uninspiring creeping darkness mechanic, which provides the only reason to build up defense in the first place (every turn players' defense values are simply matched to a steadily and predictably increasing darkness value). 

Viking attacks are marginally more interesting, but ultimately come down to players needing to roll dice values that match those rolled for the Viking invaders. Since everyone rolls pretty much the same number of dice, the outcome is basically all about who gets lucky and who does not get lucky. If the rules could somehow be tweaked so that the number of dice rolled during attacks is tied to a player's defense value, battles will already be more interesting. But then again, not rolling the right number to fight the Vikings is not much of a big deal either (effect on scoring is rather minimal).

I was excited to play this one since I'd been following the kickstarter from first re-launch to success.  Rahdo's video really painted a picture of a game that I thought I'd enjoy.  I was right - very fun dice placement game.  Doesn't really break any mechanic barriers with dice placement (Kingsburg does that), but it does give you more options.  Rolling a 1 or 2 is useful as is rolling a 5 or 6.  There is a LOT going on though for a dice placement game.  It's a hefty game.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent dice placement game, borrowing some mechanisms from Troyes. Much heavier than would first appear! MUST keep defenses up and construct 5 of the 6 buildings you are dealt. Impossible to build all 5 towers, so you will lose points at the end for at least one of them. Which makes buying buildings from the market a critical part of the game: vital to get good engine builders early on but don't buy anything you can't build or you lose points!

Our 1st 3P game: tie score going into the penalty for unbuilt buildings. I lost 8 he lost 6 for our unbuilt towers. 3rd player was 44 points behind. It is nearly impossible to catch up if you get off to a bad start. The game is probably one round longer than it should be due to the very involved decision process for getting through all of the phases each round. This will be a drudge if you fall far behind!

The eleven phases are all logical, for the most part, but it is very involved to set a strategy at the beginning of each round: which dice get placed where, which die or dice get manipulated, the whole quest mechanism: invite others to help or lose use of the committed dice for a round, FEEDING (I HATE this mechanism in all games!!!), go for extra resources or the initiative (with bonus!), etc. etc. And the disaster and Viking events can be annoying at least, devastating at worst. (i.e. losing a quest that already has 3 meeples on it!)

This game has a considerable learning curve. The quick start game is definitely easier, and there are options to lessen the difficulty. (Maybe add: NO food 1-4, 1 for 8-12, 2 for 9+ -- represents the abbey only helping out when the population has grown, otherwise they can fend for themselves.)

This game may well move up my Top 100 list, but it probably won't hit the table as often as I like due to the unexpected complexity.

Feels like a strange combination of Pillars of the Earth and Castles of Burgundy.  Has both dice and worker placement with a little semi-competitive "have to fight a common threat" every few rounds.  Gorgeous components from top to bottom.  Almost no player interaction outside of some minimal "hope they don't take my spot to get these extra resources".  A neat puzzle to solve but there are games that do it way better.

Absolutely loved playing this the first time. Great theme, mechanics and art. Had a tough time getting through all the rules (more diagrams/examples would have been useful), had to read the rulebook throughout the entire first play.

Played the quick rules for first play and still lasted several hours. Loved the Event cards, would love to add in more Vikings! to get more excitement from the game. The negative points for unmade buildings and unfinished crusades really hurt at the end of the game - will need to be more careful about that in the future.

The rulebook is a mess.  Hard to put together what happens, as each part makes references to other elements that are not clearly linked.  They probably could have used help with organizing it in a way that is clear to new players.  I'm sure that it made sense to them, as they already had a full concept of the rules system and mechanisms, but it was very difficult to read.

The first I had ever heard of this game was when a friend kickstarted it. I can't recall ever hearing/seeing about it before then or since. I don't know if this game has just flown under the radar or if I've been oblivious.

But, despite the religious theme, it looked like something that would really interest me. So I was pretty excited to play it. I had missed a previous opportunity, and jumped at this chance to play.

There's a fair bit going on in this game. It's kind of a Troyes-meets-Stone-Age-meets-Ora-et-Labora thing. You have nine dice. You begin the turn by rolling them. Then there's an event that has to be resolved, which could be good, bad or just random (Don't get me started on the "Year of Plenty" event which could be renamed "King's Abbey likes Ron, and not you two other bums!").

Then you allocate your dice. You'll probably want to save some of them to put into resource collection. This is the bit where it's similar to Stone Age, as you spend pips to get resources where wood cost 2 pips, wheat 3 pips, etc. Every player is guaranteed the opportunity to place a single die at each resource if they want them, but only the earlier players will get the ability to add a second die. Other things you can do with dice are send them on crusades (which require 2-5 dice all of the same pip value), seat parishoners in the pews, and train your clergy (which essentially just gives you bonuses for every 3 trainings). And of course, you can use dice to "fight the darkness".

The darkness is the embodiment of everything bad... poverty, disease, ignorance, etc. Every round the darkness level will increase by one, and you must have shields plus dice equal to the darkness level or you lose people and points.

There's a building purchase phase where you can buy buildings from a central area, with newer buildings being more expensive. And then later there's a build phase where you can spend money and resources to build these buildings. And of course, you must man these buildings in order for them to have any effect. Manning a building usually requires either that you train parishioners to be an archer (for 5 bucks) or you fill them with divine grace by baptizing them.

Then you have to feed your people, but in a weird "peasants are forced to share food" manner where 1-4 workers require 1 food, 5-8 workers require 2 and 9+ require 3 food.

You do all of this for 7 turns and that's the game. There's a fair bit of thinky going on in this game, which I really enjoyed. There's a bit of luck in some aspects that was a little annoying. In particular, I didn't draw any good crusades. My first initiative reward was a toolbag I used only once in the entire game. And of course, the "KA loves Ron" event which locked me into third place in turn order for two turns.

But honestly, I can't blame my poor performance on any of that. It had a lot more to do with failing to feed my people, failing to meet the darkness three times (which I could have easily done but apparently I have trouble counting to 4, 5 and 6?), and building willy nilly without a) giving much thought to what I built or b) realizing there was a limit to how many buildings you can build or c) remembering that towers were a thing. My consolation is that I now know what not to do next time.

I really enjoyed the game and am looking forward to playing again. I think the game will be a lot easier now that I know what some of the buildings are, and what they're worth, and don't have to struggle to read the world's tiniest cards from across the table.

Gorgeous art and production quality... if the prototype is any indication. A dice worker placement where King Sivolc has commanded each player to erect a magnificient abbey as a symbol of the powers of good and hope that will finally stamp out the darkness of the dark ages. The game allows for sharing workers in negotiation which I think is cool but our group seldom employs. I love the designer's interpretation of what the darkness represents and the creative use of its last surge as a doomsday counter against the strength of our abbey's defense. Dramatic. I can't think of many worker placements that create this sense of urgency as we send our monk dice out to the crusade, or to the fields to gather resources (with a cool dice resource conversion mechanic), or to gain and develop followers, and of course build and fortify the masterpiece of hope for the people.

My finger is hovering over the pledge button... Couldn't hold out any longer. Seems like an obvious game to get funded but it has a little ways to go yet.

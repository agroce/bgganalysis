B&W PnP version. The files are mostly jpg, so they'll need to be fiddled with. Personally, I prefer PnP stuff as a pdf so that additional step is taken out.

K/S - Initial review after 1 play. Great little Tile placement treasure hunting game. My only complaint in the paper tiles sliding all over my tabletop. I would have paid for an upgrade to cardboard but again, minor complaint. Definitely a solid filler.

**Quick update** Upped my score to a 9. We really like this game a lot and collectively agreed to remove half the Gnomes. Group (wife and son) did not care for the random, "take from the rich give to the poor", balancing technique. (Felt too Liberal - Egghhh). We may remove them all at some point. Also, played on wood tabletop not Granite which the cards grip better too. Also, rule book is very well done. Thanks Poppy Jasper for a job well done.

Update  : -1.5, replay value is really lacking. The excitement of the first few plays is quickly disappearing. Hoping for an expansion.

Random fun, tile-laying/exploration with elements of Carcassonne and basic dungeon crawlers, (move-fight-collect loot etc!) Good for a filler game.

Bit heavy on the luck for my taste (not getting good weapons or not finding monsters) but great for more casual gamers, explore, simple combat, grab the gold!

Backed it on Kickstarter and it proved to be exactly what we wanted it to be. This is a very lightweight family game that will never play the same way twice and its a ton of fun with kids.  You might finding yourself exploring the woods, armed with a paper towel roll, and forced to retreat from a goldfish!!

Mechanics are easy to teach, components are excellent quality, and this game will be on our collection for a long time!

I really enjoy this one, originally a kickstarter that I had missed.  You get to collect weapons and fight baddies.  The weapon dictates what kind of dice you roll (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)...the weapons are all fun.  Enjoyable goofy roll-offs and exploration.

Backed on Kickstarter. Family-friendly and geared towards a younger audience. Limited game play mechanics and variety mostly boiling down to rolling different dice from D4 to D20. Not for mature or serious gamers. Even for a casual/light game, I found the fun factor to be low; I have had very flat and "meh" experiences playing this with my kids.

Just ran through a solo play and this game was fun!  It's a light-hearted dungeon crawler where you never die, but you can get beat up enough to where you're penniless.  The game is very easy to learn and the instruction booklet was written very well (yes, even easier games can have complicated rulebooks).  The simple dice rolling to resolve combat amidst the humorous theme made the game very enjoyable.

Bought through kickstarter.  Really nice quality parts.  A really easy game to learn but does need a bit of luck to win.  Leaders in the clubhouse (one with the most gold) seem to constantly change so it always enjoyable and takes some strategy .  A good solo game that I usually just play as 3 or 4 people versus using the solo rules.  Probably not a good game with 2.  Either 1,3,4+ seems best.

RATING: 6
Fun, light game with a very family friendly theme. Lots of dice chucking and drawing tiles to explore, not much strategy to think of. No one dies, so everyone plays to the end.  You may find yourself backtracking towards the end as you search for the exits and battle the guardians, but turns are fast and downtime is minimal.

RATING: 3
The game suffers from total randomness, tedious and repetitive gameplay, and the potential to drag on forever if the dice aren't being nice.  A 3-player game took us about 45 minutes, with almost half of that time making bad rolls, returning to start, trudging back to the Guardian's location, making bad rolls, returning to start, rinse, repeat. With a few changes, this has potential to be an enjoyable, light filler. But as it is,  we were all bored and frustrated.

A simple exploration game with a fun art style. It starts off moving at a nice pace but can grind to a halt when a lot of the map is revealed, and can end suddenly when one player notices a path to victory.

Easy to learn game. Doesn't have a lot of strategic depth but it's fun. The Golems keep the game close though that enhances the luck factor some. Have only played two players so far but should be fun with more.

Tile-laying adventure game? Sounds right up my alley. This could be some light bear-and-pretzel fun. It did trade it, because I don't have beer and pretzel that often.

A very light dunegon crawl type game that takes place in the woods. The game has a lot of luck in it, but generally no one ever gets too far ahead or falls too far behind. You'll still already know who the winner is before the game actually ends though.

Backed Feb 2nd 2015 - Received Jan 22nd 2016.

A lot lighter than I had been anticipating. But it may have been what I was after when a backed it. Could see this being very fun with kids but for adults there is quite a large chunk of luck that can be frustrating (never drawing blues, or drawing a blue and ALWAYS rolling 1-2 even with some of the larger dice). Will probably stay in collection but I don't see myself bringing it out unless it's a new crowd or the kids want to play.

--Sold 2/25/17: Some pretty heavy regret after selling, definitely keep an eye on a retail release. Such a quick little game that sets up fast and has some great exciting moments. Once the kids are older (7+) definitely make an effort to grab this one again.

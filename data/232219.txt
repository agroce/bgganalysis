Dragon Castle (despite its stupid name) was one of the more pleasant experiences in Spiel’17. Mahjong inspired means that the setup can be a bit painful but not too bad. This can be forgiven thanks to the fast flowing gameplay that features tactical decisions with some push your luck elements. Or maybe luck is the wrong choice of words here since luck plays a minor role. It is more about what tiles your opponents let you have. Greed can easily result in a failure to score which can be fatal for your game. I really liked this aspect of the game that you have to balance between secure and greedy play, as well as between your own benefit and blocking your opponent. The art (except for the generic dragon on the box) is also easy for the eye.

There is room for criticism, however. Some of the tiles are quite hard to tell apart which is a clear minus but fortunately this does not break the game. And as mentioned before, the setup is a bit of a chore.

I got sucked into this, somewhat reluctantly. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's light, it's fast, but it's a nice twist on Mahjong,filling a nice slot in the super filler genre. Lots of variety in that every game there's a unique score card and a unique action card (in addition to standard scoring and actions). And of course you can make all kinds of shapes when setting up the tiles, although I think that's mostly aesthetics. I'm probably being overly generous with the 7 rating, but the pieces feel extra nice, so I'm feeling generous.

Gyönyörű kivitelezés, érdekes mahjongg lapú mechanizmus. Játék közben vegyesen van szükség tisztán figyelemre és minimális döntésekre. Ez a keresgélős dolog nekem mindig a halálom, nem érzem egy alkotó gondolkodásnak, hogy keresd meg a párokat a egy táblán. Szerencsére némi döntés is vegyül mellé, mert nem teljesen egyértelmű, hogy mindig párt érdemes szedni, mivel a tetők is kellenek előbb utóbb. Mahjonng szeretőknek, egészen biztos jó választás, ha társasabb élményre is vágynak.

Components: amazing
Complex: easy to learn and start playing
Weight: family/ light
Players: 2 or 3
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: set collection
Decisions: which tile to take, where to place it
Opinion: well, we are trying to rebuild a castle from the ruins of a different one... but this is an abstract game, and this doesn't mean anything bad.
With a Shanghai style you have to take tiles (pieces) from the central board and place them in your personal one, trying to get same colors together.
The tile you take must follow the Shanghai we have all played in any videoconsole or app, you can take a tile that is free from its sides. Then place it in your board.
The game looks amazing, and it's funny to play, personally, I think the decisions, although you can have several, are not as appealing as they should be, many times you will find yourself with only one option, or choosing between one or two.
Taking into account that this is, at least in my opinion, focused to a family target is not bad... but I think that with the set up and this, the game is not to be played all days

Dragon Castle is an abstract game with beautiful bakelite tiles. The gameplay borrows heavily from solitaire mahjong, turning that rather boring pattern matching exercise into a tight multiplayer experience.

At the start of the game the tiles are stacked onto a central board. There is a broad base layer, and then a smaller central second layer, followed by another smaller third layer. The whole thing resembles a somewhat haphazard and unfinished pyramid. Each player has a small player mat with spaces to hold tiles.

On your turn you identify a pair of tiles (same artwork) that are exposed so that you can slide each one off the board to the left or to the right. You take the pair and place them face-up on spaces of your mat. If you create a contiguous group of 4 or more same-coloured tiles then you score them and flip them over. Larger groups score more points. Flipped over tiles can have tiles placed on top of them in the future.

An alternate turn exists where you slide out a single tile and also take an adorable pagoda top. The tile is placed as usual and the pagoda top is put in your supply. When you finish a group you have the option of adding one or more pagoda tops to the flipped over tiles. The pagoda tops score more points when placed on higher stacks.

There are also two cards flipped up each game that change the rules in small ways. One adds a scoring option and the other allows the rules to be broken in some way. These cards are at just the right power level to make each game feel different without feeling like the cards are overwhelmingly important. They certainly add a lot of variety to subsequent plays, and challenge players in slightly different ways each time.

I loved the puzzle this game provides, figuring out which tiles to claim and how to add them to your player mat is tricky. You also need to watch your opponents and be mindful of what they want, and what you're leaving them. There's a bit of push-your-luck when setting up for larger groups as your opponents have a lot of influence over which tiles you have access to. I played a 2p game and it was a very tight back-and-forth battle full of interesting decisions. Upping the number of players will take the edge off of this somewhat, but I expect I will still enjoy the 3 and 4 player game.

A lot of the appeal of Dragon Castle obviously comes from the tactile feel of the Bakelite tiles, and the game in general looking amazing. But the gameplay is really solid too. The gradual unraveling of the central castle has a good bit of getting/forcing others to do the moves that'll help you. And the solitaire puzzle of building your own castle to maximize both instant scoring, end of game shrine scoring, and the variable end of game scoring, is pretty pleasing.

Regretting not grabbing a copy, this would be perfect when I had non-gamers over for dinner + a quick game.

Ez egy szuper absztrakt játék nagyon szép megjelenéssel... Ami egyrészt nagyon jó, másrészt viszont nem akármi az ára... De úgy tűnik, ez az új irány, absztrakt játékok felturbózott köntösben, akkor megveszik azok is, akik amúgy nem rajonganak az absztrakt játékokért (lásd Santorini, Azul, stb.). Jó lenne valami középutat találni a gyártásban is, de persze az árképzés az addig fogja feszegetni a határokat, amíg csak lehet. Persze ez nem a játékot minősítő. Ez a játék ebben a formájában nagyon jó, nagyon szép, jó szívvel lehet ajánlani, de csak az absztrakt játékok szerelmeseinek.

Played the game in Essen, my friend was about to buy the game when a table opened up, so we decided to play a quick round first, great decision because none of us liked the game, yes the stones are lovely, but the player papers and set up paper were very disappointing, gameplay didn't capture us at all, we actually stopped playing the game before we were done because we just couldn't care anymore.

First game left on the fence with this one. First of all, using the word Mahjong when talking about the solitaire should be a criminal offense. Second, the tiles don't have the correct form factor: they don't feel like Mahjong tiles. If you're expecting some kind of Mahjong aesthetic here, prepare to be disappointed.

The game is fine. The dragon cards make the game: balancing between the different scorings works well. The setup is a bit heavy, but playing the game is interesting.

This one feels like a whiff to me, despite the wonderful Mahjong tiles. On the surface it's a simple family set collection game, but one of the fundamental scoring elements requires players to remove single tiles from the display, which will inevitably result in players killing opponents' chances of making matches that they need. I'll have to try it again, given the hype, but this did very little for me.

I had hopes that this might be a nice relaxing game to play with my Mum, who's played a fair share of Mahjong Titans in her day, but it turns out to be further evidence that attempts to turn solitaire ventures into multi-player games rarely turn out well. See Sudoku. The game-play is much the same as the computer game - slide a pair of identical tiles to the sides to claim them (but one must be on the top row). Then place them into your personal tableau, and either choose to score them (if you have enough in that colour), or choose to place them in such a way so as to enable the formation of a scoring group later at a more effective points/turn ratio. If you do the former, you get the chance to build upwards (on top of previously scored groups), and higher columns can score more points. In the advanced game, you'll also want to build towards the bonuses, so there's some planning and choices involved. This is the best feature, because turns are bland - claim the tiles you need for your plan, and if you can't, check out what other people are collecting and either pick what they want if it's a one-off, or go in a separate direction in an attempt to build more later. There's some satisfaction in executing your building plan, but it's a quiet game and that's what you'll want to be after, because otherwise it's without a lot of joy, tension, or excitement.

Beautiful game. Bought it because of that. Easy set collection game but you have to collect the tiles and place them on your board in the most optimal way as you can. I like this game, I am unsure on how much replay value there is. Perhaps not enough going on to keep me interested for several plays. We will see on the different variants and player counts.

Great game and looking gorgeous as well! Interesting decisions every turn and a very relaxing playing atmosphere. Played it three times and scores were really close.

Rating is for the four-player game; with four you simply don't get enough tiles to make for interesting decisions. You can almost always score a large set unless it's near the end so the tiles aren't available, so there's generally no reason to do anything else. If you play with lots of dragons and spirits this dynamic might change, but that's just an offhand variant - the game should play well with the standard rules.

I suspect the game is better with two players, since you will get twice as many tiles on average and the castle tiles will free up more slowly in comparison to how your board fills up, which will make for some actual decisions.

For a 30 minute dungeon bash I haven't seen better. It may be a bit of a personality contest if played. The printing on some of the cards is really small (which some people find difficult). Having had a small discussion re:traps, they don't seem to work quite cleverly enough, will try each person suffers what they play and see what that does. Have also tried the simultaneous version, which was fun but more of an experience instead of a game.

Easy to explain, simple to play, yet there are some strategy for the game.  When I play, there are some tense moments where player need to make the decision to gain or to hurt others.  Quite fun in a short amount of time, I like it :)

RATING: 7.5
Juego muy divertido y dinámico para sacar en cualquier momento con los amigos. Tiene una pega y es que tiene eliminación de jugadores, aunque en este título se perdona por lo rápidas que son las partidas: unos 15 minutos. Lo normal es encadenar una tras otra. En el juego tienes que explorar una mazmorra sorteando toda clase de peligros para llegar vivo y enfrentarte al monstruo final.

A top notch filler and family game for me and my boy. It's simply got the right balance of ingredients for a satisfying filler.  The seasoning's which contribute to is unique flair come in pinches and sprinkles rather than gobs, but it worked for Colonel Sanders and it works here - yet the game won't clog your arteries.

A very straight forward but fun little game with a neat theme.  I like the interaction caused by the items, traps and monsters.  A very neat little game that is super easy to break out and play as a fun filler.  Great stuff again Phil!

The solo rules are a fun little addition to the game - because the amount of open information grows as you go further into a level there is a pleasing degree of pus-your-luck to the game that places it slightly above those games that feel more random.  There are times when you need to really decide what you're going to use your cards for - and times when you need to decide whether you're going to push your luck.

A fun little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty clever for a card game, and the combat/treasure tracking is very unfiddly and well designed.  

Still, in the end I just wasn't that excited by this one.  Some of the traps in particular were pretty lame -- such as someone being able to halve your treasure by playing heir lowest card.  

Sort of makes the result rather random, and little incentive to get ahead early since you can't defend against these traps.

Initial rating a 6.

Prohibido jugarlo con 3, muy recomendable con 5. La verdad es que aunque tenga un mecanismo para que escale con el número de jugadores, cuanto menos haya más aburrido es el juego. Pero a 5, tiene bastante gracia, siempre que la gente sepa a lo que va, a un juego de mazmorras ligero, un poco "push your luck" y con un par de decisiones interesantes que tomar.
La verdad es que me ha decepcionado un poquito, pero no hasta el punto de arrepentirme de tenerlo. Si somos 5 y nos gusta el tema mazmorreo, el juego va a ver mesa fijo.

A very pleasent and fast little game, it´s fun and it can be over just after 15 or 20 minutes.

Of course luck plays a central role here, but the starting conditions are the same for everyone and everybody has the same information available, so it´s not so unfare. Besides, what i like more here is the phsycological element, that is "i will play against what i think you will play"...

RATING: 4
First, I will say that I think the mechanism for fighting monsters is brilliant.  Bring the team down and you can be the one to take a hit.  Wait until the end and you can maybe skate by while preserving cards.  That is fantastic!  Even the method of splitting money is not bad, though I'm a little less excited that the second place person will often make off with more than the first.  But I could live with that.  What I really hate about this game, and what takes it from a fun little cute adventure that I could have seen pulling out from time to time, to the god-awful experience it was is the traps.  Depending on when they come out and what they are, the traps allow one person to straight up attack the leader by playing an extreme card.  If the traps hit the person who played the extreme card, that would be something.  But no, they just attack one person.  Meaning what traps come up when completely dictates the game.  Ugh.

Players are characters exploring five levels of a dungeon.  Fun, light card game where players explore the five rooms in each of the five levels of a dungeon.  On each level, players have five cards numbered 1-5, one of which must be committed to each room on the level (so play your precious 5 in the first room, you don't get it back until the next dungeon level).  Rooms contain either equipment, traps, treasure or monsters, and cards vary in power depending on what room you're facing.  To keep it from being totally deterministic, is some rooms are in "darkness" (face down), so you don't know what's there until you get to it.  At the end of the game the most wounded player is Knizia'd (eliminated), the player with the highest treasure of those remaining wins.  A fun game, if not taken too seriously.

Dungeon Raiders is a semi-cooperative game where you deal with an encounter card each turn by playing one of your five power cards (1-5). They're played in turn order and face UP so you can see what others are doing first. In some cases higher is better, others lower is better. Some encounters have varying penalties based on the highest/lowest card played by any of the players which will strike the richest/healthiest/all players so you're always trying to take your shot when you can while keeping in mind how unprotected you'll be later. In a nice touch, it's not just the wealthiest player who wins b/c the player with the most wounds collapses and dies. So if someone is running away with it in gold, you can get them wounded and make them die the death of the greedy bastard. 

My friends love any kind of screwage, and we laugh it up during this game as we work together but then turn against each other at any opportunity. The more the merrier with this one.

Kudos for the artwork as well. Appropriately cartoony.

:D loveee this game!! i have the Portuguese version, the art is cool, and its soo fun to play! involves lots of strategy to plan ahead, to think about what the other players have, and soo much replay-ability! each time you play is different! and you can make the game harder if you like! its fast and not luck based. i love that is a light game that you can play over and over again, and win because you had good strategy and not because of luck. awesome game! recommend it

We've gotten several plays out of this, and there's definitely quite a bit of fun here. Second-guessing, figuring out what card to play when, and everything works well. My only complaint is that very often you go into the last few cards with no way to win, or even to bring down the leader. It feels very frustrating to have no way of improving your position.

This is a quick & light filler for any game night.  I really love the concept of his game, where each player has cards numbered 1-5 and each player has to use one in each of 5 rooms, some revealed some hidden until entered.  In the end, this game is more fun as a concept than a game, but very clever nonetheless.

Es uno de esos fillers de cartas para echar el rato.

La tematica es mazmorreo: cada uno maneja a un heroe y hay que matar unos cuantos bichos, sortear algunas trampas y conseguir tesoros. Luego el desarrollo es bastante original: cada jugador tiene un conjunto de cartas numeradas (del 1 al 5) y adicionalmente algunas cartas de equipo (una espada para matar bichos, una llave para cofres del tesoro, otra que permite ver todas las cartas del nivel...). La gracia del juego es que hay que superar los varios niveles del juego, sin morir, consiguiendo matar a las criaturas que puedan aparecer, usando correctamente las cartas de manera cooperativa. 

da para un poco de todo... veces que te reservas alguna carta esperando que le caiga el marron a otro, veces que o cooperamos todos o de aqui no salimos vivos... cosas asi. 

Entretenido y divertido. Es carne de P&P pero la presentacion es buena y el precio en tiendas es suficientemente bajo como para que te pienses dejar durmiendo a la impresora :D

Un muy buen filler.

I'm rating this high with some caveats.  This is a great game for my family, but I know it isn't the game for everyone.

Less a dungeon crawl and more a trick taking game, this quick filler makes for some tense moments of decision.  

We play it with the simultaneous reveal and while that may make the game less strategic, it works well for our family because it makes it more about the bluffing.  I think bluffing elements are great in games that you play with the same people over and over, i.e. your family.

Besides the simultaneous reveal doesn't remove all strategy, you know what's in everyone's hand and what they have already played, plus it makes the crystal balls more powerful.

We love this game for it's simplicity, quick play and tense moments.  For an inexpensive extra that I happen to throw in one of my game orders, I am absolutely delighted to have found this one!

I probably like this game more than it deserves.  I'm no fan of dungeon themes, but I like the simple artwork and quick play.  I tend to enjoy little blind bidding games and this is no exception.  Probably the main thing I dislike about the game are the traps, which seem a little overpowered, as I doubt there would be a time when it would not be advantageous to hit the leader.

I admit it: the dungeon theme and the artwork for my hero had me kind of not enthused about this. But it turns out it's actually a fun and clever mix of take-that and push your luck elements. It's similar to Cutthroat Caverns in what it's thematically accomplishing, but without being a murky slog to do it. A pleasant surprise.

The game plays well for the first few times, but loses its fun factor quickly after just a few games. All novelty are gone and what remains is a simple bidding mechanic with a little backstabbing. If the game has triple the amount of dungeon cards (drawn randomly), I believe the game's appeal will last much longer. As of now, you've experienced everything after 3 - 5 games. For younger players, this game would be good.

We play this now instead of Incan Gold for a filler game. This game requires some strategy and bluffing. It also allows for a bit of backstabbing your opponents. We play with the blind bidding variant instead of having the highest bidder from the previous round going first, either way should be fun.

Game in a Nutshell: Delve into a dungeon with other players combining strength to defeat monsters while saving enough to steal the most treasure.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: I love the artwork. The game has some great ideas on how to present a dungeon-crawling experience into a short, filler-style card game. It's pretty easy to teach/understand, and plays in a time that doesn't overstay its welcome. Munchkin could learn a lot from this design.

Cons:  The theme of back-stabbing adventurers (the main draw to me) faded into a simple semi-calculable numbers game upon playing. The decisions are just "my opponent played his '1' card should I play my '3'?" simple; and I mean it's literally a card with a number on it. The sort of sits in this paradox of being so simple, you could use it as an introduction to non-gamers but carries along with it the "dungeon" stigma that can cause eyes to roll from the same people... so while I'd like to play it with new gamers, I sort of would shy away from it.

Other: I never tried it, but if I were to play again, I would play with the variant that had players simultaneously lay down their cards rather than in turn order. This would exchange the simple calculable decisions into more interesting bluffing/mind-reading ones. I think the theme would shine through too as encounters in dungeons would be quick and from the gut, not in turn order and needing a calculator.

Best Use: When you want to pillage a dungeon while waiting to get a bigger game in.

Nice game to play with casual gamers, specially in a 5-people group.

PROS
- Really easy to teach.
- Fun "take that" situations will take place.
- Just as short as it should be.

CONS
- Way too simple for medium-advanced gamers.
- The (Spanish version) art is... different and, while funny, may not be liked by everyone.

RATING: 7.5
Played this game as a filler last weekend. It was easy to learn and played quite cleanly and I actually quite liked it.

The game itself is a card-driven dungeon crawl; each player chooses a standard adventurer-type (e.g wizard, warrior, thief & etc) to join the party and explore the dungeon. In the course of this exploration the objective is to acquire the most gold and not die. Unlike a lot of fillers players can be eliminated in this game.

The mechanism driving the game is the playing of either one-use special item cards or standard action cards with a value of 1 to 5 as the five areas on each level of the dungeon are explored. This is a pretty good sort of mechanism as it can force interesting decisions on players as monsters have to be dealt with, treasure amassed and other loot grabbed in order to win the game.

There is a 'bash the leader' mechanism which can stop some-one racing away with too much gold, but another player will have to be willing to play one of their higher value cards to activate it.

Not a bad game, and if you're up for a good silly dungeon crawl themed game it's certianly a much better option than anything from the Munchkin franchise.

All-in-all, a good solid filler and one I would play again and even consider purchasing.

Filler with simple rules where you take half of your decisions blindly, and the other half with limited knowledge. It combines a bit of take that and a bit of push you luck, enough "bits" to entertain me.

The components are a bit mean: some tokens to keep track of the money would have been nice, instead of the unreliable moving card system.

Dungeon Raiders is a sword & sorcery themed cardgame in a similar vein to For Sale. Each level players face a series of challenges, and must assign a card to each. Once used, cards are not available again until the next level. High cards are generally good, low cards are bad... but you must play the bad cards sometimes. There are nice thematic effects, plenty of opportunity to stab your buddy, and well designed cards. Go Aussie! Great filler, especially for D&D fans.

Nice quick game. You've got 5 cards, 1-5, each of which will need to be played to the next 5 rooms. The problem is you may know some of what the rooms are, but the others will be face down, so you're not sure to which room you'll want to play your high cards and which will need to take your low. Rooms vary between highest cards getting the treasure, lowest cards taking hit points, etc. Play out the 5 rooms, get your cards back, and then do 4 more sets of 5 rooms. Most treasure at the end wins except if you're dead (10 hits), and except if you have the most hit points of those still living. You can play simultaneous revelation, but it seems more interesting playing out cards in turn, seeing what others are doing. You do better if you remember what others have left. You can also acquire special cards which allow you to see what rooms are coming up, or special 5's that you can play for treasure or for fights, or delay playing until you see what others have played. After a first play, I thought it very decent for its niche. While there's not a lot of tension, it's kinda fun working out whether to go high or low for the early rooms based on what you think others will do, as well as determining what specials to go for and when to use them. There's some mini co-op required to get above the monster tallies (ie lowest card played takes the hits, so pull your weight or else) which I liked. And all over in 20-30 minutes depending which way you play. My only wish is that the text on the room cards was actually big enough to read without squinting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played once and it was quite good fun for a "filler" short game. It's quite similar to other simple bidding games, and the fact that a few of the cards that you'll be "bidding" on each round are covered at the start of the round adds some interest as you'll have to guess whether to keep your high/low cards in your hand.

Not sure about how replayable the game is, nor where it lies on the skill/luck spectrum. Either way, I can't see it as being expensive, so it's probably worth picking up.

One solo play- I see why people claim its a bit dry solo. You're not really playing the game, but stepping through 60% of the mechanisms.

This is not a negotiation game. There is no co-operative play in this game. As a matter of fact, it's a game with lots of fuck you. Seriously, this is a light and clever tactical card game with a bit of risk management.

Each player has five cards valued one to five. (Players can also have other special power cards.) Each round consists of five dungeon cards, which range from treasure, traps, and monsters. For each dungeon card, players play one of their number cards. In almost all cases, it's much better to play a high number card than a low one for each of these dungeon cards. This is where the tactics come into play: You always know which cards your opponents have not played, and you (sometimes) know which dungeon cards will come up in play.

I've always liked second-guessing games, and this was a really good fun. Information is not hidden, so you can do math and make decent risk assessments for card plays. With the lack of randomness though, I'd guess most games will always be extremely close. Very easy, especially with the traps, to reign in the leader. Would like to try with the kids, as it is a light filler/kid's game, despite some of the calculations required. Time will tell if it has replayability.

It's basically For Sale with a fantasy theme and a few fun additions.

I was attracted to this game because its concept seemed to me similar to [i]Cutthroat Cavers[/i]'s. That is getting into a dungeon with your partners, in order to "colaborate" with them to eliminate the dangers that show up, while collectig spoils. But, as players act this way, they are also ready to backstab their companions to grab all the riches found for themselves. Nevertheless, after a play, it is evident to me that the tension and the "take that" element was almost completely gone, and that this is more an auction kind of game, in which player bid for gold, or to avoid damage. Still, a very pleasant and original filler, with a well integrated and credible theme.

This is a short outguessing game.  It is fine for a quick filler and is well-designed and cute.  I think it gets more fun with more people as the chaos level rises.  With fewer people (2-3) the better characters often win as planning your selections each turn is easier.

I really wanted to like this. Dungeon Raiders plays quickly, has an engaging theme and uses asymmetrical but balanced starting powers for the characters - all things on the plus side of the ledger. Sadly, I had almost no meaningful choices during the game, and very little room to maneuver. The game is very constraining at times and choices are nearly always obvious, locking this firmly in the ranks of the ordinary.

A simple fun fantasy filler full of agony.

It's quick yet creates the sense of adventure, it creates constant agonising (mini) decisions and really keeps you on your toes. It also is varyable and has a pretty push your luck aspect on it. And most of all, it's tons of fun!

The fairly rare player elimination is always a downside in any game, though I admit it's less of an issue on a filler and when it's only pausible later in game. Other than that, nothing really so far!

Overall I expect my rating to climb the more I play this game. Seems like a great little filler!

Dungeon Raiders is a light filler game with a dungeon crawl theme.  You're exploring a dungeon and in turn order deciding which of your cards 1-5 to play on the current room in the dungeon.  You don't get your cards back until you've played to all five rooms.  You've got to balance how much you can screw other players with how much you need to protect yourself.  As an added twist, some cards are hidden and you won't always know what's coming up.  Whoever plays the highest card starts the next turn.  

It's fairly quick, but there are some interesting decisions and some people get screwed.

First off, this game is a blast. 

Not as awesome as I hoped it would be, though, but still a great game. Not a long one by any means, but we played three times in a row just to warm up to Power Grid and Runewars the other day. In that respect, this is just what the doctor ordered.

The opportunities to hit other players directly isn't as great as I thought, but the player who's winning can still change in a heartbeat. Chaotic, tense and many laughing-out-loud moments. A great way to start (or end) a gaming night.

Not good as single player though. Setup takes longer than playing a round, and without opponents and items the game is reduced to a luck-of-the-draw trudge.

I no longer need to spend my daydream hours wondering whether someone will ever fix Zombie in my Pocket.  Adventureland Games did it independently and better.

Dungeon Raiders outshines Cutthroat Caverns, Masquerade, and other light 'n nasty card-based adventure systems.  Yes, it only involves playing numbered cards while fighting through dungeon "levels".  Some fantasy purists will hate it, but that doesn't make it bad.  It just means their taste in underhanded gameplay has not yet evolved to my exquisite level.

Or it could possibly mean that they don't pop as many Quaaludes as I do.  Call it 3:2 odds.

Easy to learn, hard to master I think is really the best part about Crokinole. The decision tree isn't deep or wide, but there is something fundamentally fun about *playing* the game. It plays fast, it's beautiful to sit and look at, and it's easy to pick up.

It might have lost a little luster due to Carrom but right now neither game is getting much run.  This one however stays stronger in my mind's eye.

Well it dropped to a 9.  Weird how finding another great game (Carrom) might lower your rating.  I'll have to think about how this all works.  Damn.

Crokinole, man! It's so much fun! 

I had been wondering about this game for years. Why does a 'flick your finger' linger in amongst the top games in BGG year after year? But I wonder no more. Yes, the basic premise is very simple but the beef is hidden in the rules. You really have to ponder about the choices and while it is possible for a player to make epic comebacks no matter how dire the situation on the score board or on the table looks like.

The scoring is a bit on the abstract side and it is not always easy to see who is winning the round. This can slow you down at first if you played very seriously. However, most of the time it is quite intuitive to see what you need to do and you do not have to worry too much about the scoring.

I definitely recommend Crokinole to everyone and I am happy to play it any time.

If flicking games were the Greek Gods than Crokinole would be Zeus, father of them all. You flick wooden discs across a varnished round board trying to pip the ace and get them in a small circular goal while also knocking your opponents discs out of the way or off the board. It is great fun and I am always happy to play. I actually payed to have a custome LOTR board that I have been dying to play with at some point...

Finally learned how to play this at BGG Con 2014, and really enjoyed it. Grabbed one of the Mayday ding and dent copies, and it's got a tiny blemish on one edge, probably not enough to affect play. Will need a few more plays before rating, but can definitely see the appeal!

RATING: 9
[2-4] The game itself is just brilliant.  I'll give it a proper rating after a bit more plays.

The board I initially had was by Mayday Games.  The board was not really worth the money and I would rate it a 4/10.

I now have a Hilinski board that is really incredible (the 'jackpot').  The quality is noticeably improved and gameplay is spectacular.  It really does an incredible job of taking what I love with shuffleboard and curling and putting it on the table.  Just incredible!

Almost perfect. The best dexterity game ever. 2 minutes (really!) to understand rules, maybe one life to master every shot. I've got a Willard Pro tournament board, White, black, red and Green discs, carring bag and floor stand.
Quite expensive if you consider that I've spent 118$ for shipping it to Italy, but sure it worth the money!

I'd rather play:  PITCHCAR (accessability)

There's nothing wrong with this game. However, it's just like every other dexterity game except Pitchcar. The gulf in skill can be massive, and if you practice, games just aren't a contest. 

It's a fun game, but if you're not very good, it's traumatic. 

For me, this just proved the brilliance of Pitchcar, with its modularity and safety rails equalising without making skill pointless.

I had two.  Now, which one was my favorite?  That's a toss-up...I received this one -  http://bgg.cc/image/161489 - as a gift, and it definitely held a place of honor in my collection.  It has since been given to the BGG Library for play at BGG.CON.

The other board is a Burgundy Eagle board from www.crokinole.com.  Great board, somewhat fast, nice bumpers, etc.  What makes it special is that my wife gave it to me as a first wedding anniversary gift.

A great Canadian bar type dexterity game.  Very easy to get "dad" (or whatever male non-gamer) to the table.  May work on women, too...but this is one of the few games my father has tried out and absolutely loves.

I bought the ‘Green Eagle tournament’ Crokinole board from Mr Crokinole. It came all the way from Canada, import tax and all. It cost me an arm and a leg (Well my partner and my mother... Thank you!) but a fine board it is! It’s a very addictive game that surprisingly my partner has taken a great interest in. It’s also a good partnership game that will be great for when our gaming couple friends come over. This is just what I was looking for.

I really like this game! Crokinole is one of my alltime favorites games and for now my only 10.
Before Crokinole I got a Carrom board, which a had to repair. I started some training but had to realize that Carrom is not easy to master and it needs a lot of practice to be able to realize controlled shoots.
Finally I decided to buy a Crokinole board, model Wintersonne [url=crokinole.de]Crokinole.de[/url], which is much easier to play even with people who play it for the first time.
With Carrom there is no way to play without serious practice. With Crokinole you can enjoy playing right from the start on (but practise will help also for Crokinole...).
___________________
\_______GER_______/
Habe die Wintersonne im November 2012 erstanden [url=www.crokinole.de] Crocinole.de[/url] und bin ganz begeistert.
Für das sehr große Spielbrett muss man sich schon etwas einfallen lassen wo man es denn lagert wenn man nicht spielt, aber ich habe da eine sehr praktische Lösung gefunden (siehe auch meine Galery). Ich habe es aufrecht an die Wand gestützt aufgestellt und mit Filzstreifen vor Beschädigungen geschützt. 
Mit Carrom Gleitpuder ergibt sich ein deutlich anderes Spielgefühl. Schüsse können damit sehr genau gesetzt werden aber der Krafteinsatz muss auch minimiert werden.
Tolles Spiel!

Great dexterity game. I haven't played that many dexterity games, so this one is my favourite. I'm now aware of the skill that is needed to play it well and from my experience a skilled player will crush a non-experienced player most of the times and it could get frustrating for some people. I love it though and would never turn down a game of crokinole being it two player or multiplayer, great fun!

Simply one of the best finger-flicking games out there.  This is game that will get played simply by setting it out for others to see.  Try placing it on a side table or kitchen island and watch people start playing simply by walking by.  15 minutes later you don't have to ask if they are enjoying it, they are already starting another game.  The cost of admission is steep, but a quality board is worth having around.  If you are handy with tools and woodworking, you can craft your own board, but be prepared for the long hours of work.

As far as dexterity games go, pretty close to perfection, especially with four - it's less interesting with two. The ideal game to play during short breaks at cons.

At the larger game meets, whenever we're waiting for a game to start or waiting for some friends to finish up a game before going out to dinner, we find ourselves constantly looking for the crokinole board.  More a parlor game than a board game, but definately great... also very universal... I find it hard to imagine someone who would not like this game... well, I guess if you had really long fingernails that you spent a lot of time painting.... but otherwise, anyone would love this.  Wish there were more places to buy decent boards.  A lot of places are sold out and on backorder....

Asztali curling... Zseniális! Mindenhol ajnározták, de el nem tudtam képzelni, mi lehet olyan jó egy ügyességi játékban. Megvan a megfejtés: nem lehet abbahagyni! 2 mondat a szabálya, és beszippant, azt veszed észre, hogy "na még egyet, na még egyet", és elment az este vele. Egy parti akár 3-4 perc alatt lepereg, ezért könnyű ottragadni újabb és újabb menetekre:) Ami szuper, hogy szinte nincs elveszett parti, nagyon dinamikusan változhat az állás... Egyébként meg nem csak ügyességi, hanem taktikai is. Ketten is és négyen is nagyon izgalmas, bár teljesen más a hangulata és a nehézsége is, ha csapatok vannak.
Mindenkinek ajánlom, kár hogy Európában ennyire nem elterjedt. Az eddigi legdrágább és legnehezebb (mármint kilóra) játékom, de megérte! Ja és a legnagyobb is: 80x80 cm.

Simple dexterity game.  If there are opponent discs on the board you must hit it with your disc.  If you miss you have to get remove your disc and your other discs if you hit them.  Once everyone plays all of their discs the round is over and each discs gets their respective points depending on how close they are to the center.  The game is a big hit with everyone I have showed to so far, which is at least 15 people so far.  They cannot get enough of it.  As for me, I find it ok.  I find some enjoyment out of it but I don't think I'll ever request for it again, since enough of my friends will.  Normally, I won't keep games in this ranking but I will make an exception.
Rating: 7.

I own a Mayday board and it's shit, the KS campaign was a disaster and I got royally stuffed around in shipping, but it's still unbelievable fun and I'd recommend Crokinole to anyone.

My Mayday board is currently permanently set up at work and gets at least 10 games a day, it's a huge hit in the office. Planning to get a Willard Pro when I can afford it to replace the Mayday.

There's just something classy about Crokinole. It's a dexterity game with strategy; unlike Jenga or Hamsterrolle, I feel like each of my shots is a tactical decision. There's a big barrier to entry, though; it takes a lot of practice before a player can consistently put the puck in the approximate direction they want it to go, and you can actually start playing by the full rules.

An extremely enjoyable team dexterity game that has a lot of strategy involved.  I can see where people may have compared Sorry Sliders to this game, but this is like the next tier up in complexity.  The challenge arises from 2 things:  The requirement to hit your opponent's piece, and the little posts protecting the center.

I will gladly play this game any time someone suggests it.  However, I don't feel quite so much of that "must have" desire that I originally was hit with when I heard about the game.  It seems that the cost of getting a nice board is just too much for such a simple game.  Although i would love to own a board, it just seems that i can get a similar experience at a much cheaper price.

An outstanding flicking game, lots of laughs and a great deal of skill needed. I am even tempted to say "better than pitchcar" which is high praise indeed.

Best with 4, OK with 2.

* One of the great things about Crokinole is that it is like Pool; it is very easy for somebody to be introduced to the game and very quickly to reach a passable level where they can have some great shots come off, yet skill still shines through.

It's a dexterity game with a sprinkle of strategy once as you suss out what shots your opponent has trouble with.

Fun flicking game. I enjoy the game but I think it would really hum if it is played in partnerships.  More plays and it might reach Pitchcar for me.  This might be more accessable to people than Pitchcar (as it's just a game, not a race).

Update: now a 10.  Who am I kidding, I love the game.  Great with two and great with partners. 

Update: June 2012 - Just broke the 200 barrier on games played since I bought it.  Best game investment I have made (and I have made a lot).  We have *just* started to track stats on shots at the hole.  Boy, that has ramped up the fun for me, at least.  Planning on hosting my first tournment this fall, even.   

April 2017 - yeah, still a 10.  This November will be our fifth annual Fall Classic tournament...we are starting to pull in 20+ players and we have the availability of 10 boards.  

My board is a Hilinski:  Big Top - this board has sold at least 5 other boards from people who played.  

It's a true classic game.

GREAT dexterity game that can be played by anyone! The rules are fairly simple and the game is a lot of fun!

My Hilinski board is Birch with a honey stain on the deck and java on the ditch/rails. In the 20-hole is a piece of cocobolo wood. It's name is "Mixed Blessing" and was made in August 2012.

At some point I really want to get another board. Whether it's hilinski or another homemade board. I like that they are as much art as they are a functional game board!

Interesting.  I appreciate the tactical aspect of having to hit the opponent's piece, but I'm so uncoordinated that serious dexterity games are not really my thing.  Wish I could love this more!

UPDATE: Broke down and got a gorgeous Hilinski board that now hangs on my kitchen wall.  I'm looking forward to playing it often enough that I might be able to suck less at it!

Crokinole is a fantastic dexterity game that can be explained in one minute and enjoyed by family and gamers alike. Nearly unbeatable at family gatherings. After years of wishing for my own copy, I ordered a board from the Hilinski Brothers: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1431570/crokinole]Elephantasy[/url].

I like it.
A round doesn't last that long, it is easy to play but still somehow tactical. It's a nice two player alternative.

I can see how there are tournaments for this game.

This is the perfect flicking game for me.
It is strategic (as far as your flicking skills allow) and has a short playtime. I appreciate that it doesn't want to be more than it is, but I guess this comes from its age...and still despite for being an "old" game this really is an awesome game.
For the longer sessions or for more players I'll set up PitchCar (Carabande) for a nice relaxing round? Crokinole.

Few games recently have had me wanting to play them again, but this is one of them!   Looks like the type of thing where years of hard study is required to become a great player.  Might have to pick up a board for play with the family...

The grand-daddy of dexterity games... There are few feelings as viscerally satisfying as landing the perfect shot that catapults your opponent off the board and lands you in the bullseye. Also, as much as it is an easy game to pick up and play, there is a considerable measure of skill involved.

I must admit that I may be a bit biased, however, given that I've been playing this game at family functions since I was a little tyke. As a result, even just thinking about Crokinole suffuses my mind with a warm glow of happy memories.

I now have the Ferti board and 4 sets of 12 discs from www.crokinole.de. I replaced the Ferti discs with the Crokinole.de dics because the Ferti discs became rough quite soon.
This combo is great the board is very good for its price and the Crokinole.de dics are fast.
All in all a great set for an reasonable price.

This game is one of my favorite games and is also loved at my gaming club. I don't rate games at 10 easily but this Crokinole deserves a 10.

Excellent dexterity game. Makes me wish I was raised in Canada.  :-)
My board was lovingly (and expertly) made by my awesome father-in-law for my birthday. :D
I just spent the entire Labor Day playing 2-player, 3-player and 4-player crokinole (with a minor foray into PiratenBilliards)... Truly a brilliant day.

Whenever I visit the Canadian side of the family, the Crokinole boards come out. Excellent flicking fun!

I have a cheap Mad Hatter board that I ordered from Amazon.com. The surface is imitation wood, but it's smooth and even. The disks from my copy are good, and overall it's a decent value, but the plastic pegs are pretty flimsy. I'm tempted to replace them with padded screws right away. For anyone with a bigger budget, I'd really recommend getting a nice board from the start, but for $30 and a few metal screws, the Amazon board is great for the gamer on a budget. I also have a Carrom board with a Crokinole board on the back, but it's not nearly as nice to play on as a regular board.

3/18/2013 update: I got a copy of the Mayday Cherry 4th edition board, along with white, red, green and blue sets of extra disks. I like it quite a bit.

Pretty much the gold standard as far as dexterity flicking game go.  Simple rules, but very effective at creating good, tense matches with lots of make or break shots.

Anyone can play Croinole, from little kids to old farts, and have fun, but some experience definitely pays off in this one!

The only drawback is the cost to own, as you're essentially buying a small piece of furniture.  A decent board will run at least $150.  I own a Hilinksi board, which is a very reliable maker of quality Crokinole boards.

This is, make no mistake, a skill game. And the difference between a great player and a new player is enormous. So, as far as replayability goes, I am unlikely to plateau my skill at this game any time soon.

But that doesn't mean anything if the game is bad. And I suspect one of the things that makes this game so good is that there is room for great plays (like knocking out an opposing players piece and scoring the centre), and the game offers immediate feedback. As soon as you flick, you know what you did right and what you did wrong.

Also, dexterity games offer a kinetic experience as well as the mental one.

This all sounds kind of jumbled and unclear, I know, but this is a game that I'm having trouble putting into words why I like it. My guess is, is that the physical aspect is what makes it so. It's easy to use my mind to describe why mental games are fun, but harder for why physical games are fun.

Simple rules, fast paced, nice quick playing time (or longer, if you like!), tons of screwage and lots of skill involved. The nice thing is that although the game can be quite brutal since only one person/team scores each round, it's really easy to catch up and the game can swing back into someone else's favor in just a round. I'm completely addicted. I'm not sure I COULD turn down a game.

Crokinole is a game I’ve been intrigued about for years. I never got why people would pay a huge amount of money and why they would decorate their game room with this game board, but having played almost 30 rounds in April, I can see the potential. It really is strangely addictive, which my numerous plays testify!

I haven’t tried a lot of dexterity games (except for “speed games” which I’ve tried a bunch of), and while it’s certainly not my even close to my favorite gaming category, Crokinole was a big, positive surprise. While I won’t buy a board myself (it’s just too expensive and big), I would almost always play a round or two. Edit some years later: I got a copy, BUT it is the cheap plastic version which costs MUCH less (and also isn't as good, obviously).

You can play to 100 points and all that, but in my opinion the strength of Crokinole is that you can play a round or two while you’re waiting for other players to finish their games, or if you have a few minutes to spare. I just record one game with the 2x12 discs as one play here on BGG, but to be honest the score doesn’t really matter too much in this game. It’s all about the quick fun! Oh, by the way, it’s a cool rule that once you’re sitting in your seat, you have to remain seated there with one cheek on the chair.

A very interested game, and definitely fun.  We didn't play on a totally official $100 board, but it was close enough.

I can understand why some consider [gameid=37196] to be a poor man's Crokinole, because the mechanics are relatively similar.  However, with "chutes" rather than an open board, the conversion in rules would require some tweaking.

Overall, I decent game, but like [gameid=327], I don't know what the long-term fuss is all about.  Count me as a "mediocre" enjoyer of this game.

EDIT:  08/05/16 - the more I play this game, the more I like it.  I think that is because the only person I play it with is kind of a "Crokinole" connoisseur, and I think he now owns 8 different, very high quality boards.  I really like playing the game with him, so I am starting to enjoy the game itself more than before.

To me, this game is like a good single-malt scotch - it's an "acquired" taste.

Being a non-traditional american, my favorite team sport to watch over healthy doses of beer and whiskey is Curling. Stop laughing -- it's a damned complex sport when you get down to it. Until I see you on the ice giving it a try, you keep your mouth shut. It's truly Scottish. (Golf was invented by an Englishman in Scotland.) It's also the one sport that plays, in my opinion, like a boardgame.Crokinole? It's the only board game that I know of that plays similarly to Curling. Unfortunately, I haven't played this one yet.. but am looking forward to it.

On total faith that I would enjoy this game, I received a new crokinole board from Mr. Crokinole as a Christmas gift. Needless to say, I'm very excited to give this a shot. It may not be a Hilinski board, but I'm very happy with the quality.

Crokinole is the ultimate flicking game. You can teach it to anyone, and you can play it as light or as serious as you like. I've seen videos you YouTube that will convince anyone this can be as skills-driven as billiards. And though I'm not even close to that skill level, it's impressive to have that degree of depth to uncover should folks want to pursue it. When dexterity is involved, you never have to worry about "solving" the game.

After 30+ plays, it's easy to rate this game a 10. This will always be in my collection, and I can't ever see myself tiring of this game.

I find it difficult to rate this game. I like the idea of a dinner-table sized game about flicking discs with your finger; it's also a beautiful illustration of classical mechanics. For the same reason I can also stare for some time at a game of bowls or billiards. There are fine motorical skills to be mastered here alongside the heuristics of 2-body collisions. 

But I just suck at those motor skills to the point of fouling up at least half my shots. I spend a few relaxed counts aiming and positioning my fingers, and *poof*, the disc moves about a centimeter, or slides away with eery precision at an angle I most certainly did not intend, or occasionally even slams into my opponent's face. I truly have no idea what goes on at the moment of impact, nor am I able to figure out what I need to do to make my shots more reliable. Yes, practice on my own for hours and hours until I find a comfortable position of my fingers which allows for some control, but it goes without saying that I cannot start such a practice session once someone expresses interest in playing a game with me. Consequently, there is just no point in playing further about halfway through. All of my discs have been expertly ditched, while all of the discs of my opponents are clogging the interior circle, in sofar they haven't been pocketed already. The [i]game[/i] of Crokinole has ended at that point, and I see no point in prolonging the agony for either of us at that moment.

Perhaps I should just leave the game unrated.

I own two copies of Crokinole.  The first one I have had since ~1970 and have played it all of my life.  The second one was made by Grandpa Etling.
For practice as a kid I would see how many 20s I could score out of 12 tries, keeping all misses on the board.  My best score was 6.
A few decades ago I improved my technique by making sure my shooting finger was perpendicular to the board.  It helps.
I have a problem with the yips though.  It's hard to shoot consistent weight when shooting for 20s.

[b]What I like:[/b] that this can be taken as seriously or as silly as needed depending on audience.  It is a game from my childhood that has evolved into a guilty pleasure game to close out the evening.

[b]What I dislike:[/b] too many regional rules.  I like to keep it simple, and only count wins and losses, go to an agreed upon number of wins.  I like 2 players, and 2 teams, but not a 3/4 free-for all, too chaotic.

[b]Colour Blindness:[/b] not really - so long as the pieces are clearly different colours

[b]Other Notes:[/b] I have a great custom board from Dennis Shmorong.

This gets a 10 because it is one of the few games that I can get both my wife and son to play. My son is young nd just getting into games and my wife normally doesn't play anything. However, she is willing to play this one and everyone enjoys it. My son calls this his second favorite game (his favorite is Cube Quest, another dexterity game with a strategic flavor) so I can I rate this anything other than a 10?

It helps to be playing on a beautiful Hilinski board (Awake Before Dawn).

Honestly, I don't think it fits here on BGG. It may be a board, it may be a game, but I don't think it is a boardgame. :)  Why aren't ping-pong and pool in BGG (the standard games)?
I played it at a Con while waiting to get in another game.  It was ok.  But I don't think I'd seek it out again...especially with so many real boardgames waiting to be played.

This is a fun, light dexterity game that I enjoy and  expect to be able to play fairly regularly (as in almost any time someone came to visit our apartment). It didn't take a lot to convince myself (and Minerva) that we should get a copy. What makes it so special? I honestly am not familiar enough with dexterity games to say beyond that it was pretty easy to get into and was engaging without being particularly complicated which is something that rarely works with me. I really enjoyed it and now have my own, custom board:

Crokinole. This is going to be a positive review. Firstly a few caveats, do you like dexterity games? If you feel like you've never played one we are talking about games that feature physical skill rather than primarily mental skill, and also a decree of luck. I'd say Pool was a dexterity game. Could you store a circular piece of wood in like the one shown in your home? If the answer to both is yes, I recommend getting yourself a crokinole board immediately. Game plays excellently with both four and two.

RATING: 10
My favorite dexterity game, and one of my favorite games.   It is super addicting.  Sort of a indoor horseshoe/shuffleboard combo.  Simple to set up and easy to learn.  Subtle strategy, but mainly a game of skill.  It is pretty much a perfect game.  It costs more than most games for a good board, but it is worth it.  

This game earned it's "10" with me.  It started lower rated (8), but after several plays, I realized I always want to play this game.

A game I had heard of, but never played until I joined BGG.  I then played on a friend's board (I met on BGG), and I knew I had to have one.

I finally got a Mr. Crokinole Eagle Board when I turned 40, and I use it frequently.  I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it, once they try it.

I also use this as a party game when not everyone wants to play a game (IE: Superbowl party, etc.), and it is always hit.

One of the participants in the recent Counter Magazine Weekend had hand-made a beautiful Crokinole board which I was lucky enough to buy.  And I am so glad I did.  This reminds me of Carom, the Indian game, but it is more fun.  Can’t believe it has taken me this long to discover it.

RATING: 9
Board purchased from the iconic Hilinski Bros. Very proud owner of unique board: "Dervish."

Even though I'd seen pictures of this game, I was still surprised at how large the board was when it arrived. I finally dropped the big bucks on a good Hilinski board, even though I'd never played the game. This is by far the most expensive game in my collection and I haven't yet regretted the purchase or the large expense for a quality board. Not only does it play beautifully, but it hangs very attractively on the wall in my dining room.

This is a light dexterity game that seems to have a lot more depth and strategy than you would think from reading the rules. It's just a lot of fun to smack your opponents' discs off the board. My favorite move is one where I hit an opponent's disc off that was resting outside the center circle, yet leave my own ricochet inside for the big points.

For some reason, this game strikes me as a pub game. Of course, I haven't brought it with me to a pub to try it out, but I always make sure to have a beer alongside when playing this game to make up for it.

Flick those discs!  I think Crokinole is the best dexterity game I've played.  The rules are simple, the play is engaging (particularly when playing a 4 player partnership game), and there is skill involved.  There isn't a huge learning curve to the game, so it's easy for new players to pick it up and start having fun.  I think it's more worthwhile to get a high quality board from Muzzies, Mr. Crokinole or the Hilsinki brothers, than cheaper boards from someone like Mayday games.  Yes, this will run you about $200 for a nice board, but it looks nice hanging from a wall and I bet you will get more plays out of Crokinole than many others in your collection.  Highly recommended!

It's a classic dexterity game some have described as shuffleboard for the tabletop, which is a fair comparison.

Fun finger-flicking dexterity game.  Despite the higher than average cost, this is one of the best value games of all time, in terms of the amount of hours played.  Have a quality board made by [url=http://www.muzzies.ca]Muzzies[/url].

Can also use Crokinole discs to play [gameid=65565] on any table.

There are very few table top games that one can enjoy with pleasant banter, a few drinks, and general relaxation and still remain fully engaged in the game.  That is Crokinole.  There is no such thing as a game of this without laughter, groans, and a solid good time.

Flicking wooden disks slightly hurts my fingers.  Also I am not super great with the hand-eye coordination.  Seriously, I am utterly terrible at all games that involve flicking small objects.

This is a no-brainer for rating.  An excellent sit down dexterity game that can be played with any age, & which allows conversation.  Quick, simple rules.  Fun & addicting. The only strike against it, must be played with either 2 or 4 players--either in teams or as individuals since I ordered 2 more sets of pucks in different colors. 3 doesn't work well on my board although there are 3-player boards.  A good board is way too expensive, but what handsome boards they are.

O famoso jogo de petelecos. Muito divertido. O tabuleiro é de madeira circular com alguns pequenos pinos na região central. Cada jogador deve dar petelecos em seus discos tentando remover os discos do adversário e posicionando seus discos mais ao centro possível. No final, quanto mais próximos ao centro do tabuleiro seus discos estiverem mais pontos você ganha. Muito divertido.

7/7/2015-The reason I enjoy this game is that the board we have is not slick at all which makes it very interesting and challenging.
But if you have a standard board it is the aiming and bouncing off the posts to make insane shots is why it is interesting ,so no matter which board you have it's going to a really fun game(in my humble opinion).Oh and by the way my score is a 8.4.dc

A wonderful old-world classic. A lovely mix of skill and strategy with little room for luck (although some shots do appear to be luckier then others), exactly what I love in any game. 

For me, I get a very similar satisfaction from this game as I do from playing pool, but thankfully it's much cheaper and doesn't monopolize an entire room of my house.

Have to eat my words on this one--turns out Crokinole is a hell of a lot of fun.  Dex games still aren't my cup of tea but get a beer in your hand and play this with some friends and you're going to have a good time.

Still, if Pool, Foosball, and other games like that don't belong on BGG, neither does this one.  But from now on I won't hold it against this game.

One of my absolute favorite games.  I bought a board not knowing what to expect, but something in the game just clicked with me. It's addicting. This may become my first 10 if my wife begins to enjoy it as much as I do.  She plays but gets a little frustrated with me when I'm on a hot streak... 

My parents have played this game hundreds of times, making it easily the most played of "Trevor's games" by anyone besides me!

Crokinole is a must-have dexterity game and might be one of my favourites of the genre purely because my dad said he'd play it (he won't play ANYTHING!).  Simple on the surface, but the constant battle between sides has a very easy-going, screw-your-opponent feel.  Many games that have this kind of conflict never felt so freewheeling. Lots of room to practice and get better but it's also a great game to play for the unpracticed (though certainly more frustrating).  Takes up a wall space to store, but a pretty board can be art. (I have myself a Muzzies - a very beautiful board and well crafted.)

The absolute king of dexterity games- nothing comes close.

A fond nostalgic memory from an Australian boy's adventures in a Canadian winter, along with skidoos, skiing and home smoked salmon (mmmmm).

First foray into dexterity games, feels unlike boardgames really; more like a mini-sport (ping pong kinda deal). Lots of fun and quick. Makes me feel like I'm 10 years old which is a blast.

Fast and simple enough, too old for me to feel like I can critique it.

Excellent dexterity game with a nice ruleset. Flick your pieces towards the center. First shot must end up in the center otherwise your opponent goes. Every turn, if your opponent has at least 1 piece on the board you MUST touch one of the opponent's pieces with your piece. At the end of the round you add up your points based on the final resting place of your pieces. The winner gets a number of points equal to the difference between the two players' board score. Lovely game you can play endlessly, just enough strategy to keep your brain working but the luck of the flick keeps it from getting too serious. The game deserves its longevity.

Fantastic nostalgic game.  The board I got from Lee Valley is quite nice, and the price was right.  It has a very good quality play surface and playing pieces, though there are a couple of spots on the plywood surface that didn't absorb the finishing wax quite as well because of the grain, so it might need another coat or two to get the surface really smooth.  I say this, but I didn't notice it having any affect on the playability, really.  Not as fancy as some of the custom boards I've seen, but compared to other boards available for the same price (130$) or less, I think this is still a great investment.

finally got around to playing this at TBGT 2006.  Instantly hooked.  I then had a board made by Carl and Stan Hilinski, which is a thing of beauty.  This is a wonderful dexterity game involving flicking discs towards the center of a set of concentric rings. Play is similar to curling, another Canadian activity, the sport that everyone loves to poke fun at.  The key rule that makes this such a great game (IMHO) is that if your opponent has any discs on the playing surface on your shot, you must hit one of them.  Otherwise, your shooting disc, as well as any of your discs you hit during your shot, are removed from the playing surface.

Crokinole is a Canadian classic, combining the elements of finger dexterity and elementary strategy. Like curling or marbles, the underlying principles are simple: shoot your discs as close to the bullseye as possible and knock your opponents discs out of play.

The concept is deceptively simple but the moves are rather complex, requiring a situational knowledge of how the discs will act physically and being able to exert enough control to execute your flick flawlessly. There will be moments of frustration when you miss a crucial shot. Yet, those mistakes are inconsequential to the joy of executing a shot with a slim margin of error.

The game can be taught in less than five minutes. Furthermore, players will see improvement in their play over the course of a single round! When you can play with 2, 3, or 4 players, setting up a pick-up game becomes entirely too easy.

My only gripe is that the board is difficult to transport with its sheer diameter. However, it's definitely worth the hours of enjoyment you will derive from an evening of Crokinole!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sublime.  The day I got this, we played for hours.  Your family will love this, most of your gamer friends will too.  My wife, who doesn't like many games at all, enjoyed it from the first time we played and kept wanting to play more games.  This is definitely a game for the "wife games" type geeklists.

The first night I got it I played my cousin for 3-4 hours.  A few days later, I tried it on the wife and we played for over two hours even though I was beating her nearly every game.  We stopped because we had to eat!  That tells you two things.  One, this is a great game, and two, i'm not smart enough to realize when I should let my wife win.

This is an excellent game in every way.  Many complain about the price but if you look at the board purchase as a sort of furniture/family heirloom purchase in addition to being a game.  You will probably play this more often than 3 $50 games because it is easy, fun, and fast.  The boards are also beautiful if you get them from a craftsman.  I can't recommend the hilinski boards enough.  The boards are without compare.  They ship fast, are packed well, are reasonably priced compared to similar crokinole boards.  and look like a million bucks.

You also can't go wrong with Mr. Crokinole.  Wayne Kelly is the definitive source for crokinole products and information.  I bought some new discs from him and talked to him for 20 minutes about board maintenance and the game in general.  Great guy - highly recommended.

Collection: I own a homemade board that works pretty well actually.
There is real strategy here, rare for a dexterity game. Deciding how and when to hit your opponent's pieces can make you spend as much time planning the shot as actually lining it up and flicking. Even so, while I like games that reward learning the strategies, I am not a fan of board games that simply reward practice, which this one clearly does. You might even say it requires it. Nevertheless, even a first time player can get lucky and win. This game strikes a good balance for me, and is so simple to teach.

Finally got around to trying this, and yeah, it's pretty good. Always having to hit another player's piece keeps things from getting stale, and those dastardly pegs keep the challenge high. Quick moving and quite fun. I'm not sure it could ever warrant the prices it goes for, but I'd probably always be happy to play with someone else's. It's easy to spend a lot of time playing "just one more."

I can't get enough of this game.  Some of my earliest memories involve playing this game with my cousins and grandparents, who had a board made in the days of my great-grandparents (or earlier).

I recently purchased a competition-level board and enjoy playing it with family and friends.  Unfortunately I have trouble getting it to the table as no one wants to challenge me (I tend to win against anybody I know...), but whenever I get the opportunity, I'm quick to pull it out and start flicking!

Purchased my board from Owl's Hollow, PEI, in January 2008.

First played May 8th, 2007.  This is a very quick learn and a quick play.  There is some agility to this one.  There is an element of strategy to it, however it's more of a hands on game.  The play of the game is a lot of fun.  It reminds me somewhat of shuffleboard as you try to knock off your players' pawns and score your own.  I'd recommend giving this one some game plays.  It seems it is an additive type game as well.

Stan & Carl Hilinski's board "Old Scratch."

This is probably the easiest ten I've ever given.  Crokinole is a relatively quick, satisfying dexterity game that rewards skill and encourages that "one more game" feeling.  There is quite a bit of strategy to disk placement and tempo can shift on any one shot.  I would argue Crokinole is the *best* dexterity game out there at this point considering all the others I have played.  Great fun, very engaging.  I must give credit to the Hilinski's too; my board is gorgeous and really sucks you in (almost like you're playing on a lavish air hockey table or something).  Love it.

Almost instant 10 from me.  It's a flicking game with a great balance of skill and strategy.

The board layout is just great.  As is the rules about having to hit an opponent's piece.

There is risk and reward since you can try to combo off your own pieces, but if you fail they all get removed.

And then there's the glory of playing with a partner.  And a fun scoring system that allows for huge comebacks.


Win win win win.

The game this most reminds me of is Corona, and this seems to be a smaller and handier version of that. They don't work quite the same though so I guess if you are into classic dexterity games and have the room you could want both.

This game is one of the few in the "dexterity" class that I truly enjoy.  I hate card games where you must slam down a card, I hate stacking games like jenga, but I love games such as this, pool, and others in the arena of "lining up your shot"  

Update: Purchased a Mr. Crokinole board

A dexterous, skill contest. Very accessible due to most people's innate ability to flick their finger, but without strategy or tactics, an adept player can quickly demoralize an inept opponent who overestimates their abilities.

Crokinole is the granddaddy of all dexterity games. It's a little like the child of darts and pool, but it's easier to master than either of those games. It it wasn't so difficult or expensive to find a Crokinole board I think this game would be much more popular than it is. I could see this being an amazing pub game.

I haven't got the slightest idea what people see in this...
How on earth could it be in bgg's top 50?..

It's simple, fun maybe for the first 5-10 minutes and that's it.  From this point it's repetitive and boring.  It's just waay to simple.

Pitchcar Mini is equally simple knocking wooden discs with fingers.  But it is fun.  Crokinole ISN'T.

Rating strictly for fun level, very light strategy and severe screwage! :) 

The game is very fun and it is a shame my wife can't win and hates me every time I knock one of her pieces flying thus doesn't like it as much or I would buy this in a second. One of the best dexterity games for 2 people although 3 could play with a new color (and a few less pieces each) and 4 as teams....hmmm sounds like a good selling feature to convince the wife...

Things I don't like:

- Its size!

RATING: 10
He shoots, he scooooooooores!!!! The best filler/dexterity game out there, also the least portable!  Very much enjoyed by adults and absolutely loved by teens in our game group and our church youth group. I'd also recommend the dexterity game "Le Passe Trappe" if you enjoy Crokinole. I recent found that we were playing incorrectly but I'll call it a variant and continue playing that way. Our rule is that you MUST hit the opponent FIRST and not as a combo. It makes you take the hard shots.  Get your board at hilinski.net

Update: The finish on my board is actually wearing out right in the middle of each player area!  I take this to every game night I have and it's played often.  There are two ways I play it depsending on the crowd and the speed I want each game to be. One is classic rules, play a round and the team with the higher total will score the difference in points.  If I want to really speed things up, say when there are 5+ people wanting to play, we total actual points and then a game averages only 2-4 rounds.  This give people a taste of the game and allows onthers to get into (and out of) a game quicker.

RATING: 7
I used to think I didn't like dexterity games, but I like Crokinole and games like it, so clearly there's a subcategory of dexterity games I do like.  I guess you could call it the "token flicking subcategory" that I like.  Dexterity games that involve balancing or dexterity or speed elements, on the other hand, are not likely to be favorites.  As I type this in late 2011, it's been a long time since I've played Crokinole, but I've been thinking that I should make an effort to get it to the table again.

This is a great game you can play with just about anybody on the planet. You could even form league nights if you wanted.

In some ways, it reminds me of local bars out in farm lands of my youth that had wood skittle bowling things, table top shuffle boards, and other home constructed games to play while drinking an ice cold mountain dew (with the straw chomping hillbilly on the bottle) against an old timer drinking the high life in the grain belt.

Fantastic!

Flick the pieces into the right rings for points. It's like shuffleboard for fingers, but with a round board, barriers and enough of a physical challenge it makes winning a challenge.

BIG PLUS: physical, attention keeping, goes fairly quick
MINUS: can go a bit too quick

WARNING!!!! Be prepared to spend on this one. Cheap boards are warped or lack the appropriate surface to get the right momentum when you flick your wooden pieces.

It's an amazing game, 2P or 4P, though I prefer it with 4.  The beauty of the board (guess which one is mine!) only adds to the experience.  If you get the chance to try it sometime, please do, even if you've never played a dexterity/flicking game before.  It's wonderful fun!

I brought a Pro-XL board from miracleventures.ca (now out of business), and it's beautiful. The game is very enjoyable, but the flicking skill takes some time to develop, so consider some house rules to make it easier for newbies. Overall, it boils down to the fact that the game is just very very fun, and making a tricky shot is quite rewarding.

Flick the pieces with the first one having to go in the center. After that pieces must hit a competitors piece to stay in. There is lots of strategy required in selecting what piece(s) to hit and lots of skill needed to do this. Scoring is 15, 10, and 5 from center to outer ring with a 20 for going in the center hole.

I think Squad Seven and Modern Art are the only other games I've rated a 9 after playing once.  Crokinole met my already high expectations as being a very approachable, yet not mindless, dexterity game.  The partnership aspect makes it even more engaging.  If only those boards weren't so expensive and bulky!

Update: Purchased a Hilinski board - it's called Thunderstruck.

Update 6/10: After regular play on my board, I have to make this my first 10.  I hope this becomes a family favorite as my kids get older.  We may have to buy another board!

Hey,
What if we combined shuffleboard and marbles and passed it off as the great new thing.  That's basically what this game is, but shuffleboard is still better.  Unfortunately, its hard to fit a shuffleboard on your dining room table.  I'll be the first to admit dexterity games aren't really my thing, so I'm probably the wrong market for this game.  If you want to play a dexterity game, get off your ass and go play some basketball or something.

I was skeptical at first about this.  I made my own board, and brought it out.  We've been playing primarily 4 player games and love it.  It has a surprising amount of strategy for such a seemingly simple game.

Appeals to a very wide age range.  Very light, very quick, and very fun.  Improves with more plays.

Homemade from Hilinski directions--This game is so much finer than it would seem at first glance.  It is very tactical and both luck and skill can be admired.  Threading the needle to make that last desperate shot to win the round happens more often than would seem statistically probable, but there it is, greatness in game design.

My favorite dexterity game.  More practiced player has better chances to win, but not as much as in pool/billiards since you can't "run" the balls.  A good board will cost you over $100 and is huge (often hanging over the edges of your kitchen table), which is the main distractor for me to own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In my experience, this game appeals to everyone, from gamer geeks to complete non-gamers. The rules are few and easy to comprehend, so people learn the game in seconds. Games are fast, no one has to wait, and play time is quick, so the spectators get their chance to play quickly too. And so addictive. You can invite your friends over for a gaming weekend, and this game will be in use for the entire time. Only loses a point because skill level makes such a difference.

RATING: 10
Best for 2 or 4 players.  Better than Carabande!  Just be sure to play on a better quality board, the rich wood appointments are a large part of the pleasure in this game.  Just like pool or darts, this is a game where you build skill.  Making difficlt shots is very rewarding.

Easily my favorite "dexterity" game.  But more than just that, easily one of my favorite games.

I get why some people really like it but I grew up with a pool table so if I want to aim or bounce pieces off of others I just can't get into this game vs. alternatives.  And if I want to actually flick things there are just other more interesting flicking games.

Finger flickin' fun! It's an easy to learn fast paced game of skill, dexterity, and tactics. It seems like everyone enjoys the tactile pleasure of smacking an opponent's disk into the ditch while trying to deflect their own disk towards the best scoring area or a good defensive position. Standard rules for 2 player and 4 player (with two teams) work great but I also really enjoy the 3 & 4 player no-team variant discussed here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/192278.

I loved crokinole as a kid, but I haven't played it in years. I'm afraid part of the appeal may have just been that I was told it was my father's favourite game though as I do remember I disliked my finger hurting after flicking disk after disk. I just hope to find a similar quality board some day.

i never gave a ten and I don't think I ever will.
Price for me is about 60% higher than you would pay for it in the states. But when I saw it and played it I knew it was well worth the price.
My board is North Star made in june by Carl and Stan.

The board is an absolute work of art and craftmanship.
It plays lightning fast and is a thrill to play


record 20/21 (twenty games streak ended 80-100 agains Steven)
record 38/42 (lost two more games against Steven and one against Rhode. I lost two games on the same day and it was my hand position that was wrong. Fixed it)

UPDATE MAY 2010
I don't play it as often as I thought I would.
therefor I lowered rating to a nine.
There are other games I want to play. You won't see me refusing an offer to play,...ever

Outstanding! What a great game. Very good game for two, but amazing experience when played with four (partnership game). If you have played carabande or pitchcar and liked them, then you will love this one. Crokinole is SO much better than any dexterity games I've ever played. The board is quite expensive, but worth of money (my own board is called 'Blue Moon' and bought from Crokinole Companions (www.crokinole.de).

RATING: N/A
This game is like shuffleboard in the round. Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions. The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward. Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game. There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years.

An outstanding flicking/dexterity team game of high skill and high interaction.  I always enjoy playing with Crok veterans and newbies alike...   

I'm the proud owner of a Death Star crok board. One of very few that were handcrafted and custom ordered.  [Yes, it is more than fantastic art, it plays like a regulation tournament board.]

LIKE:

* What isn't there to like about flicking little discs across a board?
* This game rewards practice and trick shots.  Dexterity with strategy as placement of the discs is key.
* Plays well with people of all ages - simple rules.
* Really enjoy this one with four with two teams of two.
* Boards made by professionals are a beautiful work of art which can/should be hung on a wall!  Mayday boards, on the other hand, should be avoided.

DISLIKE:

* Can't think of anything!

Probably the closest I will ever get to owning a pinball machine or a pool table. Combines elements of curling, marbles, pinball, pool (yep, no kidding). Fun dexterity game. Allows for skillful trick shots (with practice). Good all-around family or group game (2 or 4 Players). The trick is buying a quality, hand-made board and it will cost you (tip - avoid the boards by Mayday Games and other mass produced boards).

RATING: 8.5
As my formative years were mostly spent around the green felt of a Subbuteo table and my university desk was more likely to be covered by a carrom board than a textbook I have been waiting to play this game for years.  From my first impression Crokinole is significantly lighter than Carrom as you do not not need such a range of shots at your disposal or such control over your piece (this is before I saw some incredible clips on YouTube).  But this is its strength; there is still room for strategy (which encourages replay value), trick shots and importantly the learning curve is not as great as Carrom so even in the first few games you will not be blown away by an experienced player (well not always).  Crockinole is a game I would like to play regularly and probably will as I can see it being a part of gaming nights with newbies where Carrom I would be reluctant to introduce.

Comments entered on 03 Apr 2010:

Crokinole is a dexterity game that plays very quickly. Despite the simplicity of components and rules, the game has a depth to it that is related to the ability of the player to flick their discs effectively.

I had never played this game before working at Fantasy Flight Games. James Torr had a board that he brought to work and for quite a while it was the lunch time game to play.

In February 2010, I pre-ordered a board from Mayday Games but I am still awaiting its arrival. I look forward to playing this game actively again.

A dexterity game where you flick disks on a board and if you end up in the center you score points automatically.  Otherwise, you try and knock your opponents disks out of scoring position and leave yours in a good scoring position.

Beautiful board from the Hilinksi brothers, named "Beauchamps."  Plus a gong bag for protection, storage, and transport.

You only use a tiny bit each time and will likely find that you don't have to wax it that often for it to retain it's coat. There IS a correct amount to use. If you are using a tooth paste squeeze amount you're using way too much.

Never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd really love a dexterity game.  But this one rocks.  Highly interactive--you actually MUST hit an opponent's piece on your turn.  The rubber bumpers on the pegs keep it extra lively, but it is still a skill game--those who play carefully will do better than those who just slam discs into each other. Good with two, better with four.  Fun for gamers and non-gamers: my dad HATES board games and bought this immediately after I introduced him to it. Just a blast.

I grew up with this game.  It was kind of fun as a child, and I can see the appeal to casual adult board gamers.  I knew it as "table top curling" while growing up (of course, we called it Crokinole though).  The most lasting memory I have of it, is really, really painful fingers after playing.

RATING: 8.5
Outstanding game by any set of rules. The combination of dexterity, suspense, and action-/reactionary play here aren't matched by many games. 

I love the strict rules that don't let anyone but the active player move a muscle. The juxtaposition between dead silent laser-focus and whooping cheers makes this game a blast for anyone. I liked Carrom more when I was a teen, but Crokinole has long since overshadowed it. It's simple and intuitive, but has a very long and steep curve to mastery. Why isn't it found in more bars and gaming venues? Beats me, but... hey, their loss.

I don't have a 'favorite' game and am not a 'favorites' sort of person, but rather try to appreciate things for what they are. However, if pressed to pick a favorite from my BGG list, it'd be this game. But that's assuming equally competent and sporting players to play regularly, which I unfortunately don't have. 

If I give anything a 9.5 or 10, it's because that game has managed to be as fun with 1-2 players as Crokinole is with a decent-sized group. It IS fun to play in a golf or practice-billiards sort of manner, and it's fun to set goals and pars to try to reach - but this is really a group game. 

Great for parties and casual settings. It's the mezcal of board games: it is for both good times and bad.

Got my Hilinski board about a year ago.  It looks beautiful on the wall and is always a conversation piece when people come over.  It's always fun to yank it off the wall and start flicking discs.  Even the most staunchly anti-gamer will enjoy a few rounds of Crok.

It's easily one of the most fun "dexterity" games on the market.

I can think BGG.Con 2011 for this purchase.  I swear I spent 5+ hours at the Crok boards flicking discs until my fingers bled!

I have fond memories of playing Crokinole at my grandmother's cottage.  It is a simple dexterity game whereby players attempt to flick their disks past pins and into the centre hole of the board for points.  There is strategy however, because not only are you going for that centre area, but you are also trying to block your opponents disks from getting there.

Crokinole was created in Ontario c. 1876.  Nearly 140 years later it's still going strong.  It's a great game that young and old can easily get into.

It's great at 2 or 4 players, 3 not so much.

Game in a Nutshell: Players flick discs on a big circle board trying to knock the opponents pieces off and keep your own in the central scoring circles.

Played as: 2,4 player

Pros: Very adaptable game. Can be played as a brainless flicking game or a more tactical area control dexterity depending on how the players want to approach it. Very easy to teach and play. Requiring players to hit their opponents piece adds that level of interaction that brings it from what would otherwise be a game of "sliding darts" into a back-and-forth grind with each shot being interesting and important. Fun for young and old.

Cons: Well the price certainly makes for a tough entry point. As much as people tout this as a "strategic" game, if you can't execute it with good old fashioned simple flicking than your strategy won't buy you much.

Other: I've only played on my own board which I would say is more in the mid-range in terms of quality for a custom build. While I'd play the game any time, it hasn't reached that height where I feel like I'm scratching a deep itch. Perhaps that will come in time with more play as skills increase and rivalries develop. 

Best Use: Every family should have one of these hanging on their wall instead of a flat-screen. Use it for all occasions.

Picked up the premium 26" Crokinole board from Mayday Games. Despite the complaints surrounding their first board, the new board is fantastic value for the price. One slight, small mark next to one of the peg holes is the only complaint I can make, and that's definitely nitpicking. As for the game itself? Instant hit. I introduced a bunch of people to it last weekend, and many, many games were played. Very satisfying to pull off a fancy shot, or knock an opponent's piece out of the board. Definitely worth giving a go, and for the budget conscious, Mayday's premium board is definitely worthwhile.

For what it is, top notch.

A quick, easy to teach, yet often nail-biting game of flicking disks, which most importantly looks beautiful (nice sets anyway) and adds a touch of class to any room.

Very simple but extremely satisfying game. I like the fact that finesse is almost always a better option than force. The best Christmas present I've ever received was my beautiful Mr. Crokinole Eagle board from my beautiful wife Ginny. [284 plays, all but five with two players]

Flick flick flick flick and
Flick flick flick flick flick flick and
Fourteen more flicks. Score.

Picked up a two-sided carrom board with crokinole on the back at a local thrift store for $2.00. A fun find that makes me wonder about upgrading to something nicer...

Easily the most addicting game I own - a game takes ten minutes at most, involves as much thinking and tactics as it involves dexterity, and is playable by up to four. A lucky find that makes me want to save my money for a cadillac board.

This is the perfect game for playing at work. I introduced the game to the guys with an old Carrom board with Crokinole on the reverse side.  The game caught on like wildfire and half a dozen of us now own very high quality boards.  This game would rate a 9 or 10 if I didn't suck so bad at it.

RATING: 8.9
The best dexterity game I've played. It is really easy to learn but has a really high skill cap and possibility to tactical gameplay. The gameplay itself is really elegant; rounds are really short and the game has a good flow.

Only downside of this game is that it is quite expensive to get into. Good crokinole boards cost more than 100 bucks and they can be hard to find in some countries. There are cheaper options out there but it really isn't a same game than when played with a quality board.

Still highly recommended if you are looking for a dexterity game. Everyone will like this game so you can be sure that your valuable board will be in use.

Best frikkin game I've ever played.  Period.

Not one single person that has ever sat down at the table has walked away without wanting their own board.

Everyone that sees us playing in the pub wants to know what it is and they ask to  play a round.. and then want to know where they can get a board.

This is a universally appealing game.  

EVERYONE loves it.  If you don't like it you have no soul.

Played both 1v1 and 2v2 and hope to get this one on the table much more in the future. Tense back and forth thanks to (a) an amazing balancing feedback loop (more points = more blockers) and (b) a nice catch-up counting scheme (only the point difference between teams counts towards the goal 100 points).

RATING: 8
I've only played a plastic version, so the disks were probably too light & the board too small. Liked it anyway and I'm sure I would love it if the table was large & wooden; that would make the strategical element more palpable & the shots wouldn't be so easily prone to chaos.

In this dexterity game, players attempt to flick disks onto a circular board, where there are disk like, scoring regions with more points awarded towards the center. The trick is that to keep your disk on the board, you must hit one of your opponent's disks. You can play with 2 people, or as teams of two. I have only played the team version. It's fun, but I found that I slightly bruised my fingernail when flicking too many disks. I consider this more of a party game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once.
I get it - but dexterity games mess me round.  I can see there's a strong element of skill involved, and I struggle with these flicking games.
Two-sided discs either float or grip when flicked, giving a very different action over the board.  The rules are interesting without feeling onerous, while repeated plays make a game - that could take a while to finish.

RATING: 7
If the skill level of the teams is too disparate, this can be a very frustrating and demoralizing game. *** UPDATE*** Like bowling, you need to be able to adjust to changing conditions when playing on boards other than your own (or depending on how much powder is on your board at the moment). I doubt I'll ever get good enough at this to be a contender in a tournament, but I highly recommend everyone get a board and leave it out when guests come over. It's like a having a dart board without the possibility of someone losing an eye!

This one has quickly become the most played game in our house after owning it for less than two months.  

A mix of darts, pool, and shuffle board, this game is a gem.  

Played 1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. 2, people take 12 discs and start flicking them into the center of the board.  The center hole is 20, center ring 15, middle ring 10, and outer ring is 5.  

The thing that makes this game interesting is that you are not just taking turns trying to get into the center, to make a legal shot, your piece HAS to hit an opponents piece.  That essential rule makes this one worth playing over and over, and over....and over.  

My group loves it.

Gioco di destrezza e abilità nello schiccerare, ovvero muovere le proprie pedine con una spinta (colpendole quindi lateralmente con un dito) per mandarle nel buco al centro del piano del gioco o, se ci sono pedine avverarie in gioco, andandole a colpire. Il gioco ha nella sua semplicità e immediatezza i suoi punti di forza. I materiali sono pregiati e potrebbe essere utilizzati come elemento d'arredo. Un gioco che spinge spesso a sfinde infinite a furia di continue rivincite.

This game is an unstoppable force of nature that should be pursued by all who do not own it!! That is better.

I truly love playing this game (my wife only entertains me by playing it).  If I could have it set up in a permanent place in the home I would.  It is that much fun.  The price can be the sticking point, but once you own it the hours spent playing it will justify the price.

12/18/11 - I never played a dexterity game before and if I have to start somewhere, why not the granddaddy of them all.

Yes, this is great dexterity game. If you can get a copy you should, it will be popular with all ages. It will also surprise you when certain non-gamers try it and do amazingly well. It is expensive relative to other games, but has been a good value considering it will likely never lose it's basic appeal.

Oct 2014: I rate this a 9.5 as I will likely always pull it out in certain situations, particularly mixed-groups. It is the ONLY game I can play with ANYONE at least once, and it's quite fast, and has surprised me in who has immediately done well with the game. It loses a 1/2 point for me in that my board is of low quality (I think), and requires polishing/waxing after every long session. Even then, certain pucks "stick" occassionally on certain parts of the board. While this is fine for casual, one-time-play, for me to really want to get good at this and to enjoy it 100% I think I need a "pro" board. At probably $300-500, I don't think I'll be going beyond what I have (the $100 Mayday games "ding-and-dent" closeout special).

Upgraded back to a 10. It's really good.

[floatleft][ImageID=679429][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
Dexterity at its finest! 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
Crokinole is the game I typically pull out when I am hosting non-gamers. It is easy to teach and plays just as well with 2 or 4 players which makes it great for couples. I rate Crokinole so highly because I absolutely love it and I will almost never turn down a game.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I think the only downside to Crokinole is portability. Its not easy schlepping a giant board around so it usually gets left behind.

One thing I have observed is that different boards tend to play different depending on lacquer. Not a detraction from the overall game itself but playing on a slower board isn't as fun.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I absolutely love my Mr. Crokinole Eagle Tournament board! It is beautiful. It is definitely worth every penny I spent on it. Here is a link: http://www.crokinole.com/preview1.asp?ID=5

Long overdue that I got to play this classic dexterity game: funny seeing the PitchCar cars doing their business in a different environment (presumably the original). It's lovely to look at, for sure, but I found it to be a bit of a one-trick pony from my only play. Maybe I need a good long session of this, like I had with Tumblin' Dice to see what I'm missing. I still find the one-cheek rule most amusing!  Don't get the top 100 feel from it yet, but happy to be persuaded otherwise.

This is a wonderfully elegant flicking dexterity game. The idea is that you flick a disc from the outside ring, trying to get it in the center if possible, or as close to the center as you can manage. There are barrier pegs that might send your bit where you don't want it to go, but the real trick of the thing is that each subsequent disc must at least touch a previously flicked disc on the board, or else it's removed. It's simple, it's not as easy as it looks and it's full of wonderful tension.

A brilliant dexterity game with a nice layer of strategy about where to be aiming for to set up future shots and influence positioning. In many ways it reminds me of an actual sport I enjoy playing--Curling--where it is equal parts strategy and skill. You're always trying to place your pieces just where you want, and get better over time at aiming. All the while you're constantly figuring out what does and doesn't work well in terms of placements and positions.

Nobody is likely to refuse this game when offered.  It's a lot of fun, even for people who say they aren't interested in games.  New players get "lucky" often enough that it's never a discouraging blowout.  2-player version is fun too but not nearly as much fun as the 4-player partnership.

RATING: 10
I own a Stratford board purchased from Mr. Crokinole. Rating of 8 after an initial 6 games played with 4 players in teams. Wow, just amazing!

A little over a month later, and it's definitely a 9. I would play it more, but I only have a rectangular table for gaming at my place. It's perfect for 2 player Crokinole, but not so good for 4. 

I can easily play this for hours at a time. Right now I mostly play 4 player Crokinole, but I haven't played enough 2 player to figure out a preference yet.

Many months later and who am I kidding. I will always want to play Crokinole! Getting a 20 and knocking an opponent's disc out is easily one of the best moments in gaming.

The most fun you can have with a game in 15 minutes or less. Accessible to everyone, lots of laughs. Likely a lifetime experience for me. There is a satisfaction from playing this game that is unrivaled. There is something about the body/mind connection in a dexterity game that is refreshing in a way that a deeply contemplative game is not. Four players is much better than two, as much as the purists will roll their eyes at me for saying this.

RATING: 10
Best flicking game ever! Assuming you're playing on a high quality board -- posts wrapped in rubber for bouncy ricochet shots, disks that are slightly convex so that they have a "fast" side and a "slow" slide, and a highly polished, hardwood surface.

More fun than Carroms since it's much simpler and less frustrating. After you (or your team) have played 12 disks, the round is over. I don't have the time to perfect my technique, which Carrom demands; Crokinole I could play intermittently and still have a good time every time.

I started playing this before I was 10. I had a long layoff as the board was always left at an uncles cottage. It was on my buy list for years but I always found it to be too expensive. After years of waiting my wife bought it for me as a christmas gift in 2009. This is by far my favorite dexterity game. You bring this out when you have some people over and it will be occupied most of the night. Sometimes we'll do one offs and other times play until a certain point total is reached. Every one should own a crokinole board.

29-01-2014. Rated after 2 games. Crokinole has an almost legendary status for me as a dexterity game, being hyped and lauded so often and being ancient as the sun. So when I finally had the chance to sit down and play a dex-game, I came away with mixed feelings.

Yes, the game is fun. You're laughing, mocking your opponent, cursing your luck if you do something stupid. I see the game, which is fun. We played using a mayday board, which really gives a fun feel as you have this big wooden thing to play with. Then again, ultimately the games are forgettable. A short, but meaningless distraction from the other games you're playing..

Also, there is some skill involved! (which I lack). All in all, a great game that I'd love to own.. because I can see my whipping it out a lot.

----------

I had low expectations for this game, but I had a LOT of fun playing it, which I'm sure is due, in part, to my embarrassingly bad flicking skills ("skills" a term I'm using as loosely as possible). 

The game is extremely accessible for new gamers, so I honestly think it could be a decent replacement for the classic game of billiards.  Still, it's incredibly difficult for me to justify the high price of the game because I don't think it'd be nearly as fun with 2p, and I never have 4p games at my place.  Still, it's a very fun game.

King of dexterity games. Purchased a Hilinski Brothers Board "Sandstorm" http://www.hilinski.net/woodgames/crokinole_gallery/Sandstorm.jpg
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easily the most fun dexterity game.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


[b]Unique Component[/b] - Polished circular wooden and wooden pucks.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] -  Flicking the pucks across the board.


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - Many games use the flicking dexterity mechanic.  I listed this one because I believe it is the oldest known game to use this mechanic.  Plus, I think it is the most fun game to use the dexterity flicking mechanic.  There is nothing extraneous with this game.  Just pure flicking with deep strategy.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


[b]Starting Age[/b] - 4 to learn how to flick the puck.  But they will not know to score.  Ages 8 - 9 for a full game.


[b]Will children like this game[/b] - Yes.  It is always fun flicking pucks across the board.

[b]Why is this good with children[/b] - Great Hand-Eye coordination.


[b]Parents Frustration Level[/b] - Low.  While younger children will not grasp the concept of scoring, it is still fun to play.

--Dec2003-- Fun fingers&dexterity game.  2 or 4.  Add to the fact that it's a "family tradition" on both my wife's side of the family and on mine, and it tends to get played a few times every year.

Yeah for this one! My father's father played crok, my father played crok, and I play crok. A family tradition. When I became a man, my father bestowed upon me a $300 'Eagle' Mr. Crokinole board, the style that my family prefers. We take it veeery seriously! COme on down to my board, bizzza! Games can be of epic length, the score cancelling rule meaning that you can have multiple rounds where no one scores, dragging the game into awesome fights for the finish. Who will slip up first...? Confidence plays a big factor among similarly skilled players. Not unlike the role it plays in pool. Start to crack and you're done.

Nice if you can get hold of a decent board. There must be hundreds of old flicking games, but I think that this one has survived on its merits. Carrom is "better", of course (and cheaper), especially for four, but this is quicker and lighter to play - less demoralizing if like me you are hopelessly inept.

[234 plays] The grandfather of dexterity games. It is a great way to begin or end an evening of gaming. There are decisions to be made with every shot, just like a quality game of billiards (which is the closest thing to which I can compare it to from actual experience - having only limited experience with curling.) Crokinole is fast and fun entertainment without any elements of the brain work that the games I love often contain, so it is a very nice change of pace.

This has been a big hit with everyone I've introduced it to.

Crokinole is the ultimate dexterity game to me. There is a simple elegance to it. The first time I sat down to play this, I ended up not leaving that seat for two hours. I was so happy to finally purchase my own Hilinski board, which is lovingly mounted in the living room. I hope that it will become a family heirloom and provide hours upon hours of entertainment for years to come.

Probably THE best dexterity game around. It's more forgiving than Carrom but still rewards skill. It's fast playing and there are good rules to scale up from two to four players. Pity the boards are hard to find and expensive in Australia! I WANT MY OWN SET!

Well, someone brought in reasonably priced boards to Australia.

Crokinole is the best dexterity game I have ever played, and that includes such non-board games as bowling, billiards, shuffleboard, croquet, darts, and lawn darts. PitchCar is fun, especially for large groups, but Crokinole is intense. Play is full of suspense, surprise, and satisfaction. Playing on a fantastic Hilinski board doesn't hurt, either.

Fun game!  Accessible to almost anyone and easily explained.  Highly addictive, and it is *very* easy to sit down to a game and still be "filliping" 4-5 hours later!  Yeah, the price can be a factor, but you are likely spending $$$ for a nice wooden board that will probably be played by grandchildren and great-grandchildren long after you are gone.  I would say spend the extra couple of dollars for a good board, you won't regret it!  Now that I am a High School teacher, I have brought this game with me to the classroom and there is a loyal group of players meeting in my room after school almost everyday!

Egyetlen ügyességi játék, ami ennyire a top közelében van a BGG-n. Nem véletlen a sikere. Bárki által játszható 1 perces szabállyal rendelkező Curlinghoz hasonló játék, de jég nélkül. A játékos megpróbálja a 12 (4 játékos esetén 6) korongjának egyikét a körtábla közepén levő lyukba juttatni vagy ahhoz minél közelebb. Ha van fent az ellenfélnek korongja, akkor muszáj azt érintenie közben. A játéktér 4 különböző értékű körre van osztva, az összes korong ellövése után megszámoljuk a fent levő korongok összértékét és jön az újabb kör. Nagyon addiktív játék, gyorsan játszható és tényleg bárki által. Meglepő, de nagyon jó négyen is. Csak az ára borsos.

Fantasztikusan addiktív, nagyon nehéz abbahagyni.

I would get this game in a heartbeat were the board not so obscenely big and clunky and, well, downright expensive.  Fun, light and addictive.  Given the choice between having this or a pool table in the house, I would choose Crokinole hands down.

Having played Carrom, I found Crokinole to be much more accessable, easier to pick up and infused with higher results of fun.

Certainly, you can get better at playing this, but in the meantime, getting your ass handed to you is fun.

Holy crap! This is the absolute best 2 or 4-player game I have.  Light, easy to teach, but oh so much fun!  Everyone I have introduced to this game has had an absolute blast in playing it, and several rivalries have sprung up among players.  Though the cost may seem prohibitive for a nice board (e.g. Hilsinki or other quality board) it is well worth it and money well spent.  In the last month, I've averaged three games a week -- and I've only had the board a month!

----

After six months, this continues to be my most worthwhile game purchase.  I've played this countless times to the point that I'm due to buy a new set of carroms because I've worn the "nipple" side off of them.  Though Crokinole might seem cost prohibitive, it is my best gaming investment, as it is easy to explain, loads of fun to play, and highly addictive for those introduced to it.  

----

I think I've had this for two years now, and though I haven't played it as much recently, that is more of a function of an inability to get a group together due to scheduling than it is of any dissatisfaction with the game.  I still have friends asking when we can get together and play some crokinole.

I didn't go in expecting much, I'm not a big fan of dexterity games.

This one really surpassed my expectations though.  It didn't feel like I was playing a board game but more of a physical activity such as Cornhole or Horseshoes.  I'm still not great at it, one of the reasons I don't like dexterity games is I'm not great at them, but I still enjoyed myself and this feels like something you could play with pretty much anybody.

The people who rave about this are right.  I received a Hilinski board as a present.  It has a hook on the wall to store it, but it's rarely up there.  My husband will play this game any time.  It's far more fun than the rules sound, and some great shots are possible even for fairly novice players like me.

Let's hear it for those Mennonites!  Between this and "Dutch Blitz", they've brought us a couple of darn good games (would they mind if I said "darn"?).  This is pretty much the only type of dexterity game that I've played in the past few years, since "PitchCar" employs an identical mechanic.  I love to do those power take-out shots!  Boo-yeah!  The price of a good Crokinole board blows my mind, though.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

RATING: 7
Solid dexterity game; players take turns flicking discs on a large, waxed board, with the goal of landing them in the centre hole (20 points) or having them on the board at the end of the round (15/10/5 depending on distance). If an opponent's piece is on the board, you must strike it for the shot to be legal.

Note on my boards: The Mayday edition is a very functional board at a good value. My father also owns a board from Hilinski, which is excellent for not too much more. As for the game itself, Crokinole is my idea of a great group game. Perfect with beer and friends. Fun for kids too (without the beer).

Review: Crokinole is still popular on the Geek, but about five years back it seemed that a week couldn't go by without a Crokinole board making the list of top images on the front page. As trends go, I was happy for this one because I purchased a board for myself and one for my dad as a Christmas present. While neither board sees as much use as it once did, I'm still happy for a match whenever the mood strikes.

Despite the hype, Crokinole is a solid dexterity/flicking game. While it seems downright abstract compared to some modern riffs on the same premise (e.g., [thing=169124][/thing]), I can't help but enjoy the straightforward nature of Crokinole because the basic premise is so simple: flick your discs into the center hole. If you can't manage that, get them as close to the center as possible. It's 20 points for the hole, 15 for the center ring, 10 for the middle ring, and 5 for the outermost ring. Points cancel, so you subtract your opponent's points before banking the difference for the round.

If it was just that easy, of course, there wouldn't be much game. To this point structure, add a few complications like a series of posts obstructing your path into the central ring. And most importantly, when flicking your discs, you must hit one of your opponent's discs if there are any on the board. From this one rule comes a host of complications because you almost never get a clear, simple shot after the opening salvo. Moreover, you can use this rule to your advantage. Want to make your opponent's life difficult? -- No problem. Just position your disc behind a post on your side of the board. If it's the only one of your discs on the board, your opponent will have to shoot for it. But that can't last. If you want to get points, you'll have to shoot for the center. And unless you're a pro, you'll miss a few shots, leaving more and easier targets for your opponent.

Bottom line, there is room for skill shots and thoughtful strategy alike. Crokinole delivers because it manages to appear simple even though it rarely remains simple. Plus, any frustration is short-lived. In the middle of a round, you'll never be stuck for very long. And worst case scenario, you have a bad round that is quickly over.

Of course no game is perfect. To play Crokinole, you'll need a board -- a rather large board that requires storage and transport. Nowadays, with so many board games on my shelf, storage is at a premium. Finding a place for a large piece of wood, no matter how pretty, is a commitment you may not want to make. I understand, but taken with that caveat, Crokinole delivers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is more along the lines of playing pool than a strategy boardgame, but it is flat out fun.  Anyone has the skill to make a few 20 shots, and the amazing carroms off of the center posts can lead to incredible shots.  Plus, the boards can be simply beautiful.

Father's Day 2010 gift from Caron and the kids.  Hilinski Board, Sunset on the Salt Flats.

The definition of a 10.  Crokinole can be played with anyone--young or old.  There is skill involved, and veteran players will have an advantage.  However, because of the nature of the game, with the unpredictability of caroms and such, anyone can sit at the table and pull off ridiculous shots.  

No set up time.  Quick play time.  Simple to understand rules.  Beautiful presentation.  Lends to conversation while playing.  Can be hushed or boisterous.  Games can and will be talked about long after they are over.  

The only drawback is the high cost for a good board.

Scratches a very different itch than most games on this site, but it's fantastic.  I wish I had a nice Crokinole board to call my own!  The only danger is that one can get sucked into so many rounds of Crok that you forget to play other games.

Expensive, not easy to lug around and requires exactly 2 or 4 players. Those are my criticisms.

I like everything else. It can be thoroughly enjoyed by skilled and unskilled people, though not at the same time. It plays quickly and has some real tactical decisions to make. 

My favorite dexterity game. PERIOD. And I love dexterity games.

Update: My rating has only gone up. It makes me think I should look into investing in Carrom. I'm not sure I'm ready for the leap.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1  Worst Travel Game award!

Its great fun.  Really really really great fun.  The bumpers can be so cruel, and so helpful.  It turns flicking into an intense game of skill.  Must get better.  I can win a round... but not the whole flicking match.  Practice makes perfect.... and the practice will be so enjoyable.

The game gets better as your flicking skills improve.  Strategic placement and of that sort.  Very nice, very nice indeed.

Great for gamers and non gamers.  Addictive.

Wow!  After reading so much about Crokinole on BoardGameGeek, I finally decided to ask for a board for Christmas so I could try it out for myself.  I received the beautiful Cimarron board made by the Hilinski brothers for Christmas, and have fallen in love with this game.  I played it 35 times in the first week I owned it, and look forward to many future plays.  It's hands-down the best dexterity game I've ever played, and certainly a very interesting strategy game in its own right.

What a marvelous dexterity game! The board I played at was just a piece of art!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[thing=521][/thing] is a dexterity game with its main rule being that, in order to stay on the board, your piece must hit that of an opponent, making the game more strategic with the positioning of pieces, both solo or with teams.

The goal is to be first to a certain amount of points - and there regions on the board worth 5, 10 and 15 points, with the center being worth 20. Players have 12 (or 6 each, when playing with teams) pieces and after all are used, there is a scoring of the pieces still on the board. Then the process starts again.

[thing=521][/thing] is fun, easy to understand and play (but no all that easy to do well). What can be said against it is that it can run for a little too long, more due to the (lack of) quality of players, thus the recommendation is to, at first, don't go for a too high end goal.

Everyone should own a board, you will play it religiously!  One of the greatest all time skill games.  If you are into shuffle board, darts, ping pong, table games, etc.  Find one, and pay extra for a good one! 

p.s. I dominate my gaming buddy... he says he lets me win.  Uh huh, well it must be painful for him.

The kids and I are having a blast with our new Hilinski board.  I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I do.  Highly recommended for anyone that likes dexterity games.  This will be a blast with a few beers during our annual camping trip!  Like every game, it's not something you want to play all day, every day, but is perfect when in the right mood.

To anyone complaining about sore fingers...don't strike the discs, PUSH them!  

The "One Cheek" rule is one of the lamest rules I've ever heard of.  So a tall guy with long arms and better reach will have an advantage over a kid or someone much shorter?  Lame...It's a board game!  We never play with this rule and guess what...The game isn't changed without it!

I was right about everyone loving it on our camping trips!  It was played numerous times in between more serious, time-heavy, games.

It's a dexterity game and I'm not a fan.  I'm guessing the reason this game is ranked so high is that people spend so much money on the boards, they have to rank it high to feel good about it.  Does the game of marbles get this high of ranking?  It's the same concept - flip an object at a target and also try to hit your oppenents' objects.

The Number One best finger flicker around! I ordered my green Eagle board (the same board used at the Ontario Championship) from Mr. Crokinole (Wayne).  There is no more fun sporting event on the planet, especially good for team play with 4 players. You get better at it the more you play, and is amazing when what you try to do actually works! I would love to attend the national Championship in Ontario some day.

My ultimate "Grail" game, just got it yesterday, waxed it today, amazing fun! Great game for adults and kids. *Update* We've owned this game for almost a year now, and it has been played more than any other. No matter what we play on Board Game night. This one will usually either start the night off, or cool down our brains at the end. In addition, EVERYWHERE we take it, it's a huge hit. It gets a ton of attention, and everybody wants to play!

Hello?  BGG?  What kind of mass madness leads you to like this game so much?  It's a dexterity game, something which you normally pooh pooh.  Hello?  Anybody?

Neat enough for a dexterity game.  Good fit for a few rounds as filler.  There's enough disks that you'll probably make one or two shots you feel really good about, and there will also be a shot or two where you want to hit yourself because you flubbed it so bad.

I played online just to learn how to play and it's similar to Tumblin' Dice. Shuffleboard on a small table. What's not to like about that? If I get one it would have to be a really nice one. I'm leaning heavily towards a Helsinki Brother's board.

UPDATE: Played in December 2014, and upgraded from 8 to 10. We had left the game upstairs as we didn't have a suitably large table to leave it out. Now we do, and we immediately played it five times in two days.

***

Pool for gamers with no space for a pool table. A dexterity game of pure skill... And flicking. I own a Willard's board and the component quality is incredible. It's like ice hockey - the flicking surface is almost frictionless.

If you can afford/want a board and have 2-4 players, this is the only flicking game you'll ever need.

This game is like shuffleboard in the round. Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions. The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward. Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game. There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years.

Best dexterity game out there. Another that is more tactical than strategic, and coordination is a must. Fast play time, 2er or team play, and the variation in designs on the nicest game surfaces you will find anywhere make this a top game.

If you like flicking things, and you enjoy 'angle' games like pool and bowling, then this may just be the most awesome boardgame you ever sit down to play. Not just dexterity, lots of tactical decisions also. A 10 without hesitation. I ALWAYS want to play this game. 

note: after a year of pining after this I finally ordered a Hilinski board. Fantastic, just fantastic.

quite fun dexterity game, probably lacking a strategic element.
disquieting the fact that in a tournament the first 4 players were at their first crokinole games and there were other players with more than a dozen games experience. how much dexterity and how much luck in the ricochets?

[EDIT] it's till an 8, but i must write 8.5 because there aren't many games that i played 60 times and i am still eager to play every time i want a quickey to close the night. Played in three is also great.

A game that has always been a family favourite.  We play with house rules where each side has 21 pieces.  We generally play a few variations with the winner choosing the game.  One variation is where you are trying to place all 21 pieces on the board without hitting any other piece.  If you hit a piece your piece is out.  Any version is that you have to hit your piece first if you have a piece on the board.  And then we finish the night where we see who can get the first piece in the 20.

Played a few times. Dexterity games are usually not my favorite kind, but this one seems to be actually quite good, and has less downtime than Carabande / Pitch Car.

This is the lovely board that the Hilinski's made custom for us with our names to commemorate 16 years of marriage.  It is super special.  It is an awesome game to boot.  Always tense and fun.  I don't like rating games 10 as it seems like hyperbole to me.  This one gets the closest.

I enjoy both the 2-player and 4-player game.  There are good handicapping mechanics that have lead to some close contests.  Maybe someday there will be an affordable way to own this game.

Really boils down to dexterity with little game-like feeling. more sport-like to me. still fun though.

RATING: 8
Initial play - the simplicity is not a turn off solely due to the addictive nature of trying to achieve the 20pt shot or the satisfying ping of knocking out an opponent's disk.  

Plus, the woodworking on a handcrafted designer/proper board is just a pleasure to behold.

The best dexterity game for me. Very tactical, and so much fun. Can play 1v1, 2v2, even 3/4 free-for-all. Beautiful to look at. Awesome.

Very strange game. It seems like a 'next level' thing from a game I played in my childhood called "Sjoelen" in Dutch. The team aspect is interesting, and the gameplay as well. It mixed tactical play with agility. 

However, it requires an incredibly unwieldy gameboard and I think it also requires maintenance. This off course doesn't make the game itself less enjoyable!

Took a bit of getting used to but another fun flicking game. Definitely some learning curve. Very quick and plays in teams.

Similar to playing a lawn game or something (bocce!), lots of fun packed into an easy activity.

Received my new Crokinole board from the Hellinskis.  While I'm thrilled to get the board, I was a little dissapointed with the staining on the inside of the inner ring.  I'll probably fix it myself, but still...for the price I was hoping it would be evenly stained.  On the plus side, I absolutely love the game!

Really don't get why this game is ranked as highly as it is.  Was a lot of fun the first time I played it, but certainly not one of the best 50 games of all time.  What is with the obsession with flicking games, people?

One of the best manual dexterity games out there. Brings back such fond memories of Carrom. I am on the lookout for a high quality board, as it can last a lifetime and will see lots of use. So simple, so much fun!

I have only played the 2-player game, and look forward to trying the full 4-player team game. I like it, but don't love it yet, but that will likely come with more plays.

While dexterity games are not a favorite of mine, I can see getting a lot of plays out of Crokinole.  Simple to learn but hard to master, anyone should be able to get into it.  Too bad the cost is so prohibitive to owning one, but if you going to get it, might as well go for the best quality and unique designs you won't find elsewhere right?

Total plays >> 100

This is as close to being a 10 as is possible with a game based on body mechanics rather than thought. When you are learning how to play, or are an intermediate level, the game is ideal. Once you are accomplished the game is worse. When I now play with my 18 year old, we are sufficiently competent that the winner is the one who made 1 mistake rather than 2. It reminds me of Olympic gymnastics: a tremendously beautiful, but horrible competition.

After 1 Play: Really liked my one play at BGG.con '07.  I was bummed that I didn't get in any other plays.  I really liked the game, but I'll need to play it some more to justify a higher rating.

After 10+ Plays: I keep enjoying this game, and it has just the right mix of ability and strategy.  My only complaint is the scoring system, in which only the net difference of each round is scored, as it makes the length of games wildly variable.  Bumped rating from 7 to 8.

GAME: The Swarm
RANK: 2919

RATING: 5
[I]tl;dr A Wolfgang Kramer game that mixes area control with action selection for a sleeper hit that's definitely a hidden gem, though rather dry if you haven't read the book[/I].
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

This was a surprising game that came out of nowhere for me. I love the area control aspect and fighting the game's own puzzle as well as other players is great -- lots of thinkiness to be had there. I also love the no-luck action purchasing as you weigh your options. Because you're spending VP to get good actions, you have to consider whether your planned move will make up that ground on the other players! There's the same action cards every round -- all that matters is which ones you're able to buy and what order you will play them in. Having no secret information in this game makes it feel like you're really racing the other players. It's also extremely satisfying to build your big swarm network and achieve your goals. 

But my favorite part about the game is actually the damage dealt to other players. There's a built-in catchup mechanism in that your position on the board determines how many points you lose when you are damaged. So if I damage a player with 48 points twice using the tsunami, that player is losing ten points -- and I'm gaining ten! By contrast, a player with only 20 points is only losing 4 points if I make the exact same move on her. This makes damaging each other an important part of the game, especially late when you can provoke large point swings by bashing an opponent. Additionally, the three different damages feel very distinct from each other (crab is land only, whale is sea only, tsunami is land/sea) and spice up gameplay. 

Because it's based on a book, I feel this game got little attention. It definitely made me want to read the book, though, as the game has quite an interesting plot. I'm a little sad that this game has been forgotten, it seems like, since it could have gone so much further, maybe with a different or more generic theme/name. Also, I feel that the game did drag a little long for our play, though we all enjoyed it and would like to revisit it. 

In short, The Swarm is a somewhat forgotten game that actually has some pretty solid gameplay elements tucked within it. Unfortunately, the facts that the theme is tied to the book, and the game looks rather dull, meant that it rarely got played and I had to trade it away.

The criticism that there are fewer strategies for victory than initially appear overly discounts the tactical play, where a single tempo playing a key tile can make the difference. 

Update: okay, this is starting to fade, but still worth its low, low price for 2-3 plays.

For a themed game, it sure is abstract. The mechanisms do not really mesh with the theme; it's basically a pipe-game with extras.

A very interesting game.  The auction mechanic is different -- "top"-most card is free or pay 1vp per distance from ("behind") the top card for a different one.  The wild is very helpful.  I like how the mechanics mesh to form an interesting, connected series of actions.

What I don't like is how... [i]uncontrolled[/i] it felt.  Turn order matters a great deal as going earlier will provide more, and presumably better, choices for cards.  A lot of player interaction at work.  I got totally hosed by another player taking a spot I wanted for a research station and there was absolutely nothing I could do.  I didn't have enough actions to recover or attempt to alter my plans.  I was locked and instead had to choose from a number of other, sub-optimal choices.

Might be subject to a run-away leader problem.  Yes the damage inflicted scales as a leader emerges, and yes the point swings will be bigger, but one player can significantly hamper the efforts of other players, to the point where they may not be able to recover.

In other words, the player interaction is such that the take-that aspects might overwhelm any chance of an equally strong recovery.  And that annoys the heck out of me.  Otherwise, a very interesting game.  Nice production value.  Well worth giving a shot.  I would play it again.

Vaguely reminiscent of Parker Brothers's Survive! but very busy with card drafting and track laying features. Very cluttered game board.

RATING: 7.5
The board and bits are beautiful, and very evocative of the theme. Gameplay, however, is only marginally evocative, theme-wise. It's a route building game under the sea: that's it. If you want a game that is a better themed take on undersea exploration and mystery, try out Nautilus.
The Swarm very much reminds me of the tile flipping of Messieurs Faidutti's and Cathalla's Iglu Iglu, as well as the route building and blocking of Aqua Romana. Cutthroat it is, but not anywhere near as bad as I had been led to believe. Making use of the evil seaples is almost mandatory, simply because you're bound to end up with some seaple cards in the card drafting rounds. Plus, the damage that the seaples cause is fairly minimal, unless your target is well in the lead; in that case, they act as a nice catch-up mechanism.
A good dollop of luck in The Swarm.

RATING: 7
An interesting and decent game.  The game plays more simply and smoothly than you would expect from the rules.  I'm not sure about the replayability as it doesn't seem very deep, but I've only played it the one time so far. It's clearly very important to get the 4-connection tiles to build over someone else's play, or you will be cut off and unable to connect.  Pull lots of tiles with the ship, and if you don't get any 4-connection tiles then try to pick early so you can take a "golden swarm" tile to get a 4-connection tile.  Don't worry about the disasters [i]that[/i] much, particularly early in the game.  Don't neglect research stations - try to build [i]at least[/i] one per round, even if it means using your wild card for that. Be prepared to jump ahead to get what you really need.  I won in spite of giving up 9 points to jump ahead for cards in the final round (including one jump of four cards).  Given that you can pick this game up for $10-12, I'd say it's worth giving a try...

RATING: 7.9
A nice, unique theme, and incredible components for the price ($19.96); one of the best values I've come across.  The game play is interesting.  It's fairly simple, too, so it's on the lighter end of the spectrum.  Handling all of the components on the board can seem a bit fiddly at times.  Also, the skills cards are very unbalanced--we picked the same two cards (the Researcher and the Ship) every time.  The extra swarm tile is pointless, as it's easy enough to come across similar tiles by using your ships.  The Protection card is equally worthless--why would you ever take that when your number of researchers (that would earn you bonus points via the Researcher skill card) exceeds the number of times you MIGHT get attacked in a round?  Perhaps the Protection card has more value in a multi-player game, but it seems virtually useless as is in a 2-player game.  We are thinking about the following changes to the two weaker skills cards.  Protection: 1/2 the damage (so, instead of you losing x points and your opponent gaining x points, they simply gain the points).  Swarm Tile: +2 bonus points when part of your longest contiguous chain during end-of-round scoring.

Medium light networking game with a nice action drafting mechanic. Game is very abstract and the theme does not get me at all. Still there is enough game here to keep me interested. The Swarm has a rather unique combination of planning, luck and take that aspects. Will have to play more to see if it has staying power. For now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

The abstract nature of the game caused it to gather dust on my shelve. Sold the game to a better home.

Kifejezetten kellemes csalódás a játék. Semmitmondó doboza nem keltette fel az érdeklődésem, viszont a játék igen, miután lejátszottam egy négy fős partit. Nagyon tematikus egy játék és az akció megoldást is kedveltem. Hátrány a kevés kör a stratégiák kidolgozásához, de nem is lehetne tovább játszani, mert így pont jó a végkifejlet. Sok lehetőség van a játékban és mindemellett, tetszik, hogy kockáztatni kell a pontjainkkal. Ha jó áron találkozom ezzel a játékkal biztos, hogy a polcomon a helye :)

The disasters seem over-powered.  Perhaps this is intentional and players are supposed to bid or pay accordingly.  The game is pretty tight because you don't have many actions over the course of the game, but overall the game was more work than fun.

RATING: 6
This is a face down tile pickup, face up tile laying game, in which the aim is to build research stations around the edge of the board and connect all of those to a central location in the sea that makes up most of the board. A role card selection mechanic lets you select actions, and whales, tsunamis and the nasty crab can be used to attack other playersships or research stations. The rewards yo get from this increase as your victims score increases, so this is a definite stop the leader mechanic which helps the game.

A very thematic medium-light weight game from the authors of Maharaja (Kramer & Kiesling). Three rounds of tile laying, pathway building and light screwage. It all comes together quite well and this is a good 1 to 1.5 hour game for what is offered. 

Recommended.

Mixed feelings about this one.   Having no idea what the story is about (it's a book right?) the concepts of a swarm and queen and researches makes no sense at all. 

In any case, it's ultimately a connection game, where the big points are earned connecting sides to center and multiple-sides together.   

The game is enjoyable, but the scoring feels somewhat arbitrary when it comes to number of researches, ships connected, etc.  

My main complaint though is that it is rarely cost effective to block other players because turns are so limited.  To connect three sides of the board you really have no wiggle room to go out of your way to stop other players.

I liked this more than I expected to from reading the rules; the way the various elements of the game came together makes a difference, though the importance of connecting via the centre to the scoring makes blocking a bit too powerful. Maybe not Keisling & Kramer's very best, but pretty good all the same.

I have only played the Swarm once, so I am on the fence as to whether this game has some design flaws. It seems like a good enough tile laying game, but it is a little clunky in execution. My husband enjoyed this one (he won!), So I am going to give it a fair chance and try it again. There is a good possibility my strategy was just all wrong.

Me esperaba muy poco de este juego y tras jugar una partida mi sensación fue de que es un juego que adapta bastante bien la idea de la novela y que se deja jugar bastante bien. Tiene un punto de interacción entre jugadores que me gusta ya que asolas las costas de tus compañeros con tsunamis, golpeas sus barcos con ballenas y atacas sus ciudades con cangrejos infectados de Pfiesteria...apasionante no? jajajaja

First play with 4 players.  Not a super exciting game, but the mechanics all works pretty well together.  Lots of Take That, but in small doses.  I like the points-as-currency aspect.  The board got crowded pretty quickly with 4 players, even in this 4 turn game.  3 player option seems like it could avoid that.

Bonus points for being pretty unique, both in theme and play. Feels (and looks) like an old-school K&K game. Minor ding for having [i]very[/i] thin cardstock. It's sort of a reverse exploration game. The sea starts off with a bunch of face down tiles, and when you explore with your boats instead of just flipping the tiles, you take the tiles, and later place back in the open water, building your connection of researchers. Basically trying to build the largest contiguous network of researchers, and also trying to connect multiple points on the outside (research stations) to the middle (the queen). We played with three players, and I think I'd like it better with four. More carnage fodder for the hazards (similar to the hazards in Survive), and more competition for water spaces, making it harder to connect stations to the queen.

Put me to sleep.  After first round I needed coffee to finish.  Just nothing in it that made it worth the effort.    Much better games have been made by Kosmos and these designers. Maybe not knowing the story had a profound effect.  Everything "thematic" was totally unrealistically mechanical (crab goes clockwise, whale can only go back a forth not diagonal).  A fear that actually implementing realism would ruin the math.  But the math is so blah what does it matter.  VPs for the sake of VPs.

Rating is for 2-player game. I'd probably rate it a point higher with 3 or 4.  I just don't think it works that well with 2 players. The dangers (whale, tsunami, crab) in particular don't work well with 2 players, given that each player has a wild card. There isn't enough incentive to build new ships with 2 players.  I found the tile laying aspect a bit underwhelming, but I suppose it's one of the only things that introduces a degree of luck and prevents this from being a perfect information style game. The game may grow on me after I've played a few games with 3-4 players.

Played our first game of this a bit late, started off all tired and out of it, trying to figure out how we were ever going to figure out the rules, and then bam! We were playing, and it was easy to pick up.

I thought the 2 player game was going to be relatively open, but even with the whole board to ourselves we clashed more than expected.

Very fun to play, I look forward to more ~ to seeing how it does with more people, and to play some more 2 player games as well.  Generally, when we try things out for a first play with two, it's with the intent to play with more people once we learn the game, but I feel this one works well with just 2 players.

RATING: 7.5
Really interesting game but the huge swings of victory points available at the end game (50 for connecting north, south, east and west) are a little overpowered and will probably be house rules fairly swiftly. 

Boats are more powerful than we all estimated and the sea monsters are a little underpowered, they seem very powerful being able to 'steal' victory points from an opponent however swings of 2-3 victory points are a little irrelevant considering the points available at the end game.

Played this in Essen a few years back and grabbed a cheap German copy last year. Worth getting, it's a nice network/rail game disguised as sci-fi, with a significant dose of screwage. The basic auction method is very basic, but works very well, you don't want to buy the cheap stuff in front of you, but don't want to pay the extra for the cards you do want, but you don't want to leave it because the other players will buy them cheaply before they come back to you!! Other than that, it's a good mix of timing, planning, and making optimal moves. Worth getting and playing, if you like light economic network games. No problem with the German edition for gamers.

The name attracted me on this one.  However, the mechanics of the game could be used with other themes.

I think it is a well thought out and tested game with many balances built into it: For instance, during purchase of cards, the more powerful cards are positioned near the end of Phase 1 and can be quite costly the earlier they are chosen, and they are purchased with research points used to win the game; Sea connections with more options for placement are worth less points; And the damage points often increase for those out in front.  

There are different ways to score in each round and 3 different scoring methods so although it is not impossible, it is difficult to know who is ahead, especially when it is close.

The game has other elements I like:  It is attractive, rules are uncomplicated, there is strategy, and it is a relatively short game.

I think it is modified nicely to 2, 3, or 4 players, but I like it best with 4.

Box inserts don't always fit the game, but this one does.  Some of the components were secure without bagging.

Kramer and Kiesling recycled the action selection mechanism from Vikings to create a family game that feels a little more thematic, more convoluted, and more aggressive. That is kind of an odd combination for a family game and not exactly what I expected from those designers.

Good or bad? I'm not a fan of the added take-that elements, turn order seems to be much more important than I would like for a family game, and some of the action cards are very situational. All of these add up to a game that just feels rough and clunky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an excellent Kramer & Kiesling game. The first time I played it, there seemed to be nothing much to it. But that is because the game system itself is quite simple. With the second game it was 'very good' and has been 'excellent' from the third game onwards. The depth of the game is in the amount of choice you have and in the player interaction, rather than in having a complicated system that you have to play against. This may not appeal to some but is very much the kind of game that appeals to me.
The theming is very good for a Eurogame. The 'take that' element is also very well done; moving tsunamis, whales and the crab to clobber your opponent is fun, but their use is without any luck at all.

The game manual made the game out to be far more intimidating than it wound up being, but the bright side was that there was nothing that came up that the manual didn't address.

The game doesn't quite come together until the end of the last turn, so those few final actions can make or break it (or in my case, net you around 55 points to win the game).

An excellent connection game. Mechanics are reminiscent of other games of the same designers: the connections from "Cavum", the acquisition system from "Vikings" and the use of dangers to harm other players, similar to Neptune in "Sunken City". However, the mechanics are put together in different and original ways, resulting in a very pleasant game. The bonus points for connecting sides of the board seemed too high at first, but it provides the necessary incentive for players to pursue that goal. The unusual Science-Fiction theme is a plus.

Very enjoyable. Played with 3. We all love science fiction so the theme worked for us. Daughter particularly made use of danger cards (the rotten kid).

It's brutally unforgiving. With so few rounds, if you make a mistake in one round you'll be pretty screwed. The game is a weird combination of evocative mechanics (the tidal wave and creature attacks) and completely abstract ones (creating a network out of the gooey swarm creature). It's certainly unusual. I'm not sure if it warrants more play or not.

RATING: 6
A game about an apocalyptict scenario, unknown life forms threaten to extinguish mankind. Wow, cool! But then I read the names Kramer and Kiesling and I expect the worst. Indeed is an tile laying game which fails to create any suspension. You just build a track put you markers on it and then the obvious scoring round follows. There are some calamities, like toxic craps or tsunamis, but all they do is making you loose some victory points.
Aside from this is, there is not much for the hardcore eurogamer too. It is simply to short to develop any long term plans. A very uninspired recycling of well known mechanisms and almost no connection to the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very clever game--as we'd expect from the esteemed Herrs Kramer and Kiesling--where you're scientific research teams investigating a sentient swarm of tiny, but angry, marine life. Some neat stuff, where you're sending out boats to collect water samples--picking up face-down tiles--and then performing "research", where you lay the tiles you've collected down, trying to form paths from research stations to the eye of the swarm.

I love the theme, which kind of reminds me of Pandemic, with your team of do-gooders trying to suss out the cause of a catastrophe. It feels fresh and interesting, and makes me want to try out more of the Kosmos line of games based on books. (It really kinda makes me proud to be part of a hobby where the literacy quotient is high enough to make games based on books a going concern!)

Gameplay-wise, I especially like the method of drafting action cards, where the first card in the row is always free, but you can spend VPs to take cards from farther down. Included in this row of cards is the turn-order marker, so choosing to advance your turn order means forgoing a shot at a useful card and paying out VPs to do so. Makes for some good decision points.

This is interesting and unusual and not really my style of game.  It's a game in which players pick up tiles which then become tubes they can place on the board in hopes of building a big network, but their actions are constricted by card drafting.  If I were a connection game person, I could see myself being more excited about this, but alas.  However, I did manage to make a move clever enough to impress Doug, so that always helps. (1 play)

What'll probably keep a lot of people from liking it is its strong take-that element: A couple hits with one of the "dangers" (the nifty tsunami, whale, and crab pieces) can easily cause a player to go from first to last in the final round. Those bits can't help but remind me of Survive, which is a shorter, simpler game that I'm more likely to bring out with family and causal gamers. So this is probably too complex for nongamers and too take-that-y for most gamers; that, coupled with the unfamiliar theme, and it's no wonder it didn't sell well. Still, I'd like to play again.

Terrible, horrible mixture of family game with 'screw others over and over again' game.
Mechanics is absolutely artificial and stupid.  Maybe it would make a little more sense after reading the book on which this game is based on, but that wouldn't really change a thing, anyway..

I wouldn't mind if somebody erased this game from my memory.

initial rating 4 player Essen 08

The K & K duo teamed up again for this game which I think is based on a book, it apparently relates well but I wouldn't know, what I can tell you is the game is quite thematic overall. This could be described as "Sunken City" on steroids, that is exactly what flowercita and I thought once gameplay commenced, many many similarities, theme, high screwage and in a similiar way, movement mechanics and beautifully produced. 

Exploration was added here and p/u and del was removed, instead of building a map it is randomly set out from the beginning for players to discover. Players are trying to build pathways from their stations that they build along the edges of the board to the center tile. This is done by buying up special action cards before a round begins. Here you have things like: Build a station, move a ship, add a scientist and then very much like the screwage in Sunken City you have it here in the same way but x3!!! Move a whale, move a tsumani and one more I can't remember. 

A little meatier than SC but also more screwage possible I think. Some luck in the exploration tile mechanic, not sure yet how much effect it will have. A well put together package overall but it possible suffers from the same aspect as SC, it falls somewhere between a family game and a 'Gamey' game which leaves the audience for it somewhat small, I think it does lean a little towards the later. 

There are some nice scoring things here to watch out for and your decisions are meaningful as well. Beating on the leader I think is quite possible, again not sure at this point if this is good or potentially an issue. 

Summary - Nice overall game that we liked more than SC, might become too much of a screwage fest but not sure yet

You have to commend the Germans for making such an effort to design games based on books.  Kosmos seems to have made a great effort to come up with a solid line of literature based games.

Who knows what The Swarm is really about.  The cover and title make it seem kind of horror-ish in nature, but from what I've gathered from one play, it seems to be more sci-fi.  I'm still not really sure.

I like the way actions are selected (which reminds me of Vikings), but the way the leader is penalized seems a little too punitive to me.  I guess that is part of planning, a common tactic in other Kramer/Kiesling games, staying back in the pack before your final sprint.

It does seem like there are several paths to victory, though I wonder if the connection path is too strong, as the points you can gain there are huge.  This perception could be due to being all new players, and maybe we would prevent that in the future.

Playable.  My enjoyment might increase if I read the novel and get better attachment to the theme.  But I am much more likely to just dispose of this game.

The disaster cards are clearly much worse than the researchers and ships.  This needs to be made clear to any new player.  I dislike "false choices" in games.  This game has a correct way to play.

This is solid, original Euro, not maybe all that strategically deep but with lots to occupy the mind. The connection mechanic whereby the Swarm gets constructed is only somewhat artificially related to the theme, but apart from this the game has lots of flavor, and the classy art and highly varied gamepieces (especially the "damage" tokens) add a lot to its distinctive feel. The rulebook is competently written, but a bit paltry, and says remarkably little about the German novel that the game is supposed to be based on. Designers who write this sort of rulebook should be locked in a closet for 48 hours with nothing but a copy of Twilight Struggle.

Hardly the worst game I've played.  The board design is really quite good, and the game plays well.  The only question is whether or not it plays well enough to be chosen over a different game, and that's where it falls short; it's really pretty good, it's just not quite good enough.  My copy will see more plays, I'm sure, but it won't be in danger of wearing out.

Also, the crab is fairly useless.

Uses the pseudo-auction mechanism from Wikinger to good effect, but seems to both less deep and more convoluted than that game.

For some reason this is rate low, and cheap. This is a great bargain then. It plays fast, scales well, and while simple, does have depth. Balancing what cards you want to take (and maybe pay extra for) versus each rounds' strategy is interesting. There is some randomness in the tiles you may get, but it doesn't usually kill you. Points can be had in a few ways but there can be kingmaking.

Decent tile-laying game with some bonus mechanics. "Decent" is probably the pervasive adjective for the title, it didn't really bring anything particular strong, neither mechanics, novelty, solidity, thematic enthrallment, strategy or unadultered sense of enjoyment. All involved mechanics (random tile drawing, strategic tile placement, network building, blocking opponents, damaging opponents, point spending to jump ahead when drawing cards, turn order selection, etc) felt like weakly interacting rather than natural aspects of an holistic entity. Mildly charming though not particularily engrossing theme.

Intriguing connection game where players are trying to connect research centers to the center of the board (where Der Schwarm resides) and to the opposite sides of the board.  There's a round where players draft (and pay for) actions and then a round where the actions are played.  The decision making gets interesting as there are a number of ways to block your opponents, ship their research ships and even attack their stations.  Certainly worth a few more plays.

After a couple plays, I have to agree with the naysayers: there really isn't a whole lot here. Everybody basically does the same things, just in a slightly different order, so there's not much difference between players' strategies, and I don't anticipate future games playing very differently. There's a little more to it with more players, I suppose, but I'm not excited enough by the monotonous play to want to bring this out and teach. Ultimately, this is about as light as Carcassonne, but takes twice the time. I anticipate it gets one more play before hitting the trade pile.

A German-style game of exploration and route building based on the novel. This may be my favorite Kramer and Kiesling Game, yet !!  I love this better than Survive!  A better 2 player than Survive-Escape from Atlantis. A neat experience; a game that is more than the sum of its parts. I like the rules, but there are many ways to get the rules wrong.

Not a gateway game. I'm having great difficulty getting this game played, i.e. seems to have a smaller fan base than it deserves, IMHO.

Based one one play: The two designers usually produce great game, but this one is out there. The theme alone is odd and the mechanics seem just piled together and just seem odd. From the race to get to the center to block others and have events attack your opponent, the game does not play smoothly, just a bunch of items added in here and there. The card/action selection where you pay points to take actions is a good mechanic, but that's all this game has going for it.

This game has great components and a bizarre theme (having not read the book), but boiled down it's really a route-building game.  You're trying to collect tiles with which you can extend your network, and have some opportunity to block your opponents or otherwise mess with them a little bit.  Like many Eurogames, the key seemed to be efficiency.  Overall, I found it to be a decent game, but it didn't really jump out at me.

This is a Kramer and Kiesling tile laying game. It's essentially an abstract where you sail your boat meeple around collecting tiles, and then placing the tiles so they connect your spots with the center. At the end of each (very short) round you do a scoring for each thing that has your color on it in that chain. There are also some cute animal meeples that players take command of to damage each other. I don't know what the thematic reason is for any of this, as I haven't read the book this game is themed for. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this game, but I still don't know if I would ever play is instead of any of my other tile laying games.

What's to like? It is a quick game, will play in about 1.5 hours with 4. It is thematic and lovely to look at as you play. It has excellent production quality and everything fits in the box nicely, they tray actually has a place for everything (way to go Kosmos, a lot of companies could learn from your example.) The game itself is pretty simple, create as many connecting paths to the centre as possible and score them multiple times in different rounds. The screwage factor is there but minimal.
The only thing I didn't like is it can be anti-climatic. If one guy connects all four "coasts" he will almost win automatically. Normally I would rate this a 6 but bumped it to 7 for theme, production quality and quickness of play.

An inoffensive train game with a shoddily pasted on theme.

The "swarm" in this game is a network of paths. Players build this network, hoping that the tiles that belong to them connect as many sides of the board,

According to The Swarm (novel) entry in Wikipedia, the swarm has been responsible of millions of human deaths through tsunamis and epidemics. The swarm itself consists of "single-cell organisms that operate in groups (or swarms, hence the novel's title), controlled by a single hive-mind that may have existed for hundreds of millions of years. [The Swarm] form a collective intelligence and have inheritable memories that are passed on by manipulating parts of their DNA."

The Wikipedia article ends its synopsis with this moralizing statement:

"The knowledge that humans are not the only intelligent lifeform on Earth has plunged most religious groups into chaos, while parts of the world still suffer from the epidemic [the swarm] sent to destroy the threat to their marine homeland. Humanity now faces the difficult task of rebuilding their society and industry without coming into conflict with the ever-watching superpower under the sea again."

What is incredibly frustrating about this game is that you have no clue what the swarm is. It's unfortunate that the designers of this game didn't bother to tackle the deeper concerns of the novel: the idea of humans co-existing with another intelligent life form that can destroy them.

As for the game, the interesting gimmick is that in each game turn you must draft all your action cards before you play any of them. Track building itself is very luck prone. The board starts off covered with face down track tiles. You must draw these tiles to clear a path, then build your network in the cleared off path. Tile building becomes even more restrictive, and thus the importance of the luck of the draw increases.

I only tried a two player game of this; I suspect it would be more interesting and interactive with more.

I have had this game for a year or more and just never played it - the rating here just kept me assuming it couldn't be that fun.  Played it for the first time tonight and wow, it was very fun!

The first phase kind of has a bidding aspect to it.  Numerous action cards are laid out in a line, the first one is free and then getting more expensive up the line (the second one cost 1, the third one cost 2, etc.) The tension can build here and choices can get painful.

The heart of the game is the tile laying, trying to connect to the queen swarm in the middle of the board. Even in our 2 player game we were blocking each other and causing havoc.  The scoring system is interesting and the dangers are fun (the crab, whale, and tidal wave.)

This game is very under rated, we really really like it.  Due to its rating on here I really thought this was going to go straight to the trade pile after our first play.  Wrong. This is a keeper.

It's too bad stuff like this has fallen out of favor, because The Swarm is a really fun game. I'm an especially big fan of the way players basically pay for all of their actions up front, and then determine the order in which they will  play them. I've never seen anything quite like it.

The license feels like it might be part of the problem. I had never heard of the novel this is based on before playing the game, and only tried it on the recommendation of others. Its box doesn't really give any indication of what the game is like, if you just look at the front cover. Shame too, because this is one that deserves better than the bargain bin.

This is a weirdo connection game that in some ways feels like it should be in the same family as Cavum.  Rather than having action tiles, you draft action cards (ala Vinci).  Using the various cards you've recieved, you run around exploring, then in the clear areas you set up your swarm tube (??).  Don't ask me what is really going on here.

But it is rather fun, chock full of great decisions.  Probably best with three. 

Certainly an abstract euro, but the monsters and ships make this feel special.  There is some real joy to be had here.  It certainly feels like a classic Kosmos big box exploration game (if you know what that means), it has an Entdecker quality to it, better than Nautilus almost as good as Giganten.

After 1 play...

An interesting game, really, but probably not for us: it depends on bashing the leader in order to keep everyone close, and we don't like those games very much! Still, the mechanisms are pretty cool and it plays very quickly (maybe too quickly? Seems pretty difficult to connect all 4 sides!).

--- Summary ---
Players start with 20 RP (research points = victory points). The board's central sea area is covered with random face-down tiles. Players start with 1 research station on the board. Action cards are placed in their appropriate spaces (# varies with player number), including regular and special actions, and turn-order cards; regular ones are available every round, special ones vary each round. The first part of each round is action acquisition, in typical Showmanager style: the outermost card is free; to get other cars, pay 1 RP per card skipped. Everyone will end with the same # of cards. Then, in turn order, acquire a special power for the round (double RP earned from researchers, move boats 4 instead of 3, get free 4-way tile, or get partial protection from disasters).

Then players, in turn order, play a single action card. Cards allow you to deploy additional research stations and/or workers, deploy/move boats, create/move disasters, place tiles onto open water, etc.

- Moving boats: spend the MP shown on card to move ship(s). Moving off covered tile --> add it face up to your display.
- Play tiles: tiles have 2, 3 or 4 connections. May play onto open ocean, or on top of other face up tile (but must maintain all connections already present). Score RP according to #amoebas shown on each tile placed. Place one of your color markers on tile (if playing over another player's tile, their marker stays as well).
(If your network of boats/tiles connects to central square, place your marker on that square.)
- Add station/worker: place station/worker on space on edge of ocean.
- Disasters: crab moves clockwise, tidal wave starts at center and moves in 1 direction (must go towards land), whale moves 3 spaces orthogonally. Moving these over enemy ships/stations --> they lose RP according to their score track position; you gain those RP.

At end of round, score RP for your biggest network (=connected path of tiles and/or boats and stations) = 1 RP per anything of your color (markers, boats, researchers, stations).

Game ends after 3 rounds. Get final bonus RP for connecting 2, 3 or 4 sides = 10, 30, or 50 RP! Most RP wins.

RATING: 8.5
8.5 is a tentative rating that may go up.  This game has a number of interesting elements but I'm not sure how well they are all tied together.  I'd like to play it with 4 before I settle on a rating because it seems like it would be just enough tighter to make blocking a valid tactic...generally with tile laying games, I tend to want to be able to try to block opponents when I don't have a better placement.

I have played with 4 now and indeed, I find it to be the best balance of crowd and options.  Blocking does become a valid tactic, but it not overpowering--if you can do it while pursuing your own goals or not deviating far, you should--it can force you opponent to take more ship cards to reveal more tile connection types..  There are very interesting tactics awaiting those willing to learn the tile roster, since you can only overlay (and therefor join with) a tile with one with more connections--and those gold tiles make a great block or threat and keep those looking to block away from you.

Moved the rating from 7 to 8 now 8.5.  This game gets better with more play.  The elements are actually well-tied together.  The catch-up mechanism with the dangers is a little forced (at least it appears so without having read the book).  The game plays even better with 4 players who know what they're doing, the research points become very tight, and the decisions between when to go for player order (and therefor "special ability") become quite painful.

There is a bidding advantage to going last which is worth paying attention to, since you will either force your opponents to pay a lot of RPs to get something early, or you'll get it for cheaper.

The timing on this seems excellent, and we look forward to more "research" into how it plays out.  Contrary to some reports, "beating on the leader" is not possible.  The only way to do that is to use up your valuable "wild" action to activate a danger.  And even then, a judicious leader will be able to minimize or eliminate dangers because they can chose to move them as well and you don't damage your own pieces when you're the one moving the danger.

I'm not sure about the comparisons to Sunken City, the games play out remarkably differently and the whole bidding for the actions makes for a radically different experience.  I suppose that there is tile-laying and it is over water, but seriously, they're nothing alike.  The best part about this one, compared with Sunken City, is that SC can digress into pretty severe AP with players prone to that.  This one, does not.

Oh and read the book, it's a great ride!

We've played several times now, with both 3 and 4, and it I'm sticking with the 8.5 rating.  It is very entertaining, and quite challenging with competitive players, while remaining a reasonably quick play.

WAAAY better than Cavum, as a comparative.

- gameplay seems a bit dull and predefined (always connect more or less the same things in similar way)
- There is interaction, but it has limited impact.
- some balancing issues ?

The double action card seems overpowered especially in the first turn.

Read the book afterwards. Very nice artwork and great game in general.

RATING: 5
Mechanically sound and works well enough, but it lacks a certain something that would really make it pop.  Despite a theme that should click for me, and despite there being some interesting choices to be made, so far it hasn't made it to a point where I'd consider it really exciting. I can't even put my finger on why that is and I doubt I'll spend the time finding out. Not a bad game, but there are so many better games out there I doubt it'll see much table time.

Excellent artwork makes this look like it will be heavy with theme but it's actually quite an abstract effort.  Works well overall but the scoring bonus for building from multiple sides seems far too powerful.

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution

Why we culled it: I bought this through a charity auction, and it was mostly to support the cause. That said, I was attracted to the included tsunameeple. Just not enough to actually play the game. It sat for a few years and ended up on the chopping block when the cull happened. It is currently living in the game library of our FLGS, where it does occasionally see play.

Acquired in a trade. 

My first play was a 3 player game and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Every aspect seemed to be very well implemented. I've been playing different games looking for a connection game that I enjoyed and this one is it. I've not played Cavum so I don't know how to compare the games. I have played Sunken City but I really felt it was a bit too thin. Der Schwarm fills in from there. 

This is a really good game that I'm surprised flew under the radar big time. Sad to say, maybe when the ZMan edition comes out this will see more exposure.

This is a very interesting game with well thought mechanics that fit very well the theme. You will not be disappointed playing this game.

You can buy this big box game on Tanga for $6.99 right now. I got to play it, and it's actually MUCH better than I expected. Very fun, relatively quick, easy to learn and lots to think about. You need to collect tiles, lay the tiles you collect, build a network, and protect your assets while attacking the assets of your opponents.
Don't let the bargain basement price fool you. Worth way more than $6.99.

Even though the theme is definitely different (hard to grasp if you have not read the book), the mechanics combined in this game are very familiar. They are combined in a very enjoyable way though! The game offers a sweet trade-off between immediate and end-of-game points, a need to assess each action card's relative value for the next round (before you pay for them with victory points), and multiple ways to add some of your opponents' points to your own (the giant crab, whales and tsunamis). You need to think ahead in order to make your connections in time, while the interactivity between players (even with only two) is very tangible at the same time. A very enjoyable experience!

After two games: serious game. Lot of possibilitise to make points.
Some luck when picking tiles. Four sides tiles helps a lot.

Finally got this to the table! Considering it was a sort of gag gift Chris gave me last Christmas, costing only $7 on clearance on Amazon, it sat there a long time unplayed. There is only one video about it, and it is not in English and is a sped up video with no commentary. Turns out the game is pretty good.

Nothing to write home about, but an engaging little game nonetheless. Each round there is a preliminary draft of action cards and then actions are executed. Thus, it has a bit of a programming element, but it's fairly straightforward. The spatial element here is fun as well, and the little shark, tidal wave, and crap meeples that you hurt your opponents with are cool. A solid, if unspectacular mid-weight game. UPDATE: increasingly less convinced by this game, which is unfortunate cause I own the damn thing! It just seems like every game plays out the same, which makes the thought of playing kind of boring; and with so many good games in my collection...

A route building, tile laying game that I think loses something in translation from the German since the theme seems recognizable in German.  A bit too much take that?

I love this game. Its twixt with world building and VP stealing combat with a theme that does not feel pasted on!

I felt like i just picked up an out of print gem from the 1990's and loved it.

Best with 3.

This game is underrated. Quick, strategic, with high interaction. A mixture of tile-lying, bidding, and spoiling plans of your opponents... Played only 2-p version predict it is even more tense with more players. Highly recommended!

A generous gift from Michelle. You were right - we like it very much! Thank You :kiss:

Even though the mishmash of mechanics in Der Schwarm seem to work for the most part, they do have the unfortunate effect of making the game feel very busy.  The auction of action cards; the exploration and tile laying; the activation of disasters; and finally the tallying of points after every round.  While all of these are interesting in their own individual respects, as a whole it becomes a chore, and you get to do it four times.  Very susceptible to bashing the leader, and also possible to take someone out of the game completely so he has no chance to catch up.

I'm going to echo the sentiment that Der Schwarm may have tried to be a product which can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers, but ended up missing the mark on both accounts.

Pretty much what I've come to expect from Kramer: 2 hours trying to grok and manipulate mechanics rather than playing a game. An awesome theme wasted on "connecting sides for bonuses".

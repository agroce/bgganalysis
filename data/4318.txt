Sort of Roads & Boats lite with a film star theme but while I love the grander game on which it is based, this just failed to work for me

I have only played it with 2 and 3 players, but found it very tactical. The old boys network tile need to be played early in the game to get high scores. I am considering playing both tiles in my next 2 or 3 player game.

{1 play • 4 players} Well, I'm glad to read Dan Bosley's game ended in a 0-0-0 tie, because I was the only person to sell a movie in our game, winning 13-0-0-0!  We read and reread the rules afterwards, and, dang... apparently we did NOT miss anything.  Well, except for any sort of satisfaction at the end of this game.  Had it been great up until that point, that'd be one thing.  But despite an interesting method for drawing tiles, it was just a so-so, puzzley connection/production game.

RATING: 3
As Gertrude Stein said about Oakland, "There is no there there." The end-game conditions guarantee that the game is over before it even gets going. The game has some wonderful ideas; I just wish they had been teased out into the design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme and ideas in this game outweigh the actual game play slightly.  Games are likely to come down to the final tile draws and thus strategy seems to focus on positioning tiles to take advantage at the end game.  It would be more interesting if more movies were made during the mid-game.  Game play is similar with different numbers of players.  Overall, it is a descent game with interesting mechanics, but the game has a slight feel of incompleteness.

I played this game once with 3 players and I wasn&#039;t crazy about it.  Maybe we played incorrectly, but it seems like as soon as one person gets a network established, they can continue to use it each round to make a movie and if you are behind, you get further and further behind each round and have no hopes of catching up.  Will try this again to see if my opinion improves.

This game seems to have been designed such that your first play requires the level of knowledge you will have upon your thirty-first. A fact that is intrinsically intriguing. That's the only reason I've still got this game. Hats off to the Splotterers.

RATING: 6.5
I bought this from a friend for an insanely cheap price.  Yeah, I know the game is not well regarded, but I'm a Splotter completionist.  I admire their designs mightily, and although the theme to this one is odd, there is a lot to admire here too.  In many ways, it is like a pocket Roads and Boats.  This is basically a pick-up-and-deliver game, and it works well for what it is.  What I don't love about the game is the scoring methodology.  You can manipulate the values of the items you are delivering, but not much.  In fact, in most of the games I've played, they go down one or two, then back up one or two, and repeat.  So, the winner winds up being so named often by a thin margin, with most of the game coming down to one last delivery/manipulation of value.  Not the most exciting or tense.  This one might not last in the collection, as it doesn't get played often, but for the collector, I'd recommend it as another strange Splotter design doing some interesting and unusual things.

RATING: 7
Good game. A little abstract as far as "making movies" goes, but it gets the job done. Interesting methods of production, kind of like connect-the-dots. It's also pretty short, and everyone wants to crank out as many movies as they can, so it stays interesting until the last round. No anti-climax here, really.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting, but the Splotter people have now officially dropped off of my "buy" list to the "try first". Their games are so close, and have such interesting ideas, but they just can't seem to finish the job, and I've ended up disappointed with all of their recent games - not just because they weren't that great in the end, but because they could have easily been great with just a little more. I strongly suspect that like Ur: 1830 BC, Cannes will continue to lose ground with more play rather than gain. I doesn't help that this is an obvious attempt to paste Roads & Boats into a new theme, and the results are bizarre.

This game is the hilarious missing link between Great Zimbabwe and Roads and Boats. The themeing and art are pitch perfect and the game has got a fair bit of meat on its bones.  I'm really looking forward to exploring this one.  I'll start this off at a hopeful 8.5.

RATING: 7
This was MUCH better than I expected.  But its still butt-ugly, and there is no denying it.

When I play Roads and Boats, I find myself enjoying the first 2/3 of the game, and hating the end.  The networks just start getting so big I can't track it all anymore...and it begins to feel like work. 

Cannes addresses this issue by limiting the size of the network by your 5 rods (and any cigars in play). It keeps the logistics down to a digestible level of complexity for me that is still fun. 

The theme carries this game very well. Its silly, and it engages you. I have to admit, after a while I didn't find the art so grating or distracting. I'm looking forward to playing this one again some time. I had expected to want to trade it off, but I think its worth having.

RATING: 5
Played a three player game. Which I won. However, that didn&#039;t help me like it a lot. It&#039;s ok I guess. I wouldn&#039;t recommend leaving out some of the tiles as suggested in the rulebook for three people. Our game was over before one player managed to make more than two movies. There is some room for clever play. One thing that seems to stand out for me is the gameplay doesn&#039;t mesh well with the theme. This game just doesn&#039;t cut it for me. Traded this for Queen&#039;s necklace.

RATING: 8
An excellent logistics game involving a tech tree and pick-up-and-deliver mechanic.  The art is bad but it is functional.  It's easy to see which tiles have which functions.  It is tactical and filled with interesting decisions.  Its reputation as the little brother to Roads & Boats is well-deserved.  Given that it scratches a similar itch in a fraction of the time, it is sure to hit the table more often.

Cannes--not. 

We all just played a tile-laying game called Cannes. We universally did not like it. Cat'r has played it twice and had the same reaction both times. The basic premise is gathering components in order to make movies. But the main problem with the game is that it's over before you can make more than one movie (or even one movie at *all*). There are lots and lots of chits for movies and money, but you never need them/get to use them because the game ends too quickly and abruptly.

There was a reason Cat'r got this originally-$60-game for $6. And the artwork! It looked like a six-year-old did it! I can see paying $60 for the gorgeous Lord of the Ring cooperative board game. And for the equally gorgeous The Princes of Machu Picchu, with all its lovely artwork and all kinds of little perfectly-crafted wooden bits. But not this.

We hardly ever have this kind of reaction to a game--all of us. The last time was years ago, with O Zoo le Mio. Blurgh.

RATING: 7
Played my first game with 4 and it left me with a strong "want to play again" feeling which is always a good thing.  I'll echo similar comments that the game is very tactical and I certainly spent 3/4 of the game trying to figure out what I was doing until something finally clicked.  Very much looking forward to future plays.

RATING: 6
There is good and bad about this game. THe good thing is the fact that it is, I think, the first topological growth game, where growth is assisted or hindered by the placement of tiles in the vicinity of the tiles which do the actual growing. The authors have devised an engine and detailed its workings in the rule book... but in practice you are limited by what you can play and activate. To my knowledge it was not until Glen More before this concept was revisited. You can see how the authors of Cannes solved the problem that parts of the engine will never be connected: they created 'parties' which in essence act like wormholes. They twist the topology by making tiles adjacent which are physically not adjacent. It's a crude fix, but it gets the job done—and subjectwise the idea of a party isn't that bad, actually.

The downside is the [i]horrible[/i] artwork which looks like it's been drawn by a child, or by someone who took a handful of drawing lessons and was then commissioned to do the artwork of this game. It genuinely detracts from playing the game, which is something that this title does not really deserve. This and the fact that the ideas were really years ahead of the competition meant that the owner of this game sold it off before I got a chance to properly learn it; I've always regretted that decision because there is definitely more to Cannes than meets the eye. Perhaps I can pick it up on the cheap, or create my own set... I can't draw well either, but I should be able to do better.

I just haven't been inspired to figure this one out and give it a try, although I've sat down to do so several times.  This is usually a sign.
Update:  I finally tried this game--I really enjoyed it!  I still think it is really ugly, but the game play itself is quite fun.  It has a similar feel to Roads & Boats, but plays in a fraction of the time.  It did seem to end a little too quickly--I'll have to see how it works when the players all have more experience with the game.

A couple plays now, and I enjoy it as much after #2 as after #1.  Our three player game ended with scores of 69, 60, 56.

In both games the winner had a pretty good process for movie production, but I wonder if the old boys cigars can be used to counteract that.

Fiddly, fiddly, fiddly. Earn this, trade for that, then trade these for that.... counters flying everywhere. Then, in the end, what matters most is if you draw one of the 3 film making tiles or, perhaps, if you're just to thier left so you can make the best of those films.
Yes, there are ways to boost the values of your films, but in the end it seems to come down to player order & a dose of good luck despite all the counter swapping.
Blech.

A research-tree economic exploration pick-up-and-deliver game (somewhat like Goldland), with a really unintuitive theme (making movies), yet it somehow manages to work.  Lots of clever elements to this game, like the constraint of five sticks per player, the telephones that act like wormholes, and the "old boys' network" that everyone can share.

If you like oddities, you have to appreciate this bizarrely themed game with art from a middle school DIY session.  We had much the same problem as others have mentioned - the game went too quickly and none of us could quite figure out what to do.  We ended up 13-13-0-0.  Probably works better with fewer than four so there are enough turns to actually accrue enough points to make the result interesting.

Once you see how it works though, it's really not that hard to understand.  There is a fairly simple resource collection strategy which has to be combined with a spatial understanding of the placement of hexes and your network through them.    I thought about this game afterwards more than I expected, but my fear is this is one that goes from "what the hell" in play 1 to "this is pretty interesting" in plays 2-6, and then maybe on to "okay, but let's try something else" after that.  Despite its initial inscrutability, it's fairly simple and straightforward and I wonder how much life can be wrung from it.

Cannes is a connection building game that for some reason tries to bury its obvious logistics focus under an ill-fitting theme and craptastic illustrations. The limited, shifting player networks make for a fairly dynamic experience even though the "market" is not particularly compelling. Nevertheless, the game works perfectly fine as is. Then again, some of the competition has implemented the logistics dance more convincingly.

new week of 10-30-10. After two plays, the game ends too soon. There must be 50 scoring tiles in the box. No one ever is going to need them. There are not enough tiles in the box to be able to use those tiles, The game would have been a whole lot better if they had reduced the scoring tiles by 80 percent and added a bunch more hexagons to the box. Another play last evening results in the rating going up by 1/2 point but this game is going to have a hard time climbing any further up the scale.

I really want to like this game more.  It's mechanics are fun.  It's theme is good.  Components are nice.  It's just to easy for one person to throw the game into disorder, by burying the movie tiles.  So, more times then not the movie tiles only come out near the end of the game, so it's only about making 1 or 2 movies and ending the game.

(Played once and had a great time, a person that had played a few times with me and had seent he above problem, played two movie tiles in the first three turns so we wouldn't fall into that trap.  The game was then about making movies and your network and moving the network around.)

There is quite a bit about this game that I think I might like.  However, the first play was rather frustrating as not one of us actually produced a movie before the game was over (granted all three of us were new to the game and were figuring things out as we played).  There's a fair bit to think about in where you place the tiles and how you form your network.  Pink tiles can be very effective in blocking depending on how the board is forming.  The modular board allows for a different gaming setup each time you play which can help replayability.  With no one playing movie making tiles early in the game, we were all wasting a considerable amount of resources.  The variant one person mentioned on this board requiring people to play any green movie tile they pull and getting an additional tile to play as well to compensate might be well worth the while.  The randomness of the tile draw may also frustrate some people although I think that will add to the flavor of the game in future plays now that I have an idea of how to play this game more effectively.

Splotter claims it's a small scale version of Roads & Boats. I can only partially agree, as the resemblance is quite small. It can work nicely though and the graphics are ugly in a fun way. When it doesn't work (i.e. people keep discarding the crucial tiles) and no/few films get produced it is somewhat boring though.

I really like all the Splotter games I've played, and this one in particular is very nice.  The key as far as I can tell is to pay very, very close attention to what your opponents are capable of doing, and working to get rid of the old boy cigars before they can actually do it....

This is actually a much better game than I had been led to believe based on the rating and comments.  Some clever decisions need to be made to arrange your network to maximize your abilities to create films.  The artwork is really subpar, and actually makes it difficult to see what is happening.  Also, it should be made more clear that the production can only be done AFTER all the routes are described.  At least, that's how we interpret it, but please let me know if I am wrong.  A much maligned Splotter title that actually is better than a lot of drek from the Euroworld these days.

A unique Splotter design (a bit Roads & Boats, a bit of Bus) that's a pick-up-and-deliver game with a movie producer theme that actually fit the gameplay.  The goal is to create networks that will ultimately provide what's needed to create a movie.    I've only tried it with 2 (which worked well) but I'm thinking the sweet spot is probably 3.

In my one play, the game never seemed to get off the ground. I assume because of the order in which the tiles were played, we spent most of the game doing nothing. All the points were scored in the last two rounds and the game ended in a tie. Yawn.

Some interesting mechanisms here but I understand they were redeveloped into later, better games.

This is very obviously part of the Splotter family of graph-based resource-conversion games -- if you like Roads and Boats and Duck Dealer, but only have an hour, this is worth trying if you can accept a big luck factor.  (Possibly skilled play could mitigate the luck, but I don't see anyone playing this enough to get that skilled.)

First impression (2 player) : It's a connection building and resource-management game. You build up structure out of tiles and connect yourself to those tiles via one connected network. Job is to collect resources, refine them and then create films and gain victory points by having your films shown on Cannes. 

Tactical game mostly but there seems to be at least some strategy about how to place tiles to existing fields so preferably only you can get it cheap enough to be worthwile. Game worked very well with just two players and I wouldn't even want to try it with four but three might be the sweet spot for it.

Certainly not the best Splotter, but an enjoyable production game nonetheless. Would have liked it to last a little longer; by the time it gets really interesting, it's over.

A heavy economic game masquerading behind comic artwork and a light theme. Goods acquisition, multiple levels of processing/refinement, and market manipulation make this most similar to Le Havre. Hex tile placement, route building, and blocking add an interesting twist to the mechanics. A good design.

The primary resources yielding secondary resources to yield tertiary resources took a while to grasp especially within the confines of the networks built - but first game ended reasonably close and I look forward to trying again.  Advantage for this game is its short playing time for this type of resource management game.

Another Splotter game with minor issues.  I like the game concept, but sometimes it falls short on game play.  It depends on how players put down the tiles.  Sometimes a tile has to be played for the betterment of the game and not all players will do that.

--Jun2015-- Quite amusing.  It's fast; straightforward; entertaining.  And wasn't remotely tempted to stagnate with my colleagues: for whatever reason, it worked quite tractably for us.

Nice light network game with a fun theme and weird texta art. Players very quickly for a Splotter chit explosion also, around 45-60 mins. I really enjoyed this one.

People complain about the luck of the draw, but there are so many ways to mitigate it. You've got the phone lines, the cigars, the parties -- all good ways to sneak your network to where it needs to be.

After first play: A pleasant surprise! I'm surprised that it gets such a low rating on here. The mechanics are compelling with tough decisions and yet it holds its theme very well. It's not hard to understand what one needs to do, but actually accomplishing it is tricky. Players were getting in each other's way and the old boy's club is very interesting. Initial score 8.

Boy is it ugly.  

This is a solid pick up and deliver brainburner.  It is fun to get your limited resources all lined up coming together.  I'm always, always, always one stick too short for what I want to accomplish.  I really think this game will reward players who will invest in learning the system, yet will continue to be entertained by the modular board.

I wouldn't play this with four though, or the downtime will kill you.

I liked the concept of this game very much, but found the execution somewhat lacking.  Unless the board is built in an unusually felicitous configuration, it is very hard to put together any sort of productive network.  The game often ends just as it seems to be kicking into gear.
I would say 'close, but no cigar', but it does have cigars, so I'll just say 'close'.

a game of making movies, bribing reviewers, and using the old boys network to get stuff done! there is a simple tech tree that you must navigate to get your movies produced.  lighter than i thought it would be and incredibly charming. 

quirky artwork fits the spirit of the game perfectly. 

if you are the type of person who dislikes games that end as soon as you get your engine going... avoid this.  i personally like games that do this.

Got this as part of a Splotter pack that included Indonesia and Roads & Boats. Still own it, and haven't gotten it to the table due to other games stealing the spotlight. I'm sure it's a fine game, though.

An interesting tile-laying set-collection pick-up-and-deliver (sort of) game where you are laying tiles creating a geography, and building links (some public, some personal) between them allowing you to collect the resources you need in order to make movies (e.g., actors, scripts, special effects, etc.) -- and release them when there is the biggest audience (there's a bit of supply-and-demand economics here, too). Surprisingly, the theme really works!

RATING: 3
The rules are not intuitive at all. Because I'm geometrically challenged, it's even less intuitive for me than the average player.  The gameplay is different to say the least.  It's not everyday that you play a game that allows you to influence critics with beer!  It seems difficult to actually make a movie, which I suppose can be said to mirror reality.  Doesn't hold much appeal for me, but maybe I'll enjoy it more a second time.  Maybe.

The game that people suggest you play if you don't have a copy of Roads an Boats. I have played Roads and Boats and I wanted to buy it after playing it. I own this, and figure that I would consider holding on to it if I didn't have 300 other games to play instead. Will probably sell.

Typical Splotter-offering: convoluted gameplay in search of a convincing theme, with very silly graphics. Do they use child labour or something? Still, I kinda enjoyed my only play, so this gets a tentative 6.

This game has some real potential, but for 4 players it falls a little flat.  I'd like to try it with 2 or 3 and see how it plays.  The mechanics and play are solid and fun, and the artwork is nowhere near as bad as some make it out to be.  But the game, so far, seems a bit too limited in the end-game.  From the some of the comments about scores though, it makes me think that the 2-3 player route might be best.

I think it needs a slightly larger tile mix--one more sheet of 8 tiles would have helped immensely.  Also there are too many chip production tiles since they are only used to make computers and it only takes 1 chip to make 1 computer.  The other base production tiles have 2 uses.  The game feels like it got really close and then testing stopped about a month before it should have OR expense limited the tile sheets so that you're effectively 8-10 tiles short of what the game should be.

Game with the worst art in the world, only saving grace is that it's a Splotter game unfortunately it just didn't work with my group. In theory it seems like a solid game, but to get anywhere you have to somewhat cooperate with others but there is only one winner.

Kind of like Neuland. Though the board state is much easier to read than in the ZMan edition of Neuland (despite all the criticism of Cannes' artwork).

In place of Neuland's time track and expiration-prone workers, there's a smallish board of tiles that you want to connect via your colored sticks. Your stick network has to remain connected, and you can actually hold on indefinitely to the resources you obtain (though the quantity is limited to five, which is pretty tight).

The players draw 3 tiles on their turns and place some subset of them (dependent on a couple of things), growing the board slowly. As certain tiles exist only in very limited quantities there can be a quite different feel to the development of the board from game to game. This random element is a large difference from Neuland.

The game is weirdly short. My first game, a 3p (for which you are actually told to remove some tiles from play!) ended in a three-way tie with every player having cashed in a single movie. The "old boys" tile didn't come out until late, so only one "cigar" track (i.e. that anybody can use) ever got deployed.

For 3p, at least, I think the mechanisms need some kind of rebalancing. Adding the removed tiles back in might be harmful to the player interaction, but perhaps the game could continue for some time after all tiles have been placed (which normally ends the game).

Player interaction comes in the form of your sticks blocking placement of another player's sticks, whether deliberate or incidental. It may frequently be the latter. As there are multiple approaches to each hex tile which can all be used at once, the blocking isn't as brutal as in Neuland. There is also interaction in the form of placing new map tiles to maximize inconvenience for the other players.

The rules and component material quality are actually pretty nice. The cardboard is thicker than Zimbabwe's and the box is about the same size, nothing like Antiquity.

...Tried playing where every other round of play, no tiles are drawn, and you can hold more goods on your board. This saw more movies getting made.

Blocking (usually inadvertent) of other players by your mere presence is effective enough that I think you can lose the game just for not being present in the area where you'd probably need to be and where you have no effective means of going.

Relatedly if you try to fix the game length issue by just continuing to play up to some score, even when the tiles are all out, you'd probably find that the game is already decided, due to the tile layout and where everybody is.

Blocking is so inadvertent that it actually makes the game feel solitaireish! I do find it fun, though.

The ending seemed both too abrupt (another round would have been about right) and too

This is an alright game, but not great. This is all about the network building, and not about making and storing goods to be used later. That can help, but a better built network will trump a storage strategy.

(Trade Interest: medium) hmm, interesting game.  seems fairly hard to create a movie.  we didn't create any movies until the game was almost over.  the links are interesting, and balance of having only five of them is cool. not sure how much interest there will be in a replay, but some.

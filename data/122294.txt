I like the events and the Unite and Trophy keywords, but the Soul Gems introduce more randomness than I like.  They can be quite swingy.

This set is a decent extension of Return of the Fallen, but not a must-have.

General thoughts on Ascension: I generally like the game, having the right level for complexity for what it is. It's definitely better with a low player count, as with five or six players (which you can play with only by combining two sets) the downtime gets a bit too much and the center line changes too much after your turn to really care about what is there. Combining sets is also problematic, as it make the deck unshufflable. If I were to ever buy a copy of Ascension, I probably get only set and player as a two-player game.

I have owned this one for a while and only this year sat down with it and played it, I like it a lot as the expansion to the first game that I played in the franchise it really should have hit the table sooner. I can say it made the game a bit easier and more lively at the same time, it made it a different experience  from a certain viewpoint. I will certainly play wit it again and am looking forward to mixing the two sets. A good investment if you like the series.

Expansion / 2 player game.  (Part of "Block 2" with Storm of Souls).

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

The Soul Gem cards are completely random and can sometimes give you a card that works out brilliantly with your hand and sometimes works out poorly.

This expansion adds more events (first introduced in Storm of Souls) which I really like.  I wish they'd kept events in the later released expansions as well.

I've played Immortal Heroes and have thus far been underwhelmed. I say this because I don't like the new Soul Gem mechanism. Some cards that grant Soul Gems seem too good (ie Soulshaper) and then others seem fine (Askara of Souls). None seem like a bad investment for their cost but it is a bit of risk/reward. It's not the randomness that bothers me the most, despite being pretty damn random. I think what bothers me the most is that even if the cards seemed properly costed and even if it wasn't crazy random, it's boring. How can I be excited about using all of these heroes that I've literally used thousands of times before? There is some excitement of the wonder of what you'll draw but it just bores me after I see what I get. They should have made something different for the soul gem deck. I will say that I do like the new events. I also really love the event placeholders which make events come up more with bigger center decks. The non-Soul Gem cards are pretty neat as well. Overall, I enjoy playing with this set despite the actual soul gem cards.

This was the first version of Ascension I played, however I've since purchased most of the expansions for the iOS version which is the only place I play anymore. I don't mind Ascension, it has moments of interesting gameplay, but I feel like I've moved away from deckbuilders over the course of the last year, so this holds less interest to me now. Playing on iOS is preferable for me at this time, however I'm still far more likely to play the iOS versions of Agricola or Lords of Waterdeep over Ascension. Arguably the best deckbuilder I've played so far, however.

The expansion is nice, but it doesn't make the game feel any different.  Despite the soul gems and some trophy monsters with ongoing effects, it's basically just new cards and events in make the game feel a little more fresh.  But it basically plays exactly the same, so it's only worth a purchase if you love the base set, but want more heroes or constructs to work with.  Need to play a few more times to see how well factions are balanced this time around.

The best addition from the expansion, IMHO, is the "New Event" cards, that way you can control how often you want events to change.  The one thing I thought the Storm of Souls set needed.

Favorite card:  [i]Wandering Askara[/i]

It's beautifully creepy—both in art and mechanics.  It's the paragon of what I love about this game.

(All plays gathered under [thing=108784]Storm of Souls[/thing].)

[size=7]Minor sour note:  The cardbacks in the expansion* are printed much lighter and less vibrant than those in [i]Storm of Souls[/i]**, making the new cards obvious.  Also, they're almost, but not quite, the same size—so riffle shuffling (the only true shuffle) is just a tad rough and the cards sort by size when overhand shuffled.  Yeah, sleeves would solve all of these "problems", but I hate hate [i]hate[/i] sleeves...  

Honestly, this won't affect my ability to play & enjoy the game—they are minor issues after all—but it would be nice if everything matched up and meshed without looking like glaring add-ons.

Immortal Heroes changed everything, I think for the worse, to begin with the fan base had to wait for ungodly amounts of time for the eventual release. This sets mechanics throw the whole balance of the game off, soul shards are a bad idea, period. I have played this stand alone, with storm of souls, and with the entirety of whats released and seen the victor be the person who got soul shards. Too agressive of a game change IMO.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2013)

As I (somewhat) enjoy my plays of Ascension, I was keen on trying Immortal Heroes. I like the new cards BUT I really dislike the Soul Gem mechanic. Ascension already has lots of luck with the variable market offering (low strategy, high tactics). Adding the Soul Gems adds more luck than I’m comfortable with so this is perhaps the worst game for me (so far) in the ascension series. 

Love the art!

I would recommend this only for diehard fans. Not for me though I won’t buy it.

The additional events are a great addition and spice up this aspect of Storm of Souls quite nicely.

The soul gems add another random element to Storm of Souls and some players might not like it. But once you know which cards are in there it helps you to asses the value of cards giving you Soul Gems.

As a stand-alone, I do not enjoy [i]Ascension: Immortal Heroes[/i] at all.  The one time Soul Gem cards add more randomness to an already random game.

I rate this lower than the other Ascension expansions because the new Soul Gem mechanic is too fiddly (and adds a much larger element of luck than before, but more for it's tedium than anything else).  There's also more text on some cards than in other sets.  

Nevertheless, there are many fun cards here, and I'm pleased to add them into custom blocks.  Overall, I'm still happy I bought it.

Another small expansion, but a great one. The new Soul Gem mechanic is pretty awesome. There are loads of card effects that have to you gain a "Soul Gem" which is a drawing a card from a new deck of cards on the side. They have one shot abilities that must be used that turn or they're lost. Once again some great new cards and combos. As usual, nothing bad to say here.

[u]02-Jul-2015[/u]:  This is falls square under the Deckbuilder category of games.  You begin with a small, standard set of cards.  Then throughout the game you will acquire better, stronger cards to play on future turns.  The Ascension "system" includes two forms of currency (strength and money, essentially).  And it has a sort of conveyor belt system for the market - it has six randomly drawn cards which are immediately replaced when bought or defeated.

Overall, I enjoy the system quite a bit.  I find it fun to play as you can make all sorts of card combos to increase the value of each turn.  It's not a thinky game by any means, but I do think there is more strategy here than many of the comments I've seen in the past.

As for the solo game, I have mixed the ultra small, portable Apprentice edition with the Immortal Heroes edition.   The Apprentice edition is just a small, 2P set of basic cards.  Nothing special but nice to have.  Immortal Heroes has several "extras" including Events, Trophies, and Soul Gems.  I find this combination of basic cards and the goodies from IH to give me the best bang for my buck.

However, I do not use the official solo rules.  I found them to be simple and uninspiring.  Instead, I created my own solo variant ([filepage=111622][/filepage]) based upon the Nemesis Beast from Star Realms.  I find my variant provides more variety and interactivity for the solo gamer.  It's the only way I'll play this one solo.

Finally, just a quick mention of the art as that gets a lot of comments as well.  I think these later additions to the game have fine artwork.  Not the best or necessarily my taste, but compared the original base game and first expansion, I think these are a big improvement.

I like the random element introduced by the Soul Gems, but I feel this set, when played alone, is strangely balanced - Mechana seems very weak, while Void is incredibly strong. In fact, Void seems so strong that Void cards are an instabuy over most other cards for me.

Nice expansion or standalone version of Ascension. Soul gems are a nice mechanic, though I'd preferred them to be more unique rather than versions of existing cards. Event and trophy mechanics add some good stuff to the game.

Really fun additions in this expansion.  The soul gems are randomizing but in an exciting way.  Ongoing trophies are a construct-like equivalent for void strategies.  I've still only played it standalone with two players, but I realy like this set.

Adds some interesting bits but there's too much randomness in the soul gems.

Edit: Over time have realized that most souls gems are similarly powered. Someone getting Dhartha luckily will win them the game, though.

It's much the same experience as the other Ascension base games. The addition of the Soul Gem cards doesn't seem to be enough to warrant purchase by itself. They're just another reward type, without adding any new depth or twists. Even if you were looking for just a 2 player game (which this provides) and didn't have any other base Ascensions, I'd probably still direct you to one of the others first ... more cards, more variety.

Pros:
Lots of good additions to the base game.
Soul Gems let me make Puella Magi as a custom player power :P

Cons:
Event cards add too much bookkeeping for an occasional benefit. Fortunately I can just leave them out.

Wow, really poor color matching on the card backs.  Resold immediately.

RATING: 7
Immortal Heroes adds the concept of "Soul Gems"--one time use cards that you can get as a reward for defeating an enemy, playing a card, or doing something else specified by a card you play.  While they're completely separate cards found in their own deck, they're just exact copies of popular cards in the main deck.  This adds some nice variety but detracts from planning, since you won't get the Soul Gem card until your turn is half over anyway.

Like many of you, I've played a lot of Ascension. I've logged ~350 online games and hundreds more against the AI (both almost exclusively 2 player) in Playdek's well-polished app. My 8 year old also really likes this in iOS form. Rather than playing bent over the screen, I thought I'd pick up a set to play with her. 

I've been ruined. The app allows me to play a game in ~10 minutes or asynchronously. IRL, I don't think the game lives up to its 45 minute play time. It's a fine game, but I'd rather play Dominion, Core Worlds, Nightfall, or Trains as far as deckbuilders go. They seem to have a better return on investment when considering depth vs. playing time. 

Ruined, I tell you!

After the 'Fait' from Return of the Fallen and the 'Unite' from Storm of Souls, again a very good addition with the 'Soul Gem'-cards. Hopefully they can keep adding good new principles to future additions :D

No ground-breaking additions here, but there is the occasional cool card. Soul Gems are pretty uninspired but have potential to be cool in future expansions, as the mechanic is neat, I just dont like the cards that make up the Soul deck. The new event cards are a welcome addition. Overall, it feels like Ascension is starting to lose steam

These people Ripped off Magic the Gathering mechanics, abilities, themes, and art style, then puked them onto the format of Dominion and Marvel Legendary.

As a gamer and a designer, I have never seen such blatant plagiarism and unoriginal work. This game was kickstarter- no wonder. Because they stole from everyone else. AND its not fun, boring, derivative, and ugly.

What a rip off. Lame unplayable hype. Garbage, of the lowest nth degree.

I did not notice while playing this game how awful it was... that crept up on me over the last few months.

Someone recently asked me if I wanted to play and I had a physical gag reflex.

If youve never played TCGs, strategy games, or deck building games, this may be fun for a few goes. But: you are missing out on much better games by wasting your time with this one.

I won the game way too easily. Beat Zack, the other players were inconsequential. Like 120 points, 50 pnt spread. Used constructs, mostly mechanoids, but stayed with purely constructs.

This Game sucks. I have many good reasons to support that statement. Many. Will share a few.

Left out all the wonderful icons, colors, and graphic representations that make Dominion, Legendary, and MTG great games that are easy to play after a while.

No card ability or type icons. ALL TEXT. ENDLESS TEXT. Must read every single cards full text over and over. Shit game.

100% stolen format of Dominion. 75% stolen abilities from Dominion.

75% stolen idea, art, and style of MTG.

50% stolen mechanics and abilities form Legendary.

Do not bother playing this if you are into good games, period.

This expansion seems to rebalance mechana and lifebound in the Storm of Souls block. Mechana was clearly the weakest in base Storm of Souls, and lifebound was the default strongest strategy. The new cards dilute the lifebound synergy cards a bit, and give a boost to mechana. 

Soul gems are fun, although a bit random. I'll have to play with them a few more times to flesh out my opinion of them.

Note - At the time of writing this, I've only played this game as a standalone. I intend to combine this with Storm of Souls if I ever get that at which point the rating as an expansion would take precedence.

Components - .7/1 Just like the others, good card stock, gems are nice. I fault the rule-book that it doesn't handle the descriptions of the new rules very well. It expects you to know the prior game rules, or know what they're called to download them from their site. At the very least, it should have called out explicitly what was needed.

Fun - .7/1 Definitely a good recharge after playing the original to death. It does feel like an incomplete experience though. There's a lot of pieces that feel like with a larger core pack that there would be much more combination to create. Overall a good experience. The wife still loves it.

Replayability - .7/1 Definitely enough rules that this game holds up surprisingly well for replays on its own. I would have figured given the smallish deck that this would have become tedious on its own quickly. It doesn't. My wife and I played quite a lot yet I haven't found it getting stale at the same pace as the core set. 

Strategic - .7/1 A fair amount of combo play, but given the small deck there's some strategies that seem unfinished (e.g. Mechana constructs, with other versions mixed in these would be much better)

Theme - .6/1 The theme rating for this comes from how it ties into the Ascension series. It's cool that the soul gems are basically all the cards from the original and the return of the fallen expansion. This makes it feel like the timeline has advanced some.

Personal Review - 3/5 As a stand alone this works, but it definitely has a lingering feeling that this would excel as an expansion rather than a standalone game. There is surprising amount of playability but there are things that seem to come up as incomplete, as I mentioned before these are likely the balance factors included when mixing sets.

RATING: 6
There are two new additions to the game in this expansion.

The first, and the smaller of the two additions, are ongoing trophy effects.  Instead of banishing a trophy to use its effect these are, exactly like they sound, cards that stay out and have a constant effect on the game (unless another card effect causes you to discard it).

The second addition is the Soul Gem mechanic.  Soul Gems are copies of cards from the base game that other card effects will give you in your hand for free.  These are pretty neat because they add to the already very chaotic nature of the game in a fun way.

All in all the game is still the same with some new stuff to play with though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK Ascension expansion; the addition of more events is welcome. The core novelty, however, is the set of "soul gems", random unique trophies that must be either used in the turn they are acquired or lost. These are a bit of randomness too far in an already quite random game -- the advantage of randomly picking up a one-use Master Dhartha gem over a one-use Arha Initiate is obviously significant.

The variety is nice but the game is worse with this expansion in it.

Great deck-building game. It has pure rules and can be played very fast but the theme and illustrations are making this a very interesting piece to have. Rules are the same in all Ascensions games and small things are adding a differtent flavour to every one. Here you can find soul gems which are one-time only boosts for your actions and it works very well. Definitely a nice game.

[thing=122294][/thing] is a good expansion (and stand-alone) for Ascension. It adds the soul gems cards, which are basically versions of existing cards that you can gain for free when using others cards from the set.

With its 164 cards, it is slightly bigger than the base game (as 55 cards aren't unique), and can work as a 2 players stand-alone game (such as the Return of the Fallen).

While this can be tossed along side the other expansions and base set, the dilution increases (not a problem of this set, but an overall issue), as with the 484 cards my huge deck currently has, is nearly impossible to count with something (be soul gems, events, transformations, etc).

Personally, [thing=122294]Immortal Heroes[/thing] is a little better than Return of the Fallen and a little worst than Storm of Souls. Yet, along side the base game, it does make it better.

I really enjoy playing of this deck-building.
Fast and easy to learn. Less waiting time, even with new players (2nd match).
I also really like the new meachanics with each add-on.
My personally max of players is 4, maybe 5.

This one got a lover rating, because of the bad translation and mistakes, fractions are wrong and so on (5 thinks like that in total!)

Meh. It felt more like a gimmick than a game. If the goal was to make a [thing=12333][/thing] filler, this ain't it because there is too much left out (and I'm not that big of a fan of TS). If you want TS-lite, go for [thing=177590][/thing] because it brings the DEFCON into play.
I base my comments on a single solo game, so take it with a grain of salt. I'll see if I can get others to play with me and update then, but for now, this isn't one I am really excited about hitting the table soon.

Surprisingly interesting and much more strategic when you'd expect from a 20-cards game. 

And it's certainly "Twighlight Struggle" condensed into 20 minutes which I think it's just amazing, since it preserves the essence of the game, but for me it makes it much more intense, since it's so quick.

RATING: N/A
Very quick and compact Twilight Struggle lite games - of this genre it is probably the most alike TS in terms of scoring region and placing influence (although on a much smaller scale). The box is a little big for what’s inside but an excellent travel game.

First came 13 Days, which was a very good attempt to condense Twilight Struggle into a 45 minute game. 13 Minutes, on the other hand, was much less successful and a clear disappointment. And now we have Iron Curtain, which actually is the best of the entire bunch.

Iron Curtain focuses on the spatial aspect of Twilight Struggle while retaining the tried and true cardplay seen in all the previous games. Bluffing isn't as prevalent than in 13 Days, and although you can only burn a single opponent card, sneaky maneuvers are still possible. The game plays in around 20 minutes, with the world map taking radically different forms each time, depending on the initial card distribution.

After having gotten Iron Curtain on the table over 50 times in just two months, this is my favorite two player area majority game, and my preferred game out of these small versions of Twilight Struggle.

A somewhat tentative rating since I've only played this once. This game is just 18 cards but has some weight to it. I was pleasantly surprised. The game really feels like a super-distilled Twilight Struggle as the card mechanics are similar. The adjacency rules of the cards will definitely add to the replayability and can be critical. I would have to play this more to see if the game is balanced but it at least felt balanced.

Good filler card game.  Needs an expansion of more cards to mix into and out of the deck for more randomization.

As a Twilight Struggle enthusiast, I’ve often been faced with the same problem most Twilight Struggle players have to deal with: really wishing to play it but being unable to put three or four hours aside in order to complete a full game.

Then I stumbled into Iron Curtain, which is the solution I was looking for: it’s Twilight Struggle condensed, as it makes for the same experience in only 18 cards and twenty minutes of play. Sure, it’s been necessarily (and heavily) dumbed down but it still drips with the same dilemmas as the original and overall provides a very enjoyable alternative to it.
And it only takes one tenth of the time!

The micro game fad has come and gone... Or has it? This is actually a pretty cool filler game that does a really good job of distilling the event or command points concept into 18 cards.

Experience wasn't helped by the quality of the demo. Distills everything I liked about 13 Days away.

Im always impressed when a game designer can take a simple concept (18 Cards/48 Cubes) and turn it into a deeper, meaningful experience, This reminds me of how I felt the first time I played Sails to India: A few cards, a few cubes and off you go. Yes, its 13 Minutes re-boot but IC does it better (for what it is - a half our cold war reboot with a buddy). Not sure of replay-ability yet. Seems like strategy may diminish after after a few plays due to lack of card variance   My only complaint is the ridiculous size of the box. Game would easily fit twice over in say; the Sails to India box. Oh well. iI never understood these decision. I just know its an unnecessary shelf hog where shelf space in a 600 plus game collection is a premium.

PS   I love the tie-breaker. US wins. Ha, love that.

A lovely fast 2p filler. Will likely be my go-to 2p filler.

RATING: 6.5
The cold war between the USA and the USSR in an extremely boiled down version of Twilight Struggle. The game is about area control by means of majorities of cubes on countries forming regions. The countries are on cards which form a map as they are played. Placement of the cards is important, because you can only move cubes into a country if you have cubes in the neighbouring country (= a card with a vertical or horizontal border with the card you want to place cubes on). If possible cards from 1 region have to be placed next to cards from the same region (even if this means you cannot reach it with your cubes...)
Points are scored for domination of countries and for domination of regions. Scoring takes place as soon as the last country of a particular region has been placed, and at the end of the game. Consequently, most regions will be counted twice during the game. 2 cards are not played during round 1. These are kept secret until the end of the game. The number of cubes on these 2 cards and the superpower to which the cards belong determines which of the two gains a max of 3 extra points. These are counted before the final regional scoring. Final regional scoring also takes place in a fixed order, starting with Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa,... The order is important, because as soon as 1 of the superpowers has a lead of 8 points, it is declared the winner, and the rest of the scoring doesn't take place.
As said, this is an extremely boiled down version of Twilight Struggle, but unfortunately it has lost just about all the thematic feel to the game. The actions on the cards lack historical context entirely. As a consequence, the story telling ability of the game is very low. A game like Cold War: CIA versus KGB does a lot better job in this respect. But as a filler game with a thematic scent to it, Iron Curtain is OK.

Después de unas cuentas partidas me parece un gran microjuego. Salvando las distancias, tiene la exigencia de un Twilight Struggle, concentradas en menos de media hora.

There are better filler games out there and I'd much rather play 13 Days for a shorter Twilight Struggle experience.  As a result, I don't see much of a reason to play Iron Curtain and I think it will struggle to find a place among other games.

Not convinced by this after two plays.  So few cards, it feels like it could get very similar in play after a few games.  The odd way to lay the map seems weird, and some of the card effects are not very clear from the text.  Also, the immediate scoring when placing a card is a challenge to accomodate.  I would much rather play 13 Days if given a choice.

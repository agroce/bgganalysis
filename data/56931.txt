An interesting game that gets a lot more interesting when you won't allow the forum to be in the wildcard slot.  The give-and-take with the dice and cards create a lot of variability and maneuvering.  It has a lot of fun in a small package.

A little more unpolished than the original, but it's hard to say that it's bad.  Some interesting new cards, but the bribing didn't interest me much.  Long live "The Fons"!  :)

RATING: 6
+ Great theme for a 2-player game; Interesting combinations and decisions based on the dice that you roll; Quick play time.
- Luck can play a large part here which can be frustrating at times.


Why it's previously-owned:
The two-player card game market is entirely too competitive to keep any such game around that doesn't completely knock your socks off.  While this is a good game, nothing about it stood out to me as being best-of-class.  
This got traded in a huge lot to a store in return for tons of goodies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Possibly too chancy; hard to tell after one play.  But a very clean game system, with several strategies evident from the start. I gather Roma has a different cardset, and I'd very much like to try out both at once.

Update: several more plays in, the chanciness is less of an issue.  It's certainly possible on occasion for luck to blow a player away, but there's always something to do to mitigate it; you can always scratch around somehow to improve your position.  Quite apart from that, this is simply an enjoyable game.  Fun with the kids too.

RATING: 8
As good as Roma (which I also rated an 8). If played by itself, Roma II is a very good 2-player game with many "take that" cards against your opponent and more ways to earn VPs than the original game. But the real way to experience them both is to play one against the other (each player draws from his own deck), which creates a very cool and unpredictable asymmetrical game. Oh, and the titular "Arena" card is one hell of a building!

De los Roma que hay , este es el que más me gusta, cartas mucho mas equilibradas y partidas mucho mas interesantes.

No es ni de lejos de los mejores trabajos de Feld, pero si lo adquieres a buen precio no es mala opción.

Por cierto no me gustaron las partidas en las que se mezclaron Roma y Arena.

Quick-fast take that game of card positioning, card powers and dice luck.  Can be played with its counter part to give each player their own deck, or mixed together to make one large draw deck for both players.

RATING: 9.5
Stefan Feld hits a home run with this 2-player game. Easy mechanics as well as a lot of take that in a head to head two-player game using dice as its main mechanism. You roll the dice and use them to either get cards into your hand, get money to play those cards from your hand or activate cards already on the table. The game can get cutthroat and nasty at times with cards that make your opponent lose cards, victory pints or money. Plus you are always looking for ways to destroy the cards your opponent has on the table. And with two different end game options : ending a round with more victory points than your foe after all the VP chits have been picked up from the supply or to just run your opponent out of victory points.  If you like 2-player games this is the one for you.

Similar in layout to Battle Line but very different in the way it plays. After three games I have worked out that it is all about the victory points. Once you get ahead, try to finish the game as quickly as you can. I don't have many "dice" games so am finding it fun to work out how to allocate the numbers. I can see that familiarisation with the cards will be helpful.

Superior to the first game, with less situations where you have a paralyzed state and have to just take the opponents attacks until you can do something. 

Plus, having the card text ON the card is HUGELY advantageous for teaching the game, or for picking it up again after a few weeks (wherein one forgets the icons).

This game is essentially the same as Roma, however there are enough differences to warrant owning both games.  Even the fact that you can play one set against the other makes for an interesting variant.  I highly enjoy both Roma games, and I recommend both, without reservation.

Great - it's a standalone game that I think I prefer to Roma, having text rather than icons helps if you don't play all the time. The bribery mechanic is great - you can always trigger it if you are prepared to pay.

Plus you can combine it with Roma for more options. Everything an expansion should be and the some. And you can fit it all in one of the boxes. :)

Nice 2 player game with a Roman theme. It feels like luck can play a significant role (initial setup + dice rolls), but considering that games are usually fairly short, it is not such a big deal. Once you roll, however, decisions are pretty straightforward. Still a fun game, just not indispensable.

A decent two player game, with some nice twists from the norm (though nb I haven't played Roma I) and not as random as a combination of dice and action cards might have been, though it would probably take a few more plays to be sure quite how much is actually involved.  The good news is I'd be happy to play more to find out.

I really enjoy Roma, and this is definitely an improvement on the original!  They fixed the start game, which now allows players to get going before just losing due to open slots, and they also provided an activation space that doesn't force you to match die rolls to it to activate it.  Both excellent improvements!  There are also more ways to score points now, which is the icing on the cake.

Is it an expansion or a completely new game - It's both. Just as good as the first one. Now how to log a game if we combine all the cards. Then it becomes an expansion and needs to be logged as Roma I think. I prefer the original so lowered my ranking just a little. 16 Plays and 1 Use as an Expansion.

I give this the same rating as Roma: Thumbs Up.

Roma has a heavier focus on combos, whereas Arena's is on strategies and gameflow. I think Arena does a better job at teaching the fundamentals of the Roma system. Subtle changes like replacing the Onager/Velites with Basilica/Decurio have a meaningful impact on the game.

We've played this game a ton.  A very swingy, cut-throat 2PL back-and-forth.  At one point, I was down to 1 VP, but had finally set up a strong row of attack cards, and slowly, methodically chipped away and won.

It takes a few plays to get to know the cards, but then it really clicks.  Occasionally someone wins quickly but typically it is a real slug-fest.

Interesting two player game, about factional power in Ancient Rome.  Players play cards against a set of "dice platters", numbered 1-6.  On a turn, players toss three dice, and use the dice to activate the matching card to use it's power, or use the dice to draw more cards or cash.  The goal of the game is to exhaust the bank (or other player) of victory points, and the card actions help you gain vp's and also hinder your opponents.  Fun game, interesting card combinations, quick to play, little bit to think about.  Basically the same game as Roma, with a different card mix and a new bribery mechanic.  You can combine the cards from the two sets, too.  Great, fast little two player game.

I was hoping that I would find this to be an improvement of the original.  The central dice/card mechanism has a lot of promise.  Arena does seem to be an improvement, somewhat tempering the tendency of the game to snowball in favor of one player.  However, it still seems difficult for a player who starts to slip behind to recover, which makes you wonder why then it still takes another 10-20 minutes to end the game.  Overall not a bad game, but not good enough that I don't have a dozen other 2 player 30 minutes games I find more interesting.

Arena is a fun and nasty little card game.

This is a 2 player card game where you either try to delete your opponents VP pile or the general pool while having more than your opponent.  While I thought the victory conditions were interesting, I sadly feel that there is too much luck in the dice rolls.  There just wasn't enough meaty decisions for me to make compared to other 2-player card games that I've been playing lately.

Played a partial learning game 10-15-11 with Mystery Bob.  We were both a bit lost but intrigued.  He claims to want to play again.  Played a second partial game on 10/22/11.

Played 2 complete games on 10/30/11.  Split the wins. We really like this game now that we understand it better!

RATING: 8
In my opinion the original is probably better, a more meat-and-potatoes approach, where as Roma II (while having new interesting cards) losses some game play. If you enjoy Roma at all, neither version is bad purchase.

The only difference between the two (other then the cards) is the addition of the 7th bribery slot. A new mechanic I'm not sure is good nor bad. While it does a good job of further reducing the penalty for low dice rolls (a "1" which is normally less desirable, becomes a good low cost bribe number); however, having a card slot that can ALWAYS be rolled creates games that can be too one-sided if the superior player has a better board position.

Still a good game but seems to lack something versus the original.  Was told this was supposed to originally be a re-release and/or refined version of Roma.  Glad they didn't follow that course.

Another solid engine building/combo based two player card game. There's room to interact, but it seems as if attacking is only a good idea if it's going to stop your opponent from doing that is earning him a lot of victory points. 

After 5 plays I'm beginning to wonder if the combat aspect of the game is too powerful...

(As of [b]4[/b] plays) A hand-management card game with dice. The rules are realtively simple, but the gameplay is gratifyingly deep. There is a certain amount of luck in dice rolls and card draws, but the allocation of dice and the selection of which cards to put in play (and where) requires quite a lot of decision-making, and the player interaction is significant. 

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Not many 2-player gaming opportunities at the moment, but this is one I would love to revisit. There's still a lot more game here for me to explore.

Sequel for Roma, independent game (although can be combined).  Same game-play and feel, but all new cards.  Main rule change is the addition of a Bribery mechanic (which is optional).  Minor component changes include an "icon bar", and English text on the cards.  Both games are equally good!  I am a big fan of Roma and card games with CCG-type abilities generally, so it isn't hard to get excited about this.  Just as good if not better and more balanced than as the original!

I have mixed feelings.  This is the same game as Roma with Bribery added & the cards have different capabilities--which I am not all that happy with.  The first cards are more clever than this deck which is more of what you see in other games such as, "your opponent gets one less die to roll".

This is a better balanced game. As my friend Sharone pointed out, the forums and accompanying buildings in Roma can be very over powering.  The forum in this game doesn't have the same strength.

However, I prefer the graphic instructions in the Roma game opposed to the text instructions of these cards. Also, and this is superficial, but I just like the "feel" of Roma better with its round dice disks which were replaced in this game with a long strip that is pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle.

I've wanted to try this game ever since I heard it was coming out as a sequel to Roma, which I enjoyed, especially as I heard that it was supposed to "fix" some issues with the original game.  This sequel (which can still be played with the original) was a bit of a disappointment, while still being a solid, quick 2-player filler game.  I thought that the original played out a bit too quickly before strategies and card combos really had time to develop, but if anything, I would use those criticisms even more with this game. Maybe future plays will bring it up a notch or two. This is a very tactical game that can easily be over in 4 or 5 rounds. I like the mechanics, the artwork, and the idea of this game a lot - I just wish it played out a little longer, and didn't seem quite so luck-dependent.

A fun two-player game. Loads of luck involved, but there are ways to mitigate it, which makes it alright. Still looking for a good house-rule to fix my issues with imbalanced initial 5-card setup (some cards, while useful during the game, are just plain awful to get during in your starting hand).

This game matures the Roma system dramatically. What used to be a game that was often frustratingly lost by turn five is now more about strategic play, sacrifice, and guaranteed activation through the bribery slot.

Nice Dice/Card game.
You must use your dice perfectly to active card's ability, and win more VPs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just as good as the first one, a rarity for "sequels."  I thought that they would seek a more 'balanced' game after the Forum so thoroughly dominated the first game, but what they did was ramp up other strategies to match.  I supposed it's more balanced because of these new options, but things like military and big money seem like they're more viable.

I'm torn on the optional card slot; it seems abusable at times if a player gets just the right card there and can lean on it turn after turn.  One of the best parts of the original was making do with what you had.  For a few coins, in Roma II the variable slot lets you press and advantage.  There are games I don't mind it so much, but other games where it's clear that a player can get a sizable advantage from it.  Thankfully, it's optional.  So if you don't dig it after a few plays, ditch it and just enjoy the new powers.

I haven't tried any of the other methods other than Roma I versus Roma II, and surprisingly both decks held their own against each other.  Roma I seemed better at generating VPs in bursts, but Roma II seemed better at countering and tearing stuff down when needed (as well as providing cool new ways to generate VPs, such as sacrificing characters and buildings.)

This one seems to be getting hard to find.  I strongly recommend you hunt down both if you can, before they're all gone.  Great, great 2-player confrontational card game.

There is a good deal of luck with the dice rolls in this game, putting it definitely in the "slightly north of filler" camp, but like any good dice game there are enough ways to mitigate what you are given. It is a very tactical card game. It's quite fun though and creates the requisite amount of tension required. For a lighter 2-player game with a definite Euro feel and a taste of Feld mechanics, it works fine. It does go on a little long though for what it is, and by some point the strategy becomes: "search the deck for cards that give you victory points and pimp the shit out of those until the game ends."  In that the game becomes a bit blunt and not very exciting in terms of replayability.

Well - Played two different hour-long "best of 7" sessions in late 2013 using both decks (base Roma 2nd edition plus Roma Arena II).  One play session was a total bust: the dice and cards favored one side so consistently that even over 7 plays it was a total meltdown and black hole of fun.   The other session was close: I think one of us won 4 games to 2.   This game can be maddeningly sensitive to luck.

Don't expect "high strategy".  Sure, there are things you can do to increase your chances of winning.  However, in some sessions no matter what you do, your hosed by the dice and cards.

Very Fragile.

Rating of 10 for the series. 

Inclusion of Roma 2 makes this a top 2p game in my collection. The new set ingeniously adds a new method of pursuing victory: depleting the VP pile. Furthermore, the addition of the bribery slot gives you more control and less dependent on die rolls. Both of these changes make an already great game even better.

Games seem longer. Cards are a little more balanced. Building heavy rather than character heavy. Looking forward to pitting this against the first set in some Roma-Roma2 showdowns. First two such showdowns were blowouts by the original.

Roma: 2 wins
Roma 2: 6 wins

I haven't played the original Roma in years, but the sequel is a nice improvement over the original in its use of the 'bribery' space on the board as well as its set of cards which makes for far less 'bottoming out' losses (which definitely might help address any feelings that the first player might have too much of an advantage). Over all, a great card game that balances tactics, strategy, point optimization, and aggression. While not a brain-burner, or deeply tense, this game is fun.

Stefan Feld revisits the head-to-head Roman combats, with wolves, bears, lions and triremes in the Colosseum... well, maybe it's not quite THAT thematic, but Arena: Roma II presents both a nice stand-alone game, with some nice enhancements to the orginal (e.g., the Bribery slot,) as well as what seems a more balanced set of cards for the duelers.

Like Roma this is a one-on-one, may the best player win game.  The same set of 3 dice are used to activate cards, and similar empty slot penalties are in play. 

Instead of the 1-6 pip discs, Arena: Roma II provides a nice belt built of interlocking sections, and it adds a new slot to the six basic ones, which raises the number needing to be filled, but also the number of available cards. The new slot- the Bribery slot- is available with any die, but requires sesterces matching the pips to activate the card there. This means with funds it can be used very frequently, and this can create some interesting strategies all on it's own.

After a first solo play I give this a 7.5; making it among Feld's best games, and enhancing an older one with a couple of flaws.

Nothing like improving on a good idea!

RATING: 7
I love Roma; it's a 10 for me.

Roma II I'm not so sure about...

It's the same game, more or less, but the cards give a totally different feel and game experience.

I guess what I most object to is the great disparity of power between cards in the two games. The cards in Roma II are wildly more powerful than the cards in Roma.

Case in point: In Roma, the Nero card allows a player to discard an opponent's building and then Nero is discarded as well. That seems a balanced power to me. In Roma II, the Statue of Jove card eliminates [i]any[/i] opponent's card and the player gets to keep the Jove card. Sure activating Jove sets you back 10 gold, but that's hardly a limiter in the same way as Nero's "use it and lose it" deal.

All the cards in Roma II are that out of sync with the power levels in Roma. I believe that a Roma deck playing against a Roma II deck would not be a fair contest...

Update: The above comments refer to playing Arena by itself. When Arena cards are shuffled into the Roma deck, the result is a better game -- not as good as Roma by itself -- but not bad. I've now stripped out the Arena cards from the Roma deck.

Arena: Roma II is one of the best light 2-player games I have played. The components are excellent quality, with the cards being attractive and thematic. The rules are simple, unambiguous and provided in six languages - in six separate copies! Arena is a tactical game with a significant element of chance. Occasionally fortuna wins the game for one of the players, but as Arena typically lasts only 20-30 minutes I see this as only a minor flaw.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (February 2012)

In general, I dislike long games with lots of luck, Arena: Roma II has a lot of luck, but you can manage it so I like the game when it doesn’t take a long time to play. Unfortunately, some games finish very quickly while other take A LOT of time to finish, so I’m on the fence about this game. 

It´s similar to its parent game, but with new cards. This is a must if you have played a lot of Roma. I think the Feld design is very clever and, in general, I like the game and I would like to have it. The problem is that, for two players, I would rather play a lot of better games. 

Bottom line, I enjoy Arena Roma II (and Roma) only when it plays quickly, otherwise it becomes a very boring game. I would play it from time to time.

I was browsing queen games and saw the demo of this game. Ok. I started looking around and found a copy. Happiness begins. A card game with great mechanics on each card. A die to activate one of your cards on your turn. A perfectly themed game using a Roman backdrop. Some games are over in 20 minutes and some are knock down drag them out marathon games of 60-120 minutes if two opponents are either equal strength or bad dice rollers. This game made me go out and buy Roma the original game that this game is a sequel to. This game is heads and shoulders above the original. Now if the original was in english and not icon driven I would enjoy it more. You can combine both decks from each game and play with both of them. Enjoy.

Sequel to Roma. Two player tug of war card game in a roman setting. Sometimes the game ends very quick, but most of the times it goes back and forth. Kind-off an arm wrestling match with tactical card play instead of strength. This game feels different then the usual point salad games that I'm used to from Feld. I prefer this sequel only slightly more then [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16496/roma]Roma I[/url].

Arena is almost identical to Roma in core mechanics but has a different deck of cards. There is some carry-over from the first game, but quite a bit of new stuff as well. In particular, it looks like there more ways to generate victory points. I think you would have to play a lot of Roma to recognize what, specifically, the designer was trying to achieve with Arena. Both games are a lot of fun (but volatile).

RATING: 7
A revised version of Roma with the advantage that it doesn't feature an overpowered card like the Mercator. All cards except for the forum have been changed. There's a seventh spot to place a card, the bribery. The card placed there can be activated with any dice but the pips of the dice have to be paid for this. Thus, rolling low has become more interesting. Winning by VP's has become more frequent. All changes for the good.

Whatever I said about Roma applies to the sequel, I'm sure. Just more of the same. Most games decided early with a slow, painful death for the loser. Comebacks are rare, but they show up sometimes. Reasonably entertaining, and I'm quite grateful that this edition has words I can read instead of iconography I can't remember.

Again, what a game, I like it even better then Roma (1).  A little bit more strategic/deeper although still very well balanced.  Light fun play, super fast.

We managed to win a copy of [thing=56931][/thing] as part of the 2013 Jack Vasel Memorial Fund Auction.  It's a game that's intrigued us for a while---we've been fans of some of Stefan Feld's recent dice games such as [thing=55670][/thing] and [thing=84876][/thing], so this earlier dice game focused on two players sounded interesting.

The game looks like a typical card tableau building game where you lay special cards on your side.  However, it does have a twist.  In typical Feld fashion, the dice are used to allocate different actions that you can take.  You can see some similar ideas to his bigger dice board games.  It's a clever mechanism and a nice twist on typical card tableau games---you line up your cards around a central board and can only activate them if you roll the corresponding die.  There is a space to draw more cards, collect money, or use the bribery action as a wild to activate that particular card.  

However, despite this, the game felt a little flat to us.  Part of it is that the game is not quite an engine game like we expected.  It's not really about setting up card combos or generating a VP engine and letting it run.  It is quite different from something like [thing=28143][/thing].  On the other hand, it didn't feel quite like a battle game either.  There are a few cards that let you attack your opponent, but they feel fairly limited.  So it feels like it fits into a weird niche.  A related issue is that there just didn't feel like many unique cards in the game---we've been spoiled by games like [thing=28143][/thing] where there are hundreds of unique cards.  I suppose you could buy the first [thing=16496][/thing] and mix in the cards, but it's an issue with this as a standalone game.

When we've played, one of us has gotten an early lead that ended up being insurmountable.  It was hard for the other player to try and catch up by either collecting points or by attacking the other player.  However, the game just kind of dragged on as that player circled the drain until the ending condition was finally met.  It wasn't a bad game, but we weren't that excited by it---why would we play this rather than play any number of somewhat similar card games ([thing=28143][/thing], [thing=12002][/thing], [thing=9446][/thing], etc.)

Much like Roma, Arena can be over in a turn or two sometimes if the wrong (right) cards come out, and there are times where the game can feel a bit lopsided. This is forgivable, since it's a short game, so you can always play again. When the game is close-fought (which it usually is), it can be a tense bit of backing and forthing. The fact that the scoring mechanism is essentially a tug-of-war makes for some interesting decisions, as sometimes it's better not to take points in order to allow your opponent to lose points.

RATING: 8
If you like its predecessor, chances are that you’ll like Roma II: Die Arena even more. Apart from the four Forum cards, which again fill the role of prime VP generators, all the cards are new, and so far they feel very well balanced. And more interesting to boot: wrecking your buildings for VPs with the Looter is as neat as grinding your opponents personages through the titular Arena until one of them falls. Plus, there are no time-consuming decksearchers like in the first version of Roma, which pleased me a lot.

Apart from the cards, the only other change is the additional “bribery” card space. You can activate the card placed here with any die, but have to pay the amount of this die. This increases your choices as well as the need for money (and the importance to have some of it readily at hand) and adds to the game without noticably complicating matters.

I held back on buying the first Roma after playing and liking it - its remodel/remake was already announced and I figured that I might as well wait for that. It’s been  a while, but I’d say it’s been worth waiting for. In fact, I’m now considering the purchase of Roma v.1, because pitting the old deck against the new sounds very intriguing to me.

Two players battle over control of Rome, using the abilities of people and buildings to their favor. That's the theme, I guess, but this is game is all about the mechanics, unless having Latin names for everything really does it for you.

And with dice and card mechanics, this is game of probability manipulation. You play cards that allow you to make the most of your dice rolls, and you use your dice rolls to help you have the best cards. The interaction between the two mechanics is fascinating and fun. 

Billed as a 30 minute game, with two experienced players it can easily go on for for twice that. The play length is part of this game's problem. Early games seem to end too early, just as you're starting to form a strategy. Later games tend to go too long as one player drains from the general VP supply and the other contributes to its refilling. 

I keep coming back to it because each game I learn new ways to manipulate those probabilities. Yet, when the game becomes a slog, the reward of manipulating probabilities to my favor seems slight when my opponent has simply drawn the better cards.

06/20/10 Played once and felt the game was seriously broken. If one player gets more than about 7 VP chips ahead that player has a *huge* chance of eventually winning. Why? Because in Roma II there are many more cards that remove VP’s from of the general supply than in Roma. 

Roma II - Cards that remove VP’s from general supply: Pictor x2, templarius x2, forum x4, triremis x2, carrus bovinus x1, offertorium x2, taberna x2.  Cards that remove VP’s from general supply (and the game): Aquaeductus x1. In other words, 16 of the 55 (29%) cards remove VP’s from general supply, none remove VP’s from opponent. 

Roma - Cards that remove VP’s from general supply: legat x2, forum x6, mercatus x2. 
Cards that remove VPs’ from your opponent: mercator x2
In other words, 10 of the 52 (19%) cards remove VP’s from general supply, 2 (4%) remove VP’s from opponent. 

I did not take into account any cards in either game that assist/amplify any of the above, although I know there are some. 

Conclusion: Occasionally I would see runaway leader games in Roma. But with so many more cards in Roma II draining the general VP supply ( 29% vs. 19%) I think this tendency would be much, much worse. 

09/04/10 Played a second game. I changed my rating from a 4 to a 5. But I still think Arena has exacerbated the runaway leader problem in Roma, instead of ameliorating it. 02/19/11 Played two more games. 

11/15/14 Played two games. I saw nothing that made me want to change my earlier opinion.
09/05/15 Ditto.   04/30/16 Ditto.

An interesting dice-based game which has elements similar to Alea Iacta Est and Yspahan, though also very different to either. Place cards along a 9-space track: one space each for each number on a six-sided die; one each for cash, card draw and bribery. Place cards against each of the die value slots or the bribery slot; the cash and card draw remain empty. Pay penalties for each empty space of the 1-6 plus bribery. Roll three dice and use the face values to trigger the equivalent card slot (some cards show that they require more than one die to activate), or place a die on bribery, card draw or cash. Draw cards or cash equivalent to the die value; pay bribes similarly. Place a die of a specific value on its spot and activate the associated card. Some luck, some strategy and plenty of opportunity for screwage. Light, but very entertaining.

If you like Roma you'll certainly want to add Roma II to the fold.  What a great combo.  The bribery, the addition of text to the cards and the Forum destroyer are all good stuff. I love that it works stand alone or that you can combine it with the original set of cards.  There is still a bit of luck in this game so if you didn't like that about Roma nothing has changed here - except the bribery icon mitigates that a little.  I prefer a best of 7 series for a match.  The combined deck game probably propels this to a 10 for me.

A fun little 2p game that can last anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes. While I do enjoy the game, strategies are somewhat limited, and the game has a pretty high degree of luck for what it is. I think if 2 people know the game well enough, however, the game's nuances can really come too life, and make this little deck of cards into a back and forth knife fight. Good game, but I would rather play Pillars of the Earth: Builder's Duel for a head-to-head Feld experience. I also think Fight for Olympus feels similar, but is a more compelling design.

Roma is a lot like Jambo. When you pull off a sweet combo, you are rewarded with disappointment. There's no sense of satisfaction because the reward is so marginal. The strategy is blah. It was a poor design idea to have your actions tied to cards which are also tied to dice activation. This doesn't create tension or difficult decisions. It's annoying. I'm all for the best-laid-plans, but this approach is like waiting in line at a club, paying to get in, waiting in line at the bar, then spilling your drink. 

After several plays, there didn't feel like there was much left to discover or think about. For its time footprint, there are many more interesting 2p games.

Enjoyable, quick dice game with a Roman theme.

I'm not sure how much your ability to play this game well is affected by the luck of the dice, but it is quick to set up and quick to play, and has a nice variety of cards and card effects to make each game fun.

I purchased both Roma and Roma II to combine them, and so far, they have worked very well together, minus one card (Harusplex).

Unless one day I realize that there's too much luck in this game, I'll keep it in my collection and quick-games rotation.

Update: not a bad game, just not enough to compete with my other 2-player games, especially Omen:Reign of War.

Fantastic strategy game. Knowledge of the various cards improves the gaming experience but you quickly come to understand their various effects. Victory is possible even from the jaws of defeat - tense and exciting. Second favorite game of my wife's only just edged out by Battle Line.

A sweet little improvement on the original Roma, with a tad more direct confrontation and - crucially - more ways of earning VPs than the original. Using card text rather than weak iconography is an obvious but important step forward, too.

The real beauty, of course, is that it's now possible to play deck-against-deck, or even draft a full pair of decks. With all the added freshness, Roma suddenly has a lot more legs.

It is fun, quick, and easy, the rules are easy to teach. It didn't  blow me away, but I had a good time. There is some randomness, but not too much. I think the better player can usually win since you can mitigate the randomness. It has less luck than something like summoner wars. I think I will put it into a smaller box and keep it in the collection.

Very clever design and I thoroughly enjoy the game everytime I play. The game has a lovely balance between weight of attack vs VP gathering, oftentimes games hanging in the balance and dependent on what can get activated when. The cards provide lots of different options in how to go about the win, providing the variety needed for replay, with enough luck to keep things interesting and non-predictable, even when you thing you're in a winning situation. Some games are fast - some are momentous see-saws with multiple changes in strategy. There's a learning curve involved in the cards and games can be slow until you're up the curve, but worthwhile climbing. Overall, big thumbs up, especially for a dice game. Cards seem to be cheaper and attackier than the original which makes for more volatile and swingier games - not a bad thing at all.

RATING: 3
This game, I suppose, was designed to be quick.  However, a game can easily get into a back and forth tug of war with both sides close to a winning condition but not quite getting there.  Games can sometimes drag on for 45 minutes or more and that can be really bad for a game that is only interesting enough to last 10 minutes or so.  The cards feature powers that I find silly and dull (attack this or that character or building and add 1 to battle die/get a point for every opponents character card, blah blah blah).  It almost feels like the cards are playing the game for you and you are just watching.  Yes, there are some tactics/strategy that can be employed such as holding a powerful card in hand and activating it AFTER you see the die roll, but I just do not like this type of card game at all.  It feels like I am playing Pokeman with a Roman theme.  Feld should just stick to what he does best which is certainly not this.

RATING: 6
Arena: Roma II is simply an update of the older game Roma. In addition to the six dice spots, there's now a seventh card spot that corresponds to paying money equal to the number of pips on the die you put there. The bigger change, though, seems to be with the card distribution--the game no longer seems to be about getting a particular combo set up. I'd say there are probably more ways to succeed, but it's hard to tell that from one play. The game still lacks any sort of built-in timer; a player can crash and burn right away, or the game could drag on for a long time as players go back and forth.

This is a card and dice game, so I'm not surprised that there is a lot of luck in this game. That's fine with me, since it is short. However, I never feel like I am setting up anything cool or setting up any intresting combos. Instead I feel like I am just sort of reacting to the happenstance of my draws and my opponent's draws. I still play it, but there are other fillers I'd rather play.

= 2012-07-16 - R:8

Played one time. The rules were easy to learn and the game played quickly. My wife commented on how attractive the cards were and we both enjoyed the direct conflict and combat. As we weren't yet familiar with the cards, we played our "draw X and keep one" actions very quickly but I could see that becoming an AP prone action.

Fast setup, quick play, good player interaction, tension, and an excellent way to bring in dice while still making sure there's always something you can do with even a "bad" roll. I'm starting with an 8.

= 2013-01-27 - R:6.8

Seems wrong for this to be an 8 if we've only played it twice and never brought it back to the table. I still think it's a great game, but it needs more plays.

Dropping to a 6.8 because there are other 7's we like better.

I think the game is alright but I have so many other 2-player games that I would prefer to play. I think Jambo is similar enough to this game that you get a little bit of that vibe mixed with some other mechanisms. I also found the rules to be overly confusing.

The game has some interesting ideas for a light dice management&card game. The game is still very swingy. Bad luck and powerful combos can end the game can very shortly. On the other hand the game can last very long and become a slow march to the end. The should be some sort of time limit that would prevent the game lasting forever.

Dice and variable card powers give the game a nice, open feel. Lighter than I'd expected. Plays briskly, so the time investment suits the weight. I don't think we were aggressive enough attacking score cards, so maybe there's opportunity for longer, harder-fought games.

Quite fun card game that uses dice as well. Very neat mechanic where you only activate cards that match your dice rolls. The game does rely on some luck depending on the cards you get but there is definitely some skill involved as well. Most games go quick (20 minutes) and is a great filler or ideal if you just want a light and quick 2 player game. It takes several plays to get familiar with all the cards and figure out the strategy. Recommended.

I like it.. But the Forum seems bloody overpowered n in my experience... Whoever plays it first starts raping.

I think that I am finally starting understand the subtleties... Great little session on the last game. I can distinguish between when it's wise to keep chasing the vp's and when it's time to attack like a mad man. Sometimes you need to forget about those pts and just dismantle your opponent, so that they can start leaking vp's.

Update: After 10 plays, I can safely say that I finally love the game. There's a lot of depth to be uncovered here, not apparent at all within the first couple of plays. The Forum, which was my main concern, isn't as OP as I thought. There are ways to deal with it, with Equitatus or with a heavy military strategy. Components get the job done, good quality. But I hate the oversized Queen boxes and how they fold all of of their rulebooks.

I would play this over the original English Roma version any day for one VERY good reason - the text is on the cards (like the original German edition). It makes it sooooo much easier and fluid to play.

A few tweaks on Roma - very similar play. Actually, I find the original Roma cards to be a little more diverse. Games can be quick or great see sawing epics. Usually the quick ones are down to one player getting a couple of low dice rolls on the opening turns and not being able to build up a decent position. If that happens I suggest you play again. I'm happy to play either the original or this second version. Now... maybe I should go ahead and mix the decks together...

I like it. It's quick and simple and the cards seem to work well together. The end game conditions are variable: either someone has 0 VP or the VP pool is gone. I'm not sure that it feels like other Feld designs, but it's still good.

My wife says there is too much luck, but I feel like the mini draft at the beginning mitigates some luck, along with the choices that are available with your dice.

I think this'll be a good one to just play quickly when we don't have much time.

[4 plays] Slightly better than the original because of cleaned up of card text (english text not confusing icons) and the new bribery space, which makes low die rolls more appealing.

This is a great card game that benefits from repeated "one more game" evenings. Fast set-up. Quick play. Tough choices.

RATING: 2
Every time I play this game I like it less and less. One problem is that we are the sort of people that prefer iconography over loads of text. We often find ourselves pausing to read each other's cards, which breaks the game flow. More plays would help familiarize ourselves with the cards, but even when we were playing it a bunch, Michelle still needed to read most of the cards. 

The second thing that really bothers me is that I really hate how your options are limited by the dice. You can have 2 or 3 fora out there and the dice just refuse to give you the right values until your opponent blasts them off the board. That is really enough to make me want to throw the stupid thing into the fireplace. The result is that we find it too shallow and luck prone. I suspect that there is some strategy/depth surrounding the card draw, but I also suspect that it isn't enough to save the game for us.

Its a pretty quick playing 2 player game where you assign cards from your hand to dice slots (1-6) and two $/draft slots. The cards are either buildings or characters that have special abilities and are activated upon role of three 6 sided dice. Win conditions include either opponents depleted VPs or most VPs when general pool runs out. Its a survival game at first to get your engine running and make sure you don't run out of VPs and then an optimization game. Pretty fun filler that made me want to play again.

Nice choices and good tension in this one.  The primary complaint I had of Roma - that it was hard to know that the cards did - has been resolved by this one.  Instead of always looking up what my options were, I could check them out and spend more time on my strategy.  I'd definitely recommend this over Roma.  I have an initially very favorable impression of this one and it may move up with more plays.

RATING: 8
More strategic space to play with than the original Roma and different balance among the cards. Because of this, the game more often ends in a VP race than a KO, though the Forum isn't as powerful. Otherwise it's more or less the same game. Two complaints about this version: the English translation, which isn't great; and the box, which is inexcusably large, so much so that I trashed it and threw everything into the Battle Line box.

relatively random, but there may be enough card cycling to control the random.  Battle die is still a problem because there is not often a way to mitigate the luck there.  On the other hand it plays quite fast, so the large luck amount isn't a deal breaker.

This Feld sequal to ROMA has some interesting game play.  To make it "work" it helps to be a bit ruthless--and to hope to get the right combination of cards.  We tend to prefer BATTLE LINE, but rotate the two on our coffee house trips.

Combined the best cards from this into the original Roma to make a great 2 player battle.  Perhaps with certain opponents this version complete would make for a nice slow game.  I feel it added in length and took away from the original's quick-fire style of play.

A pretty fast dice game. It is very attack orientated, but the attacks are so numerous that cards don't stay with you very long so you don't have time to get upset about it.

It needs more plays to see how well balanced it is between luck and skill, but it warrants the extra plays...

Update: After quite a few more plays, it seems that many of my gaming partners are not keen on A:R2. Which is a shame as it's a lot of fun and plays in next to no time. The game is obviously better when it doesn't bog down and last more than 45 minutes, but I don't actually recall the last time that happened.


Rating up from 6.8 to 7, to 7.3.

I really want to love this game, but there are too many things holding me back.

Like:
The varied abilities and uses of the cards
The dice which keep from abusing combos every turn
The art and graphic design

Dislike:
The randomness of the starting cards
Some games are done in ten minutes, others might take forty
Cards that seem way too expensive to make good use of
The needlessly large box
No compensation for poor battle die rolls
Too many games where one player gets way ahead and the other player has no chance to come back

Arena is fine as a meatier-type filler. I enjoy the interaction between cards and how placement makes a big difference. For a game that has players competing for a fixed pool of victory points though, I don't see as much tug-of-war as one might expect.

RATING: 6
Roma II theoretically addresses gripes with the original Roma.  Most notably, the cryptic iconography on the cards has been replaced by explanation text.  But the  explainer text on your opponent's cards is very hard to read upside down.  And the new deck has a lot less battle action.  It's typical to just avoid your opponent and play solitaire on  your side.  Now I'm left adrift, not knowing what the perfect Roma looks like.

Arena was one of the first games I ever played when re-discovered board games. It's also one of the games from a  small list of games my wife really likes and is willing to play almost any time. So the second game that would add some more variety to a proven system was a must have. It took me some time to find the English version of the game several years after it's release but now it sits firmly in my collection.

The cards in this game are much more useful than the ones in Roma. Also, the bribery option is a nice addition, making it so that you can almost always do something helpful on your turn.

Update 10/10/2012: Lowering my rating. Even though Arena is a big improvement over Roma, I still feel like bad dice rolls can have way too much influence on a game.

Update: After a recent play, I'm done with this game. It's far too random: even if you get the cards you need, you have to get lucky enough to roll the right dice that you need. 

Sold.

RATING: 5
After one play, it seemed a bit empty in strategy. It seems actions will be mostly dictated by the first five cards each player is dealt. I felt like I had a tableau of cards that I didn't want to have. Maybe I need to play it more. But if it doesn't change dramatically, I'll be putting this one up for trade.

After my second game, it was better. I understood the importance of placement more--although I still don't think it makes that big a difference. I bumped my rating form a 6.5 to a 7. I'm leaning towards trading. I'll have to give it at least one more play, though.

After reading some strategy forums to see if there were any more depths to this game, and discovering that there really weren't, I've bumped my rating down to a 5 and I traded it away.

I have only played twice, but I definitely want to play more.  I am almost certain my rating would go up as this is one of the kind of game I like.

I prefer tactical games so I like games where the dice narrow your decisions, but still leave you with good choices. I am always hesitant to play games with lots of variable power cards because of the longer learning curve that this usually promotes. However, the hand sizes aren't large, the cards are simple enough and one has enough time to study them that in this one the learning's not too bad. You really can learn as you go. The older edition with iconography would have scared the bejeezus out of me. 

It not just that I have to learn the game, I don't mind, but I have to teach this to others and that is a real handicap if their is a long learning curve.

Update:  More plays and I do indeed like it better. Up from 7 to 7.5.




Suitability for Travel:

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

RATING: 10
Arena Roma II is a near perfect 2 player light weight slug fest. Games can be over in a flash, but no complaints here - it just means you can play more of them.

The use of dice to activate the cards works splendidly here and there are many options available on each and every roll,  in what boils down to a tug of war for the small pool of victory points. 

There are two ways to go about your business, although it will become readily apparent if you should opt to go on offense or play defense to prolong the game and hopefully, later , get a chance to pounce.  There is the problem of comebacks being a bit on the rare side - but that makes them all the more sweeter when you can pull them off.

So make your way to the Coliseum,  set your queue of cards and do your level best at throwing your opponent to the lions.

PROS: A very unique and light dice allocation game with a "bleeding system" where every turn you lose victory points for every slot that does not contain a card on your side. This leads to tactical decisions like "should I use these dice to draw and place more cards saving my VPs in the future, or will I benefit more from activating the ones I already have?"; There are also strategical decisions: If you have the advantage, you may try to keep it by gaining more VPs and eventually drying out the VP supply, or you can focus on destructive actions to make your opponent bleed and run out of VPs first, for instance; The options to bribe a cards, get money and draw are a great way to balance the luck - There's very rarely a really poor turn (usually when you roll a lot of 1's and 2's) because you usually can at least draw some cards and place them on your side, avoiding further bleeding.

CONS: There are 7 slots total for cards, but only one of them can be activated at will, the bribery one. The others depend on luck because there's no modifier to the dice roll. The positioning of the cards may be well thought but useless if you don't roll specific numbers (or at least roll them before your opponent can deal with the threat), only changed by a few cards that allow you to re-roll and to activate adjacent cards; Some card effects could be better written.

About [thing=56931][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=56931][/thing] is a dice game mixed with hand management. In it, players are rulers trying to either overcame the other by being the greatest, or subduing the other to the ground.

This is a smart, and sort of quick - but almost leaving the filler niche -, game that puts both players in head to head conflict. Though most 2 players game have high interaction, not all allow one to mess with the other side, using different ways to achieve confrontation. But in a game with Arena in the title, one better put blood on the sand, and maybe some bread and circus.

While the game is short-ish, it can be prolonged, as players can keep making the opponent lose points, almost at the same rate the other gains them. This can make the play going and going. Still, there are several ways for it to end inside the 30 to 45 minute mark, therefore this is more of a "heads up" than a "you have been warned!", as the end condition for the game is in the hands of the players - there is no round limit.

Since [thing=56931][/thing] is a dice game and has blind draw of cards, you bet there is luck build into it. However, the game provides a lot of options in every turn, even if not the best as it could be, nor one you truly wanted to do. One will simply have to deal with what Fortune has given.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player starts with 10 points. The player's turn is divided in three phases:
a) See how many spots for cards are open. The player loses 1 point for each open space;
b) Roll the dice - there are 3 of them. If all of them come up with the same number, the player may roll them again;
c) Actions. There are five possible actions, almost all of them the players can make more than once and in whatever order they want:
c.1) Draw cards. Uses 1 die - player draws as many cards as the number shown on the die, but always only keeps one of them;
c.2) Gain money. Uses 1 die - player takes money from the bank equal to the number shown on the die used;
c.3) Bribe. Uses (normally) one die. The player pays to the bank money equal to the number shown on the die used, and then activates the card placed in the Bribe spot. This action can only be used once per turn;
c.4) Play cards. Doesn't use dice, but the player must pay the amount shown on the card in order to place it somewhere on her side of the board, besides one of the numbered spots or in the Bribe spot;
c.5) Activate cards. Player use the one or more dice to activate the cards. The cards placed are all beside a number (from 1 to 6) on the board - this is the number the die must have in order to be used to activate that card.

Cards are divided into two types: character and construction. Cards usually serve for one of two purposes: acquire points or attack the other side. To attack, the player follows what the card says, but most required the roll of the attack die: if the player rolls equal to or higher then the defense number of a card, the card is destroyed, and it goes to the discard pile.

The game ends as soon as the victory points supply is empty or when a player has zero point. The winner will be the person with the most points!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Mostly will be what to do with the dice. Either will be activate a card of that number (if possible) or use the die to gain money or to draw cards - and when drawing cards, only one the person can keep, so it is important to choose wisely.

There are other decisions to be made: what card to play and where. And when activating cards, several of them will allow the player a choice - like, which building to destroy.

All the turns will present the players with at least three or more decisions to be made - not all hard or with lasting effects, but with some weight in each.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value;
- Easy to teach and to play, with all the supplementary information clearly written on the cards;
- A fine set of options for the players in each turn;
- Allows for a more aggressive approach, one focused in producing points, or a mix of both;
- Manages to have strategy without be a zero sum or have perfect information.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- A bigger box than it truly needs;
- Luck of the draw and in the rolls are a good part of the gameplay;
- A more "in your face" type of 2 player, which might not fly well for many;
- Cards with important text in each of them - it does required knowledge of the language;
- End game is player driven and it can stay in a gain/lose level, not truly advancing towards the end, and because of this, it can last for more than it should.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
With a distinct feeling that leaving in Rome wasn't all that nice. You pay for things and people to work for you, then they are dragged to the Arena and killed - you don't even receive some compensation. You build a nice Triremis, and the Ballista sinks it. You build a Portus, and the Ballista sinks it. You build an Aquaeductus, and the Ballista sinks it. Everything sinks in Rome. But it is better than see a Bestia eats your Offertorium, as you know marble probably isn't good for its stomach. But this is Rome, a place where your Praedator can steal a battering ram for you - they simply knew no limits back then, with all the orgy and wine.

[thing=56931][/thing] can pass a hopelessness at some points, with you gaining points only to lose them on the next turn, without really moving forward, only trying to prevent going backwards. Still, attacks depends on rolling well the combat die, which means there are chances of failure, and some players might want to avoid this and go for the sure thing, making the game more friendly if both go light on attacks.

[thing=56931][/thing] offers several paths for players to follow and decisions to be made every turn, even if some of them are restrained by the dice rolls - and, unlike some of other Feld dice placement games, [thing=56931][/thing] doesn't really have ways to  manipulate the the results you get - there are cards that give re-rolls or a +1 bonus when rolling to attack, but the first isn't a sure way to help and the second is only for single situation. To cover some of this, there are the money, bribe and card draw spots - any result on the dice can be used on these spots, but, for money and cards, the higher, the better, therefore luck still has its fingers all over it, and for the Bribe, is the other way around - the lower, the better. Still, there are ways to use any number the dice show.

In the end, [thing=56931][/thing] hits many right notes, but it might not resonate well with all kinds of players, specially as it can be a somewhat agressive 2 player, a type many, that constantly play with the same partner and don't want to get under the skin of each other, normally try to avoid. Be aware, however, that [thing=56931][/thing] isn't a "take that" sort of game, with mindless bashing repeated all the time. There are agressive actions, but they cost a die, have chance of failure and don't produce points - meaning they tend to be more a delaying tatic than an end on itself. Therefore, [thing=56931][/thing] is smart and well made enough, leaving plenty of room for clever plays and different strategies, and it receives my recommendation, even if I, personally, look for more laid back 2 players games.

The revolt in Rome will not end for a long time to come! Join the action and find out who is the most powerful ruler by skillfully playing your cards. No matter if you strengthen your own position with strong cards like Arena or Ballista or if you augment your victory points with Templarius and Triremis - you will be the winner if you use your characters and buildings with wit and savvy. You may also combine Roma II - Arena with Roma and discover even more options.
\13\\13\
Arena is a complete game of its own, but it may very well be combined with the cards from Roma. These are the play options:
\13\
- Mix all the cards of both games and play with the combined set.
\13\
- Both players take one set of cards. Players will have their own draw and discard piles.
\13\
- Both players can use the cards of both games, compiling their own decks of 55 cards each. Again, both players will have their own draw and discard piles.

This one wasn't very compelling at all.  It didn't feel as though there were many interesting decisions to make or ways to mitigate bad die rolls, and when you can't roll anything but 1s and 2s and your opponent constantly pulls 5s and 6s, it's more than a bit frustrating.  Boo.

In the middle of the revolt in Rome, two players are pitted against one another across a center battle line.  It is an aggressive head-to-head battle of attrition as victory points are lost.

Good little card-battle game for 2 players.  You roll dice and select your special characters and cards to activate each turn.  Our first game was a little slow getting going, but once the victory points started flowing it was a quick paced race and battle to the finish.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tense gameplay.  Direct conflict to a HUGE degree.  Easy to learn and explain, yet deep enough to satisfy gamers.  Has an element of luck, but is mitigated by how you use the dice.  The better player most always wins.  

You may be getting battered by your opponent, yet through clever use of dice and card placement, can hold on long enough until cards fall your way.  It feels great to activate one of your cards, destroying one or two of your opponents.  

There are a few very powerful cards, and combos are lethal.  So losing these feels like a gut punch.  But destroying your opponents creates a very satisfying feeling--as well as releasing the hard knot in your stomach.  :)

Replay value is high based on the number of cards and dice usage.

[b]A CARDGAMING TOUR-DE-FORCE, WITH MORE WELL-OILED MUSCLES THAN A BATTLE-HARDENED RETENTUS.[/b]

From the ivory tower populated by the gaming zeitgeist, a cardgame has been lowered by winch to the hungry masses. And they should be grateful. For Arena: Roma II is absolutely bloody superb and manages to better the original.
Someone on the Geek described this masterclass in game design as a "knife fight" and they were spot on the target, with the accuracy of a herioc gladiator's thrown soliferreum. Roma is a brutal melee of a cardgame, that colourfully represents the wrestling of rival powers for control of ancient Rome's senate and guard, by the various toga-wearing movers and shakers that skulked through the collonades of Roman power, daggers in sleeve.

In the box you get a slim pack of attractive cards, filled with language-independant iconography, 7 dice, and a jug-full of counters. Not a lot for your hard-earned coinage, but this gem's worth every last shiny penny.

Dice and cards? So this is a random, chaotic, card-flapping, dice-chucking, orgy?
If you thought these thoughts, banish yourself to the colloseum and chase some tigers with trident and net.
Roma is more than the sum of its parts. It is all of those randomish things, but yet it stands taller than merely a card game, or a dice game, or a simple meld of the two. Roma is just great. It uses the dice brilliantly; forcing you to make nail-biting decisions EVERY turn. Each die has to be allocated to a task - and herein lies the blinding design. The dice are the engine that powers the card drawing/playing; allows you cash for further tasks; enables senators, spies, etc, to do their dirty work. The deck of cards is disappointingly small. Initially. Aha! It is slim for a reason, and that reason is game-control. With a fat deck of many wondrous things you could be rolling dice all day to get the cards you want. But with Roma, the card you seek is tantalisingly close. Yes, it is.

The game is a frantic confrontation, with more back and forth than a platter of stuffed olives, carried shoulder-high by a pretty young lad at a consul's banquet. You really will screw the other player over in ways that remind me of Magic: The Gathering, and that is not a comparison I make lightly.

Some whisper that certain cards are unbalanced, and they may be right. But I say, fight and manipulate your way around those cards to victory. No Caesar conquered his people without a ruddy hard wrangling.
Roma allows you to fight back from the brink, if you find yourself losing, in a way that can keep both players on the tips of their sandles, unlike most other 2-player cardgames. It sometimes can really seem like you're windmilling your arms to stop yourself tipping over into the lion's den - games can be that close, swinging wildly. And, you'll always have a great time in the process.

As you may know, I adore swift games; Roma is safetly in the stable with other quick-playing Italian thoroughbreds. You will get many delightful turns of this in before bedtime.

Like all great games, Roma forces each player to manage their resources effectively; management of cash/cards is a skill players will have to master. And you will have to craft a defense right from the get-go, to stem the victory point bleed.
When all is said and done, Roma is a deep game with varied paths to success. I might be naturally programmed to like Roman-themed games, having been born on the Ides of March, but I'm sure that that hasn't clouded my judgement here.

[b]Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus:[/b]

1. Strong, wrestle for control of Rome theme.
2. Excellent artwork.
3. Huge and complex decision trees.
4. Fast gameplay. Did I say fast? As fast as a dagger to the gut fast.
5. Nasty, screw your opponent over to win, wranglings, every blood-soaked turn. This is a good thing.
6. No surefire strategies.
7. Satisfying experience.
8. Simple rules. The permeations that result from all the varied card powers will keep your brain busy, though.
9. Varied paths to victory.
10. Nailbiting finishes.
11. No icons. English on every card. Woop! Woop!
12. A "bribery" icon has been added. Upping the complexity of your decisions, and also smoothing out the luck a smidge.
13. Portable.
14. Cheap. Especially for the mileage you'll get from this bronzed god.
15. Superior, but similar to, many other dice-allocating games, such as Alien Frontiers.

[b]Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus:[/b]

1. Some of the English on the cards is poor. Not a deal-breaker, just irritating.
2. Dice and cards. So, no cubes moved from warehouse to the docks for 3 points on your turn, or growing turnips type euro game. Yes, there is a huge amount of luck in what you pull from the teeny deck of cards, and, obviously what you roll on the dice. But, let me assure you, that the luck can be managed by careful placement of cards to "icons". Clever play will overcome the odds. Plus, you will draw so many cards during your struggle for power, that you should be able to do something to grab a gaunlet full of VPs.
3. Too confrontational for many players.
4. Some gamers feel that certain cards are broken. I do not agree.
5. Some of these same gamers believe that Roma suffers from "first turn advantage". My anecdotal evidence does not support this. You can always penalise the first player by 1 or 2 VPs, I suppose. Or, better yet, make the loser of the last game go first next time.
6. With 2 experienced players, games can go long, say an hour; a fun hour, but an hour nethertheless.

A Feld with a nasty edge to it. Great two player game.

No need to have this and Roma in my opinion.

Quick 2 player game that has a lot of depth because of the card differences.

I think I was spoiled by Feld's other games into expecting something monumental whereas this just turned out to be fun.  Might increase with multiple plays, but for now I was anticipating more.

RATING: 7
Pretty decent two player filler. Need to play more to see if luck can be mitigated, but for now, a qualified "pretty good."

RATING: 9
Just as good as the original game. It seems to add more possible paths to victory, by diminishing the impact of the Forum, while losing a touch of clarity, because of the need to read your opponent's cards upside down (instead of, say, glancing at a symbol). The funny thing is, I prefer the text to the symbols, because it makes the game easier to teach.

This game is better than Knock-on-Word.  It allows for American-style crosswords, with their tight grids.  It doesn't put specific letters in the grids, but rather chips that represent a range of letters (A-D, E-K, etc.).  Finally, victory isn't achieved only when the board is filled; instead, you're competing for ownership of nine sectors of the board, and you win by claiming a majority or three-in-a-row.  You also aren't restricted by a two-letter starter tile when making up a word.

RATING: 6
Game is interesting but seriously flawed.  We liked the concept, and it was fun to give and guess the clues, but the rules so greatly favored the clue-givers that it was easy to go on an extended run, locking the other team out of playing for a long time.  That's not so fun.

Needs some kind of limit on turns so that control rotates around the table more quickly.

Word games aren't normally my kind of thing, but this one is exceedingly clever.   It abstracts letters into colors, combines a bit of Crossword, Password, and area control into a mish-mash that totally works.   And to think it was designed in 1973....  way, way, way ahead of it's time.   I admire and respect it for that.   Clue-giving is the most important element, and with the use of a timer and a neat 2 vs 1 system, the game moves along at a good pace, and should be playable in 60 minutes.   Nice.

[2 plays] Montage was a mindblowing experience--a 4p partnership game that's part word game, arguably part deduction game (I disagree), part party game, and the realest of real-time games I have ever encountered.

Here's the deal. One team is white and one is black. The tokens that go on the board have are in five colors; each is black-and-some-color on one side, and white-and-the-same-color on the other side. There are also some completely dark brown tokens, and these serve exactly the same purpose as the black squares in a crossword puzzle. To set up, you lay out one of a bunch of possible starting figures in the rulebook.

Each player has one of these player aids, showing how the letters of the alphabet are grouped into association with the five colors.

Words can be played on the grid forwards or backwards, vertically or horizontally. You show the start and direction of your intended word by placing the arrow token.

Say the word being made is a 5-letter word, with 2nd letter blue (O, P, R, S, or Q) and 4th letter orange (A, B, C, D, or Z). It might be "splat" or "topaz" or "aside" or anything else that fits. 

So here's where Montage is a word game: you have to come up with words that fit into the grid. If this is a deduction game, though, so is a crossword puzzle. The party game element comes in when you try to communicate to your teammate which word you've chosen. The subgenre of party games to which this belongs would be those I call communication games: games like Password and Taboo where you're trying to convey information under some sort of restriction. The restriction here is that your clue can only be 5 words long. Also, you're not just giving clues to your partner--the other team is also active. 

When someone guesses your word--meaning they've thought of a word that fits into the designated space on the board and also makes sense with your clue--they knock. If your partner is first or second to knock, you can pick them (so there's a home team advantage). If both members of the opposing team knock before your partner figures it out, though, you must call on one of them. Whoever wins the word gets to fill it in with disks of their color. First team to have 10 disks in a square wins the square. 

When the turn passes to the other team, you flip the timer on them immediately. Rather than their clue-giver starting the timer when they give the clue, the process of picking a spot on the board and thinking of a word that fits in it and thinking of a clue to use for that word is all timed. So once the game starts, it pretty much never stops. Any smidgen of spare time you have--because someone else is guessing the word, because the active clue-giver is thinking, whatever--is spent frantically looking at the board and trying to think of possible future words to use on your turn. It's a wild, wild ride.

RATING: 8.5
Terrific word game; for 4 players in partnerships; one player chooses a secret word in the crossword style grid and gives crossword style clues, which his partner must try to guess before the opposing team.  Teamwork style and speedy play make this a lot of fun for fans of word games!

Montage is a unique word game in that none of the components feature any letters or words of any kind, outside of the player aids. Itâ€™s a racing game of sorts where each team of two is trying to get the majority within four different areas before the other team can. The longer the length of the words chosen for players to guess, the faster the spaces fill up. I really like the amount of player interaction and the way everyone is involved all the time. The only slow spots are when players have to think up words for the other players to guess.

A great word game for 4, along the lines of Password, but you're making up the words rather than getting the them from a card. 

I read the rules to this and thought that the color-letter matching would be totally brain-burny. More than that -- from the rules, the concept sounds not fun and borderline painful. But in practice you get the hang of it after a couple turns, and it's a lot of fun. Helps a lot if players (or at least me) are thinking of their next word/clue when it's not their turn.

Finally played Montage again with (mostly) the proper rules, and the jury's still out. I think a proper buzzer system would make this game work a bit better. Judging the knocking got a little contentious as our game wound down to its conclusion, and understandably so. Our strategies seemed to be giving easier clues, but relying on the game mechanics to carry us through; in other words, because your partner only has to be among the first two to knock, it was rather easy for us to hold control for awhile.

Partnership letter-word game in which each tile stands for one of a number of letters.  One person gives a clue to an incomplete word on the board, and everyone else tries to complete it.  Hard to really summarize well, so I'm not going to try to do so completely.  There's a mechanism for who can guess and when.  Each tile added to the board is assigned to one of the teams based on who guessed the first word that contained that tile.  When you get enough tiles in an area, you control the area.  When you control enough areas, you win the game.

I'm not sure how much this would hold up to repeated play, especially with the "rush to answer" thing, but it was okay for one game at least.

Doesnâ€™t live up to the hype, but a very good game nonetheless. Combination of scrabble and crosswords and password and apples to apples.   I was surprised that coming up with skillful clues was harder than coming up with the actual words. This game requires the right person who can think about letters abstractly with the colors, so not for everyone. But I want to play again.  Can be easily tailored with house rules to be more pressured (1m to form word and solve) vs taker longer.

Unique partnership word game. Not for everyone. It's a game that forces you to be creative in the devising of your words and clues - which is the game's main strength and also the thing that will kill it for many people. Whether the game is hard or easy to play, depends on your skill in doing this. I think it is a pretty brilliant design. Just not sure I'll find the right crowd to play it with.

A fun and unique game, definitely ahead of its time.  While I'm not the biggest word game fan, I enjoy the partnership aspect as well as the speed part of knocking quickly.  Like Dixit, the game is prone to the use of inside information that the other players may not know, but personally I don't have a problem with that.  I could see my rating increasing on further play, though it seems like the type of niche game that you play only once in a while, when you're in the mood.

Extremely clever combination of guessing game and password game, only playable by two pairs of players but fiercely original and direct enough to make a strong impression when it hits the table. Players must have a good command of language and a very quick mind, since there's a bare minute to find a word, think out a clue of five words or less and have your partner guessing the word before the opponents do.

As usual with Joli Quentin Kansil's games, Montage seems to have too many rules as they are explained, but they gel almost immediately afterwards and the game moves forward in a quick, exciting way. Nevertheless, in Montage there's a potential source of conflict: determining whether knocks are in direct succession or not is a very subjective matter that might not suit very competitive players too well.

RATING: 7
A very neat wordy concept game. In essence, it's much the same experience as Dixit, or Say Anything - give a (max 5 word) clue to a word that hopefully only one other (your partner here!) will know. Except that the answer isn't given to you on a platter by the game, you actually to have to first work out a legal word that can be placed on the board and work out your clue from there. Lucky there's a timer! Playing cryptically's a bit dull though and often not much fun when a clue escapes everyone and you're sitting there for a minute with nothing happening. I like the fast clues which everyone will know, and you're relying on your partner to get in before both the opponents get in - the odds are ever in your favour after all. The board fills fast, the game goes fast, continual satisfaction of getting it right - much more fun. We limited our game to a max of 3 consecutive turns to ensure the fun was shared around - recommended.

Having been impressed by Joli Quentin Kansil's What's My Word? I was keen to try his other 70s word game and got a copy on sale. 

It's a partnership game in which you are trying to communicate a word to your partner by giving a clue up to 5 words long, hoping your opponents won't guess it first. But you don't get given the word on a card, you have to come up with one that fits on the crossword-grid board. And on the grid, letters aren't shown directly but represented by five colours which each correspond to a group of 5 or 6 different letters. Successfully guessing words lets you fill the space on the grid with your team's chips, with the winners being determined by area control. 

As if all that wasn't enough, the whole process of a turn (selecting a spot, choosing a word that fits, cluing and guessing) must be done within a minute and as soon as that is over, the next turn starts! It makes for a unique rush of frantic creativity. Also neat that it has elements of both word game (where meaning matters, like Codenames) and letter game (where it doesn't, like Scrabble).

Oct 2016: Best word game ever. It's only "flaw" is that it requires exactly four players.

Nov 2010: Finally played this with a deluxe Scrabble board; coloured wooden cubes that are the size of a standard die, which I purchased at a crafts store; and tiny cubic glass beads to indicate cube ownership (I wasn't willing to put stickers on those cubes before trying out the game).

Excellent word game that I don't think I'll be playing often because of the difficulty of finding exactly three other players who like word games.

Montage is basically Password or any other clue-giving party game, except your words are constrained by a crossword puzzle grid. If you were actually filling a crossword puzzle grid with actual letters, then this game would be impossible to finish. The ingenious thing is that instead of filling the grid Scrabble-style, you're filling it with coloured tiles, where a colour could represent any one of 5-6 letters.

The only downtime in this game is when one of the players tries to think of a clue. Everyone, though, should be thinking of potential clues too during this time.

What a great deduction crossword-style partnership word game! Only playable with fans of word games, though -- i.e., I don't think a casual word game fan would have a good time playing with more word-obsessed players.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is a big 3x3 grid, with each area divided into a 6x6 (or 7x7?) grid. Several of these spaces are covered up (choose a specific pattern at the start of the game). Players each have markers in their color; these, too, are placed in a specific format. These form a crossword.

Players take turns thinking of a word that fits in a space on the board. Places with team markers are color coded, with each color representing a subset of letters. Your word must use those letters (unmarked spaces can be any letter). The clue may be no longer than 5 words. The other 3 players race to find an answer that fits the clue, and KNOCK when they find it. If the partner knocks first or second, he gets to answer (if right, place your team's markers there). If the opponents both knock first, pick one; if the answer fits, they win it. 

Each player must work first on the space in the center of their edge of the board. When your team has 10+ markers, flip all markers to your side. Then, may work on the other 2 spaces on your edge. After those, may work on any space. The first team to win 4 of the 9 spaces on the board wins the game!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like crosswords as well as word games and Montage fits in nicely.  It suffers somewhat from team members using inside knowledge like movies they have both seen, for example.  Also, it would be nice to incentify using fewer blank spaces, since that is more challenging.  Maybe the possibility of flipping the existing tiles if the other team uses them correctly?  As it is, you want to try for the longer blank spaces.  Still fun, but with some improvement could be an excellent game.

Typically abstract Colovini, but there's an interesting area enclosure-type game here. Plenty to think about. Seemed to be lacking something at 2p, too chaotic at 4p so I'm hoping that 3p will be the sweet spot.

Juego casi abstracto, de control de zonas, cerrándolas al paso de Alejandro, con mecánica de cartas para movimiento y posesión de las provincias. Debido a estas cartas hay bastante factor suerte, pero quitando eso, es un juego bastante entretenido, no ocupa mucho espacio, y se puede jugar esporádicamente y también con no jugones. Fundas tamaño mini-euro para cartas.

Not too much going on. You can't really plan too much beyond your current turn because the borders change constantly and you usually have to rely on what cards happen to be flipped up when it gets back to your turn. The decisions aren't very exciting or deep. Stale gaming experience. Could be fun if you enjoy screwing over your opponents.

Game play is solid and interesting but fairly abstract (in a typical Colovini way).  Mechanics are very clean.  The game plays quickly with a feeling of acceleration as the game end nears.  Some may be turned off by the scoring for all players at 1 time, but the mechanic works well and requires some planning.  Overall a solid light game. [GTI Code: APSL]

RATING: 6.5
This is a game about an ad-hoc Elvis pit-stop whistle tour through the Middle East, criss-crossing the region according to the combined tour planning of 4 independent promoters, that leaves little pockets of fans all over the place. Once the fan-base is established in an area, the promoters send in their tribute clones to monopolize these little pockets. A promoters can trigger tribute days, and the promotion for these days creates a cash-in bonanza for all Elvis clones around the country. The promoter who controls the most lucrative areas will have the biggest cash windfall. Fly-poster wars across the entire area controlled by one promoter can result in the audience completely losing interest in the old pretender, and switching towards the new kid in town instead. I think.

Actually I am not sure what this is supposed to be about. Whatever they wanted it to be about is forgotten the moment the lid comes off the box. What is left is hand management, area control, area creation, leader-bashing and card hoarding, with attractive and functional bits on a colourful map, using a movement mechanism that is different enough to have attraction to some, but will leave many people disengaged. The Colovini name flags up quite neatly that this is one to seek out, or avoid, depending on past experiences with the man.

This is one of those odd ones where I am more forgiving to its short-comings than I should be, and if someone suggest it, in all likelihood I will be quite happily join in. I guess I find it just more intriguing than irritating, and it is mainly the a-typical movement rules for the Alexander figure that make it for me. With flashes you can be brilliant here. Alas, at times it also feels like gaining marginal control of a runaway stampede every 4th turn, and trying to do something meaningful isn't always an option.

None of the irritations I have with the game annoy me enough to dislike any session, except when they conspire and create a runaway excessive and repetitive scoring situation. Unfortunately successful power-play is disproportionally lucrative, encouraging unrestricted card-hoarding to snap up emerged super-provinces. You are very much at the mercy of what is left to you, and even with the option to override the options on the board, it can still be too hard, or too costly to create a new, empty, territory to claim. Large territories go to the person who was waiting to pounce, and lucky enough to get the turn at the right moment. Once established, if it isn't split up through a clever move in the very next turn, it is often nigh impossible to orchestrate a return visit later on. Since scoring happens to all players simultaneously, once a player gets a sizeable lead, it can be very hard to make up the difference. Matching the terrain gap isn't good enough, you need to outscore the leader by the same margin, leaving capture of claimed terrain as the only viable way to go about it, for sizeable leads. The problem is, is that that requires cards, and plenty of them. Since you acquire cards at the same pace, and seizing enemy terrain costs more than creating new terrain, the leader is likely to off-set any loss at the same pace, and will also gain half of what is used to evict. It sometimes only takes 2 or 3 taxation rounds by a leader in this position to clinch the game there and then. Which suggests that splitting up large terrain is the only clever way to go about it, but while the movement rules are clever and not completely inflexible, in reality they are a wee bit too restrictive to target danger spots with much hope of succeeding.

VARIANT: To me this game cries out for a fix, and I think it has to be a scoring fix, as it is the run-away scoring that creates a problem. Apart from that it all works quite neat. A hand-limit to tackle hoarding for huge provinces is the other one, but that can't work as turfing someone out a (then) maximum size province requires hand-size plus 2. So a scoring fix it is. I can't think of a perfect one, but maybe the solution is through scoring that doesn't automatically happen across the board. It is the one thing that people instinctively seem to pin down as the problem. Private scoring is too simple and wouldn't work. One thought is to let the taxing player score everything, and others only the provinces where leaders sit on the played card colour, giving struggling players the option to be selective. But the one that has a nice ring to my ears, is to let the active player score ALL own provinces, and let the other players OPTIONALLY score their provinces, but for EACH province players wants to do that, they have to discard a card matching their leader's terrain colour if they want to raise taxes in that province too. It would mean that the player who controls the biggest province will run out of cards to score that one rapidly, whilst others get the opportunity to create scores that the leader doesn't automatically piggy-backs along with for free. Maybe a combination of the two, if this is too brutal, and to stay slightly closer to the original rules: Let the active player score ALL regardless of which terrain colour the leaders occupy, and let the other players score ALL of the played tax card colour automatically, and if they want to include (own) terrain OTHER than the colour currently played by the active leader, they need to play the card to match that leader's terrain.

Have to try it, but it sounds like it might well work.

I think Leo develop great games with simple and easy rules. As many games from Leo Colovini, there are people who loves them and other who hates them. I love almost all of his games. Alexandros is another one that I like.

It's cheap so, future purchase, for sure.

I'm generally not very fond of games where takeovers are easy to accomplish and you have to rely on a "lucky" position to do the most beneficial. 

This game gives a small reimbursement to the player with a territory that's taken over so that it's possible to come back in a better position and take overs aren't necessarily the most strategic move.

Adquirido a Gixmo en Dic 09, entregado en Ene 10.

Es bastante sencillo de explicar y de jugar, pero hay que hacer bastantes cálculos para jugarlo. Es algo sesudo. Hay un factor muy importante de puteo, así que la interacción con otros jugadores es bestial.

Cada turno consta del movimiento de alejandro, y después dos de cuatro posibles acciones (robar carta, ocupar provincia, impuestos, recuperar gobernador).  Se trata de tener el control sobre las provincias que más dinero te puedan generar al recaudar impuestos.. pero cuidado, cada vez que recaudas solo tú gastas la acción, pero todos reciben dinero según las provincias que controlen.

Está entretenido.

Cambiado a Chesirecat en CLBSK2012 (mayo2012) por un O Zoole mío.Me dió un poco de pena, pero no veía mesa.

The theme is meaningless.  The gameplay is dry and abstract.  The game length controls feel artificial or contrived.

I would never choose this game (or purchase it), but I will play it.

I really enjoy this one.  It's not deep, but the tactics are fun and the puzzle aspect of the game as you figure out what you can do is very interesting.  The most popular tactic in my games has been to try to save up cards to get a huge province, then levy taxes as fast as possible.  If you can get Alexander to the other side of the board, away from your province, that can be a game winning move.  That's hard to do, though.

Alexandros has only gotten two plays. As a general matter, I've learned not to overlook Colovini titles after just one or two plays, but usually they have a spark that ignites my curiosity sufficiently to continue to explore. I was not really getting it from this one. While it was entertaining, it didn't seem like it was hiding a lot of depth and really just seems pretty mediocre. While the flow of play is unique in my experience, the decisions themselves were not particularly what I look for.

This game was a pleasant surprise. It has attractive components and engaging gameplay. I like the menu of actions. The scoring is a bit awkward feeling initially, as you are scoring for everyone when you do it. You just want to make sure you are in a position to have a positive margin with the other players. 

The variable game-ending caught me off-guard, but that is what really makes this game work. There are a lot of ways to manipulate other peoples' territorial value. I'd like to play this again and I think my rating will probably rise with more familiarity.

I thought this game was pretty good a couple of years ago because it was following a different path than most of the Euros- it had some fairly interesting mechanics and was somewhat unique.  However, now I find games like this tremendously grating and not worth the time.  One's thing's for certain- the game doesn't have a DAMN thing to do with Alexander and the thought of trying to suck up to him in yet another "impress the despot" Euro makes me sick.

Area control.  Take or play a card to move Alexandros who leaves walls in his path.  Each player may take 2 actions of 4 available: taking cards, occupying a territory, taking a guard off the board, or levying taxes.  The last is the only way to score victory points.  Points are received one for each empty space in a territory you control with a single guard.  When taxes are levied, all players receive their taxes.

RATING: 4
I still don't know how I feel about Alexandros, even after about 5 plays to date. I concluded fairly quickly that this game isn't particularly suited for 2 players because it's too much see-sawing back and forth and cutting each other's countries in two. This Babel-esque gameplay works on your nerves very quickly, and the endgame was more often than not a matter of being lucky with the cards so you could create a major taxation area. But at 3 and 4 players there's also something missing. You quickly learn that important in this game are [i]relative[/i] point differences. It doesn't matter to the player in the lead if his opponents get points too, as long as they don't get significantly more than he does. This makes catching up a player in the lead hard: you must, over several taxation events, score [i]significantly more[/i] points than he does, otherwise overtaking him is not possible before the game ends. The other option open to you is simply cutting his territories in two, or kicking him out, but these are costly events and depend very much on where Alexander is on the map [i]and[/i] what you have in your hands. To date the end result was not very satisfying: it appears this game cannot be played with a 'to each his own' mindset, but at the same time, 'one vs. the rest' is not very appealing either. The game 'works' and is, I think, on its own merits not a bad title, but I have this nagging feeling the game is not my 'type'. What I expect to occur doesn't, and based on what I currently know, there isn't a clear way out of the relative difference-trap either.

[b]Update[/b] The game was sold off, eventually, and I don't think it shall be missed a great deal.

[b]Update 2[/b] As part of going from A to Z through a gaming library this game hit the table again, and to my surprise the problems I had written about above didn't appear. In fact the finish was very close, which is remarkable given the at one point huge gap of nearly 35 points between the two leaders and two tailers. While going over the rules I spotted a detail which I may have overlooked during the games I played when I still owned this: Alexander may not be moved to a triangle which is occupied, and the existence of a wall along its sides already counts as occupied. The implication was that some areas simply could no longer be divided into smaller ones, and that taking over such an area causes maximum damage to the previous owner as far as his relative score is concerned. You're not going to win by opening up areas yourself: go for the throat instead!

In short, the game appeared to work as intended. Quite curious... I must replay again to discover whether I was perhaps too hasty.

RATING: 2
Components: The board and pieces are well-made. The different card/space symbols are easy to distinguish, though not pretty.

Experience: There are several different elements at work here: the movement of Alexander, the card draft, the claiming/usurping of territories, the levying of taxes; but none of them is particularly interesting, nor do they gel into an interesting whole. Very mechanical. But I am so enamored of Clans that I will continue to be a Colovini fan.

I love math, but most of Knizia's creations leave me wondering where the fun is.  Colovini, on the other hand, leaves an impression of genius by the sheer elegance of his designs.  Nothing fiddly, no contrived scoring mechanisms, just pure and simple rules which lead to naturally balanced, strategically deep game play with just enough randomness built in to reward flexible planning and ensure high replayability.  I'm in awe.

Only one play so far, but seems pretty good.  One of those games where the initial move is not really clear and probably won't affect the final score much, but once you get a few turns in and things start to take shape on the board, then it's a lot of fun.

I really like this; rating could go up with more playings.  The movement of Alexander is unintuitive and feels random, but with experience I bet you could predict his movements and even affect future movements.  I love the planning involved to occupy and take over regions and also be able to score them when you have a point advantage on the board; I always feel like I'm exactly one card (or one action) short of what I really want to do.  The game is a perfect length, too-- it lasts long enough to really feel a sense of development and conquest, but ends before the map is filled.  (I'm looking forward to meeting the 100-points end condition some day.)  My only reservation is the possibility for king-making at game end; perhaps the game end condition should be slightly more random?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
[Colovini] Puzzling little eurogame with lots of neat mechanisms. I very much like the hand-managemnt decisions and the unique way that Alexander's path cuts the board into regions. Yet it lacks fun. Also it seems to be a series of dry tactical decisions that reward the player who can optimize the Alexander pawn by making high-yield regions and/or leave few options for the next player.

I liked this but we weren't clear on the rules for moving Alexander. My friend made a big land grab, but I cut it in half before he scored it. The game seemed simple enough, but may depend too much on attacking the player to your right. I bought it, but it may not hold the attention for long.
- Played it again as a 2player game, really liked it. Much easier than I remembered. A good buy.
- Played again, it is a nice game but really works on margins. Being able to attack the leader counts a lot.

This game would be a perfect candidate for a list called: "If not for this one crucial detail, this would be a great game."  The crucial detail in question is the levy tax action.  Since everyone scores all their provinces, the player scoring an insane amount of points for an insanely big province takes and keeps the lead throughout the game.  Since the ways to take over a province is rather difficult to pull off, the game becomes obviously skewed early on.  Has anyone thought of a brilliant fix for this problem?  I generally like Colovini's games but this one just seems flawed.

The game looks rather clever and the rules are easy enough to learn.  I am more than a little concerned that one player could run away with it, but happy to say this did not happen in our game where a player near the back came up to win and the initial trailer came in second.

The game is not as short in duration as the box would have us believe; our game lasted way over an hour - more like one and a half hours.  Not good for something that has the complexity of a filler.

3/11/04 - Rating 7. This is an initial rating after one play. However, it could go up or down. All of us enjoyed the game. I am not yet ready to place it higher, only because one play isn't enough for a true rating. My gut feeling is that it could go higher with more plays. Biggest downside to me - it is an abstract war game; not like Memoire '44!

Ooh, this is a brain-burner. Quite simple rules but it can generate an epic struggle. I almost always play 2 player.

The way it seems to proceed is that one player gets a territory and starts taxing to score points. The other player then must claim their own territory so as to minimise the advantage of taxing, or maybe send Alexander through the middle of the other player's territory so that the space is divided. They could even take the territory over if they happen to have the cards. 

We almost never see a territory occupied with more than one guard - if you do so you've just created a target for your opponent to send Alexander into. 

I've had a little success manipulating the face-up cards so that Alexander is forced to travel away from my territories, but of course my opponent has the option of playing a card from their hand. It seems to be useful to try to manipulate Alexander to create a territory which matches the cards in your hand, though it may have only worked once.

Alexandros is area-enclosure meets area-control meets hand management. It is a game with lots of little twists to the common area-enclosure titles.

In Alexandros you define territories by moving Alexander around the board. He leaves a trail behind him that creates regions of which players can take control, tax and score victory points. The interesting thing is that when you tax all regions tax, even your opponents, so you have to find ways to make taxing primarily beneficial to you. Also, territories can be fought over and also dissected by further movement of Alexander.

Alexandros is a personal favorite and furthers my position as a Colovinist.

This is a neat little territory game by Colovini.  I really like Colovini's games....unfortunately, my son doesn't, and I play a lot of my games with him.  Clans and Carolus Magnus are a couple of my favorites, but no one will play them with me.

Oh how I wanted to like you, Alexandros!  It is not that I didn't try.  What is odd to me about this game is that as I read the rules I thought I would enjoy this game.  I enjoy the look of the game, and I enjoy similar mechanics in other games, but for some reason this one was not exciting.  It was tedious keeping track of the taxable spaces, and in the end this game just came across as a little dull.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A crazy-good game. Abstract board with triangle-shaped fields does a great job here - Alexander the Great travels and sets borders, this is how new provinces are formed. The greedy generals of Alexander struggle to get the best provinces and get as much gold as possible from the peasants. I love how the cards are used in this game - to move Alexander, to occupy provinces, to levy the taxes. I really enjoy the strategy here.

This one was a disppointment for me. I am rather fond of Colovini games but this one seems to lack the apparant simplicity of gameplay. 

The board design is rather bland as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It seems simpler and not nearly as interesting as Masons.

The scoring seems to discourage scoring except when you get more points than anyone else. However, that is something you usually set p for your next turn, giving other players a chance to break that up. Which seems to lead to no scoring.

As most Colovini games this one is also at heart an abstract game. As a low luck concept it's more than ok to me but it does not often hit the table becauste it's not a beauty and it can be mean, too.

RATING: 4
Played 5+ I have only played this with 4 players, each game taking about 70 minutes. It is very chaotic. You will have no idea what the board will look like when your next go comes around. It is prone to king making, within a round the other players can take someone from a leading position to dead last without the player able to do anything about it. The game is prone to analysis paralyses with down time an issue. All told a catalogue of undesirable characteristics. I would rate this lower but I suspect that with 2 and 3 players the game probably provides a much better experience. Oddly having ripped the game apart I have enjoyed the 2 games I have played I just don't fancy playing it again. *UPDATE* I did play this again, this time with 3 players, took 1 hour and it was better, still chaotic. *UPDATE* Played with 2. I can finally conclude I just don't like this game. July 04

Ok area control game; the mechanisms are not bad (Alexandre's move, cards to take over a province).But counting the points in the tax action is really annoing (it's almost a killing flaw, since you don't do it once at the end, but many times, during the game), and since there are better titles in this category (through the desert, go) ...

Played 2 player; seems quite up and down.  One player gets a lead, the other cuts them back.  It really is a race to get to 100 first (or be ahead when both hit 100), the card draw was usually bad for me, but I still won.  My gaming buddy didn't seem to like it.  I thought it was good without being outstanding.

Well, it is nice. But I didn&#039;t have this: Wow, that&#039;s new! - feeling when playing it. And there is hardly a moment when you can make interesting desicions. Choose between two open symbol-cards and move Alexander to the closest from his actual position. Lucky you, when you enclose an area with the walls you lay along his moving track.

Juego subestimado en BGG. Semiabstracto y con algo de azar.

I cannot comment on the game yet because the friend that explained the game to me, managed to get many (all?) rules wrong. I will play it again in the future, for now I can only say that the artwork is kind of ugly, it could have been better.

I expect to play this game soon.

What a disappointment from Colovini. I didn’t have high hopes but the game is very boring and obvious. As I said before, the art is kind of regular. The rules aren’t hard, but reading the from the game manual wasn’t as easy as I would have thought. 

It is pure tactics, in your turn you have to play with the cards that are dealt in the center of the table, so your options are clearly defined. I know you can use a card from your hand but that isn’t the case most of the time. I found that the uncontrollable luck is very high. After Alexander moves you now have more options, but they are also obvious (for the most part) so the game has no interesting decisions. It wasn’t fun for any of the players.

The theme is absent from the game. Pure abstract.
 
I generally hate when a game ends immediately when a certain condition is met. Some games are able to pull it off balancing this issue somehow, but Alexandros is not among them. This practically ensures that some players will have less turn than others and when you take into account that you can levy taxes (gain VPs) one less time that some players it strikes me as very unfair. It also has a lot of “king making” and "attack the leader” moments, a huge minus for me. As the game situation changes a lot between turns, I think Alexandro is best with two players, with more the luck factor increases a lot.

It has cool wood bits, I felt like I was playing Transamerica.

Bottom line a disappointing plain game. I already sold my copy. I like some of Colovini´s designs  (Carolus Magnus, Clans) but he is not among my favorite game designers. I will try to stay away from it.

For some reason I have a soft spot for TransAmerica, which is why this game might get a second chance with me.  There's certainly some strategy in deciding when to make a move for a province, and in how to divide provinces.  Prone to kingmaking though, and that's a big negative.

RATING: 7.5
It's taken a couple of plays (for us anyway) to work out all the kinks in this tactical card driven game of territory control and it has definitely been well worth the effort.  Territory size and value is determined by the placement and movement of Alex himself, while the ultimate control of territory is influenced by calculated hand management.  The overall quality of the board and bits by RGGs are top notch.  Rating will most likely go up with more play.

Chaotic, but not in a fun way. Each time I played, everyone would forget to implement at least 2 of the rules. I really wanted to like this, and it just didn't happen. When I played it with my wife, we were both disappointed. When I played with a game group, it got 8 thumbs down. It was very hard to plan what to do on your next turn, and, on your turn, there would often be either no good play, or one obvious play. Assuming you could see it- whichever intertices on the board you could move Alexander were never very easy to identify. We traded our copy for El Grande. The 1 time I have been able to play El Grande easily trumps the 4 times I played this...

Abstract game, okay, but not great.  Area creation, control and contesting.  Very unforgiving (particularly on crap strategies :)), and the random element can be punishing depending on what cards show up.  

No catch up mechanism in a 2 player game (in 3 player there may be a limited catch up option via metagaming).  This really encourages analysis paralysis, with a lot to think through each turn.  Unfortunately the game play just isn't fun enough for me.  Much prefer Ticket to Ride, which shares the random card draw and swaps area creation / control with a race for route creation.

Many other games I'd rather play first.

It seems like Colovini's games are hit and miss with me.  They usually have a highly abstract bent which I don't seem to mind.

I really like Alexandros, but my last game I messed up an important rule.  The game has simple mechanics but the play is much deeper than expected.

Some people say you are at the whim of the cards, and perhaps this is true to a small extent, but that could be said of many games.  I love how the path of Alexander carves out new territories and the idea that only one governer can be in a province to collect taxes is perfect.

The unique mechanisms of Alexandros makes it a bit hard to form a strategy in your first game. As one of the generals under Alexander the Great, you have a lot of freedom to slice up Persia and grab your shares (or decreasing or taking over others' shares). You even get to choose when to score. The problem is that everybody else will score for free so you must decide when it's worth the cost and time.

As it usually happens with Leo Colovini's games, Alexandros sports a single very unusual feature: in this case it's a big pawn that strolls on the board before every single move and leaves walls in its wake, dividing the board into regions. 

Even if what follows is more predictable (regions bring scores, players fight for them drafting and playing out cards, scores are triggered for all players at a time) it still takes a couple of plays to get warm to the game. Unfortunately, after grasping the unusual movement of Alexandros (the aforementioned big pawn) it still takes some effort to tame the relatively high luck factor: Alexandros' gate is very dependent on card draws and so is the hand of each player.

The game combines collecting cards whilst building walls to define regions, and then using the cards to control the most valuable regions.  The theme is pretty thin as this is for all intents and purposes an abstract game.  It does suffer from the problem of players often realising they cannot win when much of the game is still to play, which in the most extreme case could be a run-away leader.  However, this is still a game I enjoy playing.

Alexandros is an adequate Area Control/Economic game. Most of this game hinges on the movement of Alexander and the purchasing/taxing the various provinces created.  The movement of Alexander, while relatively simple can at times create some confusion over the specific boundaries of newly created provinces.  Game play is not overly exciting.  It is OK as a 2 player game but begins feeling constricted at 5 players.  Not a bad game but there are many out there better than this.

This is a game with very unique mechanics. Even Colovini fan like me have hard time rating this game. There is rich get rich aspect that are intentionally put in to encourage competition.  Handmanagement and card counting is a must skill to play this game. Its a game that all player must be skillful in order to be good.

I like this game however, it is too short for what it is. Just about the time things begin to develop, the game is over.  It is a great idea with a touch of wargame to it but simply too short. The game plays much better with only two as you have far more control over the flow.

Better with two I think rather than 4 players.  My wife and I really like Masons, so we picked this one up by the same designer.  Masons is the better game, but Alexandros is very interesting too.  

The card draws at the start of turn can be very frustrating but it is fun to divide up your opponents territories.  The end game conditions are rather odd and anti-climatic, but a decent game overall.

***Have only played as a 2 player, so far***
Interesting area control game. I like the way that the Alexander figure is used to determine the areas & the way you can move him right through someones existing area to reduce the size! - nasty!
You need to keep an eye on when to claim taxes (score) as it scores all players & you don't want to end up giving more points to your opponents than you're going to get!

I found this game full on strategy and low on luck. My sort of game. With Colovini in the saddle you can't go wrong when it comes to a game full of strategy. A nice middleweight game that should only last less than an hour. I abhor scoretracks, so I use money instead. With that little change, I have found it one of the games that I have played more than others. I have over 50 games, so that is a shining star when I say that.

This one can be a little dry (theme is light and pasted on). Also, determining which territory is "closest" to Alexander can be a bit of a chore as the board fills. Card play mechanics similar to Kahuna.

The game is unique, but it has some flaws. With skillful playing the first 10 rounds is just picking more cards to your hand which is quite tedious. It's dry and abstract, but abstract lovers don't like the card luck.

Another solid Colvini game. One of those quick playing small box games that everyone needs a few of. Some vague similarities to E&T, go, etc.

Very abstract, even for a Euro, so if you need theme you should give this one a miss. Similar vibe / niche to the more recent UR.

Haven't played anything quite like this.  A little bit of train game in it, but with the lines carving out regions instead.  Leans more to the tactical side, though planning can make for more efficient play.
Not many people seem to go for this game, and I wish they could be forced to play three or four times, until they 'grok' it.  It's got plenty of rewarding play for the patient.

The current rating of 6.3 is probably about right for this game. For some reason the first time I played this I totally screwed up the rules - actually the reason would be that the game is quite original. A classic Colovini. I rate it a solid 7 but that abstract odd gameplay Colovini factor can be offputting for some.

Wonky gameplay with the potential for a runaway leader.  I DO like cordoning off territory (and bisecting other's territory), but it seem difficult to have any long-term strategy about it other than moving Alexander as far away as possible from the biggest territory you have.

Interesting area control game.  I like the variety of choices available in deciding where to move Alexander, what kind of regions to set up, and whether or not to take a region from one of your opponents or set up your own.  As a two-player, it's not very good: too much tit-for tat, but as a four-player game, it's quite entertaining, although I think the fourth player (to play from the start) is at a disadvantage.

RATING: 5
It just didn't do anything for me. The theme is lacking, and it just wasn't very much fun. I'd probably try it again if someone else really wanted to play it, but I won't go looking for this game.

Rethemed as Big Bad Dog (BBD) - yes, it's a bit tasteless, but it makes more sense than Alexandros!
There's a big, mean, stupid junkyard dog running from landmark to landmark marking his territory (use yellow sticks instead of black). These landmarks should be things like fire hydrants, mailboxes, lamp posts, trees, etc. Each player represents a pack of 4 pathetic little street dogs. The little runts are too scared to mess with BBD's markings; they can, however, temporarily claim parts of his territory. The game ends when BBD can't pee anymore (starts peeing blood? runs out of juice?), and goes looking for either some little dogs to beat up more water to drink.

Not as accessible as Clans, but shares a couple of characteristics I associate with Colovini - non-intuitive spacial relationships (in fact, the art of both games is the creation of the right spaces), and each player can initiate a scoring that may benefit everyone around the table (the science is to create opportunities to benefit yourself the most).  This second characteristic makes it adviseable for players to beat up on their left neighbour, to make that scoring unprofitable, or to at least limit the relative advantage.

Игра из разряда "огораживание и подсчет". Ближайший соперник - Through the Desert, хотя там нет рандома. В пользу этой говорит отсутствие финального подсчета, вместо которого есть возможность (не всегда доступная) делать промежуточные подсчеты, суммируя результат с предыдущими очками. Рандом от карточек есть. Иногда фатальный. Иногда получается блефануть. В результате тактическая игра, в которой не надо торопиться занимать провинции. Card advantage как правило решает, но не всегда. Интересная игра с неоднозначной стратегией.

Alexander and his army passed throughout the entire Orient until he came to Persia, conquering wide areas. In order to pacify the occupied areas, as well as to keep his generals in good spirits, he placed them as governors of the new provinces. They are tasked to build the provincial administration there and collect taxes. Everyone would like to conquer as many paying provinces as possible for himself, of course. Because only then can he be seen by Alexander in the correct light with high tax revenues and win the game.

It can have a runaway leader problem, but I think it's a nifty tactical game for 2. I seldom play it with more, so I don't know if it becomes too random with 3 or 4. I like it fine with 2. I'm enjoying Colovini games more and more.

One comment says, "Transamerica for Mensa."  If that means adding randomness from a card draw, that's a spot on comment!  If it means more strategy, well... I wouldn't say so.  This is an area control game where area creation and control decisions are driven by cards drawn at random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Alexandros suffers from the standard Colovini multi-player chaos less than his other titles (Cartagena, Clans), but many that I've played with haven't stuck with the game enough to figure that out. At first the game seems quite random because your moves are somewhat determined by the cards available, but you can carry through with a strategy and adapt to what you're given.

Works well with two, but somewhat different since you don't receive any cards in compensation when your territory is taken over, a mechanism that I enjoy in the three- and four-player version because those cards can fuel new and unexpected plans.

Played once (with 2 players).

Took several turns to get the hang of the main mechanics -- move Alexander around the map, cutting regions into smaller and smaller portions. Then place your soldiers inside regions. The more empty spaces in a region, the more it scores, but the harder it is to acquire. Also, you can choose Scoring as one of your actions -- the wrinkle is when you choose to score *everyone* in the game scores. You have to pay a card to score and allow your opponents to earn points, so you need to make sure you have a good point advantage to do so. Definitely want to play again.

You know a game has problems when there are 18 pages of errata for 13 pages of rules.  There might be a good game under the hood somewhere, but seriously, this game was never properly developed.  And that d10 combat table is a joke !!

One of the nicest maps ever made for a CoSim for that period

RATING: 8.5
First, the negatives (since I have so few of them!):

-the rulebook is an organizational shambles! Most things are actually covered (but there are a few important exceptions to that!), yet frequently, rules covering a particular facet of the game are not in an area of the rulebook where one would be expecting to find them! As well, there is very little cross-referencing to help players find their way around. There are also (here and there, mainly towards the beginning) some very odd typos.
Having said all that, the latest edition of the FAQ and Errata looks as close to a perfect FAQ and Errata as a game can have! Kudos on that point!

-the price. Actually, I would have no problem with the price...if the game map were mounted! As it is, with the amount one is paying, one deserves far more than the paper game map AtA comes with; and some Spanish regulars and militia, and area control markers, would have been nice, too.

Now that I have that off my chest: this is probably the best wargame (i.e., simulation of an entire war as opposed to a campaign, battle, or skirmish) I have ever played, with the most beautiful wargame map of all time! As a simulation, it is incredibly immersive. With most wargames, you try to figure out the best strategy, calculate the odds, and eventually prove which strategy is the best. Not so in AtA! NOTHING is guaranteed in this game, due to the card-driven mechanics, the exceedingly strong fog-of-war element....and the 10-sided dice! This is MUCH more realistic than most older types of wargames, which were essentially chess variants. I don't know if all card-driven wargames are like this (this is my first, although I've played card-driven non-wargames, like Twilight Struggle), but I'm quite impressed. The horrible uncertainties of war (and the War of 1812 in particular) are an integral part of AtA. It seems impossible that any two games of AtA could be the same.

Some of the events on the cards are historically questionable....but seeing as how not every event is going to happen in every game, that's not a big deal; and none of the events are de facto impossibilities. Nevertheless, I have house-ruled one of the American Privateers cards into a British Privateers card: the deck is far too heavy otherwise with American privateers. American privateers still predominate, however, even with my house-rule; but less so, and more in keeping with history.

Initial Impression: The component quality and artwork for this game are outstanding. I'm tempted to hang a copy of the map on the wall. That being said, this game highlights the political and military aspects of the War of 1812 very well. The game doesn't feel scripted but rather is so open-ended as to almost overwhelm the players with choices. Both factions have very different concerns and strategies to pursue in order to pull off a victory. I love the mechanisms involved with the slow, deliberate buildup of naval and land forces. Surprisingly I find that the fog of war which I love in other games doesn't really add much to this game and probably could have been left out altogether. Perhaps more plays will highlight the necessity of this mechanism. All in all, this is a great package and I look forward to exploring it more.

My review demonstrates my favourable bias towards this game.  As far as those who don't like it, with the exception of my friend, Steve, I am a bit lost with the other comments.  I think that no game on the War of 1812 would please some of the nay-sayers.  And do you really think some of these proposed house rules are going to make it a better game?  If you do not like AtA, you might as well be honest and give up on CDG's altogether.

I have had this game for a few months now - rating is tentative until more play, as I do not yet have a full game under my belt.

That said, the game so far feels like one of the better simulations in the CDG realm, and that is saying something. From what I see so far, games follow a course of build up and then combat, with the deck always throwing surprises into the mix. Components are among the most beautiful I have ever seen in a board wargame and, for me, make the game well worth the higher ticket price it fetches.

Will have to get Gilbert Collins' "Mr. Madison's War" to make a concrete opinion, but so far this seems like the definitive wargame that offers a great take on a war that doesn't seem to be simulated too much at the grand strategic level.

Game needed more development effort before it went out.
I'm also not thrilled with some of the choices (glossy
rules without sufficient referencing structure for example).

Still, this is one hell of an interesting game. There's a
lot of luck built into it, but it puts you through some 
hard choices, and does what feels like a very believable
job of providing an open-ended look at the strategy behind
the war.

Second playing really showed that the rules don't get
better the next time around. Still had to spend way too
much effort finding little things again and again.

Nice installment of war between US and Britain in 1812. Lot of chrome (150 almost unique cards), beautiful map, interesting mechanics. Strong asymetrical feeling in play for both sides. Luck-dependant in card draw and battles, some "amateurish" chaos. 
All in all I think this is a good game and worth playing time. More I play it, more I like it.

After a couple plays, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it sure [i]feels[/i] like you have a lot of choice. There are a lot of different things you can do, and a lot of different events. On the other hand, much of that choice ends up being illusory as most of the peace track adjustments were the direct result of event cards rather than any particular action we took. And I mean about 2/3 of them. The fog of war turns combat into a crapshoot and, once you add in fortifications, the whole area around Lake Ontario and Lake Eerie becomes very stagnant very quickly as neither player is willing to risk a major defeat.

Land battles are a little strange because of the way the Peace Track works and the rules for major and devastating victories. Picking up local militia seems like it ought to improve your chances for winning, but in practice it's more likely to simply give your opponent another space on the Peace Track if you're defeated because defeating armies of certain sizes yields more rewards.

I suspect naval battles will be rare in practice. I only really envision about 1 battle per lake, max, before control is firmly established. After that, there just isn't enough time to build the fleet back up before the game ends.

The IF that eventually shows up is hugely swingy for the British in terms of Peace Track adjustments. The problem is that there's not a damn thing the Americans can do about it, and they can do it repeatedly. Historically there were what, 4 invasions spread over several months? Here you can do 8+, and in the span of weeks.

But, like I said, most of the Peace Track adjustments came straight from event cards or blockades, not our actions. On top of that, if you're familiar with the cards you can game the Peace Track by playing certain cards at the right moment, before your opponent has the chance to react. To wit, my opponent played Storms right before Winter, moved his own fleet out, and bumped the Brits 2 spaces on the Peace Track. On the flip side, if I had held the Indian Uprising cards until the end, I could have seriously gamed my Ghent score. But, frankly, given competent play on both sides I see this game always ending as either a draw or marginal victory.

Anyway, even with these problems and some bad luck I still sort of enjoyed it, and maybe the things I'm complaining about are just the way it's supposed to work. I could probably be convinced to play it again once or twice. But the problems with the way battles work and the excessive reliance on events to move the Peace Track, not to mention the difficult to reference rulebook and the somewhat dysfunctional map, prevent me from giving it a more positive score.

This game is definitely one of my top games. 
There aren't so many games in my collection that I am always willing to play. 

I am usually not fond of CGD games, except for For The People and Hannibal (master-pieces), but this one really uses the best of this system with light rules changes which make the difference: one may 'reserve' cards and also 'pass'. 

The quality of CDG often comes from that of the deck. 

There is an astonishing amount of work about this game: each card portrays something in history, telling you things a European like me didn't know about this war. 
Each player may try different things in each game: 10 games is not enough to discover all the possibilities in this game. 
Every player should read the wonderful design notes which happen also to be really funny. 

Above being a CGD game, this is a damn good game: you literally dive into history, with fun, tension, and a great replayability.

Played this several times now. I like this game and recommend it despite the price, if you have any interest in the period, or cdgs that provide a wide variety of strategic options. the game is of similar rules weight to Hannibal IMO. My opponent and I are quite slow at working out what we want to do since this a game with lots of choice but heavy on consequences so it typically takes us 4 hours to play.

The rhythm of the game is quite varied, you may have a few turns of attrition and countering and frustrating each others attempts to make progress, until one player creates a gap and everything blows up for a while. 

I find this game to be particularly immersive, im not quite sure why. I think its random nature (d10 crt) and the large card deck and fog of war raise the uncertainty levels high enough to make the game feel as much like poker as chess. It gives the game a sense of realism, although i can't comment on its historicity in detail.

Despite the small publisher price tag its components are pretty good if your happy with a paper map (a very pretty one it is though).

==============================
only one play, and that spent mostly learning rules. This looks like a sound game. The fog of wars is a bit extreme, and i managed to roll three 0s and 1 in the four battles i fought (we only played 3 turns). Definitly evokes the frustration of the war. Lots of strategic and tactical options though, which i like.

Played this at ConsimWorld Expo with the very enthusiastic co-designer teaching as we went - a great way to pick up a lot of nuances first time through.  Even without his help, I'd rate Amateurs to Arms as obsoleting every other operational/strategic War of 1812 game out there. Besides looking great, the map manages to include all the important theatres of the war while still covering the main Niagara front at a satisfyingly operational level of detail. The massive (150) card deck adds a lot of colour, while not allowing card management to become more important than the manoeuvring on the map (as happens too often with CDGs). As in the real war, control of the lakes is vital and the all-important ship-building race is handled at a satisfying level of detail. The better harbours can support the construction of bigger ships (up to Frigate size), which also take longer to build. Finally, the components are magnificent, even by COA standards.

Just finished playing Amateurs to Arms!, simply wow! I think I enjoyed it more than I did the first time I played Paths of Glory, and that is saying something! 

This game compared to PoG gave me a lot more freedom, there was a lot options both strategic and tactical every turn. Forward planning is absolutely necessary to win and play well. The use of hidden unit composition really adds a ton of bluffing and tension and risk taking. 

Learnt quite a bit about the conflict of 1812, the geography, the events that occur and their influence at various levels, the tactical situation around the great lakes and strategic war at sea and the land war seesaw that started with American aggression and later countered by the British after the defeat of Napoleon. It was all there in a package that is a lot more tidy than PoG. 

Totally enjoyed my experience and regret having had this on the shelf as long as I have and not play it.

I want to like this game; no, I want to love it! It’s chock-full of history! One hundred fifty cards! And Jerry Stiles’ brochure describing them is both educational and entertaining. The map and the other components’ design are colorful and the whole package is attractive. The whole scope of the war is here; and one can choose to not raid the Chesapeake and go after Charleston if he wishes. I like the flexible impact of the Napoleonic Wars, too, and the arms race on the Lakes.
     Now here’s why I don’t like it. As always, I’m not saying why a game is good or bad—I’m not an expert—but why I (me, myself) do not like it, an emotional response, but that’s what governs why I buy and play ‘em, as well as many another of life’s decisions.
     Mainly, it’s the rules and systems. Putting it simply, I and my opponents have to stop too dam’ often to figure something out. At one (long) point, I collected nearly every rules question and answer on ConsimWorld and generated a seventeen-page document as a result. To their credit, the designers answer them and fairly quickly. I think, or at least I would have preferred, the rules should have been written in the style of SPI’s case format, with possible glitches and weak areas accounted for in the rules. Sure, it’s some dry reading, but I think it’s better than as is. 
     There are some aspects of the game that I don’t like. The rank system and how it affects expeditions generated numerous questions and could’ve benefitted in the above case system. Combat with forts, asterisks, and their interplay gives me pause; I think a simple die-roll (ten-sided) with plusses and minuses for terrain, forts, leadership, and unit types would do better. The map, suitable for framing, doesn’t adhere to “form follows function;” I had problems figuring out wildernesses and the courses of several rivers, and the tribal and future state boundaries confused me. Sea movement was also confusing. Answers I eventually got, but, with over 150 games (by no means a remarkable number, but enough) in my possession, there’s just too much stuff to have to relearn every few times I get to play. I’d rather roll for leader deaths after a battle (perhaps giving the dynamic leaders like Scott and Brock a modifier) than play “assassination” cards on them. 
     I guess I’m saying that, despite all the neat stuff, playing this becomes just too frustrating, and so this was shed.

After a game where Napoleon was defeated in 1813 (i.e. Wellington crushes the US coast, starting N/D '13), the game has gone to the sell (update:sold) pile.

The Napoleon track and invasion force mechanic outweighs anything of value you do on the lakes or in Canada.

An almost-equal problem is that I can't imagine a reasonable set of circumstances that has any other outcome than minor victory/inconclusive draw, the exact detail determined by when Napoleon falls (late = US marginal, early = British marginal, in-between = inconclusive draw).

Great looking game, though.  Quite fun until Napoleon is defeated and the game falls apart.  Maybe, if that is fixed some day...

If I ever play again, I think we will try the following house rules.  Reading some of the history of the War of 1812, there are some great aspects to be gamed, maybe these would allow them to take place.

1)  Remove the Napoleon cards.  Roll for the defeat of Napoleon at the end of the turn; D/F 1813 7-9, M/A 1814 5-9, or automatically in M/J 1814.  Upon Napoleon's defeat, Britain receives the +2 cards in all following turns as normal, but the reinforcements do not arrive for another turn (e.g. defeat in M/A '14, +2 cards staring M/J '14, NAP1 reinforcements in J/A '14, NAP2 reinforcements S/N '14).

2)  Napoleon escapes 4 turns after he is defeated (e.g. defeat in M/A '14 and escape at the end of the D/F '14 turn).    This has the same effects as the card (peace track, loss of extra cards).  Napoleon is then defeated at Waterloo 2 turns later (e.g.  M/J '15); +2 card bonus returns.

3)  Taking Wellington causes a British peace track advance (Wellington wants to retire, so things must really be dire).

4)  Moving the Invasion Force requires 2OPS as normal, but invading with it takes 3OPS.

If the above doesn't stop the blitzkreig, then we will need to reduce the Invasion Force fort subtraction from -2 to -1.  If that still doesn't work, we will start forcing some of the reinforcements to start in Quebec (no all-or-nothing gambit).

RATING: 9
Excellent: 1812 - strategic - easy/medium

Plus:
-Stunning components: resembles the era it reflects perfectly
-Easy to gasp rules, fairly accessible
-150 cards deck ensure a high number of events
-Easy play; thank God this is not another Triumph of Chaos
-Includes all of America: it is strategic and you really see the big picture.
-Very evocative; can't think of a game that comes close

Minus:
-The only backdraw is the very steep price. Gameplay is accessible and it is clear why this game costs more than the average CDG. However, it is worth every penny, both components wise as well as gameplay.
-Gamespace: for me an absolute non-issue but it is worth mentioning that is a one mapper but you require extra space for the naval cards as well as the army cards. If you place the on a chair next to you, issue solved.

It took a while for me to acquire this game but thankfully I did acquire!

What drew my interst:
-Theme
-Looks
-Accessibility
-Fact that it is from CoA (anything from this publisher is made with greatest of care and attention to detail)

Despite the above I was hessitant because:
-I am not particularly fond of CDG's;
-I was afraid the main theatre of operations arond the Great Lakes would be neglected since it covered aal of the Eastern USA;
-Steep price; 'buy 2 other games or this one' is a tough choice.

A recent thread if AtA would still be interesting after you played MMW ignited my desire to write a quick review. 

Bottom line: I was really interested in the theme and the strategic approach but the price, my reservations pertaining CDG's and the worry of neclecting the main theatre of operations hampered my decision to actually acquire a copy.

My interest grew stronger as more information appeared on BGG and my interest and curiosity proved stronger than my reservations. Thankfully so.

I was pleased to find out this game is very accessible, thanks to the Extended example of Play. 

Fellow Geek Bentlarsen broke the ice for me with his review and I decided to acquire a copy.

It plays quickly, if you get the hang of it, turns play fast. An average games takes about 4 - 6 hours.

I love to see the American War of Independance this way!

The best way to decide if AtA would be interesting enough to pay that price would be a hand on experience with the game at a con or some wargamer in the area who has the game.

Now that I have played the game a couple of times I am glad I bought the game as it is a fantastic experience and a continuos roler coaster. 
Things I like best:
1) You really see the big picture
2) Small forces stand a realistic chance against larger forces; a 5-1 ist not an aitomatic walkover due to the combnation of CRT, leaders and modifiers. Brilliant!
3) Hiddn information: you see where the enemy is but you don't exactly how strong he is
4) The naval component is superb; fun, realistic, historic.
5) The grahpics of the game enhance the era beautifully.
6) 150 cards is FUN

Bottom line, AtA would be great to play for all of the above reasons. Very impressive game.

RATING: 7.9
Summer 2012: Three months after arrived, finally playing the game. Many sessions with my mates J Alsen and Nels T...one complete game (it went 13 turns).

Really like the design. Very smart and different. Lots of play value and good story elements. Will take awhile to determine which strategies work best for both sides (this is good). Amazing the amount of play punch packed into only 13 pages of rules.

Rules could have been tighter...and, there are some rough edges (peace track, saving cards, etc). And, not sure that everything works (the NAP track has a huge impact on the game and is totally random). Errata and designer QUICK! response (but, need a little more clarity) on consimworld board is addressing well. Just remember, this one is an "experience" game (vs a "tourney game" like Hannibal).

Components? Outstanding. Clash of Arms beautiful as usual. I mean really blanking beautiful.

Cards? If I've got a significant beef with the game, it is in this area: toooo much variability that exerts tooooo much impact on the game (ex: peace track moves and NAP) and too many important sub games (ex: Indian Nations) left to the cards for my taste. However, we still had fun.

Of course, us tinkers have some suggestions (Jackson restricted to only indian areas or bordering, combat - only can cause max losses equal to your strength points...maybe an odds modifier for die rolls, restrictions on the # of cards a player can save - in fact we will play with a max of one card saved next game, an overrun rule...5:1 is standard in this period, restrictions on CAV/ART use (like not with the Coastal Raiding Exp) and probably something on NAP.  

Will be playing again soon and would recommend it if you like experience games. It is not that strategies can't be worked, but, you're in for a ride determined by the whims of the card gods - and the variability is HUGE. Consequently, your success will be determined how you maximize those hands vs. say a Paths of Glory (working a plan and using whatever cards you get to make that plan happen) and whatever the system randomly dishes out.

Rating is after eight plays.

Looking forward to exploring this one, it's a war I was interested in learning more about and I like that it covers the whole war. 

There might be some unwieldy elements here, like the 150 card deck and the timing of Napoleon (random and big variance) and it has a fairly heavy impact on play giving one side quite a boost depending, my idea if its one-sided in these cases is to script his entry somewhat (not entirely) like in the middle 1/3 or 1/2 of the deck (the theme, I know....) I'm thinking this might make a nice middle ground where he is still unpredictable yet more balanced, but I'm getting ahead of myself here

Edit - Damn the map is a beauty indeed but on non-gloss matte paper, yikes! I fear for its longevity even under plexi...(and expected paper in line with the player aids [maybe map done this way for esthetics?]) Seems like permanently fitted under plexi best to stop wear on the folds/surface which is PITA

Another play and I still like it more but the variability in the card draws is crazy. 150 cards is too much.  Some games basically never have Coastal Raids or Indians or Napoleon being defeated.  It's never the same but it's too easy to hoard and/or never play important events for your opponent or a crucial card may be buried in the deck.  I have noticed the "best" CDGs have 60-70 cards, not 150 for this very reason.  It's fun and I still like it but it's an issue of concern.  In the end, this is an experience game rather than a tourney-style game and that's okay if you're aware of it.  Oh yeah, the Invasion Force helmed by Wellington or Ross is an absolute beast, especially with 20 Regulars dedicated to it.
---------
I am impressed with the production quality of the game and more importantly, most 1812 games don't allow you to deal outside of Canada but I think it presents the British alot more options of where to interact in a historical manner.  The American player can raise large armies and march on Canada while the British player has scarce resources but the ability to raid the Atlantic coastline.  I like the scale even if there are turns where you don't know what to do.  The Peace Track is brillant but I am unsure of the saving cards mechanic which allows massive unilateral turns.  It's probably not replacing Hannibal or Twilight Struggle as the best CDG, but it's probably the best 1812 CDG and that's something.

I swallowed hard when I pre-ordered this expensive game, but I do not regret the decision.  The map is extraordinarily beautiful and the production value for the game is off the charts.  Looking forward to my first play.

After two plays, I can confidently say that this is a very fun game.  The huge card deck provides endless variability and replayability, and the card effects themselves promote compelling game narratives. This is a real gem in the CDG genre.

First two players game today and I must say that I already love this game. The game system is great and it's the most beautiful game I ever seen until now.

My only complaint is that the map is not mounted. I'm not sure it will be very durable. It's sad for so beautiful components.

About another half-dozen plays in, and I would rate this game an "11" if I could.  History, tension, strategy, unanticipated swings, huge variety in plays and strategies, and top-notch components.  If you have any interest in the period, you should own the game.  If you like CDGs you should own this game.  If you don't really like CDGs but want exposure to the very best of the genre, you should at least try to play this game.

Very unscripted and great challenges. Wonderful period feel. This game shows what a labour of love it must have been. The huge card deck is incredible. Finished my first game and have two more on the go.  Early to say but I think this is one of the best CDGs ever.

EDIT: Comments after a second play. A beautiful looking game, easy to start playing. The Peace track movements are what matter in the game, and many cards are enabling that, so luck will play a determinant factor in this game, aside from dice rolling. The Americans seems to me to have an advantage with structurally more cards to play, so have a clear initiative in land combat, and should explore that. With higher chances of the opponent to have ambush cards and reaction cards, and with more difficulty in reinforcing will be risky for the British to do land campaigns. Without some really good cards then the British need to dig in and wait for opportunities, and hope War in Europe moves fast (Napoleon Track). One of the few unique things British they can do are coastal raids, but due to the way the CRT is built units without leaders are capable of inflicting severe damage. Leaderless units will roll on the same column as expeditions with leaders TR1, which hard to understand (the CRT looks in itself a bit random). The British then need to add more regulars but that is not really something he can do structurally.

Fog of War is really nicely built with concealed expeditions but be aware there are some cards that allow tho see the forces behind expeditions. The cards are beautiful, and plenty IMO most of the time OP's are the key to execute a plan, plus a few activities require a full card play (moving expedition, building/upgrading forts) so despite abundance, specific events become less relevant.

All in all, a nice an interesting game to play, surely a very beautiful one but that to me comes a bit to mechanic, and dry because Victory Conditions are linked to Peace Tracks movements, which can be advanced by cards, lake movements, and less by land movements. In may case leading to a bit of a dry game. Need to play it again and explore further.

The map is beautiful but can be difficult to read.

I was a playtester for this game.  This has become my favorite mid-level complexity card-driven wargame.  The game writes a fascinating narrative with few cards that force the historical outcomes on the players.  The wide sweep of the war throughout North America is here with all the major participants.  Beautiful components add to the atmosphere.

Beautiful game components, I was quite relieved the game played great as well!  

A lot less complicated rule-wise than it may appear at first.  In fact, I wish the rule book was a little more fleshed out than it was.  That being said, there were few reasons to be constantly referring to the rules, whereas I wore out the Index page of 'For the People'...

Overall a well though-out design that is just flat out fun to play.

An excellent package - great subject, asymmetrical play and simply stunning components.  After two plays, however, I am not sure that the final result will ever be anything other than an inconclusive draw or a marginal victory for either side.  Only more play will tell.

My call for a perfect War of 1812 war-game covering all theaters of the North American conflict has been answered, appropriately enough during the Bicentennial of the conflict.  Previously published "1812" games usually cover just the Northern part of the war with Canada; this game gets involved with the Eastern seaboard, Indians and New Orleans.  Components are exquisite from cards, map to unit counters.  Game play is pleasant, fast and fun!  Let us play?

COA's game on the War of 1812 covering all the land and naval campaigns from Quebec to New Orleans rather than just the St Lawrence River. Stylist map, cards and counters adn an easy, workable sytem make this a pleasure to play. There has been much ado about the Hickory Hammer, where the US player pays for generals until Jackson arrives and saves cards until winter before overwhelming the British. I have never seen this work myself, instead I use the Imperial Death Star, where the British use their early naval superiority to bounce around the lakes and defeat the Americans piecemeal.

What I like: The logistical challenges of moving your units, and the units themselves are differentiated not only by movement, attack, and defense stats. Leader tokens limit the size of your armies (or "expeditions") and can give you a significant advantage on the CRT. Indian troops and militia are cheap to build, but leave during winter turns. Certain units can travel only in certain parts of the board.

What I didn't like: This is a general comment on CDWs, and why I'm not a big fan of the system. It seems to me that CDWs create conflict by giving players a choice between contributing to the main theatre of war (in this case, the areas around Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), and other extraneous goals that give significant VPs. However, I find these extraneous goals boring and unsatisfying to pursue. A simple example is playing a card for VPs is a simple example. My opponent noticed that he gained a lot of VPs this way. Another example in this game is fighting "belligerent" Indians in the Southern US. This was frustrating for my opponent (because it stalled him from entering into the main theatre of war) and for me (because it was boring for me to watch these battles; I wasn't involve at all).

I believe the designers of this game wanted players to be able to reenact all events during the War of 1812, like the battle in New Orleans. But from the little I know of this war, these battles weren't as significant to those along Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. I prefer a tighter game in which opponents are focused on each other than on external events outside the main theatre of war.

State of the art game crafting, but mixed feelings about the game, which could have been simpler and more playable. This is a system you will have to learn and play a few times in order to feel like you're in control; it is not your standard CDG.

The games seems to share WW's love of special unit types, with naval stuff thrown in to make it more complicated. The naval combat system seems a bit off to me; a simple die roll or two might have sufficed.

Playing the first time, the field is wide open, even if time may prove that there are fewer good options than it seems. The complexity of "what to do now?" in this game is belied by a fairly short rulebook that has many little subsystems and exceptions and numbers to remember, only some of which are on the player aids. The game is an operational slow build.

Cool there are so many leaders, by the way. The map is beautiful but an effort to interpret and the all-important lake areas a bit small. I like the whole war being covered, but also take note of criticisms that the other theatres tend to involve less player interaction. 

The Wellington/Napoleon swings with possible big troop influxes seems extraneous to me, but might be fun for fantasy/alt-history gamers. 

Note on ratings:

I don't think every playtester has a vested interest in the game; ratings by some should not be frowned upon.

What a wonderful game! Love the real fog of war with the hidden expeditions. The naval/land integration makes good sense for the period. The players also experience similar frustrations to their historical counterparts, the British low amounts of forces, the Americans lousy leaders. The large deck means that every game will play out quite differently. I also love all the options one has ... tough choices need to be made with each card play ... a bit like PoG in the "so much to do but so little time". Highly recommended!

Outstanding game.  The period map is possibly the best wargame map I've seen beginning in the 1960's.  I wondered if it would play well.  Yes, it does, once you realize that the wilderness locations are point-to-point and the rest are area movement.  Look carefully at the Canadian/US border areas.  There always seem to be just one too many areas to cross to reach the desired target area.  Grrrr.  Makes for good gaming.

Control the one or more of the lakes and things get easier.  Have Napoleon lose Russia, Leipzig, and abdicate and things get worrisome for the US.  

This game shows how the respective sides must divide precious resources to launch invasions, fight uprisings in the Civilized Indian areas, raise armies, build lake fleets, impose blockades...

Great game.  I may re-rate after more plays.  Contrary to what some have said we found the hidden force levels of expeditions to work well and fit the war's history well.  There were many examples of forces surrendering to what they believed to be overwhelming odds then discovering that they in fact had greatly outnumbered the troops of the force they surrendered to.  General Hull surrendering Detroit was only the first example of many.

Card-driven wargame set during the conflict of 1812 between America and Britain. The driving mechanism is well-worn, whereby cards have dual purposes. Firstly their operations points can be used to move forces, engage in combat, build fortifications etc. Secondly, they each feature an event than can be used to further one's cause. There is a pleasing fog-of-war aspect to the gameplay whereby opponents can see where their enemy's expeditions are situated but not what units they consist of. The use of auxiliary troops for wilderness movement and combat, and the unpredictable nature of militia is integrated well into the game. On the downside, the map, despite being quite beautiful and historically accurate, is also impractical making movement and tracing lines of supply something of a chore. I also find that there is perhaps an over-abundance of operations points available to the player, especially considering the limited number of forces available (particularly for the British early in the game), and I prefer games of this nature to trigger events irrespective of which side plays them necessitating a much higher level of decision making and a more even balance to the gameplay.

After three plays (only one complete) I can see a lot of promise in this game. I love the scope and depth, but there are a couple of areas that I found troubling. The British have far fewer cards in the early turns. This can become exacerbated depending upon the US Secretary of War appointment and whether or not the British can effectively save cards (my saved cards were wiped before use on every occasion). I believe the game is balanced, but from a design perspective, it is very dull to play a game wherein the two players don't have anything approaching equal play time. My previous game, the US had nearly 2:1 card plays over the British for three hours.

Updated after another year in, and another dozen or so plays... yep, still Magnificent. 

----------------------

Updated 27-July-13, after 4 plays: Magnificent. 

----------------------

Rating after 2.5 plays, and currently working up for another solo run and a verrrry slow PBEM match. This is one of the most wide-open strategic-level wargames I've played.  Both sides have multiple routes to victory, and the game works just as well with/without the hidden force compositions and limited intelligence.

It's hard to imagine a game capturing as much of the quixotic 1812 war as this one, and so elegantly.  

The components are remarkable... the use of the historic map as background is very well-integrated here (as opposed to Halls of Montezuma, which could have been so much more...), although the meshing of area movement with point-to-point does take getting used to.

If there's a concern, it's the arena for AtA. The large deck, the large (and often) random swings, and the hidden forces appear to make AtA an unlikely candidate for tournament play... and without an active ladder/tourney, the CDGs usually fall into a niche group with very limited options for opponents. Hopefully not here, as this is the best of the CDGs.

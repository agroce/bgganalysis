Nifty little offbeat game, quite fun and different.  Not really a brain-burner for us, though you COULD think a ton about what will happen with some moves.  Good bit of luck in the draw, but not too bad.

Atmospheric and charmingly themed, w/intricate gameplay. Gameplay is perhaps less intuitive than many of the other Kosmos 2-player games, but no more strange than, say, Mancala.

Someone else said that this was mancala on steroids, and I have to agree---a surprisingly fun game that requires thought.  It is fairly chaotic, with the spirits dancing from tree to tree, but not overly so---they didn't dance as much as I expected them to, and as in traditional mancala, you have pretty explicit control on your turn what they do.  Currently I tend to have pyrric victories (converting the opposing tree while at the same time exhausting my own tree), but I imagine I'll learn how to move my druids at the right time.

2p, Mancala-like, brain-burner, lots of card luck.

BGGer fizzle says: The game itself is almost entirely tactical. There is little to no look-ahead, and players are forced to make do with whatever hand of cards they get. With that in mind, it is an interesting puzzle, trying to get the dryads to move where you want them to be.

RATING: 8
Unique and lovely little two-player game. Definitely underrated - most likely because learning it from the rulebook can be torturous. Don't let the English rules translation get you down. Once you work out the movement rules (look at the diagrams in the German rules!), gameplay becomes much more fun. Balance between luck and strategy is about the same as Babel - at best you can plan maybe a turn or two ahead, but that is highly dependent on the previous turn of your opponent. Surprisingly challenging. Husband currently calls this a "4" on BGG rating. Feels there's something here, but he hasn't found it yet. A lot of luck that can't always be mitigated. Will probably convince himself to try it again so that he can "get it."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Provisional rating, probably should rate it higher - but this game blows my mind, I think I understand how to play, but I never do well, and I keep forgetting that the trees determine the movement distance rather than the card value. End result I lose horribly, the experience is a mix of fun/frustration. I hope the more I play the less I'll feel frustrated.

Ugh, not my kind of game. Even though I'm not very good at it, I love the spacial element--determining which cards will go where--and I find that aspect of the gameplay very fun. Where I lose all patience with this game is in the memory requirement: remembering which numbers are under other cards, both on your side and your opponent's. My inability to keep track of this information (and the huge advantage it to gives to players who can) ruins this game for me.

What a strange game, totally unlike anything else out there.  Lots of people compare it to Mancala, not because it is similar to Mancala, but because they are desperate to compare it to something familiar.  Because it is so unusual, it's hard to wrap your head around at first.  (Traded away.)

RATING: 2
Unplannable, chaotic, and random. I also have a problem with the game itself: why would you ever want to intentionally weaken a position with strong tree spirits? Because retreating a spirit and making them 'dance' are separate actions, you'll be giving the opponent the first opportunity to take advantage of your now weaker position... to your own detriment if he can manage. It's like sacrificing material in Chess and then discovering that the sacrifice was actually not in your best interests as you'll have gained nothing in return. Or, perhaps more aptly, splitting up your group of marbles in Abalone to get something done... and then losing bigtime as the smaller groups are defenseless against the larger group. The only thing stopping such a stalemate is being unable to form it in the first place, which is luck of the draw entirely. With an RPS mechanism the strict increase in spirit strength would have been broken, and all spirits would have been equally vulnerable.

Games where the only winning move is not to play are broken by definition, but I'm still hoping against better judgment that I'm making an error of some sort. Therefore 1 bonus point to the inevitable ‘1’ of ‘broken’.

RATING: 4
Components: Cute fairy art, and sturdy tiles, druids, and ring. The colors aren't as vivid as they could be, given the sun and moon theme. The clock-wise/counter clock-wise symbols could be more obvious.

Experience: This game isn't as bizarre as people make it out to be. After a few rounds the possible moves become more intuitive, especially since a player has at most three cards from which to make a play selection. There are a few interesting decisions to be made, and I can see where better foresight would lead to a stronger position.

This seems like more of a puzzle than a game. Before you make a move, you'll stare at the setup and start working out where things will end up if you play this card or that card. I really like the dancing/fighting processes, even if the theme is kind of weird.

One of the better two player Kosmos games.  Players participate in "fairy battles" for control of the tree cards.  It is essentially a mancala variant, but it works well and does exercise the grey matter.  Let down by some poor German rules and some gaps in the English translation (I have a more complete translation up here somewhere!).

RATING: 7
I love the art style and theme, this is the best feature of the game.  At first it takes some time to get your head around how the game mechanics work, but once this is done, it plays fairly easily, aside from some brain burning pauses for analysis.  Once you learn the game, the unique mechanics become a positive aspect of the game.  There may be too much luck involved in determining the winner though, I need more plays to see if this rating will hold.

Argh, what a terrible buy.  I fell for the buzz words  "out of print" and "German".  The game follows two Druids that represent cults worshipping the sun or the moon.  You've got some trees and using card combat you dance around and try to corrupt your opponents trees.  Alright, reading what I just wrote, it sounds damn cool.  

Instead, I felt confused and unsure of exactly why the game played the way it did.  I wanted to like the artwork and get behind the whole being Druids theme.  It just never engaged us and therefore will be departing from our collection soon.

People had said that this is a strange game and I'm inclined to agree.  Normally strange is a good thing for me but in this case I'm not so sure.  I love the mechanisms and I think the theme/art is fantastic however I dislike the luck in what druids you can influence based on what cards you have drawn at setup or throughout the game and the random druid card values underneath your initial druid cards.  There is also a fairly large memory element involved which doesn't sit well with me.

Played once; I want to like this game.  I love the idea of the theme of the game, and the art is good.  I'll play it a few more times to see if my opinion of the game improves, but our game stalled out as I felt any move I did would only weaken my position -- thus I spent many turns just discarding cards and not really playing the game.  I'll admit that I still don't have my head wrapped around the game, and had to constantly check the rules to see if we were playing correctly.

RATING: 6
Strange Kosmos game. Hard to understand, but the basic mechanics are easy enough once the rules are comprehended. I'll have to try this a few more times before passing judgment, but I am intrigued to see more. 

A few more plays showed me that this game is different, in a good way. It's a Mancala variant at its core, but the game as a whole is a different experience when compared to Mancala.

[1 play] This is said to be like Mancala, which I have never played, so I found the mechanism novel and intriguing.

This is a wierd game to be sure.  The whole theme from beginning to end is odd.  It is difficult to get your mind around all of the implications of the Druids' Dance so you generally just play what seems good and see what happens.  For all that, I enjoy the game.  Perhaps because it is so unusual and almost otherworldly.

Disappointing. I understood the mechanism, but was left feeling I had little control. It seemed too luck heavy. If your opponent has high numbers on their side and you are holding low cards, playing them scores for the opponent. You're only option is to discard, or switch your druid around, which you cannot do when a tree has gone. Nice bits, nice theme, poor game.

I tried this a couple of times to be sure I gave it a fair shake, but it just didn't captivate me.

The moving cards seems like a novel idea, but in actuality, luck of the draw often leaves you with few or no useful options. Possibly holding a larger hand would help mitigate this.

Losing trees through exhausting their 'spirit' stacks is also a pretty random experience.  

In the end, it requires a great deal of concentration to keep from accidentally screwing yourself.

Just seems like too much effort for too little payoff IMO.

Odd, odd, odd, odd, odd, whoa this one is odd.  It's interesting, but mostly as . . . an oddity.  I'm not sure there's much scope for strategy, but that might just be me not seeing the depth because the game is so counter-intuitive.  Playing is a bizarre experience because the game invites you to be very analytical, but it's tough to figure out what you're trying to accomplish and how to get there.

Appears to be launched from the pits of Mancala, but with Faerie/Druidic artwork from N. Europe.

This game takes counter-intuitive to new levels: play a spirit card under a tree, ignore the number on the card for the moment, look at the #symbols on the tree for #spaces moved, check the top of the card for direction and the Card Numbers moved. After moving all spirpt cards with matching number, compare trees with similar druids (but not where spirit played initially) and place a clan token on the tree with lower spirit, then discard the HIGHER# spirit.

This is a "think-y" game, and not an everyday choice, but the artwork is fantastic and the game play can be fast moving (if AP is avoided).

First rating on (2) games is 6.25, with room to go up or down.

Interesting game. Took me a while to wrap my head around it (and I should read the rules again to see whether we did everything right - we encountered a situation I didn't find information about and I saw one paragraph which didn't seem to make sense). It is a clever design with somewhat pretty components that speeds up after a number of turns when you begin to know what you are doing. The one thing I didn't really experience was fun, it was more like an intellectual battle. It isn't terribly likely that my wife and I will pick this again as our two player game of choice...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A limited strategy game which is so due to how many and what cards you get in your hand and also it is somewhat chaotic even as a 2 player game as the ramifications of the opponent playing a single card could never be anticipated meaning you can't plan too much either as you don't even know what cards they have and one play changes the whole board! 

There is some planning you can do but the luck of the draw is too strong here and can even break a game. We had a situation arise where someone had all 4's and 5's and you can't really change their cards unless you get a 5 or two and even then it will be a slow process to undo this, my rating could be higher I'm sure but it reflects what happened which ruined the game for us. 

Rules were bad and contradictory to themselves so download the FAQ which is better and helps. We played this twice and made sure we had the rules right and we did, which didn't help unfortunately. I think it needs slight rule changes to work but I can't be bothered to do it as there are far better games in this category. 

In the end too much luck, very analytical in a 'Mancala kind of way' and too much so really for what it is and what you get back.

A whimsical looking Kosmos 2-player game of Druids dancing then battling for tree control.  The 'playing' of a spirit card is most common, however, knowing just when to 'move' a Druid or 'discard' a spirit card is where the game is determined.  Somewhat confusing at first.

An ok entry in the Kosmos 2-player line but probably too strange to get regular play with my girlfriend. Good graphics though which might help it a bit. At least they got us interested in first place despite the mediocre ratings.
Note: A tree has to be without a spirit card at the beginning AND the end of a turn to become subverted.

Druidenwalzer is is sort of an area majoritygame. except that instead areas druids are compared on their strength and the area that they are standing on gets a token if they can't beat the other druid.
It is a pretty clever card game and a nice addition to the fantastic  2 player kosmos line

Nice surprise.  I had wanted this game for a long time because of the pretty pictures and theme (I like fairies and trees, who doesn't?), and we finally got it in a trade.  

Now I know it has pretty pictures and is also a great game.  Different sort of game and very cool.  A little stressful, especially towards the end, but not too terrible.  People say this is a brainburner, but I don't think it's too bad.  It's pretty easy to see everything that will happen in a round, unless there are just a ton of the same number, than you pretty much don't make that move.  There is luck and annoyance in the card draw and in what numbers happen to come up in your pile of cards in front of your trees.  Very cool, different game actually.  Highly recommend if you can get it.

A remarkably simple game to understand--not sure what the fuss is about.  It's Mancala on steroids, and it's a great game.  Loses a mark for caring that previous top cards get flipped, which is something we skip to speed up play.

Elegant design and beautiful artwork.  I love the concept of tree spirits dancing.  This two-player game is fairly tough to get your head around but once you get into it, it's increasingly easier to see all of the options available to you.  So many cards can move each turn (and in different directions) one is often uncertain whether or not you're making the smartest play.  There are some tough decisions to make as you're often stuck with choices that will hurt yourself.  It may take a few games before you even realize all of the strategies available.

Theme is based on druids trying to subvert trees. Each tree has numbered druids on it. Each turn, play a druid card - if the number matches other druid cards, all druid cards "dance" that number of trees around the board (direction is set by the particular tree). Then, if allowed (color druids have to match), a fight over a tree takes place with the higher number winning. Lose 2 trees and you lose. Theme is different, as a game, there probably is a different way of presenting warfare, and the part where all like numbered druids dance and play musical chairs, well that is funny once, but could be almost interpreted as random. Not a bad game, played twice but I think my friend was disappointed in it so he sold it. I need a couple more playings to form a real opinion to see how much strategy there is, but game is no longer within gaming group.

Certainly a game that is prone to severe over-analyzation, but played quickly and intuitively, can be enjoyable.

RATING: 3.5
I wasn't able to play a full game. I didn't really enjoy the constant computing that needed to be done to pull off any kind of strategy. ie)Okay, if I play this level 4 fairy with clockwise movement, this and this card will move to here and here. This druid and this druid will lose and this druid will win. Hrm. So I need to first move a druid to play this card. If I play this level 2 fairy with counter-clockwise movement, this and this and this card will move to here and here and here. 2 of my druids will lose but then more low cards will be on my opponents side. Until my opponent plays of course. Hrm. Now if I play this level 5 fairy, etc, etc, etc. 

Agh! 

Lovely concept (two druid cults - the suns and the moons, strategically dancing fairies, and druid battles and subverting trees from the opposing cult to win the game), very beautiful illustrations and pieces. I may play again someday now that we know the rules. I don't know.

Played again, with the correct rules this time. You need to try and protect your trees from the opponent, but the protectors are what attacked. So any tree you are defending is a tree that can be attacked. Trying to get cards to shift off of your opponent's side or shifting higher cards onto yours are the basics of the strategy here. It's just a matter of covering yourself so that your trees are safe for the next turn as well.

RATING: 7
Reminding slightly of Mancala games but sharing surprisingly little with them, the two-player extravaganza Druidenwalzer involves moving three druids within four trees; each of these trees gives shade to a little pile of cards, the top card of which signals the strength of the druid currently on the tree. In each turn players can either move those druids or play out a card from their minimal hand to shift cards already on display, the direction being determined by the card just played and the range by the tree it's played on; afterwards, druids on all other trees duel.

The gameplay's a bit of an acquired taste - counterintuitive, less luck-ridden than it looks at first, ultimately rewarding. The artwork is simply lovely.

(2 plays)  A very pretty game with a neat theme.  Just complex enough to be interesting.  The problem for me is the number of steps required to do what you need to do, and the confusing value vs. symbols vs. arrows vs. direction dynamics.  I got it down alright eventually, but I certainly won't be initiating any new gamers with this one.  Maybe my rating would go up if I find someone that likes it enough to play it a lot and get good at it, but I don't see that happening right now.

The dance of the tree spirits is very interesting and fun. In comparison to other Kosmos two-player games, you have to think quite a lot to determine your best move. However, it is almost impossible to think too far beyond your own turn, preventing analysis paralysis and/or the use of a chess clock.

A clever game that takes some getting use to. Never before have I felt confusion over clockwise/counterclockwise but this game did it to me. Lots of ebb and flow but certainly dependent on luck to a greater degree than would warrant much AP time.

RATING: 6
A slightly above average 2 player Kosmos offering where players are druids trying to 'destroy' 2 of the opponents 4 trees.

The rules may seem strange and messy but are easy to grasp once players start playing! It's not really Mancala (steroid charged or otherwise).

The cardplay seems fairly limited but the trick to the game is to take some loses until you've set up your card base and also capitalising on your opponents mistakes (if any) to suddenly shift their strong cards away.

A little bit of analysis paralysis but still quick-ish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Druidenwalzer takes the mechanics of Mancala, and jazzes them up a bit. The theme is bizarre but fun - but figuring out the whole clockwise/counterclockwise movement and so on can be a headache. The game represent a pagan-ish forest ritual featuring dancing satyrs and so on. It's cute and has nice bits. This IS a fun game if you don't mind doing a fair bit of calculation, but I personally prefer the simplicity of Mancala.

This is a bit tough to wrap your head around at first.  The design feels arbitrary and there is a tremendous reliance on luck, but that said, this is a great game for those who like games that force them to play reflexively.  There is very little strategy to this without a deep memory, and due to the fact that you don't refil your very small hand until you're out of cards means that you really have to make due with what you are given.  But, there is much you can do, so this game feels strictly for tactical players. It may expose some sense of brilliance if I play it again, but chances are I won't be beating down any doors to crack open the box to find out.  Especially, as I have Phoenix to fulfill the same type of experience in a simpler, quicker and easier fashion.

A brain-burning exercise that is quite likely the most intense two-player kosmos game in the series. I put it ahead of Jambo/balloon cup in terms of complexity and is equally tough and baffling in terms of developing a strategy as The Pyramids of Jaguar. This game was never published in English and while the game is language independent, the translated rules on BGG are reasonably clear that we played the game but with a single error in interpreting the rules.

Overall, I like this game and will seek to play it again. However, it does engage a considerable amount of brain cells to come up with a cogent strategy. I like certain aspects of the game such as deciding the trade off between winning a one-off battle to place a sun/moon token vs. thinning the deck for each tree. Having few or no cards left on a tree is highly dangerous and can swing the tide of the battle even if the ratio of sun/moon tokens is skewed between opposing players. This makes the game unique since a "sudden death" scenario is a viable option to win the race to capture two trees. An excellent gem and one that deserves a higher rating on BGG and a wider release

Michael Rieneck; brain-burner; Kosmos two-player series; players try to protect their own trees and steal their opponents'. Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possible hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.

RATING: 7
Pretty interesting. It feels like a game where the strategy is subtle and I just haven't figured it out yet...but I worry it's actually a game that's mostly luck, but cleverly disguised as meaningful choice. I had similar concerns about Tongiaki before giving up on it, and that this only supports two, has a theme I don't care for and reminds me a lot of Mancala but plays slower and is harder to teach doesn't bode well for this rating surviving many more plays. The two I've had so far were with a gamer friend who'd also never played; he demolished me the first game, and I crushed him the second. Neither of us could point to anything specific that we did differently between the two games, which means either I subconsciously learned a lot from the first crushing defeat, or there's a very heavy amount of luck in the game. I'm not sure how many more plays this will get for me to determine which it was.

Played this only once. Maybe retry against someone who has played this a lot.

Extremely elegant design, and very original theme. Great game. And a real brain burner, too!

This is a fun little game and it takes a little bit before you get what's really gonna happen when you play a card but hey it's the figgurin' which is half the fun

Randomly random.  Ranks just above Babel in my list of most-hated 2-player Kosmos games.

Played once. This game is a bit confusing and definitely requires some thought. I suppose it becomes clearer after a few further plays, but I don't feel the urge to play it again.

One of the strangest games I own - but also very fun.

Fun and underrated game. It provides some clever mechanics, that allow both the analysis/paralysis as well as "whatever" gaming style. The theme is truly magical and works surprisingly very well with the mechanics (not like - let' say - Knizia's math modules coated with whatever theme may support selling ...) although i would change some terms in the rules to something more peaceful (conquer = convert/power check = influence check). The game plays fast - 25 minutes. After about 10 games played i am hungry for more.

nice two player game, though it involved a little too much deep thought for my girlfriend.  it has room for growth in the rating, based on another couple plays.  there is some strategy and planning, and nicely fit into the druid theme.

I like it. Rules hurt your head a bit to figure out, but once you do the mechanics are quite simple.

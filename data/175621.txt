Where to start...
I love CCGs, but have a low income, so I mostly play casual play with a family member who doesn't mind having a small collection,

But I hate MTG's dark theme, I will try some lighter themes I guess, like Unstable.

It's mostly the Dark Sorcery (I know that there's Sorcery in Epic, but it's toned down to it not being the driving force like MTG, plus I really don't like how all the cards in the past few years are really dark in color as well, even if they don't have any sorcery depicted.)

But also I don't like the collectible aspect, I liked Star Realms and that's why I first backed it, it's similar to SR only in that it's fast paced, swingy, and has really cool combos! (Which is what I like about other CCGs) all for $15! (Or go for 2-3 sets for multiple cards) I have 2 sets with promos and once I find more players will probably get 1-4 more (3 for a cube 3 for constructed, hopefully I can get gods and elder gods decks memorized for quick construction from Cube)

It's also really easy to teach to people familiar with MTG, so that although I'm not a very good teacher at games, I can easily explain it, and then get whooped!

thus far I have taught Epic to 6 different people at my LGS, and it's gone over well with all, I will recommend this game to any LCG player, and any former MTG players that have stopped because of financial issues, possibly not any MTG players that say that starter decks is the way to stay, personally though this has more drafting options, after all its like a MTG Cube for $15! 

Recommendation for teaching Epic(depending on skill level) give your opponent a mono faction (I always use green) and give yourself a random 30 card deck with the remainder, I have won some (with people that don't play card games often) and lost horribly with others (people who play Dice masters and Hearthstone a lot) It gives a nice balance (you get strategy of trying to get best possible combo, he gets a fun winning game)

If you think he can handle losing (or possibly win, if he's played other CCGs) then use your own method, but I really like teaching new players this way.

Great Game! Casual, fast paced MTG that is especially great for drafting when playing with 2-4 players. 
However! constructed, especially the 60 vs 60 format is pretty much broken because of one exceedingly overpowered blue card that more or less guarantees victory, especially when played 3 times. 
Fazit: 9 Stars for passing time with strategically competent friends who can't afford MTG. 
One star down, because it will not ever be played competitive unless they start banning cards #PsionicAssaultBroken #MonoBlue77%Winrate

Great distillation of wizard dueling card game. Compared to Magic it has no resource harvesting, has lots of strong cards, so that it provides a quick build up.

The game also provides some quick deckbuild through different drafting modes, so that mini-tournaments can be easily organized with a couple of packs.

It's not a CCG, but a self-contained game, with a superb value for cost ratio.

NB: need to try the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1783201/lightning-epic]Lightning Epic variant[/url]

RATING: 5.5
A random card game that fluctuate greatly if the rules of 30 card draw applies. 

Card art is above average and mechanics of the game is sound. The amount of special abilities provides both a good variety as well as a great confusion for the beginner. 

With lingering cards in hand, the option to resolve certain table control by the opponent could not be 'turned' and thus becomes a forlorn conclusion to that game. 

Overall, an average game that has interaction between players only if the deck powers are reasonably balanced distributed. Otherwise, it's a one sided affair. 

Suggest draft play.

RATING: 7
This is definitely the cream of the crop of every competitive card gaming experience. I've played professionals often in several of the very popular and some not-so-popular TCGs in the last decade and a half of my life. None of them even come close to stacking up to this NOT-TCG that offers a much better purchasing model and several game modes right in one box. With competent and competitive friends willing to play, Epic is one of the best experiences you can have while dueling. If you or your friends are sub-par at card games, Epic may feel "swingy" to you until you get used to its internal logic.

Update for 2016 state: Tyrants expansion added everything the base game needed. Uprising expansion is alright, though it has serious problems in constructed with a "Win the game" card, which also cheapens the experience. Like I predicted, that card warped the first Worlds tournament. Overall, I'd say a 10 if only including Tyrants, but not when you have to factor in Uprising. Maybe unplayable in constructed if they don't fix Chamberlain Kark soon.

Update after 2 years of play: Game has worn me down a lot. The company's stark reluctance to fix Kark (which has destroyed constructed, the only format I play) and the insane rule that punishes your life if you mulligan (read: punishes players for drawing a bad hand) leads to a game with archaic ideas. When you get very skilled, chance becomes one of the primary factors in who wins. WWG continues to release sets in the way people hate—split into 4 expensive packs. And they continue to release slowly. I really thought this game would hang around a 9-8 longer but I have to dump it to a 7. Still puts it miles ahead of any constructed card game, but doesn't advance the genre enough to make it more bearable. I played CCGs competitively for 16+ years and that genre has to stop with some of the idiotic ideas if it wants to keep up with 2017 game standards. Many games nowadays are allowing people to choose part of their opening hands when card-based, to reduce sack—just as a for-instance. Epic needs to grow with the times or continue to sink.

I really, really want to like this game, but it's just not that good. 

There are far too many keywords, and while they are all ripoffs of Magic keywords (ie Blitz is Haste, Breakthrough is Trample) it's impossible to remember them all, and with no reminder text it means having to constantly check the little rulebooklet. 

The rulebooklet is very poorly written and unclear.

Based on KS Backer Print&Play:

Incredible how much fun this is just dividing the cards into two piles and starting to play.

Looking at just a few cards, one might get the impression that cards are overpowered and games will be over in just a few turns.
Some games may go this way, but the amount of card draw and removal seems to enable games with lots of action going back and forth.

Favorite moment so far: I have the clear advantage on the board, when my opponent wipes the board, converting all my big guys into little wolves. But I have the event giving me 4 wolves and giving all wolves blitz.

Update: more variety, more cards, draft, sealed - it all just gets better with the full game. Can't give it more than a 10 though unfortunately.

Never played the original, but I love this iteration.  First, non-collectible. Big fan of that.  Second, it's great to play in multiple formats. I don't frequently draft, but it's nice to know I can.  Finally- it's a great, quick playing card game where every card you draw does at least SOMETHING useful.  I'm glad I backed the Kickstarter, and I'm glad they are coming out with expansions.

There isn't much strategy to this game. You play a card, your opponent plays a card. Both cards are good, but one is slightly better. Maybe you draw a card that gives you a slight edge. Maybe you don't.  The end. Not much fun.

Playable stinker. I really don't get the "lighter MTG" space in general, given that people who understand and at least used to enjoy MTG have to be the target demographic. You're not going to turn this into a great couples game or whatever. If I were going to play something like this, I'd rather just draft a bit of MTG, even though I'm over a decade removed from playing the game.

Artwork is excellent, and the game plays smoothly and quickly, but it might need a lot more before it can compete in the world of MtG, or even against other recent deck construction games like Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn. Think Magic but with less varied mana costs (1 or none), no interrupts and nice triggering abilities thrown in there (which reminded me a little of Legendary).

Nekem így elsőre gyengébb, mint a Star Realms, de gondolom kicsit bele kellene rázódni. És ez a nagy különbség, szerintem itt 4-5 parti kellene, hogy készségszinten tudjak minden akciót, a Star Realms esőre is kristálytiszta volt. 
Az egy nagyon nagy ötlet, hogy mindenki csak egyik irányban üthet, a győzelmi feltételek is kicsit aszimmetrikusak emiatt. Meglep, hogy nem nagyon vannak kiegek. A dobozba tehettek volna életjelzőt, de az se baj, hogy nincs, a minimál méret alapvetően szimpatikus. Játszom vele máskor is, de mondom elsőre nekem kicsit nehézkes volt.

Finally got enough to make a cube.  Main motivation for this was to play constructed format.  Much of the enjoyment I used to get out of playing MtG was spending countless hours constructing decks.  Sadly, I gave up collecting MtG as it was consuming too much from my wallet and life.  I still play MtG, only playing casually playing duel decks.

While the cube won't allow for infinite builds, it does do a good job of providing a limited construction experience.

It was a bit of a slog trying to figure out how to play it. I think the instructions suck a bit and really could do with some battle examples. I know they have a video and other aids, which is cool, but I wish they would just update the main manual and have that be a reasonably comprehesive guide.
Anyway, it felt worth the slog from the first play onwards. I have not played Magic, so I have no reference point there, but I have really enjoyed it.
Card art is nice. So many different cards in the base game. It's worth a try if you are prepared to take a little time learning how to play.

Love this game.  Have only played it with a random deck once, and have played a lot with single color decks with 2 and 3 players.  I'm sure I'd enjoy deck building, but until some friends buy their own deck there's no point, since we have to use my cards when we play.  Scratches that CCG itch well while taking away a lot of the clunky rules and exceptions to those rules, and does it at a fraction of the cost.

Players can download the suggested deck construction for Epic mash-up here - https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/124535/epic-mash-suggested-decklists.

Players can gain more than 30 life but players can play with house rule to indicate that maximum life is capped at 30 to prevent some players 'healing' to a level which will be difficult to be destroyed.

Rules to remember-
(1) The non-active player can only play (a) Event cards, (b) Champion's power, and (c) Ambush after the active player has played his events and champion power AND  before he declares any blocker.  There is no interrupt.
(2) The non-active player have the window to play events, power, and ambush at the end of declaring blocker step AND after the active player has performed all his actions (before damage is resolved).
(3) The non-active player has one last chance to take actions when the active declare he wants to end his turn.

In joint/multiple units attack, if the active player combines flying units and non-flying, the attacking group will be considered non-flying and therefore can be blocked by the opponent non-flying units.

It is always good to play Ambush before the active player ends his turn as the next turn, the Ambush unit will become ready and allows the opportunity for it to attack or use its ability that requires tapping/exhausting.

Other rules consideration.
a. Cards that affect multiple targets can still affect Champions with Untargetable trait.
b. Cards that deal direct damage to a non-specified target and also affect the players' health.
c. If a player deploys a Champion without Blitz, it cannot immediately attack or be expended to trigger its ability BUT it can still be used to defend as a blocker .

Question about 'Feint' and 'Ceasefire'
The effect of 'Ceasefire' to prevent opponent attacks only happens after the initial attack is made, meaning Ceasefire cannot cancel the first attack.

Beautifully illustrated cards. Awful Rulebook, jumbled and not entirely clear regarding order of play, flow of play, etc. I think that's because that's really how the game plays. I've played it a few times and watched the videos and that is still my opinion. I think it's a niche game that is tailored more toward the MTG gamer; the various things like blitz, ambush, breakthrough, airbore, etc. can be confusing, but I suspect that folks that typically play this sort of game (Magic) it's second nature. With that said, I actually like playing the game and want to get better at understanding how it all comes together. FYI Awful Box...moved everything to a deck box. It could have used counters or something too, there are cards like Thrasher demon that explicitly state to put two +1/+1 counters on it..but there are none! So it's just an imaginary thing you have to remember...sort of like damage. If you don't break the champion, then you have to remember what damage was dealt. Easy enough I suppose since it's in the same round, but still, a little annoying.

 Seems fine - kinda crazy, in a (generally) fun way. Does capture the flavor of Magic without a lot of the hassles - sort of a Magic methadone. I enjoyed it, but definitely not the same kind of hook as Star Realms, at least for non-Magic players. Because of the crazy randomness, It does need to play fast, and the raw number of different cards with text does make that hard. The learning curve to playing competently is not insignificant, again just due to the raw number of different cards.

Also, like Star Realms, this is really a 2-player game with some slightly less unsatisfactory multi-player rules hacked together. 

Anyway, this all sounds a bit negative, but I did enjoy my game of it. But I have a hard time seeing it getting a ton of play in the boardgamer space. It may do better with players who are primarily card gamers. A decent implementation of mobile would also help it get a lot more play, much like Ascension or Star Realms.

I do think the way that White Wizard is copying and repurposing other games is a bit skeevy though. Star Realms was an Ascension "homage" that went right up to the line of rip-off but maybe (probably) didn't cross it. Likewise, this is just copying Magic and trying and making it more accessible and playable. It's fine, but there is almost no original vision here. On the other hand, I'm just not going to play Magic, but I can enjoy this.

This is a redo of the 2009 TCG.  It fixes some of the stuff from the 2009 edition, but still leads up to its name.  Everything is EPIC!  Wrath of gods, 30/30 creatures, put in 20 tokens, all sorts of shenanigans.  The loser is decided by who doesn't have an immediate answer to the winner's EXTREME spell.  No real skill needed to play or build a deck.  When being taught the teacher from the company gave us a bunch of random cards that became a "deck."

Just a perfect piece of game. If you want to play something similar to MtG, but faster and not so "land dependend" this game is for you. Overall nice balance. There is recomendation to buy 3 pieces of game, because you can have 3 copies of card in your deck. With that setup, you can easily construct 2-3 good decks. Or you can buy one copie, unpack and imidiatly play. Rules are simple, but with enought good spots for tricky plays.

Epic seems like it could be quite fun if only we could figure out how to play it. We tried to get into it but the thing they call "Rule Book" left us with so many unanswered questions that after 3 rounds of a 3 player game (which took us more than 1.5 hours) we had to give up. I played close to 2000 different games in my life and I learned to play about 90% of them by reading the rules. So I am not at all unfamiliar with reading and understanding (and unfortunately often enough interpreting) rules and neither were the people I tried to play Epic with. I played Magic a while back and I love Star Realms. But I have no clue how to play Epic from reading that rule book. Maybe a 3 player game ist not a good point to start but as it claims to be for "2-4 Players", this should not matter. Maybe all three of us just had an exceptionally weird and complicated starting hand. We had no idea of when to play what and every single card made us feel like having to learn a vocabulary list first. It was a terrible experience. So at the moment this game is clearly broken to us since we are not able to play it. (This is for the White Wizard Games (2015) English edition.)

Un poco confusa la terminología, pues son efectos calcados de otro juego de cartas, sólo que con los nombres cambiados, y cuesta un pelín acordarse de qué hace cada cosa.

Basically all cards are super powerful and can be played almost at any point during the game.  Gaining synergy among your cards is futile since board clearing cards are numerous and cheap.  Way too random for my tastes.  Leads to a frustrating experience.  Rules do not do enough to clarify cards or situations either.

Interesting system, and very novel if you only play Magic. But it turns out that if you cost all the cards the same, they end up feeling the same, and the arc/development of a game state ends up being much flatter.

RATING: 8
first impression, this is a solid game. Basic gameplay resembles Magic the Gathering more than anything else. However, the resource/mana part is gone (which I like). Also, combat is changed quite a bit. And there's no responding to opponents' spells. So Epic, while resembling Magic, really is a different game. There are enough combos and interesting cards to warrant some nice gameplay out of a single deck (3 is better). Sooner or later, this game will need expansions.

Update: after some more plays, I really enjoy single pack as well. The reason I tried this kind of play more is because I don't approve of the expansion model (expansion packs are more expensive than base game by far. Compared to CCGs I guess they're still a steal, though. Compared to LCGs they're priced ok.)

Fun little pseudo-CCG, where players are dealt a mini deck of cards from a massive collection, and try to defeat their opponent by reducing them to zero points.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Para quien ha jugado a Magic: The Gathering, esto es lo mismo pero a lo bestia. En la mayoría de juegos de cartas, vas jugando cosas débiles al principio y (según avanza la partida) vas reuniendo más recursos con los que jugar tus bazas más potentes... aquí, puedes jugar tu carta más fuerte desde el primer turno de la partida (de hecho, casi todas las cartas son potentes en cierto sentido).

No nos engañemos, eso hace que sea más azaroso que otros juegos más calmados (como el ya mencionado Magic), pero sigue teniendo cierto grado de estrategia (sobre todo si cada jugador se construye su propio mazo en vez de jugar a draft), pues tienes que aprender como contrarrestar adecuadamente cada una de las jugadas de tu oponente: al ser todas las cartas (casi) igual de potentes, se convierte más bien en un juego de optimizar tus recursos, de intentar sacarles el máximo provecho al jugarlos en el momento y de la manera más oportuna.

Otra cosa a destacar es su excelente relación calidad precio: es uno de los pocos juegos de cartas en los que de verdad pueden jugar 4 jugadores con una única caja (que además es la más barata que he visto en un juego de estas características, apenas 13-15 €). Eso sí, si el juego casual (draft) no te basta y quieres poder hacerte tus propios mazos (que es cuando de verdad empieza a notarse el factor estratégico del juego), necesitarás 3 cajas (para tener tres copias de cada carta existente y así poder hacer cualquier combinación que desees).

Kickstarted expecting "Star Realms" with Fantasy theme. Ended up getting streamlined Magic the Gathering with mediocre art. Another big minus - at least in Star Realms the life cards are included in the game. In this game, one must keep track with pen / pencil and paper separately. Definitely a huge disappointment.

The artwork isn't bad, but the rest of the game is incredibly amateurish at best.  All cards having an unnecessarily printed cost of 0 or 1 creates extreme balancing issues and annoyingly swingy games.  I cannot possibly explain how much of a disaster the attack sequencing is and it gets exponentially worse with the more units you have in front of you.  Too many cards have triggered abilities.  I could probably go on and on.  Have you ever used a blender without a lid?  That's Epic.  Maybe that's why it's called Epic?  I'd still rather clean the mess from the blender.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not quite the drek that everybody made it out to be.   It takes Magic and reduces the resource management in a very clever, binary way.   Most of the cards are high strength, potent and powerful, so it provides balance in an interesting way.  This is necessary so that the game can move along quickly rather than a whittling down approach.  This is a game of big blows, not nicks and cuts.   Takes a little while to draft and set up, but that part is fun too.   Not sure how many plays are in the starter deck, but I'd be happy to play this more.

Tactical card game with beautiful art work.

This is meant to be MtG, without:
-Mana Flood / Drought / Resource Issues
-The boring early game

It's actually a fairly 'Take That' experience - I play my overpowered game-breaking card on turn 1, you remove it on turn 2.

So naturally, card advantage is absolutely key here.

Provided you house rule out the retarded initial rules, it's actually quite fun to play. Here's what we changed:
-Forget the you go - I go turn structure. 
-All events are played like 'Instants' from MtG
-The keyword 'Ambush' is interpreted as 'Play this like an Instant' on creatures

And that's it! After a couple of plays I've actually warmed up to this game.

Luck of the draw can really have an impact, though,

I'm a veteran [thing=463][/thing] player that has stopped chasing after the new sets because I nearly don't play as often anymore since I got into board games.

While this is certainly not a replacement for Magic, it does scratch a lot of the same itches for me. I think the best way to play this is either:

- 2-player Rochester draft
- 4-player standard draft with a mini tournament

I don't play constructed because if I want to play constructed, I'd rather play Magic. And I'm also not fond of the free-for-all multiplayer format.

However, playing 2-vs-2 could be quite intriguing, as well as the 3-vs-1 mode with the Elder Gods. Will have to try them out at some time.

Backed it on Kickstarter after I had discovered it via Star Realms, which is from the same makers. This game is not Star Realms though. If you like Star Realms, there's absolutely no guarantee that you like Epic as well. It has some similarities. Most notably, Epic is also a complete game in a small box for a low price that plays quickly. Furthermore, Epic has four alignments, similar to the four factions in Star Realms. Other than that, it's a completely different game.

Anyway, I really like Epic and prefer it over Star Realms, mainly because there's more skill and less luck involved. There are many choices to make when building your deck, when playing your cards, and when attacking and blocking. The rules in Epic are a bit more complex than those of Star Realms but clearly and concisely explained in the rule book. I found the rules easy to pick up and easy explain to other board gamers. Unlike Star Realms, Epic is not a deck building game, although when using the drafting format, it shares some similarities.

Rating still subject to change as I by far have not played as many games yet as I would like.

It's Magic the gathering with overpowered cards that costs 0 or 1 mana (in this game is coins). Because the cards costs nothing or all your mana (1 coin).  Most cards are removals and some are creatures with 14/14 Trample, Flash...     
If the cards did less things this game would be better.

Not bad as a 'magic end-game' game.

I'll have my fun with it and then it'll probably end up with those Magic boxes in the back of a cupboard somewhere.

Ha sido el primer intento de aparcar el Star Realms en la oficina como juego de cabecera después del almuerzo y ha tenido la mala suerte de que el hype y las ansias por el SR seguían por las nubes, de modo que cada vez que sacábamos el Epic, mirábamos de reojo el mazo de naves.

Maybe I'm just too set in my ways as an old Magic player, but Magic has a great rhythm to it involving an early-game, mid-game, and late-game stages.  In attempting to "cut to the chase" Epic provides a haywire, swingy, peripatetic experience where units are churned out and cut down with all of the grace & beauty of a chainsaw going through bologna.  I guess some people are happy with that, but I just sort of shook my head and moved on.

Mítoszos múlttal, és ascension/star realms rajongással nagy reményeket tápláltam a játék iránt. Ilyen bevezetővel mondanom se kell, hogy elég nagy csalódás volt.
A kártyák grafikája elmondhatatlanul szép és részletgazdag. Szerintem simán lehet 1-2 órát nézegetni a lapokat játék nélkül is. A játékmenet szerintem ellentmondásosan nehézkes. Nem értem, hogy mi értelme pont a mana költségen egyszerűsíteni, ha közben minden más annyira bonyolult és annyi kérdést vet fel, hogy ez az apró dolog már semmit se számítana. Ez a 0-1 árú felosztás se tetszett, illetve a másik körében ingyen akciózás se. Így irreálisan felértékelődnek a mások körében manáért kijátszható kártyák, tekintve, hogy gyakorlatilag ingyen vannak, és elég erősek is. Jók még persze az ingyenes cuccok is, de az 1-be kerülő sima szörnyekkel semmit se tudsz kezdeni, mert 3-ásval sorakoznak a kezedben. Persze mindezt egy négyfős játék alapján mondanom. Lehet, hogy ez volt csak a hiba, és tényleg csak ketten szabad ezt a játékot játszani. Négyen mindenesetre egyáltalán nincs egyensúlyozva, ami még nem lenne akkora baj, de a többi része olyan bonyodalmas, hogy nem hiszem, hogy leülnének mellé olyanok, akik tolerálják az ilyen szintű randomot.

A véletlenszerűen kiosztott paklik mondjuk valószínűleg két főnél is értelmetlen szerencseszerepet visznek a játékba. Azt viszont el tudom képzelni, hogy színre válogatott paklikkal, kettesben nem rossz. Bár akkor meg a loyalty lehet fura, hiszen minden körben el tudod sütni.

If you are expecting a MTG LCG, this isn't it.

It's a fast playing, simplified card game where both players are playing very strong cards. One miss step and the game can be over however with some good planning, each games tend to be very close.

I really enjoy the pacing in this game and the lack of resource management. Just play strong cards, time your cards/ability and go for the win!

RATING: 6
My kids would rate this much higher than I did, for a couple of reasons.  They really enjoy the over-the-top monsters and spells that can clear a board or end the game with one swing.  They are also MtG fans, and this game is very reminiscent of MtG.

To me, it was all about luck of the draw - who can get that big board-clearing spell and then strike before their opponent can redeploy defenders.

In one sense, it's very balanced.  Every card seems to have a very large effect.  So much so, in fact, that you can almost guarantee that the really cool Champion you played this round will either be matched by your opponent's next card - or destroyed by your opponent's next card.  

If you like slugfests, try Epic.

Wow Epic indeed! Damn I'm addicted! 

This looks like Magic: The Gathering on steroids, but in many respects these are two very different games and have different feelings. In my life right now Epic is the better game: it is self enclosed, and it is ferociously fast with big epic combos. 

The game starts with a bang, plays in a flash, and ends in a satisfying crunch. Recommended!

RATING: 8
A very ambitious game. I haven't played Magic: the Gathering in years but I have good memories of it, so the idea of a similar game that's contained in a single box is very appealing to me.
It took a bit to learn what keywords are equivalent to the ones in MtG and the turn structure (mainly when in the opponent's turn I can intervene). 
The economy system in the game is very interesting! Must play further.

RATING: 2
Another boring Fantasy duel card game with ridiculous randomness. The usefulness of cards vary wildly, but the only restriction is that you can play just one of the more powerful cards per turn (these constitute maybe half of the deck). And since you have no control on what you draw, this leads to a very unbalanced game with huge swings of luck. Also, the rules are annoyingly fiddly. The only good thing is the beautiful artwork.

After I figured out this game I really loved it. The rulebook was very poorly written. A few more examples would have helped. I was not that experienced with fairly sophisticated deckbuilding game and the  rulebook presupposed a fair amount of background experience in this sort a game. This is always a flawed assumption when teaching--to assume that  a certain level of skill and understanding has already been attained. I believe that this gam would be rated significantly higher but that the rulebook lost a number of people.That being said, I really like the artwork, the special powers available. The card chaining aspects were really good. This is a permanent keeper for me. The base game is a real price bargain but the expansions are somewhat pricey.

Yera. Adquirido en 2017

De los autores de (entre otros) Star Realms, llega este juego "solo cartas" de construccion de mazos 1vs1. 

Teoricamente es un juego simple que se aprende a jugar en 5 minutos, pero cuando lo fuimos a probar Yera y yo, nos pegamos mas de 15 y no nos quedó claro como cojones era la secuencia de juego. :p

Aparte de que el juego es solo cartas, sin tokens ni leches pero luego hay que llevar el conteo de los puntos de daño que se infligen a cada jugador. 

En fin. se supone que es un juego sencillo para partidas rapidas. cuando pueda jugar una partida completa lo podré valorar. 

pd. P&P compatible. de hecho la primera version que salió era para imprimirselo uno mismo, luego ya salio en version comercial.

Early plays are fun, fast, and (indeed) epic. That said, I'm not sure how much room there is for clever play in the standard format--your hands may play you. Draw irregularities that screw you over are different from those in Magic, but they are (possibly?) still there. Looking forward to exploring more.

Honestly I like this game more than I like to admit, as a drafting game.  Tactical card play makes this much more fun than magic.

Magic the Gathering in a box. For 15€ (!).
Really good MtG clone/successor/implementation. Four complete and balanced faction decks in such a small (and cheap) box. 
The art on the cards is stunning, the gameplay is tight and thematic, and wild and overpowered combos are on the table, almost every turn!
It does perfectly what it was meant to do: recreate the "Collectible Game Card" feeling, without its finance draining aspect (you might call it "addiction").
What I don't like? the three and four player mode.
What I like? Everything else!

The value proposition of a single box of Epic is ridiculous. You get so much game time out of those 120 cards.

Of all card games, this iteration of Epic best exemplifies easy to learn, hard to master. Out of a single box you can play a variety of formats, ranging from the high variance 'random 30' to the skill-intensive dark draft.

If you like games like MtG, (but not the mana screw or the $$$) and Hearthstone (but not the random effects or lack of interactivity), grab this.

I like this more than MTG because of the resource management is not based on luck of draw when playing the game. For those that complains that this game doesn't come with everything you need, I feel that is unfair to say about this game.  Although it is not a CCG, it is made for players who would love to play a CCG but don't want to or can't fork out the money for it. To get the same gameplay for Magic, you will have to spend a lot money and it still won't provide you with any tokens/counters you will need.  Additionally, a few dice that you have to provide to keep track of your health, damage, and defense is not horrible.  I agree that the rulebook is written for those with former CCG experience so if you do not have any the learning curve will be a lot steeper.

1-on-1 card game with mechanics that will be very familiar for MTG players. However, with a simple 1 gold/turn mechanics in lieu of mana, Epic is much faster and more action packed without any of the mana screw.

Yet another game that tries to fix Magic's resource system and fails. Your opponent gets a resource to use on every single one of your turns, and every color of cards has so many creatures with ambush, events, etc. That means that your turn, which should be your chance to let loose, make a little progress, and have some fun, is incredibly likely to result in foiled plans. Instead of players whacking away at one another's life totals while building up to an exciting finish or a sneaky kill that was a while in the making, the game feels like posturing posturing posturing posturing until one person can finally spend a turn or two finishing off the opponent with an opportunistic and/or lucky move. And the posturing is all _tactical_ posturing, since the effects can be so drastic. An entire board wipe (effectively resetting the game to the beginning, save life totals) will likely happen in very many games. So I don't feel like I'm making any progress as I go along.

Basically it feels like you're playing one big, swingy stalemate until somebody makes a tactical error or gets a lousy draw at the wrong time.

Definitely owes a lot to magic, to the point that a table translating the keywords will get you to almost full understanding of the rules (e.g. blitz=haste, breakthrough=trample, airborne=flying). But the game is at least for me more fun to play than magic. Rather than mana, all the cards cost either 0 or 1 and you can play a single 1 cost per turn but can play as many 0 cost as you'd like. It also seems like all of the cards are incredibly powerful, which is more fun than sitting through those first few 1/1 standoff turns in magic. And I like that as of now you get all of the cards in one go, though I'm sure that won't last.

Disappointing. I wouldn't necessarily compare it to Magic since this is trying to do something different in the CCG space. Besides, Magic is a special kind of misery.

A lot of sizzle and no substance. No middle game since there isn't much buildup or ability to plan anything. Lots of wham! bam! it's over. Most games were over by turn 3-4 because of elaborate rock/paper/scissors where one player could not respond and super high powered minions 1-2 shot your opponent. Speaking of which, some minions are just OP and are good in no matter what deck. For 1 gold cost, this is kind of an odd way to deal with Magic's mana issues.

The draft took longer than the game itself. It also didn't seem to do anything about the imbalance issues, even though you had the chance to draft combo cards. Games lasted a little longer than random draw mode. Still a disappointment.

I really wanted to like this game but if you are looking for a Magic alternative, just play Hearthstone.

Pretty fun. Very very similar to playing Magic: the Gathering at the top of the mana curve all the time. Every card is broken which is fun enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty fun pick up and play game. Since cards are either free to play or cost 1 gold (you only get 1 gold per turn) this means the power level of the cards goes from okay to completely broken. This kind of works because removal is just as broken, complete board wipes, etc...

An interesting mechanic is the banish mechanic and one of the win conditions. Unlike other card games of this type when you run out of cards in your deck you actually win. The reason this is hard to achieve is because the "banish" keyword doesn't remove cards from the game as you'd expect, instead it sends the card from your discard pile to the bottom of your deck. This is also a common form of removal so drawing through your entire deck to win is pretty tough.

Haven't tried the drafting and don't really plan on playing the constructed but it's enjoyable to just shuffle and deal out some cards and play. I don't care for the constructed aspect that would require extra copies of the game and I don't think the game is good enough to justify that when there's much better games out there for that. To me this is mostly just a reasonably quick 2 player game for when I don't want to play anything heavier or as a filler to have a bit of fun.

Wild, wild swings in this game. 120 individual cards, in sets of 30 over four factions. Mix and match. Total random set ups. Drafts. It was great fun to have some huge creatures pounding your opponent, then your opponent plays one card and bang your monster is gone. Easy setup and take down. If they keep bringing out additional monsters, look out, this game could get huge in deck size and popularity. This is magic the gathering playing rares only in singleton format.

Still learning this one, but I like it so far. I have never played Magic The Gathering, but many of my friends have been into it. They tell me this game is like Magic on steroids. One guy said "every turn of Epic plays like turn six of a Magic game." In Magic you need to build resources for a few turns to begin playing your most powerful cards. Epic plays with many of the same battle mechanics as Magic but there is no resource mechanic to speak of. Every turn you get one gold to spend and every card costs either zero or one gold to play (though the majority are one-cost). That's it. And each and every card is like the powerful cards that come out during the late game in Magic. There are few cards - if any - that you would just plain not want.

Better than that is you can play it right out of the box with up to four people. Constructed decks, random shuffle, pick a color, draft construction. All of that in one $15 box. My buddies and I all bought a simple $15 set and we can construct decks from the same available card pool to go head-to-head. The contest then becomes about card selection instead of who can spend more money on expensive chase cards. This appeals to me. The idea of spending more momey increasing my chances of winning is what always kept me away from Magic.

The artwork is superb, and the game is fun as hell. I highly reccommend this to anyone who ever loved any collectable card game, but wasn't in love with the financial demands of competitive play. I am hoping to find organized play in my area soon.

a game where every card is overpowered does not appeal to me at all. 

the biggest issue to me no pace to the game .. its like one random event after another.. first turn has 15/15 creatures on board attacking each other. This doesnt make the game fun. 

if you want to play a game with no resource buildup play ashes. both players always have 10 to work with and game has a sence of pace.

This is a decent Magic: The Gathering (MTG) alternative for people who don't want to be sucked into MTG, but want to scratch that itch.  It has all of the complexity of MTG, since most of the mechanics are directly taken from the game.  This game also eliminates the problems with mana (either too much or not enough) by instead using gold that you have one every turn. 

I like that the entire game is contained within the single box, and the format forces you to play with all of the cards.  There is no collectable card game element to this, which is great.  I really like the gold resource mechanism this game uses instead of mana. 

The downside is that you have to learn a new language to play what essentially MTG.  That makes teaching this game a painful exercise.  The other problem that I have run into is finding players; I can't figure out exactly who this game is for.  It's a bit too complicated for people who already have no interest in games like MTG.  It's impossible to get MTG players to play this when they could just play MTG instead.  And why would they play a MTG knock-off when they've invested so much into MTG?  So that leaves a very small target audience of former MTG players that were sick of sinking money into it, but maybe sort of miss playing MTG just a little bit.

I'm just going to go play Star Realms instead.

This really captures the Magic the Gathering feel without random boosters or frequent LCG expansions (at least so far). I haven't tried customizing a deck yet, but I'd be happy to play the game again, especially at this price.

    - Chainmail Bikinis
    - Dinosaurs
    - Temple Maidens

    - Nearly Every card would be a Mythic Rare in MTG 
    - Playing the 4 Demigod decks in multiplayer is the dope shiz.

Cons
    - Rulebook is not great, appears to have been rushed.
    - Kickstarter Promos are a must have.
    - Needs a "MTG Players Only" sticker on the box
    - Promo cards really needed to be all foil

I realy like this game far more tham MTG for many reasons. 

The game is fast, turns goes back and forth very quickly thanks to the "cost to play" system. Also the texts are simple, effects are simple, no absurd or brain powered combos and triggers.

Unique set of cards wit no copies!! Perfect, so you don't get attached to your creatures. (I use to play Warhammer Invasion and COC LCG in this way, with only one copy of the card in the deck).

Any one can play it very quickly and also can win, because the lucky draw factory.

Very good game in my opinion, created with passion for someone with a vast experience in MGT and respect to players.

Edit: Got the full game, and it is as good as expected. My wife, who is very casual compared to me, likes Epic a lot, in particular sealed (30 random cards to each player) because it evens the playing field. I backed for 3 sets to be able to cube, but presently 1 set is pre-constructed (mono-alignment), 1 set is demi-gods (which we haven't played yet) and 1 set is used for sealed. Every game has been fun, even though one player can dominate a particular game, the games are fast enough that it's not a drag to play from behind.

I have kinda a mixed feeling about this game. It's not as easy to explain as star realms, it might seem a bit random - though my friend kicked my ass all night long (he plays a lot of magic), we've played 10 games or more I think, so it is anything but and allows deckbuilding. I just think the decks are a tiny bit unbalanced and add to the feeling of randomness. Maybe it's because I got my but kicked all night long that I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. I'll make sure to try this game again though :p

Basically a 2 player game, but could be played up to 4P with more cards. After a video review:

It's very similar to magic the gathering, but there is no power rating, in fact, all casrds cost 1 or 0, so you could litterally play anycard right on your first turn allowing you to play powerful cards.

There are 4 factions, you can play with a faction deck, or you can draft cards. But I think card drafting would take way too much time. So better stick to pre-made factions.

Not sure I would be willing to buy, but as an app, probably yes.

UPDATE: I think the main issue with this game is card balance. There seems to be some cards that are too powerful and break the game. But it's hard to determine for a game where the goal is to be powerful.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm rather ambivalent about this one. Basically, one plays a bunch of overpowered cards trying to reduce your opponent to 0 life or force him/her to run out of cards first to win. Will remind a bit of magic although there are no lands in play.

I played the hell out of Magic in the early 90s and loved it. I still miss it, and every now and then fight temptation to get back into it. I grabbed this game on a whim after hearing that it was essentially "speed magic". 

That it is, and my hat's off to these folks who figured out how to distill Magic down to its essence and make it all make sense without adding a lot of the timing and wonkiness that Magic has inherited. Well done.

Unfortunately, it seems that unless you do something like drafting hands or deck construction, and unless you know the cards pretty well, it's a game of just random things happening until someone wins. Playing as-is out of the box you don't have much control over your fate. And the reason I'm not playing Magic or Netrunner or such is because I really don't want to learn a bunch of cards and do deck construction and such. I have other games that give a similar feel right out of the box, most notably Omen: A Reign of War. 

Nevertheless, I can't deny that there is some attraction here, and if I can find someone willing to go for multiple plays, it might be worth keeping around.

Had a three-player game of this with a couple fellow Magic veterans and it was a blast. We did a very basic draft first.

Oct. 2015 - I like that you get 120 cards and many modes of play for a low price of $10/$15. However, the game felt very derivative of Magic: The Gathering. As the game progressed, I kept thinking to myself, "I've seen all this before."

Jan. 2016 - Criticism aside, I wound up buying the game to play with my eight year old son. He's very interested in Magic: The Gathering. I believe Epic will be a good stepping stone toward that end.

This game is highly underrated. Every card is useful and you can play a great game just by dealing random cards. The person who plays better will usually win, not the person with the "better" cards.

Otherwise, CCG experience that doesn't require constant purchase of new cards and almost no limits about when and what cards you can play from your hand sound really great.

I enjoy many CCG:s but I don´t like Magic very much. This is almost Magic except every darn card is unique. It´s supposed to play quick, but it takes some time to get to know the cards, esp with slow players. Not worth the playing time, at least judging from our first game (3-pl).

A quick 2-player card game that looks and feels quite a lot like Magic the Gathering but without all of the fiddly rules. It plays quickly and feels balanced, despite each player just taking a random half of the deck each at the start of the game. The artwork is solid but the print quality on a few of my cards was blurred.

Really interesting twist on MTG mechanics. The resource system is rather smart and allows powerful plays from the get go.

The sealed format is rather random, but draft is really fun.

After more plays, we figured out the game is a lot more fun following the stack rules from MTG (we keep the 1 gold a turn system). When playing with the regular rules, a lot of cards feel like they are not that interesting.

Blows Star Realms out of the water by a landslide.

The first few games might feel clunky as some of the gameplay concepts can be a little hard to wrap your head around (at least for players unfamiliar with MtG like me)
But once you are past those first few learning games, man this game is fantastic.

Only got 4 plays in but it does feel Epic. Been looking for a game to scratch the MTG itch and seeing how this will do.

Update: I have to drop this to a 5 just because I have haven't been able to get anyone excited to play it in the 6 months since I got it. I just don't have anyone that has enjoyed playing it with me. I want to like it, but since I can't get anyone to play it, it makes it harder to like.

Here is hoping for an APP to drop so I can connect with other people to play with. (Update: App has been announced at Worlds. Will probably be the only format I can play this.)

RATING: 7
Played a demo game in Essen against my wife. The game feels like a variant of magic where you could cast one spell per turn but did not have to pay any costs (I *think* this went by the name of "type 4", but not sure). Differing from this, Epic has spells that are free and you can cast any number of them (plus activated abilities that may or may not eat up your one cast, i.e. "gold", for the turn).

As a long term duel game I greatly prefer magic. The need to balance availability of mana (mostly through lands) vs. having enough non-land cards is part of the game. Also, there is an interesting decision space between having many cheap spells and ramping up to huge amounts of mana. I dislike, to some extent, the ability of casting whatever insane spell on the first turn. Similarly, the power of spells needs to be limited (cutting off maybe the 5% of most powerful spells in magic).

I think that Epic wins in the setting of taking only a small box of cards along and wanting to play duels or two vs. two. Then again, the same could be achieved by bringing a stack of powerful magic cards and playing type 4 (or whatever it is called).

"For [MTG] veterans, Epic is a great way to get the thrill of tide-turning plays EVERY single turn, rather than getting those moments once every 1-2 games. I cannot recommend Epic for non-MTG players -- not unless they have a chance to get in a few games of basic MTG to get a feel for the phases and card interactions first.

This is a good card game that succeeds in giving a Magic: the Gathering-style gameplay with very few rules. It takes 15 minutes to learn it, instead of months like Magic. That’s also why it didn’t work for me, as I’ve gone through the trouble to learn Magic, so I’d prefer to play Magic over it. Worthwhile for anyone who is too scared to get into heavy CCGs.

Epic embodies the good qualities of Magic: The Gathering without the money grubbing of WOTC. Don't get me wrong, I love Magic, but these days I find myself playing more casual games. Epic has SEVERAL forms of play from drafts, to sealed to constructed, and now there are getting to be enough cards to create some unique decks. Players of MTG will feel right at home with this game but at the same time it has MANY things that will recommend it above MTG. First, the price point is wonderful! For the cost of a single card for one of my Magic Decks I bought an entire Draft set of Epic (collector's box, 3x of every card including expansions). Secondly, the strategy of each game is increased because of limited resources. Thirdly, White Wizard Games is an up and coming company that have several good titles to their name and great ones coming. Keep your eye on them!

This game is like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. You're slinging super overpowered spells at each other until one person dies, and I love it. Really scratches the same itch as Magic: The Gathering, but I think I prefer this in comparison. Mage Wars: Academy has lessened my desire to play this, but I can't help but admire how well they've supported this release.

Streamlines a lot of Magic: The Gathering, notably its resource and priority systems. And although I agree that playing things on curve was a bit too powerful in MTG, I'd rather have new iterations of the same concept capture the midgame of the genre rather than the swingy topdecky endgame. Unfortunately even as I still believe that the core ideas of Epic are good, its card design is just not on par. I didn't get a copy of the game for the constructed experience but it should be noted that the clunkiness of deckbuilding rules shows that at least a subset of 0-cost cards are probably broken in some way.

More generally, most cards are threatening to blow up the whole board or win the game in mere turns and planning around them is a chore, especially as a beginner, because of the wild swings and big numbers everywhere. After the second turn of my first game, I had my opponent at half life with two cards in hand and no board presence. For comedy purposes, I would have written it took us under 2 minutes to reach that state; but the creatures involved in this mess had random-looking attack and defence stats ranging from 2 to 18 and multiple abilities each, which really slowed down our processing of the (low amount of) gameplay leading to that situation. And is no fun at all.

Unhelpfully for veteran MTG players, a "we don't want to get prosecuted by Wizards of the Coast" policy implies that every single element nicked from MTG went through a renaming process (colours, zones, card types, phases, keyword abilities, actions...); it's a miracle cards are still called "cards". Finally, while as a CCG player I've been accustomed to the need for additional markers and tokens with some decks (generally in the form of small dice), they're usually not required in truly gratuitous amounts for basic out-of-the-box play. I consider the lack of components there a significant production flaw.

I'm not a MtG player, and with a 10yo son interested in Pokémon I don't have a lot of interest in the CCG/TCG realm beyond that.  Thankfully Epic answers the call without the collectible/trading aspect.  Whew!
All cards are hard-hitting, although some more-so than others.  There seems to be a lot more going on than this just being a standalone game, and yet that's all it needs to be for me.
I'll bring it out maybe a couple of times a year, in the right company.  That's enough.

Just $15 bucks and you can get all the fun from playing Magic the Gathering in a distilled, simplified yet flashier format.  

All the cards are powerful and there is a potential for big plays in every round, so yeah, it can be swingy, but it is fun.

However, just like teaching Magic the Gathering to complete newbies, there's a lot of terminology to learn from the get-go as the cards heavily favor keywords and icons over detailed explanations of the cards' effects.  My girlfriend played two games and was struggling to understand the phases and the best way to play the cards.

Update 1:  I play solo with decks comprising two colors or one color and keep track of what combos win a lot.  Very fun.  Eager to see the expansion(s) to come.

Update 2:  I realized that this game has some very high obstacles for completely new players to overcome, when my girlfriend struggled to figure it out.  It is meant for those who have played Magic the Gathering, and want something far more affordable and quick to bring out, and even then, it might not satiate what they are looking for.  I like it, and I think it's fun enough, but I also know it's a bit chaotic and luck-driven.

The art has come a long way since the 2009 EPIC TCG. Epic now gives a nice, but sometimes crazy, experience that is usually the realm of Trading Card Games.

It may take a few reads of the rulebook to understand, but with learn to play videos and a comprehensive rulebook being worked on, grokking it should be easy.

Recommended for those that might have a M:TG itch or are looking for something a little simpler to explain with epic effects from turn one.

More or less does what it says on the tin.  It's DNA is 90% Magic the Gathering and it fits in a nice little box.  It can be very swingy but there are interesting interactions to be had and zero mana ramp to struggle with.  Tentative thumbs up pending more plays.

RATING: 5
First impression (2 player) :

I feel that having "mana" of 1 on every turn is limiting this game too much. Cards only come in two varieties free and 1-costing and latters have to be quite powerful so even the first card played can be best possible with just luck determining if you can answer it or not (usually you can, as removal is as powerful too). Not much of buildup, just playing strong (and hopefully synergic cards). About synergies, I felt drafting takes too long for what game is.

I wanted to love this game.  And I do like a lot of things about it, the deck building, the card variety, and the structure of the cards. Its all accommodating to very casual players. 

My problem comes after I start playing.  Several other reviewers have stated that every turn feels like the sixth turn of a MTG game, and while that is accurate, they neglected to mention it feels like the six turn of a MTG game, you are playing against blue and they are sporting two untapped islands.  Even on games I won I never had the feeling that I was in control of that win. 

This is okay for anyone that has never played Magic, but if you have, this game will only disapoint.

Fast paced magic the gathering action with very little resources and super affordable price. Needs some more play to determine final rating. For now only played the standard deal out 30 random cards mode. Might improve with drafting or other types of set-up variants.

After revising the rules I noticed that we were playing battle wrong due to how blocking works against multiple attackers. This made a huge different which was confirmed by playing this game again with the corrected rules. The game became overall much more tactical.

Bumped it up from 7 to 8 for that.

All the comparisons I'm reading to magic are clearly not from Magic players. No one who's played magic a good amount (or recently) would say this is better. Yes it "fixes" the mana flood/screw problem but Magic was never meant to be an purely-strategic abstract game. If you play hearts and get dealt all low cards, is that a problem with the game? If you play stone age and roll all low numbers, is that a problem with the game? If you play Ticket to Ride and you can't draw the colors you need, is that a problem with the game?

Richard Garfield has talked about game design before and stated that having some luck of the draw is important in that with no luck, experienced players would be infinitely rewarded and new players would be easily deterred from continuing to play. Similarly if it were all luck, no one would want to keep playing for long because there would be no payoff or strategy. Magic has a balance of luck and strategy and obviously a good one because it gets crowds of new players every year and retains its current player base very well... AND it's over twenty years old.

Epic is no Magic. Epic can be fun but there's so much luck and it does so many things that can quickly unbalance a game. If you've played well in a game of Magic and are ahead, you're likely to win. If you've played well in a game of Epic and are ahead, that means nothing. You're likely to suffer an "instant-speed board wipe".

I play far more board games than I do Magic and am not here to sing its praises (though that is incidentally what's happening) but it is a HUGE disservice to the Magic community to imply this game has done anything Magic hasn't. Anyone who loves Magic, or even likes it a lot, will be infuriated by Epic. The only thing Epic has done is fill the niche for a faster, less strategic, 99-cent-phone-game-style ripoff of Magic.

But like I said, it "can" be fun.

It's like if you were really drunk and couldn't remember the rules to Magic, yet still wanted to play. At least that's how "different" the rules felt in this. It's pretty obvious that it's cloning Magic, yet does away with the mana system in respect to having a single "gold" each round to pay for highly overpowered cards.

I liked it, and I'd play it again, but it made me realize how nothing has come close to Magic. I missed the timing of instants, the storage of mana from round to round so that you could play something completely disruptive to an opponent and how structured the attack phase is.

Highly doubtful it'll rise above a 7, but it's not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be.

Drafting game in the vein of Magic the Gathering.  Draft cards to build your deck, then play best of 3 or best of 5.  It's $10 for a whole lot of replayability, it offers the best of old-school Magic the Gathering gameplay, and it's just so wonderfully portable.

Magic the Gathering "Extra-light"

In theory - should be fun in the way Munchkin is fun, but it seems more like a CCG with just attack - attack - attack - attack.

On the other hand, after a long drawn out stressful game, this might be a real tonic - just 15 minutes of balls-out "throwing down" without a lot of analysis.

This game is fine. I mean, it's sort of like playing magic without needing to to the deckbuilding thing which is nice. Beyond that, it's pretty swingy. I guess I just don't feel the excitement in this game. I wanted that same rush I got from playing a well-oiled deck in perfect balance with the decks of my friends, but that's not really the experience this brings.

My God, how could I have missed this all these years?!
I burned out on Mtg a long time ago because of its extremely random nature, and its terrible mana system... but I get sucked back in once in a while for drafting, and because no other card game could quite fill its shoes.
Well, no more!  Epic takes the magic formula and streamlines it in every way.  Not only that, but it's only a one time purchase for a small box that provides four decks and can be drafted.
I love it.

Scratches my rare "let's play Magic the gathering" itch without reminding me why I stopped playing Magic the gathering.

Epic's rules are mostly straightforward, with little to none of the timing issues that make magic frustrating.  Also you can buy a nice set for cheap and have a great time, instead of mortgaging your house to try and get four of the overpowered rare for your deck in magic.

It's a little unfair for me I suppose to talk so much about MTG in this games comments, but Epic is the answer to the question of "how can we make magic fun for casual players".  I think that is high praise.

16-06-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Epic is a fun little game, which needed me to rethink my strategies regarding resources. 
Both players randomly divide the deck into two. Then, basically every turn both players have 1 money to spend, but you can only cast creatures (called heroes I guess?) in your own turn while spells can be used always.

Creatures are big, but the effects to get rid of the are also big. I could have used with some lower numbers, but the game is fine regardless. Nice artwork, fine price. It looks like a great and interesting card game I can't wait to play more of when my real copy arrives instead of the PnP.

My rating changes based on what format I am playing.

Multi-Player, Decks By Color: 8.5
I felt this game was really well balanced and fun for all parties involved.  Game length was decent.  About half an hour to an hour.  Similar to MtG but with some interesting differences.

Multi-Player, Decks Randomly Dealt: 7
REALLY unbalanced in this format.  One of us had a ton of heavy hitters, one almost nothing but events, and the third, a mediocre deck.  It was interesting- makes you think on your toes- but if you are the kind of person who likes an actual chance of winning, you're unlikely to be evenly matched.

Elder God vs 2-Headed Hydra: 5
Longest game of my life.  Boring as hell in hour 4.  Yes, you read that right.  Our game lasted 4 hours.  4 hours of near stalemate conditions.  My attention span was all but gone in the last hour.  Likely contributed to our final demise as the hydra.  Please note, the rules say to play as a 3-Headed Hydra.  We did not have enough players so we clearly suffered from that.  Next time will try with the appropriate number of players and hopefully will enjoy it more.

This is what MtG should have been. The game is faster paced, simpler, doesn't have the same kinds of timing issues, and manages to have a ton of variety from a single deck of 120 cards. So far I think that draft is the best way to create decks, but you can draft over and over again from that one deck of cards.

RATING: 5
This game is extremely derivative, and I think that it is by design. I know this is meant to be Magic in a box, but it kind of fell flat for me. There is nothing terribly wrong with this game, but in the end there are so many other games I would rather play. I suppose this does provide a game for someone who really, really wants a Magic experience without magic cards. However, I think the same thing could be accomplished with some pre-constructed magic decks.

RATING: 6
I kickstarted this as it was a low cost MtG style LCG. Epic is a decent "party" game if you play draft mode and take it for what it is, playing ridiculous, overpowered cards every turn. I cannot recommend playing constructed as the suggested decks have so much synergy it's almost impossible to follow any single strategy to win due to constant board clears. In draft, however, no one is guaranteed that synergy (and you can hate-pick cards), so there's a bit more time to breathe and take stock of the situation. If you did want to play "serious" constructed games you'd have to buy three starter sets as the base game comes with 120 *unique* cards (only one of each) so you can't triple up on a single card in a deck without buying multiples.

I can't say I didn't have fun playing this game, it did have me laughing hysterically as I summoned huge 30/30 monsters or when I cleared the board instantly with a single spell, but ultimately it feels kind of sloppy and untested. All in all, if you're looking for a quick draft-style MtG-like it's not a bad pickup, but don't expect a deep, strategic experience.

10/11/15 Few quick green vs blue plays with my daughter tonight. Enjoyable enough, but I agree the rule book leaves a lot of ambiguities in my head. I'm not sure we did everything right. Will have to scan BGG forums and watch another play through video before trying again. Love the artwork and my 11 yr old daughter did a good job catching on. Plus her brain wasn't bogged down by having to re-translate old MtG terms into Epic slang like mine was constantly. I'm very intrigued and interested in drafting with 3 decks at some point. Backed for 3 starter decks on Kickstarter and got the gorgeous playmats also.

Super cool game. All the mechanics of a TCG like Magic, but none of the incredible cost investment. A new favorite that I'd LOVE to play more of.

Really great card art too! So good that I put all of the cards into sleeves to protect them (and because I feel like I'm going to play a lot of this game).

I'll probably buy the expansions once I've played the base enough times that I'll want a refresh. FANTASTIC VALUE FOR $15. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played a TCG.

You can play random 30-card decks (all I've done so far), you can draft, you can combine multiple sets to make a pool of cards to draft from, you can play pre-constructed decks, etc. You can play head-to-head or with more people.

A Magic kistestvére az elmondások szerint. Sajnos még a Magic elkerült engem, így nem tudom hasonlítani hozzá. Nekem a Star Realms hangulatát hozta. Gyors, pörgős, bár elsőre sokkal nehezebb kiigazodni a sok kifejezésen, de szerintem pár játék után kapásból megy. Rengeteg kombózási lehetőség és epic erősségű kártyák. A játékosoknak fix 1 aranyuk van, a kártyák játékbahozási ára pedig vagy 1 vagy 0, az előbbiekből értelemszerűen egyet, utóbbiakból bármennyit lejátszhatunk a körünkben. Hősökkel és eseménykártyákkal vesszük fel a küzdelmet a játékostársaink ellen. A harcban mindenre reagálhatunk. 30 élet legyalulása a feladatunk az ellenfeleinkről. Bár játszható többen is a játék, szerintem tipikus kettes játék. Gyönyörűek a kártyák képei. Elsőre kevésbé ütött, mint a Star Realms, de van benne potenciál úgy érzem.

I have never ever seen a worst rule set, and it fits in a single page. They did not even care to include a gold coin card. Unintuitive game play and generally ugly cards. This is very subjective, but we really hated this one. I understand as I read that those who persevered sometimes found a deep and challenging game. I cannot say that I persevered, so take this with a grain of salt. We played around 10-15 games and had no interest in keeping digging.

It seems that most people who are rating this game low are making comparisons to Magic the Gathering or Star Realms and are completely missing the point of the game.

Star Realms?! Really? The comparison has absolutely no merit except that they are both card games made by the same publisher. They are COMPLETELY different games trying to achieve two different things. 

To be fair, this game is extremely similar to MTG though, except it feels more streamlined, more exciting, and faster paced--providing the purest, most idealistic form of enjoyment that MTG provides (forget about following a meta -- this game brings me back to when I was younger and my friends and I would buy a bunch of boosters and just try to construct the best decks to beat each other with using the most powerful creatures we could find).

Yup. This game has somehow managed to capture that essence by distilling it down to only the game's most exciting parts. Don't really need to think about mana curve or non-traditional, "outside" strategies like burn or dredge. Just pure back and forth take-that action. 

There are only two types of cards: Champions (creatures) and Events (sorceries/instants). There are no instants in this game, but you can play cards on the opponents turn depending on the actions taken by the opponent. Very smart simplification of this game.

I love the changes in the phases in this game as well, combined with the different combat rules compared to MTG (e.g. you don't "assign" blockers, you can attack multiple times per turn). Has massive strategic implications that can't be achieved with just the typical combat phase and main phase I and II in MTG.

I'm a bit jaded when it comes to the collectible card game model and no longer feel like spending hours following a meta and dumping tons of money into a game. Epic Card Game gives me all the aspects of Magic that I love, but without the (expensive) negatives.

The only major negative I can find is that the rulebook is very vague. For MTG players, it'll be much more intuitive and easy to figure out, but for players who have not been exposed to MTG, I can imagine this game being very difficult to understand. It's a simple game, but it's more of a paradigm-adjustment thing than a complicated-rules issue.



TL;DR - Don't listen to haters who say that Magic or Star Realms is better. Different games, different objectives. This game is incredible.

So far I've played two player with just solid color decks and a four player draft game. I really like how the game ramps up to 10 on the first turn. Won't ever play free for all four player again though. Way too chaotic.

Epic is a fantasy card game in the spirit of Magic: The Gathering which aims to recreate the TCG-style experience from a single box, with no additional purchases required. Owning multiples of the base set allows you to expand game modes to accommodate upwards of 8 players, making constructed decks, or advanced drafting modes such as "cube" drafts.

Language: English

Edition: White Wizard Games first edition.

Condition: Cards show very minor wear from 2 plays, box shows some wear from travel.

The Epic TCG, of which this is a reimplementation/repackaging, seems like a response to certain facets of Magic: the Gathering. Mana screw isn't fun, being decked isn't fun, having to wait so long before summoning huge creatures isn't fun -- so in Epic cards are essentially free to play, all of them are ridiculous, and if you're decked you win. It's the sort of game where turn one starts with a player summoning a 14/14 giant worm and their opponent responds with a spell to kill all creatures in play.

I had hoped that this would be exciting in the same "if everything is broken then nothing is broken" sense of Innovation, but cards are unevenly broken and the game requires drafting or other deck construction for balance. Even with that done, there's not a whole lot of variety in the cards. Probably a good game for children who might build a Magic deck full of dragons because dragons are awesome, but not one for a strategy gamer.

LIKE! big like.

I am deeply disappointed to see so much bad reviews it has here on BGG and I believe I know what the problem is.

The only set of players with which you can play this one as constructed is with former M:tG players, and they ALSO need to have 3 sets, so you can match against each other fairly.

I have played it a lot every consecutive day against a college of mine which has 3 kickstarted copies (I have 2 KS and got 1 from essen-15) and we evolved the decks each day, because we learned more each day.

Among the other comments I read a lot that there is a lack of strategy (whatever you do doesn't affect the game, because every card is so OP) but i beg to differ.

In the 60 card decks by changing 6-9 each day was determining whether that day I was going to win almost all the matches or not. We played a lot per day, and every day one was winning almost every game, it was never 50-50. The next day probably the other, if not the day after. Whichever the case, every card counts if the decks are properly constructed.

I didn't manage to play THE CUBE yet, but from what i have played till now, as a 2p game is by far the most exciting one.

I cannot stress enough how much fun some of the matches provided.

Culprit of the game is that the potential audience is very narrow, and i believe that only players that have been on the competitive CCG scene can truly enjoy it, so to play it in constructed format they need to own it also.

I would have rated it 9.4 according to the fun i had playing it, but when I take into consideration that i cannot bring it in front of most of the people i play with, than it goes in a whole different bracket. (still deserves much more than others are rating it)

All those other games trying to recreate the MtG experience without randomized cards? Yeah, sorry, you can just all pack up and go home. Epic has absolutely nailed it with an exciting dueling wizards (OK, so they are dieties or something - whatever!) game with lots of crazy cardplay and combos. Lots of back and forth, lots of cool cards. Plays well even with randomized decks.
However, to promptly contradict what I just said, it does have one major weakness; the terminology is pretty opaque for a non-MtG player and will require a lot of look-ups.

This game is so much fun.  Every card is ridiculously overpowered which makes this a wide-open free for all.  The rules are easy to learn which makes this a great introduction for people that want to learn CCGs.

I love that you can draft this or just shuffle up a stack for each player.  There's lots of flexibility.

I played it once with the pre-made decks. I think it's a nicely escalated version of M:tG and the drafting will be the best way to play this game, which will be kinda like a M:tG Cube. Gotta properly sleeve up my copy of the game and add some expansion.

I've enjoyed my two plays of Epic quite a lot, though in both cases I've won easily and by a big margin (both three player games, both games where I killed off both players).

There doesn't actually seem to be a lot to it; draft the same colour where possible, take almost all of the zeroes you see and keep back your big cards until someone else does something big that you need to respond to.

Epic, it isn't. But it plays pretty smoothly.

Minus points for the 80's style female depictions. So we're still not past that are we?

After a handful of plays, I think Epic manages to capture the feel of Magic without the investment. That said, with modern Magic options (Duel decks, etc.), the investment to play is really low. The advantage Epic has over Magic is variability. With the $15 base deck, you can put together a reasonable draft, constructed, or sealed game, and still feel like you have a fair shot against your opponent. In some ways, especially with sealed play, it captures the feel of my early Magic days, when I didn't have a lot of cards, and everything felt new and exciting because no one new how to play very efficiently. That will perhaps wear off, but with a low price tag, Epic is worth it so long as you don't want to get heavily into constructed-style play. But there are other games for that...

The game seems to do what it strives to do: simplify and improve on Magic, and create tons of cards that seem broken and are fun to play. Every card seems crazy over powered but it's balanced out by there being multiple counters to every card. There are some huge attackers in this game (one of them can hit for 30 damage, which would be instant death), but there are plenty of cards that will just outright kill one or more attackers.

One piece of advice for your first few games, though, is that you should use the pre-constructed decks which are each made up of all of the cards of a single color (yellow deck, red deck, etc.). Dealing out random cards to make a deck can just be frustrating, not fun, and highly luck-dependent. The single-color decks have a lot more synergy, more focus, they all play differently, and they're just fun to play. I was planning to construct my own decks right away but for now I'm really enjoying the game with just the pre-constructed mode.

Really great game. Fits nicely into a double-sized deck box and can be taught to just about anyone.

Like a beautifully restrained version of MTG, this game has simplified much of the [potential] timing complexity and confusion inherent in MTG's stack and main phase, combat and instants.

It's certainly not perfect, and the rulebook is the main complaint with this one. Some of the art is meh, but for the most part it's functional to good. But for 2-4 player action heavily in the vein of MTG, this game shines terribly well. Very glad I finally picked it up and excited to see the digital version!

After my first play, I have to admit that I'm not really taken by this game. And I so wanted to like it more! I mean, I consider Star Realms to be one of the best cardgames ever. But Epic does not strike me as either original (it is very similar to Magic) or strategic. There is just too much luck involved in which cards you get in your deck (standard game) and the order in which you draw them. Also, depending on de composition of the draw decks, the game can take a really long time to play. But maybe I will like the drafting variant better - will have to try it soon!

I hoped this would've been good but it turned out pretty average. Great idea but only ok execution.

Very simple and pretty nice Magic The Gathering clone with a fixed amount of cards and a cheap pricetag where you either make a random deck, build a deck or draft. The drafting is easily the most fun of the bunch but still the game is very heavily relient on overpowered cards that shift the power dynamic on the table a little bit too often. It's kind of fun but any sense of forward thinking will be obliterated by the fact that some of the cards are just way too powerful.

This game really is a full CCG in a small box. Too bad i hate all CCG and LCGs :D But this one works without deck construction (random or drafted decks) fine, so that saves you from looking up the decklist of the world champion.
I really love that there are no traditional resources (your cards and the one gold action you get each turn is still a resource but a simpler one) but for me Smash Up as a two player game just does that aspect way better, because in that game there are stronger cards and weaker cards, but their ratio in your deck is fixed. Each faction has only one 5 power minion, and it is a serious decision when to play it. Epic never really gave me that. People say that because all cards are powerful, none of them really feel like that, and that is true to a deegree, although board wipes and certain brutal combos are still pretty epic when played at the right time, and bigger monster are still big compared to token monsters. God cards make the game very different, and epic in new ways, allowing for new combos with the 2 gold each turn rule. But it feels like the game wasn't really balanced for this.
Edit: With a bit more with time passing, I like the game more. I guess I was a bit disappointed in the KS. But it's the best Magic-clone I know... including Magic. Lands? Stack? No, thanks. And I sometimes want to play games like Magic, and then, this is my go to.

Basically a simplified clone of Magic: the Gathering. I can understand how some might feel underwhelmed by this.  My preferred way to play is by dealing random decks and I have found this to be superbly balanced, it's just that the balance is a sort of swingy "dynamic equilibrium" that I quite enjoy but, again, I can understand that this doesn't appeal to everybody. I think the game provides an extremely fun and rewarding game experience in a very affordable and portable package. It's also approachable and enjoyable even for non-Magic players.

This game is expandable and I have all of the Tyrants and Uprising expansions and the Kickstarter promos.

Epic plays like the card games I love without the scary price tag that has eventually driven me away from other games. I've been able to play aggro, control, combo, and everything in between.

Replace M:TG's land/mana system with something simpler (cards cost $0 or $1, you get $1 on your turn and on your opponent's), crank the attack/defense values 400% and dial the board-clearing craziness up to at least 11, encourage wild back-and-forth-and-back-and-forth-and-back-and-forth turns through subtle rules changes, and make the colour wheel tactically meaningful by playing up faction affinities, and that's basically EPIC. Great, huh? Oh, and make the art way dumber/more 'kewl,' with minotaurs punching dinosaurs and lots of naturalistically rendered wolf packs for some reason. And clutter up the card design somewhat. And make sure the manual all but requires knowledge of M:TG to be parseable. And...

This is a great little game on its own terms, especially in draft format. But near as I can tell, no one plays it. I got excited at the prospect of *prix fixe* M:TG++, and if that's your bag, give it a try. I'm afraid my copy's gathering dust.

couldnt resist the MTG-in-a-box angle here. scrotnig artwork, zarjazz solo variant. Possibly too many rules blips to give super high marks but staying in collection as my MTG clone.

2016 update: decided to pull this out and carefully re-read the rules and watched bgg's excellent tutorial vids (thanks elephant). Being a non-MTG player it's been a rough ride, and the use of unusual phrases such as 'tribute' and 'Loyalty' for 'instant bonus' and 'reveal cards to trigger' doesn't make it any easier. Rather like this now I have the rules smoothed out.

Since I really don’t enjoy playing all that much, this is in my cull list. Cards come with a deck box, and there are a ton of promos and extra cards from a “draft” I was in.

Okey card game, but doesn't really feel like a strong replacement for Magic the Gathering. Game rules are easy to pick up if you know Magic the Gathering. Very nice pricepoint though, which is definitely a plus!

RATING: 6.5
This is just kind of a stupidly fun filler for me. It's outrageous in all the right ways and feels like a gratuitous mage battle. Every card is overpowered. The turn sequence is complex enough to allow clever play but not overly complicated enough to slow down the game. It can be a bit hard to learn as an MtG player since there are some distinct differences and the rules could stand a polish.

A two player magic-type card duel without Mana or a power curve. Throw out legendary monsters and powerful spells from the word go.

I backed this on KS. Amazing and well balanced game with friendly entry cost. You can really make a lot of fun and try a lot of variants just with a single set.

This is definitely a Magic: The Gathering clone, but that's not a bad thing. It's like playing MtG with only the high powered cards, towards the end of a game when all your combos and plans for the deck has come together.

I like Epic a lot. It's easy to learn, quick to play, and drafting cards from a cube is a ton of damn fun! I look forward to many more play sessions of Epic.

Good game, but my expectations were way too high. The strangely packed and priced expansions made me stop buying at the base game.

Scratches the MtG itch. Rulebook lacks clarity (though the rule mechanics are good once you figure them out).

An Epic card game of MTG-lite.

RATING: 7
Does a remarkably good job supplying the MtG experience at low low cost, and with fewer rules-complexity hassles to boot.  Possible problem: I get the sense that cards that fail to provide direct card advantage are unplayable.

Pro: Négyen próbáltuk, állítólag így nem a legjobb. Szépek a rajzok, Boris Vallejo jutott róla az eszembe.

Kontra: Most mondhatnám, h ez nem az én játékom és így nem is pontozom, de az a cucc, amiben tudok úgy nyerni, h totál homályban tapogatózva, csak arra játszom, h felhúzzam a paklim, míg a többiek szarrá agyalják-kombózzák magukat... nos, az nem érdemli meg a kíméletet. :D

They tried to make a self contained MTG game - a noble pursuit. Sadly, it fell rather flat as the binary system of purchasing lends itself to steamrolling.

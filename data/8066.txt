Miniatures rules squad level WW2.
Very clever, original and refreshing (even by today standards)set of rules for simulating ww2 combat in urban and close environment.
You will need a small table, few miniatures but a LOT of terrain!
I have not set a game of CF a few years ago and nowadays i can't find anybody to play :(
As I remember, CF was one of the best game-simulation of ww2 at squad & platoon level.
Plays fast and without downtime.
Much Better and mature than more recent WW2 miniatures rules.

excellent stand based wwii miniatures game, using no rulers, unique turn sequence where one player retains initiative until suffering a set back

I think this reads as being one of the best set of WWII mini games out there.  Fun, fast, simple, no measuring anything!  Played a modified version at Kubla with Rudy, Enron, and Jael, and I didn't really like it.  No one really explained the rules, nor the house rules they were using, and the system didn't really lend itself well to Stalingrad-style play.  But I think this could be the WWII mini set I have been looking for all these years!

RATING: N/A
Just starting to paint my fist couple of companies.  After reading the rules I can't wait to try this.  Lack of fixed turns should simulate the chaotic and dynamic nature of combat.
EDIT: 2 young kids = not much time to paint

Most realistic version of squad level combat I've played...not realistic in the sense of simulation, but realistic in the sense of feeling "real."

Wow. Fantastic simple but realistic rules for ww2 infantry miniatures. Needs a lot of terrain but can play well on a small board as long as the terrain is dense. Rules are extremely well written - short and unambiguous.

This concept seems so interesting, I had to pick it up, even though I know next to nothing about World War II wargames. Unfortunately I think the background knowledge would really help me: I don't understand some of the assumptions about SMGs and such.

I haven't tried it yet, although I would like to. I have trouble thinking of a scenario for a background I'm not familiar with.

Looks like a GREAT set of rules for simulating World War II tactical battles.

RATING: 7.5
A great set of rules with an interesting twist in that there are no game turns - initiative is with one side until they mess up one of their actions.

RATING: 6.4
interesting WW2 game with a realistic feeling flow as you try to break a line in your enemy's defence.
Unique system disposes of ranges, turns and tape measures and LOS, troop placement and fire arcs become very important.
At times repetetive patterns can bog down the game as you keep trying till you succeed, and players eye view over the battlefield can give some unrealistic movement.
Good experience overall though, but you need a crap load of scenery.

Really love these novel, ground breaking wargame rules.  Arty Conliffe broke the mould here and came up with some fast playing company level rules that dispense with turn based play and rulers.

Rewards good play that mirrors good tactics.

Split the opinion of Grognards.  I love 'em.

it's a table-top wargame, so expect a big investment of money and time to get your minis to the table.

RATING: 7
Novel miniatures game that does away with measuring and predictable turn alternation sequences and does a good job of it.  Crossfire enjoys a decent fan base considering the publisher and minimal support it has received over the years.  System is a bit "abstract" for my tastes in miniature gaming in many ways, especially at this scale where I think detail is what tells.  That said "Crossfire" is more realistic, more historically accurate and a ton more fun to play than the current flavor of WWII miniatures gaming "Flames of War".  Your milage may vary.  NOTE: This game system requires more table top terrain than most and a poorly construted table can KILL a game. Have since sold off my copy of the rules and the original Crossfire playtest Soviets as I have not been able to find a game in 15mm WW2 other that "Flames of War" for over a decade...   Thus I would rather not play at all.

Best of the 2 player tactical miniatures WWII games out there.  Very intuitive combat and movement system that is true line of sight and no tape measures. You can get in cheap with the plastic 1/72 soldiers.  Some advice though, DO NOT try this with multiple players on each side or try to do your Armor heavy Kursk scenario with these rules.

A simple set of rules for miniature wargames. 
Don't need rulers or measuring tapes for movement. 
Compatible with all figure and vehicle scales.

A novel ruleset.  Good use of new ideas, with basic mechanics changes the focus of the game from "rules" to "options".  Well worth a look into.

RATING: 8
Simple, and fun to play.  Rules provide an opportunity to use interesting tactics in a game that plays out in real-time.  Table looks nice too because you don't need any rulers, and after a few games, you can mostly set the single chart aside.  Works well with 2,3 or 4 players.  A big game takes 2 hours to play.  You need a lot of terrain to play.  Hedges work well for a Normandy setting.  For steppes of russia, you can use a lot of flat hills to break up visibility.

RATING: 7
Bit more interesting miniatures rules than usual. Certainly worth trying out if you come across this one. Doesn't handle every situation that well, but basic platoon or company level infantry firefights sure are fun and interesting. Have to recommend to everyone interested in miniature game rules in general.

RATING: 7
Very good game: fast, original and interesting in every move. You have real total control of your forces and you can win only with a solid plan and a bit of luck (like in real life). I found some difficulties to learn the game from the rulebook (boring and very old-style exposition) but the game merits the effort.

RATING: 8.5
Crossfire has quite interesting rules, which are playable beyond the curiosity factor. Flames of War players could easily try Crossfire without rebasing any figures.  Good with 2 players.  There isn't any good way to handle an odd number of players, but it could be acceptable with 4 players.

RATING: 9
The only game that keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I play it. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for the armor rules, which only lack one detail to be better. You can take any Squad Leader scale game compnents and play it with these rules.

I like this rule system for 15mm miniatures.  With 0 to 2 tanks on the table maximum, it avoids the nasty, unattractive look of 5 to 10 tanks sitting cheek to cheek in division scale games played in 15mm.

My only gripe (so far) is that it formalizes the concept of the 'terrain piece',  one of the uglier conventions in miniature wargaming terrain.

RATING: 8
Concept of Skirmish and "new" movement options. Like rules concept, yet feel that scale is to "large" and needs to be at a "fire team" concept. i.e. 2-3 teams to a squad, some with specific abilities and some with multiple abilities, yet none with "all" abilities.

Great game, but best for infantry combat (vehicles don't work so well), and also for 1:1 play. Multi-player games are a bit unsatisfactory.

A great set of WW2 company level rules, far better then FoW or IABSM in my opinion. Crossfire is both simple and very realistic. You have to use realistic tactics, otherwise you WILL get slaughtered. The only real downside to the game is that you need a LOT of terrain!

Nice set of rules and plays fast.  At the end of the night you can look over the battle field and see a flow and a story that unfolded.  It really is nice to see a game that does not turn into a huge line of tanks shoting at each other.

This game has some really interesting ideas and mechnaics. I find a lot of the games I've played bog down into small parties of understrength platoons blazing away at each other from cover with little effect. While this might, in a way, be quite "realistic" for a game it is quite tiresome and frustrating (which, again, might be quite "realistic"...)

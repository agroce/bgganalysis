Very enjoyable, light-but-strategic game for 2 players.  Still attempting to figure out strategy, but it's very easy to learn and has plenty of subtlety required to do well.

The other thing I enjoy about this is the experience of playing it.  There is a lot of enjoyable interaction between the two players as you try to guess what they are most likely to pick, and attempts at poker faces as you try to get them to pick cards that won't lead to favorable outcomes.

I especially like how the game has subtle changes after the first round, when players start aiming for ties as opposed to outright wins.

Excellent 2p game, not as tense as Battle Line, but along those lines. The idea of offering the csrds to your opponent and keeping whatever is left is brilliant in its power to create tension. It's a fast game and you will find yourself playing multiple games in a row. I've seen many people praising the art on the cards, but for my taste it was just Ok, Overseers is much prettier.

This game rocks.  When I tell people about it, I usually describe it in the way it makes you feel when you play it, like you are putting together a puzzle, but the pieces don't fit properly, so you have to force them together just to finish it. Every decision is so hard, and you can drive yourself nuts calculating the best move.  The majority of the game is people deciding what to play next, but it doesn't feel like it drags on in any way.  Since the game is so short, you will want to play multiple times in a row.

RATING: 7
A tug-of-war game distinguished by its minimalism (21 playing cards, rules explicable in a couple of minutes) and by the angst created by its I cut you choose mechanisms.  Each player will have ten cards in hand over the course of a round and will only play five of them, with their opponent taking three others.  Even if the game is not won in the first round, the ultimate victor is often decided. 

I am a sucker for Oriental artwork, but Hanamikoji's is only good, no great.  Production quality is good and the rules are clear.

I am twisting my heart in a knot deciding between a 6 or a 7 on this. By the end of writing this review I decided that this game is an 8. While the game is frustrating the game is beautifully artistically designed and the game mechanic will have you second guess your every move. 

It is a very interesting compact game.

In this game you can't just play the cards you want. You have to give some up and try to silently persuade you opponent (by the card selections that you offer them) that they would prefer that set/card of the the others available. So you may get what you want but you always have to give up what you want as well. 

You are basically trading cards for cards that you may not be able to work with or that the other person has a better hand that you cant see or eventually get.

Lovely little 2-player card game which reminded me a little of a Battle Line/Schotten Totten but through a fairly different set of mechanics. It plays fast, the art is great, and you get a push and pull tug of war throughout that makes the decisions agonizing in a good way.

FAVORITE TWO PLAYER FILLER CARD GAME

2 Players / 15 Min / Weight: 1.64
Type: Family / Strategy

Has similar feel to Schotten-Totten or Battle line, but I-device-you-choose mechanic is very clever. 

+ Great artwork.
+ Simple rule. Easy to teach and lean. Play quick.
+ Small package and foot print.
+ Not as much as Schotten-Totten or Battle line, but still very deep. Every choice is critical. I actually prefer this to Schotten-Totten because it is a bit less brain burning.

- Geisha theme might be misunderstood.
- 4 actions in a round feels a bit restrictive.

I kind of avoided this because of the stupid and possibly slightly unsavory theme.  However this game is basically an abstract game and a great one at that.  Each game leaves me wanting more but then you can just play again and whilst I would like these elements more weaved with extra layers into a longer game I appreciate that this fills a hard to fill niche of really quick playing games that are replayable and worth playing.  Feels very different than other games out there.

2 player goodness. Brian got the 4 geisha majority at the end of round 3. Very tight double guessing game that plays in 15 minutes or so. I like agonizing decisions in games, and this one has a few. You have to play each of the 4 actions once per round. And of course, many times you don't want to play the action. Or, you are hoping for an awesome draw from the deck right at the end of the round to score that 1 extra card. Super fun. Flo will love this one.

A "playing numbers in columns" game ala Lost Cities, Battle Line, a bunch of Small Box Games designs haha... but it feels almost like a microgame, and has a stronger player reading/bluffing than most others. retains the brutal hand management that is crucial in so many of these sorta games. it's an interesting one. Hanamikoji almost feels like a drafting game to me. Throughout the game rounds you are forced into offering two tough exchanges of cards where your opponent will benefit in some way and two actions that will (most likely) only benefit you... all while having a relatively small hand size from a small pack of cards. The offering actions, the two that give cards to both players, provide a decision that reminds me in some ways of Le Petite Prince: Make Me a Planet or even Biblios. It can be gut wrenching sometimes and to be honest I've not been good at it so far. There is a touch of luck in the draw, but yeah. I look forward to being a few more plays deep... If it gets more competitive, or the luck evens out a bit (being less frustrating- could be ignorance I admit!), I could see this going up to the 8(or 8.5) or down to 7.5 (or 7). Good game though.

RATING: 7
A simple Battle Line-like game where players are fighting over a few cards between them. Like Battle Line, there are just a few colors of cards and, even simpler than Battle Line, the numbers on cards played are all the same and don't really matter. The different part of the game is how you play cards in that some are hidden and others are placed face up on the table for your opponent to pick one or two and add them to their side. So, you are offering them first choice. It provides that same feeling of very simple-appearing choices that are so hard to make. I'm interested to see if this lasts over multiple plays.

My third play was still very interesting, but it does seem more limited in replay value than Battle Line.

An excellent little card game about trying to win geishas to your side by playing cards to them, this game is fast, easy to teach, and has a lot of interesting decisions. This mostly replaces Schotten totten for me.

RATING: 9
My wife and I are particularly drawn toward games with simple rules but with emergent complexity/strategy. Knizia seems to achieve this better than any other designer I've encountered, so his games make up about half of our collection. Probably the most played among them is Battle Line, which I describe as "fun poker".

We recently discovered Hanamikoji, which appeared to me to be quite similar to Battle Line. However, after several plays, I think I MIGHT like it more. There are several things that lead me to this conclusion:

In Battle Line, some cards are better than others Drawing a 8, 9, or 10 is objectively better than lower numbers. There are great hands and terrible hands, which makes the game feel more about luck. So far in Hanamikoji, however, it doesn't ever feel like you've drawn a bad hand or a great hand--it's what you do with it. The main reason for this is that it's never clear that higher numbered cards are better--is a 5 is better than a 2? Even though winning on a 2 is fewer points than 5, there are only two 2's in the whole deck, so having a 2 is more of a guarantee that you'll win or at least tie.

Hanamikoji has fewer cards. Just 21 cards in the whole deck. This makes shuffling a breeze between rounds, making it that much easier to get going with another round.
More intriguing area control In Battle Line, there is a sense of space in that you want the battles you're likely to win to be bunched together so you can get the 3-in-a-row win condition. However, it feels more developed in Hanamikoji. Going into rounds after the first, some of the geishas will already be influenced by one player or another, which changes the dynamics of where the important "battles" are. There's a tension around where you want to invest. For example, Do I try to hang onto this 3? Or should I focus more on stealing a 5, which might be harder to get but would give me the win...

More social element: A criteria for a good game to me is that you feel like you're playing the player(s), not just the game. Battle Line achieves this to a degree, but games often appear to an outside observer like totally solitary affairs, with each player staring at their cards, counting cards on the table, and barely ever looking at the other player. In Hanamikoji, since you're constantly handing each other cards, there's much more of an element of trying to understand and predict what the other player is going for, which is a fun dynamic to me.

The ending: I like how both games end--with excitement! In Battle Line, it often comes down to the last card draw, where you either draw the card that will make you win or a card that will make you lose. Super exciting stuff, but it's maybe less-than-ideal that it often comes down to a 50/50 coin toss. In Hanamikoji, there is similar excitement, but it often comes down to the big reveal, during which each player shows the one card they've set aside to score at the end. This feels a little more exciting since it's a card you've selected, and a card they've selected, rather than just drawing from the deck.

The art: No comparison.

In the end, the game feels like an extremely simple combination of the feel/mechanics of Battle Line, Biblios, and Inis (all games I adore).

The art is really-really nice. A beautiful game in many ways!

RATING: 9
Rating is for a filler.

A beautifully produced game with pretty art that befits its theme. (At heart it is an abstract; it doesn't need a theme at all). I especially liked the pearlescent/iridescent victory chits. 
An ingenious use of such minimalist components. (It is essentially a card game made of only 21 cards). Difficult, meaningful decision making with every turn. Small aspects of the pie division mechanic (San Marco, A Piece of Cake, Shitenno, Dynasties.)

A great go-to for a 5 to 10 minute filler for 2 players. Tense decision making with every single action. Seeing all the cards in your hand, you wonder how you are going to get to lay them down on your side to your advantage.

My 2-player game buddy is VERY hard to please and rarely likes fillers. He was amazed by the anxiety in the game play.

I'm wowed.

I love tension in games and this game is capable of having it. There are turns where it feels like you are choosing between two terrible options. Or praying that the other player will make the wrong choice. You can even lay traps with the hidden cards.

However, a lot of the tension dissipates when players create non decisions out of the you choose mechanisms and the game seems to incentivise that manoeuvre. Essentially, incentivising making the game boring.

The game doesn't have much of an arc, either, with each round feeling samey, and the end can feel sudden, with columns assigned at the end of the round ("Oh, I won").

Wow, what a game. Try to control 7 geisha by taking 4 unique actions each round. The kicker is 2 of the actions directly benefit your opponent so the decisions about what cards to offer your opponents are tough. The winner is the first person to control 4 geisha or have 11 total points. Most games will last 2 or 3 rounds and the outguessing and bluffing really makes this game what it is. A great alternative to Schotten Totten or other similar 2p card games, but the way you play the cards is so unique Hanamikoji really does stand out on its own.

Such candy for the eyes, the art pops and delights, this can only add to your enjoyment of the game. Mechanically the game is quick to learn but takes time to master, it has depth. The things I like the most is that this game puts the players on an even playing field where you must decide how to best to outmaneuver, out think and bluff your opponent; all the while agonizing over which cards to give the opponent because those very cards could lead to your own inevitable defeat. A great brain puzzler but not overly so, no analysis paralysis needed. The rounds are generally quick, 10 minutes or less but the game could go on for many rounds. That feeling of accomplishment I got from winning a five round game was, in my opinion, the mark of a really good game.

Though [i]somewhat[/i] similar to the excellent Battleline, I'm starting to like this one even more. 

I get the feeling when playing—and it's hard to really quantify—but I'm sensing that I am doing a bit more bluffing, messing with my opponent's mind, and generally trying to out-think my opponent than when playing Battleline.

I'm generally not a fan of games with those mechanics in them, but there's something smart about Hanamikoji, then add in delightful art, and I'm pretty happy with this one. Glad to finally have a copy. Recommended.

Played this as the end of a meetup and wasn't entirely impressed. Play is very similar to Battleline in that each player is fighting for control of a column of cards. Unlike Battleline, the columns are never locked in so you can still lose control of points from a previous round. Each round you pick one out of the five actions to perform with the cards in your hand. Sometimes this is having your opponent pick a card and you get two, discarding two cards or saving a card for yourself. At the end of a round, players determine who controls what and then checks to see if anyone has enough points. If you do, you win. The art and theme didn't really stand out and the number of combinations seems lower than Battlelines. It's an ok game and one I would play if nothing better was available.

Abstract card game that revolves around four actions. It feels like one always needs to choose the least unfavorable action. Too negative for my taste.
The theme is beautifully drawn, but not translated into gameplay.

RATING: N/A
Play with rage cards ??
Use, say, the yellow ones as the ones in the centre, and then eg 0's, 2's and 12's for the 2-count sets, 3's and 13's for the 3-count sets, and 4's and 5's.  (So just need to remember that there are 2 each of 0's and 12's, and 3 each of 13's). Then maybe 11-14 in two colours for the action tokens (mod 10 = the number of cards involved in the action)

Fine tuning the ranking. Still a good game for the filler purpose.

[April 2017 - 8.5]
I'm really enjoying this one as a quick two-player filler. It has the feel of Lost Cities and Battle Line, but it's more of a guessing game about how your opponent will play and what cards they have and/or want. With so few cards, it has shades of Love Letter, too.

So simple with just four actions and rounds and each action is so powerful with the ability to swing the game -- even the 'discard two cards.'

I also really enjoy that if the game goes into a second round, that round plays slightly different depending on who won favor of which columns in the first round.

Only one game in, but interesting gameplay. The core challenge of the game is constant difficult decisions - there's never really a 'chill' moment in the game. Easy enough to teach, but then as soon as you start to play the difficulty of even taking your first turn is overwhelming. Thinking it'll take some rounds to get the hand of the tactics.

This is a very solid, competitive 2-player experience. The mechanics are simple: each player has 4 actions to help them collect sets of cards, using each of their actions 1 time over their 4 turns. Two of those actions are laying out cards for the other player to choose from. Lots of mind games to be played. And maybe some card counting. High replayability, beautiful art, super cheap and fairly fast gameplay.

Two player compact card game in the style of Love Letter or R. Most of the cards in the deck are played each round, as players cycle through each of four distinct actions, playing cards on either side of Geisha cards, attempting to end up with more influence than their opponent. Clearly a game where half the fun is in the mind games present between two experienced players. Right up my alley.

10-15m, 2 players. < 5 plays.

Hanamikoji is a Battle Line-esque card game where you are competing to control 8 geisha (compared to Battle Line's 9 flags). In Battle Line, you are striving to control 5/9 flags or 3 adjacent. In Hanamikoji, you are trying to control 4 geisha or 11 value worth of geisha. In Battle Line, you will play a card and then draw a card. In Hanamikoji, you will draw a card and do one action. This is pretty much where the similarity ends. Two of the four actions revolve around a sharing mechanism. One is taking four cards and splitting them into two groups of two with your opponent choosing which set first and the other is displaying three cards and you opponent picks one to keep and you keep the two leftovers. One of the other actions is removing 2 cards from the round and the other is a secret adding of one card to your tableau at the end of the round. At the end of the round, majorities are awarded and you reshuffle the deck to play another round with majorites from the previous staying where they are, unless someone has reached the winning condition. You keep playing until someone has won.

This is a quick card game with a low rules overhead and gorgeous artwork. It plays differently than most of the card games where you're fighting over various areas simultaneously. It will take a few rounds to wrap your head around it. After a few games, I can say that I wasn't overly impressed with it. It felt very restrained compared to other games of it's ilk. There are many other 2-player only games I would prefer to play (including Battle Line and Throne and the Grail). There are many people who like this one a lot. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt.

I was recently a part of the Quick Simple Fun demo team at a convention, and I can safely say this is their best game currently. Most micro games become flat and repetitive quite quickly, but after sitting through dozens of Hanamikoji plays, it never got dull.

The game reminded me of the various Magic drafts we concocted back in the day (and many of the actions in the game were akin to Magic card effects). This was a superb filler game for how little components fit into the box. Like others in the genre (Love Letter) it relied on multiple play throughs to finish a "full game", but it did so smartly.

I really have nothing bad to say about the game, other than I would not buy it after seeing it played to death, but hey, if a game takes 20+ plays to tire you out at $15, you should really pick it up.

Excellent 2P game. Much cleverer than it first appears. Only 4 actions, but very tricky to balance and time which one to use. Plus, gorgeous artwork (I have Hanamikoji).

Played again, twice. Still enjoyed it tons but lost both games (second game went to a 2nd round). Felt I was limited by unlucky card draws. Just didn't have the right cards to make useful decisions. But I also feel I'm only playing half the game. I'm seeing my cards, and the tableau, I'm not computing what the other player must have in their hand.

This is one of those great little card games. For me this takes Schotten Totten and amps up the gameplay tremendously. It is a really clever design in which each round you have to perform 4 set actions. 2 of these include offering cards to your opponent. This makes for tense and interesting decisions. The only thing keeping it from being amazing is the scoring which is a tad odd.

Elsőre egyértelműen a battle line/schotten totten jutott róla eszembe. Nagyon hasonló, kétfős viaskodás "területi" dominanciáért. A szabály alapján úgy éreztem, hogy uncsi, egysíkú játék lesz, de nagyon nem az. Az a tény, hogy garantáltan szinte semmit nem tudsz magadnak megszerezni, csak osztogatással, nagyon komoly feszültséget, döntéseket generál. Nagyon szoros kiélezett volt a küzdelem, ami még rátett erre egy lapáttal. A megvalósítás gyönyörű, így összességében kifejezetten ajánlott darab. Egyedül talán csak az újrajátszhatóság kérdéses. Van egy olyan érzésem, hogy 5 party után lehet, hogy már nincs sok felfedeznivaló benne,

Kennt noch jemand den genialen Wave-Song "Geisha Boys And Temple Girls" der Synhti-Funkwave-Band Heaven 17? Popper in gelben Romben-Pullundern, Waver mit schwarzen Harlekin-Schuhen und blasse Indie-Wimps in langen Trenchcoats und Fischgrätenmanteln tanzten sich damit in den 80ern eine Schneise auf dem Synthipop-Dancefloor: "We are the geisha boys / Doing it wrong again / They are the chosen ones / Doing it right / Here come the temple girls / Looking for sanctuary / Naked as advertised /For the first tie". In HANAMIKOJI werben sieben Geishas um die Gunst der zwei einzigen Spieler, indem diese wiederum den Geishas deren Lieblingsgegenstände schenken. Das sind so liebliche Dinge auf Spielkarten, die unschuldige Mädchen eben mögen: Teekannen, Lauten, Sonnenschirmchen, Flöten, Fächer, Flieder etc. Diese werden nach dem alten, historischen Prinzip "Ausspielen und Anlegen" den Geishas passend zugeordnet. Wer am Ende der Runde mehr Gegenstände auf seiner Seite der Geishas angelegt hat, geniesst die Gunst der edlen Dame. Nett finde ich, dass die Geishas angeblich in der kreuzbraven Ausgabe von Kosmos in einem Restaurant arbeiten, da das Wort hana auch ein Euphemismus für eine Prostituierte sein soll, wie mir meine japanisch sprechende Bekannte Julia W. versicherte. Anyway: wer jedenfalls vier Geishas mit seinen Geschenken nach der klassischen Mehrheitenmanier zu entzücken vermag, gewinnt das Spiel, das in anmutigem traditionellem japanischem Zeichenstil auftritt. Allerdings hat jeder für die Gunsterringung pro Runde vier Aktionen, die man auch alle vier ausführen muss. Die einzige Freiheit besteht darin, sich nur deren Reihenfolge auswählen zu dürfen, was dann in ein seidenbesticktes Zwangsjäckchen führt. HANAMIKOJI fühlt sich an wie ein viel zu kleiner Schuh in dem man sich asiatisch höflich lächelnd hinein quetscht, obwohl man beim Gehen höllische Schmerzen hat. In diesem zwanghaft formalen Sinne der Unfreiheit ist HANAMIKOJI ein zutiefst japanisches Spiel, welches das disziplinierte, selbstunterdrückte Leben im Kollektiv gut wiedergibt. HANAMKOJI ist ein schnelles Taktikspiel wie eine Zwangsmeditation. Als Unterhaltungskünstlerin ist HANAMIKOJI ein enges Höschen. Der große Japon Brand-"Überraschungshit" , als der er postuliert wurde, ist das kleine Kartenspielchen sicher nicht, aber es ist gut genug für eine schnelle, gepflegte Alternative zu zweit, bei der das Auge mitspielt. Heaven 17 nicht vergessen.

Win the game by either getting 11 points of Geisha Cards or by taking 4 Geisha Cards. Three rounds consisting of four actions: keep 1 card for scoring, remove 2 cards, opponent takes 1 card and you take 2, and make 2 pairs of cards letting your opponent choose one and you take the other. 

It's quick, simple, and makes for some interesting choices. Despite that, I wasn't in love with the game. If someone suggested it, I would play but I wouldn't seek it out.

This game is fantastic. It has the tug-of-war card play of Battle Line/Schotten-Totten but with the fascinating twist that you have to offer cards to your opponent.

Hanamikoji is a rad little tug-of-war for two. It feels like the love child of Battle Line and Canal Grande to me with it's one part I split you choose approach and it's emplaced majorities. Perhaps (and somehow) as the best of both worlds, it is quick, tense and fraught with excitement; at least as much excitement that you can garner from a 10-minute card game! 

That said, the design feels a little clunky (but very intuitive once you've gone through your four options), but nonetheless very effective. Great aesthetics really give this the gloss it needs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Hanamikoji manages to boil down the Quarto challenge with the limited moves of King of Siam, and end up with a quick, attractive 2-player micro cardgame.

Build majorities one of two ways by obtaining the loyalty of important geisha, but to play more than one card your opponent gets a choice as well.

It's a brilliant little deal-building stroke in a head to head game.

I really like this game. In fact, the more I play it, the more I'm growing to love it. It's a game of adapting and playing mind games.

Has a similar feel to Lost Cities/Battle Line where you are placing cards into different columns hoping to win them by having majorities. What makes it different (other than the pretty art) is each round is four turns. Half of those turns will be you pick 3 or 4 cards from your small hand and your opponent gets to claim one (or two) cards for their own. There is a strong luck factor in drawing cards, (your last action will use whatever you draw from the deck) but it feels fine in this short game.

Very tight tug-of-war type of game. It is designed in such a way that the points are always very close with both players almost sealing the game. One have to just slightly outsmart his/her opponent to win the game by a slight edge. Very nice and would want to play this again in the future.

An elegant two player, "I cut, you choose" game, somewhat evocative of Battleline.  

Simple to teach, yet quickly engrosses you into deliciously tough choices.  For those that enjoy quick but deep games that offers strategic planning, putting yourself in the other player's shoes, and resource / troop deployment, with a hint of bluffing.

I also enjoy the pure strategy 10-card variant (deal all 10 cards to each player at the beginning), which I learned accidentally when we were taught the game incorrectly during a demo.  Lots of Analysis Paralysis (AP).  But Delicious AP.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2017)

Hanamikoji has been getting a lot of buzz lately. As I was expecting a light game I wasn’t too keen on playing it, but the game surprised me and I really liked it!

Hanamikoji´s rules are very easy to each, you can do it under 3 minutes. Playtime varies between 7 and 15 minutes.

The theme is ok, but you don’t feel it through the game. It is pasted on.

The art is very good, the game´s components are ok.

Hanamikoji comes with cards of 2 sizes. Regular cards and Dixit sized cards and that’s a minor issue for me because I cannot carry the game on a deck box, a very minor issue, but an issue nonetheless.

It´s true Hanamikoji is light, but it has teeth. You only make 4 decisions per round, but choosing what to do isn’t obvious nor easy and there is a lot of tension. The tension comes from which cards to give to your opponent while trying to outguess him. Hanamikoji can end in only one round, the idea is to gain 4 Geishas or at least 11 points. It only comes with 21 cards.

There is luck with the game but I’m still undecided if it is a lot or a little bit. I’m leaning toward low luck. I feel you can control it most of the time with clever play, besides, as the game plays so fast, I don’t mind much about the luck.

It is reminiscent of Schotten Totten (Battle Line).

Bottom line, Hanamikiji surprised us. It is a light family game, but it is my kind of family game :D. It has a lot of depth for such a quick game. For now, my desire to play it again remains high but I´m not sure if it has the legs to keep us interested. We will see. Good game, a borderline 7.0 to me.

RATING: 8.5
- I like this little 2p game a lot.
- It's very light in terms of rules, cards and components but there's a lot of game here, with very little randomness.
- It really feels like you're playing the other player, rather than the game. 7W Duel for example, could be played solo (not that I'm suggesting it should). This game could not at all be played solo.
- You're trying to out-think your opponent so that their moves are sub-optimal, enabling you to either win (if they're not that good a player), or set up for the win in a later round. 
- I think the "I split, you choose" mechanism is great. It makes for interesting decisions, that are sometimes more about benefiting your opponent the least, than benefiting you the most. 
- Some people may find this game a bit luke-warm at best, because of the above, but I think this is a great, quick little game for playing with people that you know well.

2017-06-16 - This is a pretty good, two player tug of war game. The rules are simple, and it plays quickly. I'm hoping that some more strategy will emerge with more plays (I've only played once so far). Right now, some of the choices, while difficult, are also maybe a little arbitrary feeling.

Our games had gone so quick, I kept looking back at the rules to see if we'd missed something. Seven geishas are lined up and players draw six cards to start. On a turn, players draw a card and then pick one of four actions - save a card, remove two cards, offer 3 and take two, offer two pairs and take one. Cards are specific to a geisha and cards taken are played to the appropriate geisha. When both players have taken their 4 actions, scoring occurs. More cards on a side gives the geisha to that player. First player to win 4 geishas or get 11 charm points (geishas are worth 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5) wins the game. 

Because there are so few cards, geishas are claimed quickly. Seems like it is uncommon for a game to go past 2 rounds. For me, it is too quick. With half of the geishas claimed in the 2nd round, many item cards become useless and the person who draws fewer of those is in a much better position. That's my take, anyway, and it is disappointing in a game that is otherwise well put together. The decisions are interesting, but the whole game is too quick for me to get much invested.

A lot of game in a little package. I haven't played another game that is so easy to learn and so difficult to win. It is a tense and somewhat quirky play that requires considerable inferential skill.

A clever quick two-player game that shares some similarities with Battle Line.  The major difference is you cannot simply play your cards.  During the course of the game, you must execute four different actions; two of which give your opponent cards from your hand.  There is hidden information, so you are never really certain who is in control of which geisha girl.  Great tension, lots to think about with only four actions during the entire game.  Now that's elegance.

Believe the niche hype on this one. It's a good alternative to other two-player tug-of-war games like [gameid=372]. The focus is on bluffing and tactically outsmarting the opponent with a well-implemented cake-split mechanism. The artwork is outstanding and helps to distinguish Hanamikoji from the flood of available small two-player card games.

RATING: 9
Games which boast that you can explain them in 3 minutes are usually not my forte, but this one is AWESOME, and that all starts with those 4 actions. There are many layers of strategy to dig through through that choice, in how they affect not only the majorities, but also your hand size, and how limited the information you have is early on. Of course, you'd want to do all 4 after you see what your opponent does and what you'll draw, but that's not how it works. I love this game.

I enjoy playing Hanamikoji. It becomes more and more challenging as one plays with the same person again and again as I've done with Peter Schell, a GameMaster.  I wish the total focus were on the Geisha so that the "winner" would have to have the minimum of 4 Geisha. I do NOT appreciate the points rule which means that IF a player gets the 5 and 4 = 9, that player needs ONLY 1 MORE GEISHA.  So, the player wins with 3 Geisha. This, of course, creates the game strategy for players to want to get both 5 and 4! One game at a time!

This is a nice two-player card game.  The art is great and the gameplay is smooth and easy.  Each player gets to take the same (4) actions each round but in whichever order they prefer.  It leads to some difficult choices as to what cards to hang on to, what to discard and what to give your opponent.  The game has a small footprint on the table and plays fast.  It kind of feels similar to Lost Cities but the gameplay it different enough.  We all enjoy this one.

It's a common pastime, scrounging around for accessories to present to ladies of unclear repute, while a rival is doing the exact same thing, and you're tossing things back and forth and hiding them behind the sofa. So it is in this tug-of-war card game where you secure majorities using I-divide-you-choose, hidden information, and the occasional lucky draw. It's not bad, but there is not much room to manoeuvre, and it's somewhat elusive just what wins or loses you a game. It is true, yellow is the cutest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A 2-player tug-of-war card game. In each of 4 rounds, a player must play their cards in 1 of 4 different ways. In only one of them is the play (of a single card) directly into their own game. Each player starts with 6 cards and draws 4 more over the course of the round. They offer their opponent a choice of 3 out of 7 of these 10 cards as “I cut, you choose” after assessing which cards to offer up to their opponent to give them the least advantage. 

With its limited, anxious and interesting choices, this simple and elegant game is quite dizzyingly thinky – and can easily lead to agonised analysis paralysis in which the player thinks round and round in circles and inspects the insufficient information they have from every possible angle again and again.

The first round seems to be the key to the game. If you can win over a good proportion of the mini-battles in that round, your opponent will be hard pressed to gain them back again. This makes the draw of the cards in the subsequent rounds quite influential in the outcome. The potential rapidity of the game, however, means that good players will tend to win over the course of several games.

The cards are illustrated in a pleasing oriental style and are made of substantial cardstock.

The rules are clear, elegant and easy to teach.

[PNP] The ebb and flow of this game is amazing. You have 4 actions but the order you use them is so important. Do you go for small actions first and maintain more cards in your hand so you can respond to your opponent. Or do you force a split that benefits you either way. Game is full of tactile decisions and I love it. It is also very quick since most games take 2 rounds max most of the time. Also, the artwork is gorgeous which is a big plus. A beautiful 2 player game.

First game took 4 rounds.
The missing card is pretty important.

I think the 2'a are more important because you can score them from a previous round.

I wonder how high luck level is in this game.
There are obvious neutralizing action in each round that can be taken.
The round i picked a non neutralizing action handing my opponent 3 and myself 2 points I won the game.

Edit
Having played it a couple of times. The total of 7 hidden cards (1/3) (one not taking part all together) is probably a little too much for me.
If the final action of my opponent is splitting the fours it means that  before that I didn't know about 8 cards. in my previous action.
And so luck of the draw becomes a bigger factor than I want it to be.
In order to keep that action so long away you need to have a good hand. 

The math behind the game is simple but it works.
the high rating of 7 is because of the agonizing decisions in this small game.
the artwork and the ease of the rules is a big plus.

I also like the end scroing trigger.

total 11 points out of 21 or score 4 geishas. In case both players trigger end game conditions total points wins.

If I lose or win 7 games in a row I will rewrite my comment.
At the moment I am 3-0. I was very lucky in the first round of my second game.

Like a Cirque du Soleil tightrope act, Hanamikoji elevates the tension-filled balance of the game's core, reminiscent of Battle Line/Schotten Totten, with the addition of hidden information and pick-and-choose elements into a spectacle memorable for its elegant mechanics and beautiful artwork. Such a cleverly focused game of attempting to constrain your opponent while they do the same to you with just four simple actions. Impressive, masterful design.

I am really worried about replayability, but this game is really clever despite its very simple rule set. It has a Lost Cities vibe to it in that regard along with both requiring to manage your hand carefully lest you help your opponent more than you help yourself. While in a longer game the ability to hurt yourself would be a detriment, here I don't mind, and it allows for the interaction to be upped. Some things I like more than Lost Cities is the tug of war for the favor tokens requires you to always pay attention to your opponent (whereas sometimes if you have a great hand in Lost Cities you can just autopilot play it for a few turns), and that the different actions makes each turn feel more asymmetric. It does come at the price of being a bit less intuitive however.

EDIT: Has reached the point I don't want to play it every week, but it already has 26 plays, and whenever I play with someone who the game clicks with it is a new exciting experience as different play styles helps keep the game fresh. I also have realized identical actions and cards can have really different ramifications depending on which actions have already been played, and what info is known, and so this game is deeper than I initially thought. Hence the boost to a 7 rating.

The graphics are actually nice to look at, with the beautiful choice of colors.  The mechanism of the game is original, and requires some mental adjustment.  Luck and skill blend together, and the game is just the right length -- you finish and feel like you are ready to play again or one more round, because you enjoyed the ride.  Currently one of my favorite 2 player card games.

What a brilliant little game. It punches above its footprint, and it looks great while doing it. There are shades of Lost Cities, Battle Lines, and Haggis here, but it's also its own thing -- and I love that thing. It's turn angst given form.

Virtually every turn features an agonizing choice, with just a dash of chance (What's in the kitty? Will I get Card X, or will my opponent?), plus ample room for bold moves -- bluffing with a secret card, hiding valuable cards, gambling on a future draw, etc.

Difficult choices in games are the best. And in this one, even if you gamble poorly, or blunder, or have a dead turn or two, the whole game only takes 10-15 minutes. It's the kind of game I can teach in 3-5 minutes, which clicks after just one play, and which should be easy to get to the table.

I also love its elegance. It's mathematically guaranteed that you can take any available action on any turn (provided you remember to draw a card!). And those actions! I inevitably want to do them twice, or skip a certain one, based on game conditions -- but I can't! It's delightful.

1st impression: shittier but prettier Battle Line/Schotten Totten. That's not a big knock though, because Battle Line/Schotten Totten is a Mount Olympus game. Hanamikoji is a short, good, light game that just happens to stand deeply in the shadow of an all time great. Unless I discover I'm wrong in the next few plays, I won't likely play it much after. My first reaction to the suggestion will always be "Why don't we just play Battle Line instead?"

I would love to have a couple of more different action tiles as some of them are a bit boring.

It feels a bit scripted that you leave the card-selecting decitions until the end as it would give more information to the opponent when you pick that action.

This might be my most played game on here just from sheer practicality. My fiance and I play this when we're waiting at a restaurant for our food. The game itself has some beautiful components, it's a game of imperfect knowledge and bluffing, and can be played in its entirety before the waitress comes back with the appetizers. I love this game. Not my favorite, but it could be.

It's crazy simple but crazy hard. I haven't found a way to balance the sheer luck with the limited choices. There is so much unknown which is great but then you can only keep such a limited number of cards.. SO HARD

Battle Line utánérzésem volt tőle. Olyan, mint Knizia játéka, csak mintha egy másik variánssal játszanánk.

Ötletes a mechanizmus, viszont kevésnek érzem a játékot, még úgy is, hogy egyébként meg gyönyörű az artwork.

A komponensek egyébként nem hogy szépek, de minőségileg is teljesen megfelelnek, főleg a hét gésa táblán csodálkoztam, hogy nem kártyával oldották meg, hanem rendes kartonlapokra vannak kasírozva azok is.

Ha a két nagyon hasonló kártyajáték közül kellene választanom, akkor a Battle Line nyerne. Jobban kiszámítható, kontrollálható és elegánsabb darab, annak ellenére, hogy ennek az öregapja lehetne...

RATING: 6
Delightful at first. Pretty art and the game play is really nice, too. Similar to Battle Line, a little, but much more minimalistic. In each round, just four actions, and playing those the best way possible is quite tricky.

In the end, a bit light and boring, I guess.

Indifferent.

Hanamikoji ist ein tolles 2-Personen Spiel mit einer wunderschönen Optik. Es ist war lange Zeit schwer zu bekommen, aber nun hat Kosmos die Lizenz und bringt es voraussichtlich Ende August in den Einzelhandel. Eine gute Entscheidung, denn Hanamikoji ist wirklich ein ganz bezauberndes Spiel. Die Spieler müssen versuchen die Gunst von Geishas zu erlangen. Wer die Gunst von 4 der 7 Geishas erlangt, hat das Spiel gewonnen. Um die Gunst der Geishas zu erlangen, müssen die passenden Gegenstände (Karte) zu den entsprechenden Geishas gelegt werden.  Insgesamt gibt es 4 Aktionen, die allesamt in einer Runde genutzt werden müssen. Nur die Reihenfolge ist egal. Mal entfernt man Karten ganz aus dem Spiel, mal legt man eine Karte verdeckt und mal muss man dem Gegner eine Auswahl an Karten anbieten, wobei er dann entscheidet, was mit den Karten passiert. Hanamikoji ist ein großes Stück Deduktion, Planen, Taktieren und den Gegner durchschauen. Es braucht 1-2 Runden, bis man das Spil erfasst hat, doch dann passt es auch. Die Regeln sind einfach zu erlernen, die Spieldauer kurz und der Wiederspielwert extrem hoch. Kaufen!

Well, I don't know if this game is super brilliant or just a bunch of randomness.  But I just won 2 out of 3 games, and the 3rd game just seemed epic (3 rounds - very tense).  The actions / decisions seem simple enough at first blush, but sometimes they are just so difficult.  It is probably me just overthinking the situation.  Definitely an interesting little 2 player game.

RATING: 6
Solid 2p game that feels like a cross between Love Letter and Battle Line. I really like the balance between executing each of your four actions once and playing the odds on what comes out of the deck. The Geisha theme is a little quirky, but it's a Japanese game, so it's understandable, I guess. 

My one major complaint with the game is that it can sometimes run a little long, especially if both players are playing super optimally. At that point, the game does come down to luck of the draw a bit. Still, it combines a lot of familiar aspects in an original way, and I think it will stick around as a standout 2p game in my collection.

Fun and quick two player card game.  It gives me a similar feeling of other tug of war, card majority games I enjoy like Choson and Daxu.  The card art is excellent and looks good on the table.  What ended up burning me out on it was the game was stressful with choices I never wanted to make.  Sold on the BGG Marketplace.

Really fun two-player game.  The theme doesn't really matter, but the artwork and component quality help boost the aesthetics of the game.  The action tiles give you a lot to think about in terms of what you are willing to give to your opponent and how you are going to create choices that help swing the game in your favor. Luck mitigation is relatively high in this game, but there is still the possibility of being hosed by the deck.  It also seems that turn order can give one opponent an unfair advantage over the other.

I had heard rumblings of how good this game was, so perhaps going in I was expecting more, but was slightly disappointed. I enjoyed my plays of it. I can see why people do like it a lot, but again if I'm going to play a micro game then something like Eminent Domain Microcosm offers better choices.

Basically Battle Line-lite, with some elements stripped out (e.g. spatial maneuvering, set collection) and a pile-split mechanic thrown in. I like it a lot, but since Battle Line is already quite short, and probably slightly deeper, I'm not sure why I wouldn't just play that.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a mind bending card game, you are forced to really think through how you are going to use your actions each round. The problem is you don't know which cards you will draw as the round unfolds which makes this simple game very punishing. I felt like I continually chose the right action at the wrong time which forced me to rethink my strategy from turn to turn. The amount of depth packed into Hanamikoji is surprising and impressive. 

The design is very elegant too, it doesn't have the rough edges of Capital Lux which in many ways felt like it offered a very similar play experience. The tension caused by only having four actions of which you can only use each one once during a round is the catalyst for a lot of agonizing and less than optimal decisions. Interaction is high because two of the actions involve an I pick "x" cards and your opponent then chooses which card(s) they want first. The thinking required for this game is a great mental exercise for kids as well, this is not a straightforward game, you need to be able to bluff and change plans quickly. Hanamikoji has jumped back onto my wishlist.[/i]

Definitely would be considered a filler based on play time however the game has a lot of depth for the mount of time you play. It has a familiar mechanic where you play cards on one side of a card while your opponent plays on the other side and the player with the most cards on one side wins. However you get four specific actions that let you play cards to the table and there is a surprising amount of thought that can go into it. The card design is also really nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Outstanding 2 player card game that borrows a bit from the Battle Line/Lost Cities family of games.  The difference is how cards are put into play as some of the actions force you to give your opponent first choice on groups of cards from your own hand.  It can be a very quick game so multiple games in one session is very possible.  Scoring is simple with very little math involved so I suppose "elegant" is an appropriate term.  With a 21 card deck, I wonder about the replay value down the road.  But since reading your opponent is so crucial, it may be a non issue as players may be constantly adjusting and changing their approach.  Debatable if it  as good as Schotten Totten/Battle Line, but it may very well be.

This game is so intense! If you think about it you really only can count on scoring only 1 card in your hand. Then you have to find a way to trick your opponent on taking the cards you don't want. Love the fact you have real tuff choices to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun ... and unique... and weird... because this game requires you to offer most of the cards that you want to keep - to your opponent - but to do so in ways that will cause them to let you keep those cards and hence achieve your strategy, all the while trying to foresee what they are trying to get you to do. It's a study in "not-logic" and hence is a bit like trying to draw something by viewing it upside-down & backward in a mirror. I like the way it makes me think differently about challenges and strategy.

So Excited for this one! One of the prettiest games I have seen and played. Simple 2 player game with a tug of war approach. This is different than  your average "Battle Line" but it is similar in that you are working to win the influence of the ladies in the middle. This game offers a single card never to be seen and for players to ditch cards along the way. Very interesting offering and grouping of the cards to hopefully get what you want. You really have to know the other player and deduct what they might be doing. Fast and excellent. Top notch game, I am not surprised that it sold out for pre orders.

Egy taktikus kétszemélyes játék, melyben úgy lehet elnyerni a gésák kegyét, ha minél több ajándékot adsz nekik. Persze arra nincs lehetőség, hogy mindegyiknél te legyél a nyerő. Illetve ami igazi csavart ad a játékba, hogy mindig osztozni kell kártyáidon a játékostárssal. Ráadásul először mindig ő választ.

Beautiful artwork, good pieces, fast play and excellent gameplay cadence. This should be in every 2p collection out there.

I almost started by saying "A beautiful game" but, while it is beautiful in many ways, I'm not sure the same is true for the underlying game.

There are only six decisions to make during the game, but I still feel lost playing this. The strategy is opaque to me. The only time I know I'm making a move that helps me is a cheap one like presenting three of the same card. The rest of the time is "well I guess this is the best I can do".

I definitely need to sit down and play this several times until the strategies become more clear. But until then the learning curve seems too steep and the skill ceiling too low.

Battle Line egyszerűbb változatban. Ebben a játékban gésák kegyét kell elnyernünk. A Battle Line-hoz képest különbség, hogy az elnyerendő gésák különböző értékűek, így célunk vagy négy vagy 11 értékű gésa elhódítása. Különbség még, hogy itt nem kell póker figurákat kirakni az elnyerésért, csak simán adott számú lapot lerakni a saját oldalunkra. 1 kör alatt 4 akciónk van, ezt teszi érdekesség a játékot. Egy lapot eltehetünk a játék végére, két lapot kidobhatunk, 3 lapból egyet, illetve 2-2 lapból kettőt ajánlunk fel ellenfelünknek először, majd a többit magunkhoz rakjuk. A játék, több körös, ha nem dől el egy kör alatt. Gyanús, hogy max két kör alatt véget ér, mert a második körben, az első körben elnyert gésákhoz már elég döntetlen, hogy újra minket válasszanak. A játék gyors, de van min gondolkodni, korántsem olyan mély, mint a BL. Nagyon szépek a gésák, a kártyák már nem annyira kidolgozottak. Nem rossz, de csak ha időhiány van választanám ezt a BL helyett.

This is a clever and fun little game. Pretty straight forward, easy to teach and play. Plays very quick; although despite its simplicity those prone to AP can get caught up. Deduction is the main mechanic and players can indeed make a bad move if they have miscalculated. Other reviewers have correctly described this game as 'tense' and I wholeheartedly agree with this. Lovely art direction and high quality print stock.

This is a simple 2-player game, along the lines of Battle Line. It's kinda neat how you have to use all of your various powers throughout the hand, and there is definitely some bluffing and misdirection that occurs over time.

Appears simple because it's easy to teach but actually very complex and borderline anxiety-inducing when you have to make tough decisions. Still a lot of flipping fun. Highly recommended, art is beautiful.

I have tried the Chinese version.  The Chinese rulebook is poorly written in clarity and elegancy.

The game itself is good similar to Battleline, Balloon Cups and Lost Cities.  Heavy interaction and competitiveness.  Meaningful decision and the luck of draw isn't strong - except the discarded card in the preparation.  However, the game feels slower than the aforementioned games.

If I haven't other similar games, I would have bought this.

The illustration is way too busy for my taste.  Hope I can have a version with Star Wars theme instead.

Such deep strategy from such a little game! The theme is a little tacked-on, but I am a sucker for gorgeous artwork and a Japanese setting, so this ticks all my boxes. An amazing two-player game that will keep you on your toes trying to anticipate your opponent's moves while trying to bluff/not telegraph your own. The player move system is ingenious. A deeply satisfying game.

Plays are based on a best of 3 rule me and the Wife decided. Pretty fun and quick card game,lots of decisions and trickery in just 4 actions per player. Components are nice and big but do take up space that it’s hard to bring on a flight. I would want to do some mod pieces and make a more portable version.

tl;dr: solid 2 player game

This game is a bit similar to games like [thing=372][/thing]. Players want a majority control over an odd row of cards. The big twist here is how you play these cards. There are 4 actions, all of which each player has to perform once in the game. This creates a very tight space to make your moves in, and it is VERY tricky. And a round only takes 5 minutes!
Very good 2 player game indeed. If only I played 2 player more often, I would get a copy.

Kellemes élmény volt játszani. Mivel az egy forduló alatt lerakott 5 kártya közül csak az egyiket fogom magam elé letenni, a többi 4 esetében pedig a kártyáimat előbb fel kell ajánlanom az ellenfelemnek, nagyon jól meg kell gondolni, hogy mit hova teszek le.

I've played it twice, and really enjoyed it both times.  Easy to set up and play!  I love the way you only have four actions, but can do them in any order.  It really shakes the game up...a lot to consider since your actions involve the other player.  Nice and short too!

I enjoy this game quite a bit. Very easy to pick up. The depth of the game is about anticipating what your opponent chooses. A unique element in this game is if the total score of a player has not reached 11, the game is played again and the card dominance is up for grabs until one of the players gets 11 or more. Very simple game and done in an elegant way. As a plus, the graphic is pretty!

Try to win the favor of seven Geisha by playing matching cards. The trick, pun intended, you only have control over three cards and two of them will not be played.

The artwork on these cards alone is enough to get this on the table regularly.  It just sets up a relaxing environment that belies the game that is about to follow.

It is a devilishly intense card game that plays quickly, unless you are prone to analysis paralysis.  What card do I play, which two do I eliminate and if I only knew which card was out of play for the round.  A lot of game in a tiny box.

The aesthetics create a flowery doom as you realize you have to sacrifice yourself to get a geisha's attention.

Lovely pay of cards into cut-the-pie sets that works beautifully. Fast & much crunchier than I thought, surprise in the denouement. Lovely too the way the first round geisha influence stays in place in the regathering of the cards informs the second round. 

It produces a lot of humor too. Squirming, bluff. A great morning coffee or date game, good for the pub. First few plays and I'm uncertain the four actions fall into a preferred order (i.e.: withhold more information vs pushing for information with proffers), so I think it'll remain pleasantly open & contingent.

There is a lot of game in this incredibly short two player game with endearing artwork. With gameplay that consists mainly of guessing and bluffing, every action you perform is meaningful and full of suspense. Most micro games do not keep me interested for more than a couple of plays, but this one just might.

RATING: 7
Hanamikoji's design is clearly inspired by Knizia's Schotten-totten/battle line and later on,  Los Banditos. However, by introducing a few card selection mechanisms, the designer has introduced a new twist to an older genre, making it fresh enough to exist alongside the classics.

Hanamikoji's short game play coupled with deep, meaningful decision-making is a delight. In fact, some may argue that the game play may actually be too short to form any resemblance of a strategy. Most of the time, there is just enough partial information in your own hand of cards to make a decent tactical play.  On the flip side, the card draw each round introduces enough uncertainty to make certain decisions boil down to a coin toss. This can ultimately prove annoying in the long run....... if the game lasted for an hour or two. Since each round last for 10-15 minutes, you probably won't here a lot of quibbles about a grand strategy for the game.

Overall, the game is an elegant exercise of subtle deception coupled with educated guesses gleaned from partial information at hand. If I have 30 min, Schotten-totten would be a much better choice, but on the other hand, if I want to play a 10 min brain burner, Hanamikoji fits the bill perfectly.

I really love the mechanics of this small excellent game. The way you are limited to just four actions, and often you feel that you are helping your opponent more than your self by using them, makes this a mind-boggling and very enjoyable two-player experience. As an extra bonus: the artwork is stunningly good ... I only wish quality of the cards would have been a little better to match the rest of the game.

RATING: 7
This is a fairly quick micro game in the vein of "Love Letter", although it has quite a few more cards than that title. Players are dealt a hand of cards with which to influence a center row of geisha cards. The trick is that the cards are not directly played onto the appropriate geisha. Instead, each player has four actions...half of which create some sort of drafting mechanic, while others let you stash cards or remove them from the round entirely.

Once all the actions have resolved, players score the geisha cards based on area majority. Whoever has the most cards deployed on each geisha wins her influence. If at the end of any round a player has won the support of four geisha, they win. Alternatively, if a player controls 11 influence points worth of Geisha, they also win. (A geisha's influence is equal to the amount of her cards that are in the deck. So a 5 point geisha is harder to gain control of than a three point geisha, since there are usually more of her cards in play.

Love Letter is still the gold standard for micro-gaming bang for your buck, but honestly it's not that great with two players. Hanamikoji replaces it nicely in that regard. In fact, I think the decision making and "battle of wits" type stuff may even be a little better than what you get from Love Letter.

After ten plays I think I'm done with this game. It's easy to teach, cheap and very pretty, but the decisions are limited and quickly become repetitive. It's brain-burning, but not in a pleasant way - I feel like I'm constantly playing against myself, not against my opponent. Every decision I make is either "bad" or "worse" and such thought process is just not fun for me. I'm sure many people will enjoy this game though.

Hanamikoji lived up to my fairly high expectations, as I found it to be an exceedingly smart little two-player card game. The rules are quite simple, but the game can still make for some agonizing decisions despite this simplicity. I really enjoy these types of head-to-head tug-of-war games where you try to get into your opponent’s head, so Hanamikoji was right up my alley. And the artwork is simply gorgeous. I’m so glad I picked it up.

Like Battle Line but quicker and with only 4 actions each that are indirect special powers rather than being able to choose the cards you want directly. The continuation rounds after you draw in the first round cause some very very interesting things to happen. Tactically genius design.

Wow, just wow. At first the gorgeous card art, the pie-splitting mechanism, and Schotten-Totten-like structure with multiple rounds attracted me to the game. The gameplay is top notch! This is definitely my style of game. I love anxiety, and the need to read your opponent.

Perhaps the coolest bit is that you're restricted to only four actions per turn, and can only perform each one once. This may give the second player an advantage, but I'm not certain that's the case yet.

This may end up a perfect 10, but we'll see.

RATING: 7
A solid, unique 2 player card game.  At first blush its a bit like Battle Line in that you are trying to control a number of cards in the central line, but the way you play your cards to gain those control points is very different. You get four chances to play cards in four different ways.  One lets you play a single face down card, the next lets you bury a pair of cards, the other two let you place out more cards you would like to play, but your opponent gets first choice leaving you the left overs a la Piece O Cake.  None of the options seem great early and you certainly don't want to wait until too late to do something and you're stuck feeling like you're short of information the whole time... in a very good way that makes it feel like there is a lot of deep thought and risk taking for such a quick, relatively simple game.  Certainly worth a try for anyone who likes quick but thinky two player card games.

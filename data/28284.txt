RANK: 3022
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simply a blast!

Excelllent design and graphics & high production (maps, counters, play aids). 

The 1940 Campaign of France derserved such a diamond.

A must have for LnL fans and beginners to this system (tactical scale, 50 meters/hex); 

Top notch quality at an affordable price.

IN my opinion is the most complete module of LnL. A bit tricky at first given the thick special module rules but overall the game delivers a wonderful experience due to the variety of units and weapons. A must to have for the LnL fans.

Perhaps the best Lock ‘n Load module ever. The production values are outstanding. Features the typically gorgeous art that LnL is famous for. The scenario card layout is the best that I have seen in any tactical game. Much better than previous versions of LnL scenario cards.

I have read that some folks have found a strange cut on the three 5/8” counters on sheet one between the tanks and support weapons. Mine are fine, and even those complaining admit that nothing is cut from the counters, but rather they aren’t exactly square.

The scenarios are varied, and look extremely interesting. Each appears to have a hook (I’ve only played two, which appears to be about two more than other folks rating the game). I particularly enjoyed Battle for the Isthmus, in which the Germans have a chance to send a flanking force off the map, onto a sub-map (hex locations connected by lines) designed especially for the scenario. The flanking force must move through this sub-map, fight ambushes, and then re-enter the map in the rear of the French forces.

Solid design, exceptional scenarios, and some new skill cards. High-quality through and through.

RATING: 8.5
Another beautiful game by LnL. I cannot yet complete a full evaluation of the game as I have not had a chance to play the scenarios.  But I can comment on many other aspects:

Rules - 8;  The LnL rules system is what I like in squad level tactical game.  The rules are fast and the interactive/competitive dice rolling helps keep both players involved regardless of whose impulse it is.  Some of the rules regarding leaders and anti-armor weapon were vague to me. More importantly, what I like about these rules is that they are not bogged down in tedious minutae that other squad level games suffer.  The rules also, allow a player to try different scenarios to learn different rules aspects before tackling larger scenarios. Also, the mechanic effectively replicate challenges of firefights, but are abstract enough to actually allow you to fight a battle in near real time once you get the mechanics down.

Artwork - 9.5.  Again LnL makes quality game art a hallmark.  The boards are beautiful.  The counters are also gorgeous and clear in their information and artwork.  The most impressive aspect is the artwork and quality of their scenario cards; unmatched in my opinion.  The only drawback is the inclusion of overlays/ a necessary evil to keep map boards varied.   

Scenarios - 8 I have played Bloody Valley and Phoney War.  Both were extremely exciting and tense.  The Germans one both, but they seemed well balanced and can be replayed based on some of the randomness associated with reinforcements, special rules, and  set up options.

Playability - 9  past LnL game system experience are Fast paced mechanics, and clear player's aid cards.

Educational - 6.  WWII squad level combat; it increased my appreciation for the ealry war, but I can;t say it added any additional appreciation that I had not already gained in other games and systems.

Solitaire - 7  the variable special rules, reinforcement arrivals, and surprise events help provide some "fog of war" to the solataire player.

In 35 years as a wargamer I've never seen a better looking game, in terms of components. Gorgeous. Especially the counters and the scenario cards. Top notch. And if that wasn't enough, the scenarios are terrific: great events, in those that have events, and down-to-the-wire in almost all of them. Lots of variability; high replay value. It's obvious that the game designers really cared about this project. Now if LnL would only do North Africa!!

I'm surprised how little love this game gets on BGG.  The components are first-rate and among the best I've ever seen even among other LnL products.

Awesome scenarios that reveal a lot about a campaign that's often covered with, at best, a broad brush and usually as a punchline. I've played a lot of LnL, and these are the best scenarios of the bunch; they always come down to the wire and have great twists and events. And the game components are gorgeous.

Bought it because I wanted something simpler than ASL, with a bit more control than Combat Commander.  The 1940 French blitzkrieg campaign interested me greatly.  Took a while for me to digest the rules, but finally decided to just jump in and just learn as I go.  I'm glad I did.  Map is dark, but a floor lamp fixed that.  The rest of the production and visuals are gorgeous!

RATING: 8
Very good looking, high quality components. Well balanced scenarios. Thrilling situations and tight endings. Rules could be a bit more precise sometimes without loosing simplicity. After all the player must decide what to do when it is not stated in the rules or ask other players, wasting time, to determine a solution that could be solved with just a little more of detail. Very funny anyway and highly recommendable.

A lot of problems leaving me wondering about the playtesting. Scenario was broken. Had Germans listed as setting up second yet stated French were first but moved on to the board from off map.... and gave them foxholes etc (?!? what do they carry the foxholes with them??). How about that 1 speed AT gun wasting the whole game trying to get into range. Obviously this setup was botched in how they wrote it. If played as written of course the Germans got to drive a lot of their forces off the map to gain victory conditions before the French could get on the map. Did anyone playtest this? What is a "Petard"? Panhard? Full sheet scenario setups have plenty of wasted space, how about a picture of the counter by the listing to make things faster to set up?

How about shocked troops, they have no defense listed so if assaulted how do they defend? In hex assault is an odds ratio so 2 attacker to 0 is a bit difficult to render as a ratio. Missed something in the rules maybe? I find the rulebook a bit padded to find information fast, and those ^%$#@ watermarks!

I had some fun with a "Hero" running around destroying tanks and fending off 20+ attackers.... then there was the very effective French cavalry able to charge in to destroy MKIV tanks, wait until the tanks have fired/moved then pounce! Yes, the game could use some sort of fire lane rule. I kind of look forward for a Polish campaign scenario so I can defeat the Blitzkrieg with the mighty hordes of Polish cavalry :-)

Other than the scenario specific rule that the French reinforcements had to roll individually to enter the map (unorganized response) I didn't really see anything that made them any worse than the Germans. the French infantry is actually more powerful and by the end of the scenario the French wiped the Germans out by a large margin.

The small maps are interesting. They have great art but are very dark. An example of looking good to the artist on a computer monitor which is of course backlit?
Another nit but not a big thing, if they had planned properly and made the mapsheets a few mm's shorter they would have fit in the box unfolded leaving room for a counter tray. Communication problems with China?

Some of the best graphics I have seen this year. But the counters are too thin.  Very fast to play, which is excellent. The subject matter is one of my favorites, too. But the realism of the whole system leaves a bit to be desired, especially the AFV (including the completely ahistorical/unrealistic infantry-carrying rules), and Machine-Gun/support weapon depictions.  I still prefer Combat Commander for now. I'll probably revisit again the House rules I did for this system a few years ago when I have some more time to correct some of the stuff I don't agree with (the game's rule are very well written and are easy to modifiy).  If you are looking for a fun and simple game, you cannot go wrong buying this product! Sadly my own copy had very thin, misaligned counters. I expeceted more, even from a "Made in China" game. Counter quality always seem to be the "weak point" in non-Euro wargames. At least now the French Army, 1940, get decent treatment.

Ah yes ---> The maps are REALLY MUCH TOO DARK!  :-(

Super-basic rules suggestion; Don't allow AFV's to carry any troops at all in battle (but for halftracks), or give them any "protection" bonus when riding an AFV; this is completely fallacious.

Great game added to a great system.  The maps are gorgeous, and the counters are terrific.  Full color with the different uniforms being represented and the tanks on LARGE counters in full color and very detailed.  The scenarios are very good, and the scenario mentioned below is fixed on the forums on the company website.

The fact that there arent a whole lot of games covering the French campaign makes this a welcome addition for WW2 fans.

Excellent game in the LnL series.  The components are fantastic and the scenarios are varied.  LnL is accessible, fun, and pretty to look at.  I still have a soft-spot for ATS but that game is a complex beast and it will require a lot of effort to get back into the system.

My one gripe with LnL is the rulebook.  The combat procedures are buried in text and should be bulleted for easy reference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just astonishing: the maps are superb, the counter art is sharp and full of character. the scenarios are well thought out and challenge the popular notion that the French were clueless (Avalanche Press' recent Panzer Grenadier set '1940: Fall of France' similarly reserects the reputation of the French army).

Of particular interest are PzKpfw IIIEs and a 'Bufla' SdKfz 8 armed with an 88mm gun. French elite troops and Belgian chasseurs challnge German domination of the battlefield. All the player aids are top notch.

fall on your knees and pray to this game!

RATING: 8
I'm annoyed with myself for coming to this system so late in the day. I did try it some years ago and thought some aspects of the firing felt counter - intuitive but now I can't really remember why I thought that. There are some clever aspects to the system. I really like the impulses and there is a real sense that the designer has continually striven to keep processes effective but streamlined, so that play remains easy. There is an absence of the 'exception' type rules that can plague games that cover potentially complex subjects. Also streamlining can be seen in the vehicle rules that share many of the infantry processes. 

Getting into this game strongly reminds me of the pleasures that I had with the original Squad Leader game in 1977. A combination of clean system, good narrative based play and being visually splendid, makes this a delight to both own and play. Love the big counters, clear graphics and decent sized hexes.

At this point in time, the game modules cover periods from 1939 to 1985, which is impressive for a system that also remains very accessible

Well worth the wait.  Components are amazing.  Best of all - the scenarios seem well tested for balance as I've yet to play one where one side seemed out of it before the final turn.

Tactically the French and Belgians can stand up well against the Germans.  The Germans feature some heavy firepower in the squads (plenty of SWs) and fantastic leadership.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A top game

Despite being yet another WW2 tactical game for the lock n load system, the shift to 1939-1940 works amazingly well -, with motorbikes, cavalry and some of the heavy French tanks getting a spin against the weaker but more numerous German panzers. It's not just 'Band of Heroes' with new counters...well it is, but is isn't - It's much more.

The component quality is beautiful and simply setting up a game is an attractive prospect, let alone playing it. I cannot recommend this game enough and hopefully I'll get my hands on 'in defeat, defiance' soon to add the Tommies to the fight.

Full marks for Lock N Load Publishing

When I first ordered the game I couldnt wait to get my hands on it and start playing.
Indeed I have to agree that this is a beautifully designed game, with alot of visually nicely done game components.
The reason why I give this game a 5 rating is because the rules are horrible!! Since I am a beginner to LnL games, Ive had a hard time remembering all the rules. There is no structure in the rules. The complexity of this game is 4 according to the box but I would say at least 6. Far to much dice rolling in this game. A turn may sometimes feel endlessly long, with alot of page-turning through the rules.
The Chart is also a mindblower, it needs alot of re-writing to make it more understandable for beginners.

This game is probably more enjoyed by people who has some experience playing wargames, but I do not recommend it for beginners. It is quite complex and filled with many unnecessary rules.

The LnL Tactical system plays very quickly and certainly tells a action movie type story.  

I do like the you go/I go impulse structure - does allow for a more dynamic ebb and flow.

However, I disliked the spotting rules (understand why they are there) and I dislike the small maps.   Everything felt very constricted.

Want to stress there is nothing wrong with the system per-se, it is simply not for me.

This is my favorite module in the Lock'N Load series (may be A Ring of Hill will change this). I have played more than fifteen times already, to play test it. You have already understood that I am totally partial on this one. And I hope to add several new games soon. I enjoy particularly this one because it speaks of the Battle of France. It shows how good men have lost a battle for their country while their leaders where quietly in their HQ far from the lines of battle, giving stupid orders with outdated strategy and states of mind.
You will discover new units and possibilities, some strange vehicles, and situations very different from the rest of the war, especially in term of anti-tank battles. Sometimes you will also discover that the enemy can be also the countryside (a particularity that could be shared with Noville - Batsogne's outpost).
A lot's of fun...

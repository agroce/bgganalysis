RATING: 4.5
One of those games that's first to a great idea, but makes a bit of a meal of it.  Abbott revised it later to try to make it less clunky (more playable), but I think there are better inductives out there.

This took a while for me to get my head around the scoring. Once I did though it all came together nicely. I like the way you have to think up different patterns for the cards, but they can’t be too difficult for people to work out or it’ll go against you. This keeps people from being too random and the game more enjoyable.

Though I prefer Zendo, Robert Abbott's original guess-the-rule game is still worth playing.  Assuming you like deduction games.

I finally printed it out! My nice funny plastified cards are ready for play. Interesting game to open your game evening, I'm going to try it, I hope very soon

A game everyone should play a few times. (Played the card version, not the published version). Went through quite the phase a decade ago where this was very interesting for a month or two.

Scales well from 4 - 8 players. Pitching your rule so that one player gets it eventually while others struggle is the key challenge for the setter.

Interesting deduction card game that can be quite a brain burner, but Zendo is an improvement on the basic concept.

RATING: 7.6
I feel like this game is a sort of rational counterpart of Dixit.
The main problem is that the gameplay is not intrinsically fun, neither for God or the scientists. Finding the right group of players is the other.

Classic for demonstrating/teaching inductive reasoning. I prefer Eleusis Express in the classroom, though.

Great combination of creativity and analytical thinking.  Less fragile than Zendo.

Similar to a party game I enjoy playing (Psychiatrist).  I used a modified version of New Eleusis to teach the scientific method in a college biology class for non-majors.  It was a success and my students really enjoyed playing the game.

A wonderful game of inductive reasoning played with traditional playing cards.  Another game that I wish I had invented.

Aka New Eleusis as described in Martin Gardner's October 1977 column in Scientific American. on a web page by Robert Abbott circa 2007 he says that he now just calls it Eleusis as it is the standard version now.

I thought it was a great INduction game. My group i played it with really enjoyed it. We would play it more but everyone is gone and we really haven't been able to find the table space to play it (or the floor space, we're very messy people). It was a lot of fun, I'm hoping to bring back everyone when my Zendo comes in.

How DARE that Robert Abbott invent Zendo!  Just whom does he think he is?  And don't use the rule:  "The total of any card and its predecessor must be 14."

Our games of this (each person gets to play God once) have tended to go to the 2 hr length which is way too long. Game fun is hugely dependent on the skill of the God in determining a guessable rule that's not too simple, which means most hands are too frustrating or too easy. Given this, for a game of this type, the mechanics work well, it's challenging and you can't complain about the price.

[4-8 players] A modern card game simulating scientific research, as players ("scientists") conduct experiments to determine the rule governing play.

RATING: 8
Similar to (currently more well-known and popular, I suppose) [gameid=6830] (which is itself a great game partly inspired by Eleusis, which came first).

Eleusis has the practical advantage of only needing ordinary playing cards.

In Eleusis and in Zendo, one (non-player gamemaster) person creates a rule which the other players try to discover. Both are cool good games well worth trying.

[Poker Game] {Abstract; Induction, creativity; optimal 5-6p} Eleusis is a prelude of Zendo and the like.  It's a good travel game when you are taking a group of math students to a trip.

RATING: 10
If you have a few decks of cards (they don't even need to have the same backs) and the ability to print out the rules online, then you own this, too! Hurray! One more for your collection!

This game is a strange concoction. It's almost a party-game/brain burner combo. Trying to figure out the rule is fun. Creating *good* rules and watching others try to figure them out is even more fun.

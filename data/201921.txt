DELUXE TINY EPIC QUEST Full Kickstarter Version - includes all stretch goals
EXPANSION:   Quest for the Golden Mushrooms! (Mini-Expansion)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I absolutely love this game! I am so glad I got in on kick starter (a bit late but still).
So in this game, there are two phases, day and night, in the day you position your heroes on temples/dungeons, goblin portals and spell shrines to set up what you do during the night, beating temples/dungeons, killing goblins, and learning spells. The hard part comes in deciding what to do to best suit you and the current quests available to complete for points.

From all the play my copy has gone through, the pieces have held up rather well. The 'itemeeples' are a fantastic idea, and I have never had a problem with items falling out.

I have tried this game with some younger kids, and it does seem to be a little too complicated for some of them. Usually if they play a lot of other games they are fine by round 2 of the game though

All in all, I recommend giving this game a try.

This game falls somewhat short of expectations.

Gameplay gives the illusion of choice. 

Fighting Goblins, Learning Spells, and Completing Quests all feel rather lackluster and clunky. There is very little dimension to this game after two or three plays, and the player is left with the feeling that exploring temples, finishing quests, and fighting could have been a lot more.

So much to like and hate. I like the idea of the meeple's having item slots, but some items are too small. Yes, older grown ups play games too and may not have the dexterity or lack of intelligence of Gen Binary, but we still play table top games. Gamelyn seems to be rushing more and more games out (including their latest NON-Tiny game) instead of focusing on the earlier greatness they had.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Tiny Epic Quest is a cute little game, that doesn't quite strike me as epic but it's definitively enjoyable, thanks especially to the excellent production and the quality of its components... in particular those meeples that are able to carry equipment are really cute!

As far as game-play is concerned, Tiny Epic Quest is very streamlined and quite clever with the way it handles player actions. The fact that, every time a player moves or rolls the dice, every other player is equally involved makes the game flow very smoothly. In this way you never find yourself disengaged from what is happening and you're never bored.

That being said, Tiny Epic Quest is not one of those games that I can't wait to play again. It was an enjoyable experience and I might eventually come back to it... but I'm not going out of my way to play it. The reason might be that I'm not sure how different the game will play out the second time. I feel a bit like I've seen already what the game can offer.

Still, one play is way too few to judge a game. These are just first impressions. A good game with great production qualities, that plays very well and is quite clever in many of its design choices... but that doesn't stand out from the crowd of good light games.

RATING: 7
A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk — and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...

This is the only Tiny Epic  I have played. And My one absolute PROBLEM with it is that it was tiny. Every game mechanic was wonderful, well developed, and encourages players to feel like they can bend the game to their will just enough to win their way.  But small font on 1/4 of the spaces, unreadable small font on the goblin tokens, tiny:life, energy, magic, max life, max energy tokens that are all prone to being bumped out of place.  These things are a gameplay problem. I can't enjoy the game, I cant enjoy the mechanics if I am constantly thinking "oh wait am I at 5 hearts or did i breathe too hard when I was moving one of my meeples". That said the meeples with equipment are well handled. Even the quest equipment had the fun solution of the item rack. But this game would do just everything more, and better if it wasnt tiny. If it was just Epic Quest marketing would have been a problem, but the game would have been so much better.

Deeper than the previous installments of the Tiny Epic series that I've played, which unfortunately takes away some of its charm. Doesn't play as fast and lacks the stream-lined experience of Galaxies. Still, plays better than Kingdoms in my opinion.

RATING: 5.5
Similar to Tiny Epic Galaxies, there's a lot going on in this game.  Took awhile to get through the rulebook, but after playing once, the game is fairly intuitive.

Really want to get this one to the table again.  Rounds go very fast and I love the ability to chain off other players turns so you're always engaged.

After playing it again a few times, I dislike this game.  It's very finicky and not intuitive.

A pretty fun game, based heavily on some of my favorite Nintendo titles, with a really neat concept for Meeples. The game does have some shortcomings in its fiddlyness, lack of strategic variety, and balance of some of the items.

First, the fiddlyness. This game has tons of teeny tiny parts. Setting this up takes about as long as some of my heavier worker placement games, and this game isn't heavy. If it hadn't insisted on being SO tiny, a lot of the setup might have actually been faster.

The other two issues I have tie together a bit. The best strategy is basically to do a bit of everything. There are 10 spell levels and 5 rounds, so you basically always dedicate one Meeple to learning spells. If you want to really push your luck you can learn them all in 4 rounds and save an extra two actions in Round 5. Then, there are the quests. You want to stack these with your required Legendary Item dungeons and movements as possible. Then the goblins. You want to kill minimum one per round, ideally more. So you have a situation where 1 Meeple is always tied to spells, 1 is always tied to dungeons, and 1 is always tied to Goblins. If you get all your Legendary Items done early, you can burn through more goblins.

The last issue - balance. The bow is far and away better than the rest of the items. Killing multiple goblins per night with 1 Meeple frees up a lot of the load discussed in the previous paragraph.

All in all, it's a pretty fun game. I just ended up with the feeling that you're never really making decisions. You're following the optimal railroad, and if you get lucky you'll get to do things faster than other people.

Having said all that, I'll continue playing it for a while because it IS fun and DOES remind me of a particular Nintendo series.

The meeples are the best thing about this. And I've only played it two player. It's fun, but sometimes you feel like you are spinning your wheels on turns. Which can be frustrating. There are both times when you can't do what you need because you can't get there and also times when you have extra moves because you're already where you need to be. My son does enjoy playing it though.

This game had potential, but just doesn't quite get there.  I like the movement drafting and the various upgrades you can get for your character to make them better and unique.  Plus the ITEMeeples gimmick is nifty and provides a nice look to the game while being played.  But in the end the mechanisms just don't seem to come together to create an adventuring feel.  The learning spells is just a track you move up, not giving you any abilities or special affects.  The dice rolling in the night phase is a nice push your luck aspect, but just doesn't feel like it belongs in an adventure game list this.  Plus the pseudo reset at the end of each night phase makes for 5 rounds of tiny adventures, not one big long grand adventure.  So while I will keep it around because it is fun, it just didn't quite deliver on the Quest aspect of the title.

Played over 60 hours now and still look forward to playing a solo game every evening. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game is expanded in the future.  

I wish the designer and publisher would start releasing ultra tiny sized expansions for these games (Ultra Tiny Epic Kingdoms size), along with the usual tiny epic box size. This game could really benefit from a few ultra tiny small box expansions with new quests and items, new movement types, and maybe even faction cards with starting abilities or campaign length quests, alternate end game or scoring conditions, a fifth, evil castle bot to fight against. . . . I could go on forever thinking of these things.

Really enjoyed TEQ.  The combination of the planning of the day phase and the push your luck of the night phase felt right. I enjoyed the theme (I am a Zelda fan).  The Items being carried on the Meeples was a good idea (as opposed to some other implementation to get the items connected with the Meeples.)  I have only a few quibbles here.  The items are pretty small, and therefore not always easily manipulated.  There is very little way to mitigate the dice, so when no one rolls an attack, over and over, there is nothing that can be done about it.  The game is too short and too long.  5 rounds isn't enough to use the items you spent so much time getting.  But the game lasts 90-120 min with four players (and longer if one or two really spend time planning).  Even with my quibbles I really love the game, however.

#Kickstarter I will never stop to be impressed by the ability of Scott Almes to take huge game concepts and stuff them inside a small box. 

This is a full sandbox game in the usual TE format. You can spend happily the night running around doing basically whatever you like and you still will be in the club of the possible winners.

I liked it a lot andf I think i just scratched it. want more plays and explore more possibilities, A winner for sure in my book.

Very fun game with simple mechanics. They have upgrades the components and some card rule changes since the preview videos on the kickstarter site. (example: on video you got life AND power when visiting castles and some mushroom grottos. Now it is EITHER life OR power. Also, the Goblin mechanics are better. Instead of needing 2 hits to turn goblin, each hit will now turn goblin. It is still hard to kill a goblin, but now you have a better chance to do so. Also, a tip I was given to resolve the issue with the weapons rack, in the deluxe version, is if you use the insides on the outside, your weapons and items will indeed stay mounted on to the rack.
The only down side to the game, is that if you like to protect your games, like I do with sleeves and such, The box is indeed too small to accomplish it. You will need to make or buy a larger one to accommodate your investment. (Like a plastic box from the dollar store maybe or a small shoe box from a dept. store.

I know I was unlucky and I would appreciate the game more but my one and only game was terrible experience.

The game itself with the random factor ruined everything for me.
I was punished to finish temples before the others. I was fatally wounded by unavoidable dice rolls. I had no chance to do quests while for other players immediately doable quests appeared. There is zero comeback mechanic, once you fall behind you stay there for the game.

The components are cute and funny but that's all.

I'm almost certain I won't play this again.

Update from 5 to 3:
Time didn't help. I still hate this game and will avoid playing it. I compared to other games what I've rated as a 5 and those are better.

The gameplay is split into 2 very different and complementary sections. One which is pretty tactical and you have to consider your gear, what the other players are doing and which movements are going to be played, this is the day phase. The night phase is then when you get to see these plans in action as you take turns rolling dice to defeat goblins, explore temples and increase the magical track marker of magical energy.

Going through this cycle 5 times definitely feels like an epic quest! There's also enough time to fully equip your meeples by the end of the game leaving you with the feeling of success.

I was really excited for this one, but so far it is falling flat and will likely be in our next purge/cull. The premise is great, but there is little interaction or competition with the 2-player game, and it isn't one that has gotten a ton of interest when we have more players.

A little better than I expected it to be, actually.  It does manage to capture a little of the "Tiny Epic Mage Knight" feel, as you power your heroes up and send them on adventures.  And, of course, the Legend of Zelda theme is adorable.  It's even cool to gear up your heroes with items and make some good combos (like the Lantern and the Key for your designated quester).  However, some of the items come far too late in the game (days 4 and 5) to be useful.

Ultimately, I think it is too random.  Your quests can be at odds with each other (and with your Legendary items), or they can work in harmony.  The map could help you or hurt you.  And then there's the rolls.  You're not actually adventuring, you're playing a simple push-your-luck game (like Dungeon Roll, except this one is actually a game).  Thus there's no real interesting decisions in the night phase, just calculating the odds.  The day phase is a bit better, but it is hamstrung by the randomness I mentioned earlier.

The rest is awfully samey, which I understand is what you need to do to make this Tiny Epic, instead of Mage Knight.  All the temples are the same, all the goblins are the same, and lots of the items are isomorphic (same effect for a different value).  That saps some of the flavour in favour of the (unnecessary) Tiny Epic-ing of this game.

An expansion should definitely make the spells do something (other than increase Power and VPs).  Maybe add an extra day to give you more opportunities to use the items you get?

Mini boîte, mais maouss costaud. Il y a du matériel dans ce jeu. L'éditeur pixie game sait y faire en packaging. La cover vous fera penser à un jeu vidéo un très connu (vous savez, le nabot vert dont le prénom n'est même pas le titre du jeu vidéo). C'est un jeu d'aventure où vous allez envoyer vos 3 meeples accomplir des quêtes (temples, gobelins, magie, ...) avec un petit mécanisme de stop ou encore sur la résolution des quêtes. Le petit plus qui donne envie avant de se lancer : Vous pourrez équiper vos meeples avec des artefacts (épée, bouclier,...) en leur accrochant dessus. Bon, je vous préviens, il faut passer le cap de la règle de jeu et du plateau. Après, vous verrez vite si ça vous plaît ou pas.

I watched a game in progress, but I haven't yet played it.
There are a lot of components in the small box, and the players seemed to enjoy it.
However I found the texts on cards and tiles really "Tiny".  I thought the game would benefit from being a standard sized game with larger components and larger texts.
IMO this is the limit of using "Tiny" as a commercial gimmick for a series.

Each player has 3 meeples which are used to move over a board constituted of cards. The cards show temples (where you can find artefacts and fulfill quests), obelisks (where you can learn spells), goblins (which you can fight), actions (e.g. gain 2 health) and palaces (where you can gain health and power).
The game is played over 5 rounds. First 4 moves are made (in a 3 player game). In turn a player chooses a mode of transport (raft, horse, foot, gryphon and ship). All players can make use of this type of transport with 1 meeple. After all the moves have been performed, players in turn throw 5 dice. Result:
goblin => loose 1 health (second goblin has effect on next player and so on). If health goes to zero, hero is exhausted and looses his turn. Loss of health can be avoided by the use of power.
power => gain 1 (second power for next player and so on)
mushroom => magic mushroom moves on magic track (necessary to be able to learn a specific spell, when a spell is learned maximum power is increased with the increase in the spell level)
scroll or torch => all players who need these items to move further in a temple can make use of these dice. With power extra scrolls or torches can be bought to advance faster.
punch => all players who are fighting a goblin can decrease the goblin's health by 1 (goblin is defeated by 5 punches, this increases maximum health by 1).
Points are scored for number of quests, number of goblins defeated and spell level.
A nice feature of the game is that you can individualise your meeples by equipping them with the artefacts you find in the temples. These artefacts imbue specific powers to those meeples.
On the downside: the spells you learn cannot be used, they only serve to score points.

I really loved the idea behind this game and the Itemeeples are adorable! This game will definitely remind you of playing games like Zelda on the NES/SNES. The artwork is cute and it's really fun trying to get one of your legendary items and then putting it on your meeple.

As far as the gameplay, trying to position your meeples in just the right way to complete quests makes the game puzzly and then at night the game turns into a press your luck with die rolls. I think it's a very neat design and I've enjoyed my playthroughs of this game.

I would rate this higher but unfortunately the "tiny" aspect holds this game back. Just like with Tiny Epic Galaxies it can be fiddly because of all the small pieces you use to track everything on your player board as well as the worst part in my opinion, trying to find the spell symbols on the board! The board is so busy and the icons are so small that it can be a headache trying to locate any specific symbol.

I would rate this higher, but it feels so jumbled when playing.  My tokens slid all over the place when playing and I spent a lot of time sliding them back.  That’s never been an issue for me in other games.  While the art is beautiful, it also feels jumbled and claustrophobic.  Every turn I feel like I’m trying to parse things out on the board.  With more plays that would probably go away, but due to the above reasons, I’m not certain the game will get those plays.  The rulebook feels a little rough too, but I think that might just be the tiny form factor.

I really like the gameplay though.  I just don’t like dealing with all the small bits, tiny tracks, and cluttered graphic design.  In A rare instance for me though, the fun of playing TEQ overcomes my issues with the production.  So while I rate it a six, it might as well be a 7 or 8.

*Side note -I always wondered why Blue Moon City didn’t have more art on the tiles.  This game made me understand why.

2017-09-25 : First play. Gold Medal Winner for Worst Graphic Design of the Decade. This turns a game which should be quick and fun into an Epic Slog that takes twice as long to complete then it should. The most infuriating thing is that there's probably a good game lurking underneath. If ever there was a design in need of a good developer, it's this one. Hell, it doesn't even have to be a good developer, just somebody with eyes and common sense.

This is a great addition to the Tiny Epic series of games.  I've only played 2 player and solo (solo is really good) so I don't know how it plays at 3 or 4, but as all players are using each others results throughout the turns I imagine that there isn't much down time. A really fun game in a very small box.

I did not enjoy this one at all. I didn't like the gameplay nor the artistic design. I know, I know, everyone loves the little pieces and how you stick them into your meeples but I found them unnecessary and the player status pieces a failure of design. /getoffmylawn

In short, I found this to be about 30 minutes of interesting decisions packaged into 90+ minutes of game. Many turns were about deciding between equally uninteresting or simply obvious options. I just didn't see the hook here. So many better games for the price of this overhead. Put this in a 45+ minute experience, and I might find it charming.

Fantastic game. The scale and complexity isn't quite the same as a full tabletop RPG, although it unfolds to take up almost as much space, but they keep the mechanic fairly basic with die rolls and only very rudimentary decision-making. This is in keeping with the 'small' factor of the game and means you can fit in more plays (or other games) instead of spending all evening on the same one.

Amazing how they fit it all into such a small box. Not overly bothered about their 'IteMeeples' but then again I don't really understand the fuss around meeples in the first place. Functional enough. The only real irritation were the markers on the player card, as these could slide out of place easily on an accidental bump of the table or an errant shirt sleeve.

The meeples and their ITEMeeples are fun, the theme is fun, the "push your luck" phase is fun. But the whole game leaves me with a rather cold mechanics feeling. 
A the end of the game, I feel like "All hat fuss for nothing !". It may come from the spell learning mechanic, the busy artwork or the "I get power / I spend power" loop.
Anyway, I'll play again if I can, but I won't add it to my collection. (did no try the solo game)

This came together really well. Make no mistake, this is a full-scale game in a small box. The ITEMeeples worked very nicely and the upgrades they provide are useful and fun. One member of my group called out the straight "rip-off" of Zelda, but in a good way.

My only concern after one play is the rapid scaling of the scoring, to the point that a single quest, goblin, or butterfly can become an unstoppable lead. This might be fine, except that obtaining any of those (or not) can be very random. For example, there were two quests that were total gimmes when they went on offer just based on the existing position of the players. Similarly, there are several conditions under which a player can obtain a goblin token for next to nothing. While this didn't really affect my enjoyment of the game this time, I can imagine it would get to me with further plays. 

This triangular escalation/set collection scoring mechanism seems to be common in at least a couple of Scott's games, and I'm not a huge fan of it if/when paired mechanisms that reach a certain threshold of randomness. In general, the trend is good—reward players for focusing on a certain strategy—but I wish the scaling were a little less steep and/or have non-set collection goals that provided viable alternative scoring options (e.g. legendary items are ok, but it's not realistic to get more than 2 in a game).

Overall fantastic job, and despite some misgivings based on previous Tiny Epic iterations, this game has brought me back into the fold. The fact that it's just $25 ($20 in some cases) is amazing, too.

After playing a number of games, Tiny Epic Quest has become my favorite of the Tiny Epic series. Everyone who I have introduced this game to loves it! What makes this game work are three things:

1) The art: It’s friendly, colorful and very inviting. From the map to each the round tracker, the art is so fun and whimsical, it beckons you to join the adventure.
2) The mechanics: The puzzle of the day phase contrasted with the risky dice rolling of the night phase, creates a unique experience. And it is a great twist to have the dice rolled on a turn shared by everyone (not just the active player)!
3) The components: The ITEMeeples have it in this game. Rather than keeping track of the items you attain by receiving a card, this game lets you actually place a physical item onto your meeple! This in combination with increasing your max health and max energy, makes you really feel you are leveling up your heroes.

All in all this game is fantastic and I’m excited to see what inevitable expansions Scott Almes and Michael Coe will cook up next! Bravo!

What a great game. Solo and multiplayer plays brilliantly.

The solo variant is really challenging even in the easy VP setting. The multiplayer variant is very thrilling because you have to watch what your opponent is doing constantly - not only that, damage and points are shared clockwise across the table even if its the 1st player throwing dice AND that can get worse depending on the level of the magic track - it is really a fun and different design approach.

Apart from that, this game has amazing components. The itemMeeples? Man, they are so cute and fun! It is also very rewarding to see your meeples get equipped with awesome items. Another amazing aspect of this game is its portability. Such a great and complex game, that can be carried around to any place and quickly setup.

This game is one of my favourites now.

While there's no Epic game I really like so far, this one is the best to me. Still not a game I need to own, but this time it's interesting for a couple of reasons.

I like the special abilities granted by those items and the overall feeling of you being on a quest is captured very well. The only negative things that came to mind were the quest cards (being replaced immediately) and the really tiny components. Of course that's what the series is about, but well...

All in all nicely done!

In addition, many of the mechanics affect all player so you're making basically the same decisions as your opponents. Components are cool, but I don't think my group will be playing this again any time soon. We'll stick with Tiny Epic Galaxy for the hundredth time.

Very nice looking art. Tempting "geek lore" appeal (Zelda, Bomberman...)
Item-Meeples!
But the game is a luckfest. Its rulebook is a chore to read. (Man, we laughed just reading it aloud to each other, and all 3players took turn in reading parts...) The fun just isn't there even after understanding it all. Some mechanisms are needlessly complex (Why can't all of my guys go home if I choose so? This way they wouldn't have to explain a rule with 3 exceptions etc.)
Randomness increased by a few things (Quests draw: if no 2-types of quests shown then trash the oldest quest - instead of the newly drawn one. Why is it a random element? Because you can already have moved your guys to go for a quest, just to see it gone because someone else finished a different quest, and then quest flush happens. Stupidly unpredictable.)
We had fun when dice were rolled for adventures and there was a risk of wipingout everyone.
We were disappointed to have to just "go again from the castle for the day" every of the 5 days. Without really much changed.
No story element. Nothing supports the theme much beyond the nice pictures.
You learn spells... but never use them. Instead they increase your "strength". Meh.
You explore temples... which actually are just 5-square tracks, all work the same, you're just trying to match those symbols in the same order to get to the top.
The game lacks sould and interesting mechanisms / choices.
Not for me or any of my 2 friends who tested it today.

El juego es entretenido, hay muchas cosas para hacer y varias decisiones que tomar, muchas formas de hacer puntos y el balance esta bien logrado. Todo eso sorprende al ver que viene en una caja tan pequeña. Es de juego fluido e interactivo entre todos los participantes, las tiradas de dados comunes a todos los jugadores generan que prácticamente no se sienta el entre-turno. La novedad de los ITEMeeples es pintoresca.
Puntuación final? 4.5 Cobras Sonrientes.

Firstly this is a game which is always beautiful to set out and play with. The components are lovely, the artwork bright and inspiring and the "toy factor" of the equip-able meeples can't be underestimated, while also bringing a strategic element, although these can be fiddly to handle and hard to store in the provided item rack. If you're familiar with other Tiny Epic games, this mashes up the action drafting from Kingdoms with the dice rolling from Galaxies.

Despite the Tiny part of the name, it's a huge game out of the box and you'll need a significant area to play on. It takes up most of my 36"x36" play mat; putting it all back away in the box is another game in itself.

This is actually the game which made me buy a proper game mat, because on a wooden table it's hard to keep from moving things around accidentally and there are one or two game elements which need house ruling - the Temple quests can be unfair if they come out in pairs (i.e. both of the same temple) while a player is already in that location - we burn the new card draws until there are no duplicates and there is a designer-approved override about discarding new quests when there is an issue, rather than the oldest.

The movement phase tends to be the area with the most analysis-paralysis, since trying to figure out your movement while other players are choosing the movement means is a bit of a head-scratcher.

But overall it's so fun questing across the board, trying to make the most of your limited time to move and collect and that gambling factor of holding out for the dice rolls needed to complete objectives during the night phase. The random and double-sided map provides huge variety for replays and tile placement effects how every game plays.

When i first opened the box, i was excited to see the amount of different components that come in the game, then a little worry set in.  I was worried that the game might have a few too many side items that would have an impact on the game. Read the rules, slapped myself for worrying, then jumped right into Tiny Epic (Zelda) Quest. I love it.  It has just the right amount of meat for a quick and easy play through.  The varying difficulty was a great touch for veteran players. It also left enough room for future expansions, without making it feel like too much. Excellent game, excellent pieces,  the item meeples add a bunch to the game making it easier to track which character has what.  Overall, AWESOME!

Definitely Tiny, and a little bit epic at least.

The map cards are reasonably sized but the map cards are the same size as your player card and it becomes quite easy to knock into the card and move your HP/power trackers and stuff around.

The box itself is also just a bit too tiny for all the components and requires some careful tetris placement to fit back without raising the lid sometimes.

The gameplay is good and there's some good decisions to be made during the day phase about what movement cards to choose and a push your luck phase that follows where your dice can possibly help other players. At 2 players it can be quite AP heavy since you have more opportunity to make choices but the 2 player push your luck phase doesn't feel as risky sometimes since you only have to sit through 1 set of dice rolls of the other player so you can play a bit more risky.

The little meeples that can hold the tiny weapons are pretty cool though.

Decent little game. My 11-year-old son really enjoyed our first playthrough of it, especially the ITEMeeples. The game is a bit fiddly for my taste and can get a bit convoluted if you acquire a lot of weapons due to all the special powers. My son went straight to all the adventure tracks and was able to fully equip all his meeples by the end of the game. We spent a lot of time trying to understand all his special powers and how they could work to his advantage, which did bog down the game a bit in my opinion.

I really enjoyed this game. I was surprised though to find such a complex game in this little package. I felt like I spent a lot of time looking up rules online and in forums. After about 3-4 playthroughs I felt that I had a good grasp on both the essential and obscure rules. It has a surprising amount of replayability and the mechanic of collecting artifacts and weapons is incorporated extremely well and love the incredibly cool itemeeples!!

Got Kickstarter. Disappointing in game play. Not impressed with the custom deluxe pieces either.  Should be called tiny epic icons. The smallest icons and text ever seen in a board-game. Rules were vague and unhelpful with too few examples. Two games so far both ended extremely anti climatic. Just 5 turns. If the dice crush you and cards are beneficial it was an exercise in frustration and limitations. Had expectations but has not lived up to all the hype. Maybe it's just not very good with two?

IMO, doesn't really capture the feel of Zelda games, rolling dice at night is not an exciting mechanic. Also I really dislike the size of "tiny epic" components. In this case, the worst offenders are the health tokens which are easily disturbed. I think I will stop trying tiny epic games for now...

First Impression: Played PnP version. The PnP was well done and assembled, so I don't think that swayed my opinion. (Plus I play a lot of prototypes so don't have to have a top notch production to enjoy a game).. The game is a bit fiddly and the rules for raising magic are a bit wonky. Overall, it was a meh experience, but I will play my production copy when it arrives before making a final judgement.
The other three players in my group all liked the game and the average rating would probably be a high 7 or low 8, so maybe it's me.

[Kickstarter] The first game was fun. I found the quests to be randomly messing a player but that could be easily fixed by having 5 of them open. Sometimes you just finish a temple for a legendary weapon and then the next quest opened is that temple which creates some frustration but still the game is fun. You push your luck on the night phase which is fun and the day phase is quickly over since people can plan what they will do quite quickly. Can't wait to play more games of this.

I liked this more than expected given Almes's previous titles. The "tiny epic" concept definitely sold me early, but, even though I thought they delivered coherent gameplay, I didn't find Kingdoms or Galaxy particularly thrilling.

I thought this was more compelling, as the movement draft made for enjoyable planning, especially when combined with anticipating how the dice might turn out in the Night phase. (I also liked that it had something for both gamers who like strategic and tactical planning and gamers who like chucking dice.)

The setup and teardown is annoying and fiddly, as there are lots of tiny parts.

I enjoyed the theme, although it was a bit weird how thinly veiled the Zelda references were. I think I would have preferred a bit more riffing on the core concepts rather than direct homage?

Tiny Epic Quest provides simple rules that children can learn with complexity that will satisfy older gamers. A true sandbox game, players can focus on whatever they want but are subtly encouraged to plan for a variety of tasks.

I have backed this on Kickstarter. I have been playing the pnp version and have upgraded it with images I've found around the net. I want to see how nice of a pnp version I can make until mine comes along. 

The game play is really fun. The solo mode works great. Since I'm mostly a solo player these days this is always appreciated and really a must for any games I play. Last muti-player game I purchased was "Star Wars Rebellion". I pre-ordered that. Still have yet to play a single game. I desperately want to but with a 2 year old and friends working and such matching times up is close to impossible it seems. 

Gamelyn Games has really been coming through for me allowing me to get game fixes in. Their games are cheap (but HIGH in quality!), and fast. Tiny Epic Galaxies I can slam through several games while my son naps. Tiny Epic Western, while fun takes a bit longer setup wise for sure and just over all playing it seems. This game (according to the pnp I've been playing) takes a little longer than Galaxies but is still relatively fast and has a deeper game play it feels. I can't wait until the full pnp version is released and I can take the game for a real spin. The foot space of this game again is larger than Galaxies but smaller than that of Western.

UPDATE: I have played several games now with full pnp setup. I wish I'd given this game a 8 or a 9 previously so I could now bump it up to an easy 10. It's outstanding. The GloomFall expansion I was not 100% sold on. After playing it, I am forced to eat my words, really good. It's an 1.5 version right out of the gate and it comes with it! After playing this it's easy to see why this blew all their other KS projects out of the water. They set the bar high for themselves after this one. This might be their "Thriller"-level game that all their future games are compared to!

UPDATE II: I’ve played this game a lot now. Have got Hero of Legend with 3 of the 4 colors. I’m coming for you red! I’m convinced that 95% of the people who give this 7 or below have only played it once. Probably wrong at that. They think there is too much luck. Of course there is some, but not nearly as much as they’d have you believe, there are steps you can take to mitigate that luck, almost into non existence, especially by round 3, if you’re a smart player. 

For me, this,game has held up amazingly well. I can literally play this at any time and have a great time doing so. It’s a star! Learn the game play several games and learn how to manipulate the dice. I watched one review that out of the 5 dice he thought he could use 1. I saw a way for him to use 4. Hard to blame the game for poor human choices. 

P.S. For the people that want to try to slam them for the patent pending Itemeeples they need to grow up. If that is why the game gets 1* that is sad. It has been said that it it to protect them right now during the production phase. If anyone else would file the same patent they did they could block or hold up production of this game for a very long time unless they came up with a different way for their Meeples to hold items. Then if they didn't file a patent on that risk the same thing happening over and over again. They have spent over 10K of their own money on development of this. They have a right (and really an  obligation to backers like me) to protect themselves and their game. "worst" case scenario (and probably what will happen) is a judge will throw it out. But *RIGHT* now they are protected. If the judge does allow it and they get a patent then I guess they were completely right to do what they did and more power to them.

Was hesitant, but kickstarted it when my kids got excited over it.  Played it yesterday and liked it better than I expected to.  It felt more thematic than I thought it would and I found that explaining the game using thematic terms worked pretty well.

Played in 90 minutes with 4 players who took quite a bit longer than they needed to, so I think the 60 minute playtime is maybe a little optimistic, but still reasonable.

I liked how you have to try to get your guys set up for the night phase and then the push-your-luck of seeing your work pay off or not.

While the "Tiny" box size and tiny price are both great, I think this could have been really improved with larger components.  But at least it's portable this way.  Just frustratingly tiny.

My item rack holds the items fine without any extra work.  In fact I found all the components to be exemplary. 

Overall -- Quite glad I kickstarted it and look forward to playing again.

In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.

Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.

I like the things that this game attempts to do. It's trying to feel sandboxy, and trying to feel like an adventure. In the end, it's really a race and set collection game and uses push your luck.

I think much of the game really lies in die luck, and your ability to "follow" other player's roles. Unfortunately it's not like in Galaxies where you can pay a resource to follow; you simply have to hope it happens. Given the seemingly larger number of possible outcomes during rolls, this game feels like die luck is far higher.

In the end, the game is also longer initially. Without the benefit of experience to bring the play time down, the game feels a bit long.

Rating based on solo play only. 

This game is so pretty and I'm really diggin' the thematic flavour! I'm still new to it and exploring the synergies and so on but very happy so far. Lot's of interlinking mechanics that keep you engaged and on your toes. 

I look forward to playing it multiplayer as the aspect of 'every time you roll the dice you potentially help/harm your opponent' is obviously missing in the solo game, which I can imagine really lifts the experience to another level entirely, ratcheting up the tension and making the decision to roll again or not all the more tense.

Seriously, they could've just shipped the dice.  That's all this game is, rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling...

Great game, both competitive as solo.
has a smart way of combining different game mechanics (push your luck, strategic puzzling, worker management). The ITEMeeples are a great find and add to the already great look and feel.

Much like Scott Almes other games, I don't see much appeal here and it's too fiddly.

The choices in the game comes across as superficial.  The idea of the game is you go around traveling to temples, shrines, and portals to complete tasks.  However, the issue I find is all of these tasks are completed by dice rolls.  So usually the most optimal strategy to spread yourself to different tasks so when you do start rolling dice, you have a chance of advancing your spaces.

They are a few areas in the game that allow you to mess around with the tasks, but otherwise it feels shallow.

The graphic design of the game doesn't help either, as everything blends far too easily to one another and the few times I've played it I've seen people have trouble grasping the map itself.

It's also a game that can lead to nasty AP sessions.  I've seen (not been involved) in a TEQ game go over two hours because of the five players combing through every detail.

In short, while the game is cleverely designed with such small sized components, they are far better options to spend my time within 45 to 60 minute time frame like Evolution: Climate and Libertalia.

The negative scoring for the three categories is a rather odd design choice- a sense of punishment rather than sense of achievement is a bad motivation to force players do something. Like other tiny epic games the components are rather small and it's rather fiddly to set up.

I will not play this game again.  It fits in a tiny box, it has quests, but the things it is epic at are not to be celebrated.  It is an epic grind, taking way too long at 4 players for the level of strategic depth available, resulting in  too long to get to the game end.  The rules are way too fiddly, and more complex than the theme and art direction justifies.  Nothing really stands out as unique, and the game is much less than the sum of its parts.

The cutesy art makes this reminiscent of a boring and grinding free to play online RPG.  I've got no desire to play solo as I feel the game is just soul-less.  There is no elegance to it.

Didn't help that I played this at the end of an evening, but when the box says 30-60 mins and we are still going at 90 (a 50% over-run), that is a big problem.

Looks great with those meeples and items to carry.  Gameplay is pretty straightforward and much more enjoyable than the rules would indicate.  The few meeples per player and few rounds seem like they would be limiting but instead it feels just right.  Not tiny on the table and not really epic, but it's a good game.

I need to point out straight away that I don't care about theme in games. Beyond it providing a game with great components and art, it doesn't really matter to me whether the rules/mechanisms make "thematic sense". Generally for me it's all about whether a game engages me mechanically.

This game is the exception. Yes, the mechanisms are solid and engaging - if they weren't I would not give the game this high of a rating. But this game achieves what few games do with me - it makes the theme come to life in my mind.

It does help that the theme isn't really trying to hide that it's heavily inspired by one of my all-time favourite video game series; namely the Legend of Zelda. It feels and plays like a proper Legend of Zelda board game would. You are going into temples/dungeons, finding cool new items (including a fairy and even a rupee - they can call it whatever they want, that is a rupee), fighting monsters and learning spells.

The iteMeeples may be a gimmick, but they are perfectly used in this game, giving the different meeples individual abilities in addition to making them look really cool. It's always a shame whenever I take on too many item quests as I run out of meeple hands to hold the items and I end up having to choose between them.

When I first played the game, I did feel like it ended before I managed to achieve enough of what I wanted to do, but once I played it some more I realized the game length is pretty nicely balanced, and you can actually achieve quite a bit in those five rounds.

Another wonderful discovery is that this game plays excellent as a solo game as well. The adjustments are few, and you do wind up feeling like you got a proper game meal regardless of whether you played it multiplayer or alone.

This game truly lives up to its name of tiny epic and is highly recommended by this Zelda-fan.

Box is tiny. Table-space is crazy.
The gameplay is fairly simple, yet there are so many rules and things to keep track on at the same time.
The graphics are amazing, but also crazy cluttered and extremely hard to read.

I don't know what this game is trying to achieve.
Gorgeous production values and the IteMeeples are brilliant. Why have that not been done before?

I want this game but in a big box, with proper strategy gameplay and less fidgety rules and things you must keep track of at all times.

Solo - third game and I got a score of 78

I feel like this has been solved for me and I don't think I will play it again.

Not a terrible game, for sure, but the basic strategy is to spread wide and diversify - have one go for a goblin each turn, another try and max spell level, and the third go for temples that match up with epic items.

Unfortunately though, this game is really just a 'highest score' type puzzle, rather than you win or you die type adventure...  Nothing here to keep me wanting to come back really...

Love the Zelda theme. All the mechanics feel fresh (really like the almost reverse-King of Tokyo push-your-luck night-phase). Hate the "Tiny" part. Left me with constant anxiety that I was going to lose one of the tiny legendary items. First game went a bit long - hopefully game two, things go quicker.

RATING: 3
Bait & switch heavy game in balanced euro clothing.  Too many messy mechanics interacting, very easy to misunderstand or forget crucial components. The 2/4 quadrant "map tiles" are hard to make out and don't really make sense - there is a better solution. Movement card mechanics are a neat idea, but they make it impossible to plan ahead much and lead to lots of think time while the other players wait. Legendary staff should advance the damn mushroom for other players!- like a powerful artifact that can curse your enemies.

I will say, meeples holding flutes and swords is an amazing idea!

RATING: 8
A bit of shrinked brain burner in the 1st phase (where to move your characters to gain advantage and rush for quests/kills/items?), and a press your luck dice chunker in the 2nd one.

Overall a good game, theme feels a bit pasted on - but surprisingly not too much. A nod: if you want to make a [b]tiny[/b] game to call it so, but then the game pieces are close to be unplayable [b]clunky[/b]... well man, just do it larger. [i]Wide epic quest[/i] could work better, y'know.

A fairly big game in a tiny box. Takes me back to my days of playing Zelda. 

Pros: The adventuring and movement choices are fun and the press your luck nights bring the tension.

Cons: Could use more quests available, 3 is too limiting. Also, the lucky player who can align temple quests with legendary requirements gets a big lead. If you get Exhausted even once, you are pretty much have little chance of getting a good final score.

Relatively big game for such a tiny box. Fun and functional, but not by any means worthy of the hype. The game play matches the price and size of the box and isn't worth a very high rating.

I'm not entirely clear if the one play I had of this was a fair representation or not, as it was hastily taught to our group of newbies and we ended up spending a lot of time peering at the rules. I'd been told it should be about an hour's play, and it ended up a gruelling 2.5 hours for reasons that entirely escape me. -- That said, I could never actually detect any point at which one could make an actually interesting decision--all the things you could do seemed boring. (Goblins to fight = roll dice until identical little green wheels turn to the skull spot. Stuff to explore = roll dice until you get enough torches or scrolls. The "spells" don't do anything, they just earn you points.) There are arbitrary movement/distribution quests to accomplish, which isn't usually too hard--I'd rather have a real puzzle to solve, as in Tash-Kalar's tasks. 

Cute art, cute little meeples who can actually hold the magic items you earn. I think I actually may have won the game I played, but I'd tuned out several turns earlier.

I normally am not a fan of games that have chance and rolling dice, but there's more to it than that. Items (as well as spending power) can help mitigate the chance of a bad roll, which greatly improves play for me. There's decent amount of strategy for a simple game, which is what I was hoping for. I do think there small things that could be improved on. I'd like to see more different kinds of quests and a little more difference in the gloom variant, though the idea is cool.

RATING: 7.5
A fun worker placement game that really compartmentalizes many elements inspired by other RPG games (Day and Night phase from "Mage Knight", for instance).  This reduction inevitably leads to a loss of complexity (as someone who generally plays a magic user of some type in RPGs, I was especially disappointed at the implementation of magic in this game). My favourite part of the game is the "push your luck" element to the adventuring phase.  The global effect of die rolls helps speed the game up, but it can also lead to players giving their opponents advantages that they would otherwise wish to avoid.  Also, I feel that "resting" can give undue advantages to some players over others.  For example, say two players are racing to the end of a temple to obtain a quest card associated with that temple, and both players reach the end using the same die roll.  Depending on who gets the dice next, one of those players simply has to be the first player to "rest" and claim the quest card for that temple. Both players did the same amount of work, but turn order essentially decided the winner.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Definitely the best Tiny Epic so far, which really feels like a 2-D Zelda adventure. The gameplay is based on simple push your luck mechanics, yet it feels there is a lot of meat in that tiny box. The game becomes slightly harder with more players as there is increased competition for temple Quests. The option of playing the harder side of tiles is a nice addition and the Itemeeples are way too cool! Little downside: everything in this game being tiny, you really spend a lot of time looking around for symbols across the tiles.

Played solo and it's a fun activity. Need to play with my games team but I know not everyone will like this. Like many of the Epic games there is a lot of card reading and card searching to be done. If you go in knowing it's going to be AP prone with lots of stalling then you can have a leisurely time of it but I know some people will be tearing their hair out. The little bits are cute but physically fiddly. I like it though and think multi-player will be a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A 1-4 player game that mostly involves point-to-point movement and push-your-luck mechanics.

Easily the worst of the "Tiny Epic" series. Not only does the game barely feel thematic (randomly running around the countryside in order to complete quests), but it is also surprisingly fiddly, overlong, and difficult to learn/play without constantly referencing the rulebook (which could seriously use a few more examples and clearer descriptions for several of the elements).

One of the most irritating parts of the game involves how quests can just disappear on you without much warning, and not just when another player beats you to it. This basically removes any ability to plan your next round in advance or come up with any sort of long term strategy (which this game would have definitely benefitted from). You either take the quests that are shown right now or they very well might be gone!

As a last well-deserved jab at this extremely disappointing game, final scores that can be in the negative is a GREAT way to make newer players never want to play again! Why couldn't they start the score tracks at 0? Why -4? Also, there is no easy way to track final scoring, so I hope you are good at mental math!

TEQ looks like a game with lots of options and different paths You can take to victory, nice artwork, original take on meeples and interesting blend of semi-coop/competetive mechanics. Unfortunately all of this comes with a BUT. The artwork is nice, BUT also a bit confusing and hard to read. Yes, the Itemeeples are fun to play with, BUT they could simply be numbered and the items could very well be replaced with cards. However, these are only technicalities. Larger problems come from the game mechanisms. You are lead to believe, that You can take on many paths to victory, BUT the scoring is calculated in such a way, that the most viable strategy is always spreading Your 3 heroes on all of the 3 types of points generators (i.e. goblins, learning spell, exploring dungeon) and at the same time maybe completing a "positioning quest" and everyone figures this out pretty quickly. Completing quests is a very luck driven affair, since You can sometimes complete them by accident or at least they can be very easily fulfilled by You and not Your opponents, which is not fun, since You did not earn it through clever play. Also the night "adventure" is just boring, since everybody just rolls dice that can't be mitigated in any way (very unlike in galaxies), so You just wait and see how well or poor it all went for You.This game looks as if it offers You ton of stuff to do, but it's just a mirage. On the contrary Tiny Epic Galaxies from the same author are much more thinky and much less luck driven (even if You roll dice all the time) offer higher replaybility, are pleasant and clean to look at, have more streamlined rules and interesting player interaction. So...play Galaxies instead.

Competitive quest game with a terribly garish board that takes a lot of space. Doesn't look very fun. Plus the publisher filed for a patent on the ITEMmeeples.

Based on one play: Tiny Epic really packs a lot into a tiny game box and the components are very well thought out. I have liked many of their games but this one fell short for me. I find the quest side to be a little random as you have to complete a quest once visible and not before and some are just positioning your pieces a certain way on the board. Also there are three main objectives that give you points but you can chose to chase only one as the value increases as you collect more of one item. The tougher ones are harder to collect but rewards are greater. The moving and rolling mechanic also got repetitive and although there is a push you luck aspect it is mainly dice rolling at one point.

Tiny Epic Quest is a game that's based on Zelda-style adventure video games.  Each round is played in two parts--a movement phase and a dice-rolling phase.  During the movement phase, players draft movement cards and then that player, as well as all of the other players, can move one of their three pawns on the map board according to that movement card.  Then, during the dice-rolling phase, players roll a number of dice whose faces correspond to various spaces that their pawns may have landed on--torches and scrolls help explore dungeons, goblin faces help defeat goblins, mushrooms help you learn spells, etc.  However, these faces can be used by all players, so while players can keep rolling dice in turn indefinitely, they have to decide whether they're helping themselves more than other players.  There are also a number of quest cards available that can be claimed by exploring certain dungeons or moving to certain places.  The scoring of the game encourages players to go after a mix of goblins, quests, and spells.  While the game was cute and definitely evoked the adventure game feel, I didn't really find much tension in the game, and on the whole thought that the game was longer than it needed to be.  After a while it just seemed like I was doing the same things over and over again.

Played this at Salt Con 2017. This is a fun little game. It can get a bit hard to move where you would like since the movement system is determined by picking cards. I also don't necessarily like the "Rosenberg-esque" scoring system that punishes players for not learning enough spells or killing enough goblins. Otherwise I love the art and the Zelda vibe to it. The item meeples are fun.

(5+ plays)  I like the gameplay, quests, items.  It all maps out very well, and eliminating the following mechanism from TEG is the right move.  Our two 2-player games took 75 minutes each.  That's a little too long, but the game is fiddly - so maybe practice will shorten it up for us.  Also, the state at the end of the game makes me feel like it should last even longer, maybe 7 days instead of 5.  The chance to use any item you get even once is a challenge, ... so it's hard to bother going for them.

I was a little unsure how this would play out initially but my concerns were unfounded. Like any game with dice, luck is a factor but decisions nevertheless remain meaningful and interesting. The push your luck mechanic is implemented very nicely with the decisions of each player as to how much to go for each night and when to rest. Might prove to be be my favourite Tiny Epic game in time but for now probably falls just short of Galaxies.

RATING: 8
Easily my favorite in the Tiny Epic series. (haven't played them all) best because there is no asymmetric player abilities which has ruined each and every other game in the series that I have played. Pretty straight forward game and so colorful it is just wonderful. reminds me and brings me into the land of Hyrule from Zelda. Happy to play and explore this game further, I really liked my one play so far!

This is definitely my favorite of the Tiny Epic series. It's the hardest to initially teach, partially because the board is an unintelligible explosion of color at first, but by the end of the first day/night cycle, everyone I've played with has been all in.

Same issues with many of the games in this series:

* Components way, way too small
* You're still moving lots of pieces along tracks

I really did like the Day phase where players moved their heroes all over the board in a chess-like fashion.

The game is too slow-moving. For these kinds of Zelda-esque games, I want to accumulate lots of special powers. But it takes such a long time to defeat anything this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tiny in components and Epic in scope.
Fiddly but so much to like. 

I like the game's sandbox open feel with Zelda's borrowed looks, and a shared dice mechanism with press-your-luck. Also, I like the puzzle aspect in finding the best combinations as I plan during the day phase to get the movement quests, and at night, for the treasure items; all the while trying to accomplish getting legendary items in the beginning and fulfilling victory conditions at the end with it. 

.:Best 2-3:.

// Quest for the Golden Mushrooms- Adds cute moments.
I like how the Golden Mushroomfolk (GM) follows the Hero, and I get attached to my GM as I move them together on the board. In addition, I like that the GM has a bit of personality not wanting to do a temple run in the dark after being traumatized by the evil Goblin who captured them.

RATING: 4.5
Charming in the extreme, but not terribly deep or thoughtful.     
Each turn sees you moving meeple to the three board spaces that are clearly the most relevant to your interests, then rolling lots of dice to see if you get the things you need before dying.     With no way to influence dice rolls, or react to what comes up, forward progress is just pure luck.

RATING: 8
Beautiful artwork, fun, relatively simple gameplay.

First half of each round (day) is the more "thinky" - you need to plan your movements very carefully to make sure you end up with all your pawns in the right locations. This involves thinking a few steps ahead, looking at what your opponents need, and trying to keep your options open as much as possible to minimize the chances of you getting stuck in the wrong locations. This can be a bit AP prone for some, though not terribly.

Second half of each round (night) is the more "fun & light" part - here you just keep rolling dice, hoping for the best, and getting as much as you can done before either bailing out or getting exhausted. This part can be very satisfying, and sometimes quite tense - it all depends on your luck and on how you set yourself up during the day phase.

Overall, quite a bit of fun, and a pretty unique game in our collection. Very happy with this one!

Only criticism really is that the rulebook is quite difficult to follow. It's organization is unclear, and it's just full of small details scattered throughout its 20 or so pages. In fact, this was our first time *ever* that we've completely mis-interpreted the rules, and after one play we were so frustrated we nearly got rid of the game. Luckily we found out of our critical mistake, played again, and enjoyed it very much. However, the rules could definitely use some reworking, and the game itself is in dire need of some turn order / player aid / rule summary page. But other than that, we're pretty happy with this game.

RATING: 5
(+) Inoffensive, worker placement gameplay that gives incremental sense of RPG-like progression.  
(+) Whimsical, visually-appealing production.  
(+) Straightforward strategic paths to pursue, and interesting mechanisms present to keep you engaged on others' turns (dice rolls in night phase, mainly). 

(-) Very little player interaction outside of limited blocking and following.  
(-) Turns are repetitive.  
(-) Lacks depth, significantly.

RATING: 7.5
Another fun game in the Tiny Epic series. This one nails the theme that Kingdoms did, but with an actually satisfying game. The game offers players a multitude of ways to score points thereby offering players choices in how they want to approach the game. The game nails it thematically and through the art alone it can be seen that they took a lot of inspiration from the Legend of Zelda. Getting new items for your Meeple is one of the most satisfying parts of this game. The push your luck element for the night phase works out well and the fact that you put others in danger is a great mechanic too.

That all being said, the game is a little fiddly, has plenty of rules, and takes at least one game/round to learn and figure out what the heck you should be doing. After that it will go much smoother, but I would not recommend this to a casual audience like I would Galaxies. There's a lot of game in the box which is a good thing, but for a more casual group this game will be a little heavy and with a play-time of at least an hour, if not more with a new group.

Interesting game of action selection with a multitude of ways to score. Makes for interesting choices and the game feels tight enough due to the fact that you cant do everything you want. Only drawback I feel is the game is probably 1 round too many and feels like it drags a little. 

Pros:
- interesting choices
- A lot of game in a tiny box. High quality components

Cons:
- Game can drag
- A little swingy due to push your luck mechanic

A lot of strategy in the way there are multiple paths to acquiring points. I like it a lot more than Tiny Epic Westerns since the theme and feel match more to the game. The item-meeples really work and give a great fantasy feel to the overall game. Solo was good also, but it does turn into a push your luck style game.

RATING: 7.5
It's abstract, yes, but the theme is so gorgeus (Coimbra's art is just great) and so enjoyable that, once you've played a few turns, you don't mind it anymore. Its pace goes from very slow to absurdly fast from one round to the next, and the only thing that is missing is a little more interaction between players. Overall, a very funny and replayable game.

As a four player game this takes forever and is very chaotic. To play competently, you need to play ahead. A lot. But the environment changes all the time, so everyone has to ponder anew once it is their turn. The rapidly changing quests do not help at all.
The components are flimsy (ok, they would call it "tiny"). I am not a motorically inept person, but I find this way too fiddly in a motorical sense.
I find the hero meeples ugly.

The randomness of the Quests is the problem: as new quests are revealed, many are easily accomplished by the next lucky player or two. Four plays and no interest in playing again. Scoring system of beginning with negative points is never a good idea! It makes zero difference in the final scoring differential, so why start with an air of negativity? The idea of the display board for the special items is nice -- except they all fall out since the holes are bigger than the posts. Fail.

As is a recurring theme in the Tiny Epic series, the gameplay is fine, but a little too fiddly to be worth bothering with. I feel like the bright artwork hurts this one as I feel a bit overwhelmed when looking at the map despite there not actually being a lot going on.

Probably won't survive my next cull.

After about 3 months: This game is ok! Probably the best Tiny Epic Game yet. The game has a lot of rules though. Also, it's called T.E. QUEST. Shouldn't there be a boss fight at the end or something to make it feel like a quest? Instead, it's a points system that tells you who won. Maybe something to ponder on for the expansion, Gamelyn Games?

Had a not so great first game with four players, I like the art even though it was very similar and made it hard to tell the differences between the locations. With four players learning, it took 140 minutes with teaching and repeatedly looking at the rules. I hope that the games owner plays it a couple times and brings it back, maybe with fewer players it wouldn't take nearly as long?
I am fearful that I may have found a game designer that I just don't mesh with,  I have had similar experiences with his other games so it's very possible that I need to approach it from a different direction.

Going to give at a few more turns at the table and re-evaluate.

I like this game but I wonder how much I like the game vs the theme.  A link to the Past is my favorite video game of all time and this is clearly the unlicensed board game version.  Of course, I love the weapons and items and I really enjoy the push your luck mechanism.  I don't like the constant record keeping I have to do and heaven forbid I bump the table and my life and power meters get pushed.  Overall a very fun game.  My first of the Tiny Epic series.  Love the portability.

Culled - Second wave; Charity auction

Why we culled it: TEQ is a really neat design, and it does a better job than most at capturing some of the innocent magic of a game like Legend of Zelda (in fact, we refer to it as "Tiny Epic Zelda"). The game play is very different that one might expect, and it actually plays out more like a worker-placement puzzle game than a proper adventure quest. It works well, but it does take a second look. I'm not a big fan of the ITEMeeples, as I feel that they're really just a gimmick to sell the theme - they add nothing that the cards don't already provide, make policing the game more challenging, and just smack of a fan-service decision to justify second editions and cheese. TEQ was the tip of a now-apparent iceberg, and I'm already bored of it. In the end, this is a neat design, but due to its revelation as a worker-placement puzzle, we find that actually playing it never outshines other favorites. So off to a better home, where the many tiny plastic items may be better appreciated.

Tiny epic quests is a game where you're moving meeples around the board during the day, setting them up to accomplish things at night. Every round players each select a mode of transportation, which everyone then uses. There's more types of transportation than players, so not all of them will be used. They all have different quirks, either moving you vertically, horizontally, diagonally, around the edge of the board or one tile in any direction.

There's three main things you do in the game, fight goblins, discover temples (using either torches or scrolls depending on the temple type) or learn spells. At night each player rolls dice until they decide to rest, at which point their done for the round. Torches, scrolls and punches (to goblins) are shared by everyone, but power and damage are dealt out clockwise from the roller. Mushrooms increase the amount of magic in the air (good for learning spells) but also make damage worse and mean power can't be gotten.

The game ends up being a push your luck thing, hoping to stay in long enough to accomplish temples, spells or goblins before things go south and you start taking too much damage. If you ever get knocked out, you don't accomplish anything in that round (except maybe goblins?).

There are random quests that come out. Most of them involve finishing temples or having your meeples in certain configurations. Claiming a quest also gives you some equipment which grants you a special ability. Finishing your temples in the right order also gives you some equipment as well.

At game end, you consult the chart and see how many points you got which depends how many spells you accomplished, quests you finished and goblins you killed. The scoring rewards killing goblins most, and then quests over spells slightly. There's also points for having finished your temples (if you did them in the right order).

The main decisions in the game are what objectives to go after in a round and how to move to get them. Then it's just seeing the luck of the dice and deciding how long to push your luck. I didn't realize goblins scored significantly better than the other options, so in future plays I'd make them a priority. Overall, I just don't think there are many decisions to make in the game and none of them are really that deep or interesting. It was pleasant enough, and I enjoyed the play, but I don't see much reason to return to this game.

I think the Tiny Epic series is quite overrated. Although Tiny Epic Galaxies is a very great game but Tiny Epic Queat doesn't seem to have the same streamlined design and clever gameplay. During the game the game seems very abstract, you just have to move your meeples so they are in the right places, and during the night a push for your luck element. Neither of this mechanism seems to give what the game promise, a feeling similar to classical sandbox-rpg like zelda. I wouldn't even call this a sandbox game.

True to its name, TEQ packs a lot of game in a little box. Almost too much game. The decisions are surprisingly heady, despite their simplicity (ie pick a movement card, roll or rest). The game feels neat and s actually fairly unique. But I find the overall result lacking in the reward department. The ITEMeeples and Zelda-esque theme are the draw here.

A nice little puzzle/ adventure game.  For my part they could skip "tiny" and do some of the components bigger.

Fun game of maneuvering around the map in stage one and then trying to stay alive long enough to reap all your rewards in stage 2 of each round. Played 2 players and solo - enjoyed a lot as a solo as every turn felt more controllable.

Up to this point I've been pretty lackluster on the Tiny Epic line, I think they're all decent but nothing I'd prefer to play over bigger games.  The portability isn't much of a selling point for me.  

This is by far my favorite of the series, it's also the most unique.  I don't have that nagging feeling of "why play TEK when I can play Kemet?", or "why play TEG when I can play Emdo or Alien Frontiers?" There's not really anything else like TEQuest.  The push your luck element is fairly subdued but adds interest.  The board movement is really  interesting, and the toy factor is huge.  Fun game!

Really solid family game. It no longer needs to be "tiny". If it was a little larger, it'd be easier to read the map and players would take less time figuring out turns.

It's very hard to setup for 4 players so that everyone has great visibility to every necessary element to play the game. There's a lot of squinting for cards and fiddling with small components in this game. Sausage hands and people with slightly impaired vision be warned.

There's also quite a lot of rules frontload for how shallow the game ends up being. You have to make a lot of pretty meaningless and minor decisions throughout the game. These decisions feel meaningless because how effective your strategy ultimately is, is literally decided by a diceroll.

The theme is also a bit too Zelda-like and video gamey for its own good. It's not bad and will definitely be right up the right persons (Most likely one who wears a fedora and Zelda t-shirt) alley but it's just a bit too generic with its wide eyed elven adventurers and Forest Temples.

Despite these flaws I think it has a pleasant and brisk pace to it and the push your luck mechanics are reasonably fun.

It's also nice that compared to Tiny Epic Western it doesn't have all the meaningless and shallow take that elements and rather focuses on engine building and movement puzzles. Even if the engine you are building is not that great or exciting. Oh well...

After 1 play, at least on par with Galaxies for the best in the series. Might be the best yet.

I've come to learn that I'm not a fan of the Tiny Epic games. Though I think this one was the most enjoyable of the group. The game is easy to grasp but seems a bit fiddly at first. The quest cards seem to play a huge factor in scoring but can seriously hinder you if they pop up after you have already completed a certain temple. The biggest drawback is playtime. Each play of this has been nowhere near the 60 min stated on the box. And at the time invested I'd much rather play a larger box, much more involved game.

Played at BGG con. Very good fun game, some of the quests need a little work because the items can be too hard to get but they said they're still maybe reworking those a bit so I have good hopes.

I'm sure this will be my favorite of the Tiny Epic series.  Clever and creative use of the recognizable and distinctive game elements in a new fantasy setting.  We are suckers for big game punch in small packages and Quests delivers with the modular kingdom setup and movement choices to coordinate workers combos and quest formations.  Clever quest goals and two-stage quests, two-stage teching up, goblin threat and combat, and a clever new spin on sharing the resource dice rolls in a push-your-luck reward vs. damage with diminishing returns--All great.  Can't wait to wear this one out.

RATING: 8.1
First time playing a Tiny Epic series game (not into the idea of having purposefully small and fiddly components) but I'm a huge Zelda fan so I had to get this (honestly not sure how one can get away with making this due to copyright reasons; it that closely resembles Zelda).
I found the game to be a bit disappointing though (but only because I had such high hopes for it in the first place and not because I think it is bad). I kind of expected an epic adventure but the game really isn't all that epic after all. The push your luck element I felt was the key mechanic and the strategy element played a back seat role. I also feel there is very little to no player interaction (I did only play 2 players though and playing with more would help with this. And also there is a touch of interaction with the mushroom expansion but not enough). 
I feel the game is too heavy to pull off the gateway, light push your luck game eg like Incan Gold/Diamant but is ultimately too light to be much else. I think it lacks meat.
I also feel that the game is too expensive for what it s.
I still enjoyed it but if I wasn't such a big Zelda fan I would have passed this up and don't feel I would be missing too much. It might grow on me though.
I have only played with 2 so far though and I suspect playing with 3 or 4 would make this game better.

EDIT:
Played with 4 and it did feel better in my opinion. Still not as meaty or epic as I was hoping but it still packs a punch. Increased rating to 8.1 from 7.4 and it still may grow on me more.

First Kickstarter-backed game.

Good replayability, a lot of challenge in figuring out the best moves. The rules are indeed rather streamlined and don't take long to relay. Have to try out the expansions still. By and far best Tiny Epic game I've tried.

The only downfall is the fiddliness of all the little bits and pieces. I'm thinking about buying a sheet of plexiglass to put on top of the prepared boards.

Great game, but there is so much going on, that each player wants to spend a ton of time looking at the cards to plan their moves.  Playing the game fast while another player takes time will make you lose.  30-60 minutes is pushing it for 2 players.

Very interesting quest game... a lot of good ideas every where, excellent stuff. Everything should be perfect except for strange scoring  : 4 points for Legendary Items force player's strategy too much.
But overall, this game is really good !

Those cute little item meeples are the main draw of this game, but there is an enjoyable light questing game here too. Maybe a tad too repetitive but it doesn't really overstay its welcome so that may be okay depending on your tastes.  There is an obvious fiddliness from the tiny items but there is a bit of rules fiddliness that detracted from our fun. Mostly that my kids were constantly confused by the fact that the symbols on the dice not only didn't provide 1:1 benefits or negatives... but that what they did do kept changing as the magic level changed. Kind of a deal breaker as a family game for me, but I could see this being a pleasant little light adventure game with a group that played enough to make the dice effects more second nature.

Have played this twice now and have a better understanding of how it works.  I liked it much better the second time through as a three player.  This is surprisingly deep for a simple push-your-luck game.

A good change of pace but very fiddly with all of the pieces.  Sometimes I would prefer the Tiny Epic Games to be full-sized because I would enjoy them more than having to worry about knocking the little pieces around.

I found this very repetitive and frankly very boring. There are no interesting decisions nor deep gameplay whatsoever.  It's all driven forward with dicethrows. Giving the meeples little weapons is cute but I don't really care if the game is unepic and shallow. The theme is not represented very well. All orc fights are the same abstracted dial mechanism, spells are just track progressions and all temples are the same. The only ok'ish gameplay element is the travel and positioning of your meeples to fulfill some of the quests.

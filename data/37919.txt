Plays well, board can get a little frustrating while flicking spaceships (just need to hold down the gameboard, but sometimes you need extra hands as you try to make a really long and difficult flick). Started out making one extra move and kept on going until end. This Changed the course of the game more and more the game went on. Still fun and not too long.

A fun space empire 4X game!

Pros:
Flicking space ships around the board is not only fun, it removes the need for fiddly movement rules and considerably speeds things up. Short play time compared to other 4X games. Few rules and therefore new gamer friendly. Excellent components. Good tech tree. I like that its humans vs humans rather than alien races. Set up is fairly quick once the board has been put together. It's a lot of fun. 

Cons:
The board is a pig to put together.

RATING: 8
Only played it twice, but learned a lot between the first and second game.  Amazingly quick turns, lots of fun, and the flicking gives a lot of leeway and can lead to some happy accidents, like ending up blockading Josh on the far side of the board by accident.  

Only concern is if the board puzzle pieces fray or get dinged up, it ruins the playability.

This is an excellent 4X board game.  It is easy to teach, a lot of fun to play and progresses fairly quickly.  The jigsaw-puzzle based board poses a problem every now and then when flicking ships around the map.  If it weren't for that, I might give this game a solid 10.

RATING: 6
Much better than I expected. The flicking aspect is alright here - in some imagined childhood, I've played this part of the game before on my bedroom floor. But what takes it up a notch is the strategy layers building on planets by choosing development ladders. Still, all in all, it sits just below something I need to own.

Fantástico juego de gestión espacial con mecánica, entre otras, de las chapas! Usa tu destreza para mover a tus naves, colonizar, atacar y gestiona tus avances y mejoras como un euro. Muy original y sobretodo muy muy divertido! Probado con todo tipo de jugadores, hay que advertir que lleva a piques severos xD. Como crítica, pues que los turnos se vuelven muy repetitivos... una sensación más de la media, y que si no te gusta esa mecánica y el caos que genera... Pero a mi me resulta diferente, y risas aseguradas :)
Hay que cuidar el tablero, si se desgarran los bordes de las piezas de puzzle como me llegó al adquirirlo de 2a mano, porque no encajan a la perfección, las naves chocaran con los bordes y se podría volver menos jugable. Pendiente de hacerme un tablero propio de madera fina, hacerle los agujeros, y dibujarles las órbitas. Sería muy grande xD

RATING: 8.6
Surprise hit in my house.....I thought for sure this game would get played exactly once.  Yet my kids just love everything about it.  It's space, it's got tech trees, you can be confrontational or you can get busy constructing your own civilization.    Yet, despite all the rich gameplay, turns are lightning fast, often just a few seconds!  So once everyone gets into the rhythm of the game, I can spend a lot less time yelling "Go!" than I do with other games...

I think that's the heart of its appeal, the unique mix of flicking ships in space with enough options to allow each player to choose their own strategy.  In fact, my 8-year-old once tried a strategy of simply harvesting his own guys for VPs....and for awhile, it looked like it just might have paid off for him since everyone else was busy beating each other down.   

Really, this game defies analysis.  It does have a Euro feel, but with Ameritrash pacing.   It just plays so quickly that the game mechanics get lost in the fun.  And that's the way it's supposed to be!!

(It's unfortunate that the puzzle boards aren't better produced, however, we've all gotten used to checking the seams and holding them down prior to flicking our ships.)

I'm a big fan of dexterity games and this little "space flicker" is no exception. In ascending empires you build your galactic empire of colonies and space fleets by flicking pieces of wood across the star bedazzled abyss. I wish I had picked up a copy before it went out of print. I very much doubt we will see it again any time soon.

+ Your success depends both on your strategic play as well as your ability to flick your ships about the board with some measure of precision.
- Seems to lack some depth; Each play felt like a replica of every time before it.


Why it's previously-owned:
With 2 players, it's easy to get to a stale-mate of sorts for long chunks of the game. With more than 2, much of the game devolves into a diplomacy session where you are screwed if people gang up on you.
I traded this away in a big trade that included acquiring the tower-defense board game Dragon Valley. It'll be interesting to see if that game can hold its own.

Average components that work well but nothing fantastic. The board parts are really bad for flicking. 

An area occupying game that is dependent on how well you flick. Both an interesting concept and also an irritating part of the game. 

Extremely unsatisfying end game. Flicking around trying to do combat. Sad.

RATING: 7
You might think that a game based on flicking discs would result in something with too little strategy and a lot of weight placed on the skill behind flicking. But I don't think that's the full story for Ascending Empires. It's got just enough light civ mechanics backing up the starship flicking so that players have some real decision making to play the game.

The flicking doesn't feel tacked on nor do I feel unreasonably hindered by it. Smart, tactical decisions adhering to an overall strategy can theoretically mitigate a little bad flicking. 

Combat is still kind of weird, though. And if players are thoroughly terrible at flicking their ships 100% of the time, it will not end well for them.

Ideal strategy also forces players to gun each other down. There's always at least one sour tone to a game session of Ascending Empires, which is a little frustrating. It's a good game that causes some less than pleasant conflict at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really want to like this game.  But when you build an entire game around a dexterity element and try to add depth on top of it, your components need to live up to the basic part of the game.  The cracks between boards ruin it, and any potential for depth is lost.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
The initial play didn't impress me that much.  Most people seem to bitch about the finger-flicking part, complaining about "luck" just because they're not good at that sort of dexterity game.  That didn't bother me at all and, in fact, made it stand out a little.  The turns also move quickly so there's not much down time.  There seems to be a lack of balance in the game.  Using a battleship should be powerful, but really isn't.  Once someone has a city and a research station on a planet, you need a battleship AND two starships in order to attack, but with a maximum movement of 4, good luck getting everything there and being able to attack without having your move blocked.  And a starship can ram a battleship and take it off the board as if it were just another starship?  Why bother?   A battleship should be a little more useful against a planet and immune to ramming by starships or at least need to be rammed twice on the same turn to put off people from such a simple strategy for dealing with a battleship.

A very fun dexterity game. The tech tree adds serious strategy to the annexation of planets, while the need to flick navigate your ships makes it so the most tactical player cannot run away with the game. My biggest problem is that I think the mining action is overpowered at the end of the game. It would likely see more playtime if I didn't have such a hard time getting the jigsaw board to sit flat.

RATING: 6.5
This game is a bit hard to judge.  The use of dexterity for movement and combat is a nice element, but how much it dominates the game is unclear.  There are many ways that the game can be played strategically and different approaches to gaining VP.  Each approach requires a slightly different degree of physicality.  I suspect that the more the players know the 'easy' paths for VP, the physical element will play a stronger role in the game.  Combat isn't required, but without it the game seems to come in a little under expectations.  Still, there is a lot to like about the game play and to like.  The fact that the game isn't just crokinole in space is good thing.

Rating after one play with 4.

This to me seems to be a classic beer and pretzels game.  I enjoyed it, but there was nothing magical that grabbed me.  It seemed a little crowded with four, but I think that with fewer players there's going to be too much room to manuever.

I do like the big wooden disks for worlds, and nice components overall.

I can see game play getting a little static after multiple plays, but we will have to see.  Some people have concerns about the jigsaw style mapboard, but that wasn't a problem for me.

Shuffleboard in space. Use your disk flicking dexterity to master the universe! Part dexterity game, part space strategy game, this is like no other and is sadly not in print anymore. 

A shame, really, as it's clever and mixes the two elements quite well.

Euro-style mechanics with a dexterity element may be innovating, but so would raw-onion flavored ice cream or countless other products you don't find in the real world. Why? Because innovation does not always translate to something desirable... and this game is a perfect example of that.

From trying to lay the board-flat to actually playing this game... it is simply an annoying and frustrating experience.

the game starts out wonderful, but near the end it becomes tedious and slightly monotonous.  I really want to like it, but I'm not sure it is a "great game".  It is also far too long for what it is.  It took us about 3 hours to play our first game.  The board also felt too tight with four players.

Well. The strategy mechanics work well. They provide a fast and easy interactive game. The actual flicking though, does not work well. Particularly the small wooden ships flip on their side too often, rolling on the side with unpredictable trajectories. And the map sometimes obstructs movement on the interlocking sides. Overall it is balanced, a fast brawl in space with some minor development. If you're looking for fast interaction, that's it. I would recommend that the wooden ships should be plexiglass components or at least have more weight so they could be handled easily.

This game is a strange and unique (to my knowledge, at least) beast: it's at the same time a dexterity and a strategy game!
The rules are straightforward and very well written, but the (strategic part of the) gameplay is not so simplistic, and the choices are meaningful!
As regards the dexterity part: it is not overtly dominant (the planets are quite near, so no flick is difficult), it adds a fresh and unusual twist and, when a flick COUNTS, the tension of the shot IS a factor and... it's time for fun and laughter!
All these ingredients should be enough to characterize the game, but they're properly mixed to make 
Ascending Empires a game with a true story arc: everything starts slowly with exploration and easy points, then the tension adds up to a truly climatic finale...
This is not my ideal game, but it is different enough from everything else to merit its own spot on many collections...

Fast paced game which combines a low complexity space exploration/empire building game with a dexterity element. Easy to learn and great fun to play. There are some issues with the board laying flat but mostly this has no influence in the game.

Light 4X dexterity game, where you flick your space ships/ discs around the table to colonize planets, battle, etc.  Really neat; unfortunately, the four quadrants of the board would never line up quite properly, and the disc would clunk up against it half the time.  It's a brilliant idea, but that one component issue holds it back.

A fun game that I need to play again.  I have manual dexterity issues that I've had since I was a kid, so dexterity games can be quite difficult for me.  I really suck at crokinole!

RATING: 9
Great basic explore and conquer game with dexterity thrown to add the variability to movement.  Flicking is fun, although I'm not really sure how much it adds to the game beyond replacing a need for dice or cards -- which is not to say that it doesn't work great at doing that.

I use glass beads to fix the board problem. This is a cheap and easy solution and it works perfectly.

With that small change this game is amazing. It plays really fast, there's a ton of strategy, and it is crazy fun. I generally don't play war games but this one is fast and fun. The flicking helps lighten the mood.

RATING: 4
The puzzle-board design is enough to give this game a failing grade that the game play wasn't strong enough to overcome. The only way to end the game is by either building up our forces and annihilating the other guys, or by mining. Really, not much to the game play, but it always felt like maybe there was something waiting to happen to make it fun.

While the flicking is a nice mechanic, once we got used to the surface, we didn't find it that challenging (except for the seams in the board) because we've played a lot of [i]Crokinole[/i].

RATING: 7
Interesting game.  Has more depth that I expected for a "flicking" game.  The rules are too vague in key parts, but luckily, there is a FAQ which resolved the issues.  

The puzzle pieces not being perfect does hurt the game somewhat, but I think if you treat it like putting in golf, it resolves the issues.

I really like games that incorporate dexterity into the base mechanics.  Ascending Empires is one of the most brilliant games to come out in the last decade.  The shame is that the components just don't work for a dexterity game.  I've played on a custom board before and it was amazing.  ZMAN should kickstart a deluxe version of this long forgotten gem.

I like the speed at which the game moves - turns speed by.  There are also lots of different things to pursue - which is good fun.  I think everyone needs to understand that depleting the VP pool is vital - not just building a big empire.

The dexterity element is a lot of fun.

Some novelish mechanics, but it's hampered by a horrible rulebook and a game that really drags in the beginning, and then drags in another way at the end.  In addition, making this a puzzle board was a really bad solution.  The board pieces should have been bigger to keep it smooth and reduce the seams.

All of this from someone who rates Crokinole a '10'.  It just overstays its welcome.

RATING: 5
A simple 4X game with a flicking movement system that has much greater strategic and tactical depth than you expect.  I don't care for it.  I lose interest long before the game is over.  The game doesn't end until the VP tokens are all taken.  The main way to get tokens is destroying each other's ships & planets, but nobody really wants to do that until they have built up their power base.  But if you let players build up their planets they become difficult to attack - and so the game takes a long time to complete.  It's probably a "groupthink" problem, and more experienced players will develop a more effective strategy, but I'll never reach that point because I just have no interest in playing it that many times.

Well, it works, but the limited options open to you mean that everyone will be pretty close in point scores unless they weren't paying attention when the victory conditions were described.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This game draaaaaaaaaags. It takes so long to accomplish anything it's almost unbearable. The turns for each player are quick, but in a way they feel TOO quick - I don't feel like I'm doing enough on my turn for it to really be fun, and the fact that everything is so broken down into different actions is what makes it take so long to actually DO anything.

I'm sure we could come up with some house rules to speed things up, but as-is I wouldn't say this is really a good game. I like the terrain on the board you can flick into / off of, but the board and pieces don't actually lend themselves to flicking very well so often when you mess up a flick it feels like it's just because of poor component design and not YOUR bad shooting. Ugh.

I'm not sure I like mining being a way to get VP. Particularly because you seem to be at a disadvantage if you go after someone who's sitting around mining, as then you leave yourself open to attacks from other players. The only way to win against someone who's ignoring everybody else is for everybody else to band together, but the game doesn't really reward that.

The rest of the game is pretty engaging though - there's some cool choices regarding which planets you pursue, etc.

Simple 4X game with a dexterity mechanic. Really fun and the hybrid of dexterity and 4X works really well. The only downside are the board links that disturbs the travel of your discs.

Sounds like it has potential as a fast play scifi civ building game.  Also, Space flicking.

Really enjoyed first play, rating will likely rise with additional plays.  Quick, fun, little downtime and plays in the time advertised on the box.

I watched a third play last night and have concluded this is a very good, well balanced game.  The tech levels are all useful, and each tree can be leveraged to great advantage if a player is paying attention.  The mistake that seems to be prevalent is trying to achieve a specific tech, rather than adapting to the planets available.

Ascending Empires is a strange and unique game... a flicking game with a fairly meaty game behind it. I admire the design of the game. And while I thought I would enjoy the flicking aspect the most, I got more out of the tech tree and building choices.

The one knock on the game for me is the flicking and how it's implemented with the components. The ships are small, and they roll over fairly easily. The publishers have made a valiant effort to keep the board flat and playable, but even the slight ridges in the interlocking pieces can mess up a shot.

I'd gladly play this again to see if flicking ships gets easier, but I don't need to own it. But heck... a space-conquest-tech-tree-flicking game? Who'd a thunk it!

Can be fun with the right group, but has some glaring issues. The most obvious of these is the (deliberate?) lack of balance in the level 4 tech powers.

Fun game. People I played with thought the design was a little broken, favoring the military track too much. I saw the point, but don't know if I agree or not. Many have complained about the pieces not laying flat and that is absolutely true. I saw a lot of copies at Origins and none of them were completely flat. The last copy I saw at CABS had one board that was warped almost 5 degrees. It was a show-stopper for me. It's a shame because I love the idea.

I love dexterity games. I love 4x space games. But I'd never dreamed of combining the two.

This is a fun game to play, with fairly straightforward rules and a very good player aid. Our first game was a little over an hour. 

I was surprised at the amount of depth there.  Its a bit of a crapshoot as far as exploration goes and which planet types you find conveniently located. But its certainly possible to focus on a particular type and march up the tech tree.  The tech tree developments give you some variety of strategy that I really find enjoyable and thought-provoking. 

Don't forget about mining! Those VPs are not trivial at all.

We had the most laughs of any of the games we have played lately with Ascending Empires.  
Yes, the board can be a pain.  We had a person who wasn't flicking hold down the board if it was sticking up where we wanted to fly to.
There are many paths to earn victory points, so I think this game will stay fresh for quite a while.
I invented the 1mm rule...if your ship didn't move over 1mm when you flicked it, you get another try, lol.

Instant fun.  So different from everything else I own – flicking mixed with galactic empire building.  Who would have thought.  This is easily a winner, maybe not for the most entry level of gamers I play with but from the medium to heavy gamers this is a nice diversion from rolling dice and drawing cards.  I’ve seen a surprising number of strategies but science is very very important.  A few regular players are just beginning to take this into the territory where we are anticipating our plans far in advance and taking the changing board into account as well.  A lot of fun, if there are a few games going on at once, this one is generally one of the loudest and usually pulls over other players to watch.

Totally surprised at how much fun this game was. Of course you have to fix the problem of the board to totally realize that this game with flicking + 4x space = fun. Some incredible moments when a ship does things you wouldn`t think were possible. Sure serious gamers won`t understand its potential , but if you have a heart like a young Luke Skywalker then you can appreciate its simple yet mesmerizing appeal.

Don't be put off because this is partly a dexterity game.  Your ability to flick your ships around matters only for the movement action, and even then you can keep your flicks pretty conservative to avoid messing things up.

UPDATE: Played with 4, got my butt kicked and afterward understood exactly what I'd done wrong. Tempted to drop a 10 on this puppy. . .

UPDATE: Finally played with three players. The board seams had almost no effect on the flicking this time. The combination of simple mechanics and elements hits a very, very sweet spot. An up-the-rating-to-9.5 sweet spot. This game is a Well Oiled Fun Machine.

UPDATE: Played again, and the weird effects of the board joins on the discs may have actually added to the fun. The game is too light to take so seriously.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

A truly awesome design, but the puzzle-cut board is an ergonomic disaster. It really affects the spaceship flicking. It didn't bother me *that* much, but my opponent today just couldn't handle it and we stopped in the middle. Why oh why didn't they use a regular folding 1-piece board? I'm half tempted to make one myself. I love everything else about the game, but I'm docking a point for that.

On the plus side, for a multiplayer space empires game, it works really well with only 2 players.

This is probably my highest rated game that I won't buy. The game itself is a ton of fun. You get to play a full blown 4X-game in a very short period of time. Everything is there: You get a tech-tree, diverse building options, space fights and exploration. There is nearly no downtime between your turns as every move plays out very fast. On top of that you have the flicking mechanism that gives the game a really unique feel.
But yet, I guess I won't add the game to my collection. The problem is the board, or more precise the joints between the single pieces of the board. In the copy I use to play with it's nearly impossible to cross a joint so that it won't deflect your ship. Long shots aren't really possible this way and even short ones between two boardpieces are far more difficult than they should be. We tried everything to solve this problem but couldn't. Too bad, since I really, really like this game.

An overlooked little gem. It's fast-paced and exciting with a nice narrative arc to it. The dexterity element is fun and adds an element of novelty, but sound strategic and tactical decisions matter much more in determining victory. The dexterity element just adds that extra point of uniqueness and quasi-randomness that helps this stand out from a crowded thematic space.

Good but not great.  The flicking is an odd addition to what is a fairly tight action economy optimization game.  Because of that, random flicking failures can be frustrating and pivotal.  3-player felt as if it had kingmaking issues but 4-player was a fun diversion.

A dexterity game where the pieces are tall cylinders so they fall over, and the surface is ill-fitting jigsaw pieces so nothing can ever slide true.  The production value is so low that this game is literally unplayable, and that is what a 1 is.  Not a game if the core mechanic is to hit a crack and roll slowly off the table.

RATING: 6
Ascending Empires is a dexterity/strategy game that can be played with anywhere between two and four players, but based on the logistics of how the board is set-up, I can’t imagine it working as well with three as it would with two and four.

Thematically and mechanically it owes a lot to the 4x genre of game, though I hesitate to call it a 4x game; this may simply be because a fellow player is a huge 4X video game fan and had problems with it as a 
4X, as a 4X themed game he was fine with it (I don’t understand either).

On a player’s given turn they can perform one action from a menu of actions that should found fairly familiar:
1) Deploy soldiers to planets they control
2) Construct research facilities, colonies, and cities on controlled planets using a mixture of soldiers and, in the case of a city, colonies.
3) Research a new level of technology based on how many research facilities they have on different colored planets
4) Use soldiers to mine a planet, getting straight up victory points
5) Move
Now, the movement phase is a bit more complicated than the others in that you get a certain number of movement points (i.e. action points) that you can divide up between three types of movement actions however you like
1) Remove a soldier from a planet and put a space ship in orbit around the planet
2) Remove a ship in orbit of a planet back to your supply to place a soldier on the planet; this only works if no one else occupies the planet
3) Move a ship by flicking it across the board

Battles happen automatically at the end of the active player’s turn, assuming that ships, the only thing that can attack, are in range of other ships or planets. Battle results are handled with simple majorities ruling, as starships require two other ships in range to destroy and planets can be cleared of structures if the number of attacking ships exceeds the planet’s defense value. 

The game continues until the victory point pool (emptied out by researching technologies before anyone else, mining, and destroying other people’s ships in battle) is emptied out.

All in all, I found it to be entertaining and fun, with the gigantic twist provided by the flicking mechanic to give the game a bit of freshness that you wouldn’t expect in a ninety minute space civilization game. It has a bit of a worker placement feel in the building sets of single actions up into a larger, cohesive string and the manuevering performed around grabbing planets and hitting technologies first (significant, growing bonus points are available to the first player to learn a level of any given tech).

One concern that was expressed by the above player is that the game rewards turtling a little bit too much, but on further analysis I don’t think that is right. I won by a sizeable margin (10+ points above the second place person out of 32) and part of the reason I was able to succeed is that I was able to perform a successful early aggression, grabbing a planet that someone else already had and then establishing myself on it. This let me out tech the others (I was the only one to get a level 4 technology), helped me build better infrastructure (slightly, this does not feel like a snowball game), and overall gave me a definite edge over the others. 

I think that the technologies and variance in the (seeded) game board set-up is going to result in a lot of replay potential, as there seems a lot of possibility in both technology combos and on the board strategy. 

Further plays have shown that while there is some variance in techs and board set-up, what you specialize in is largely defined by what you find in your proximity. It is still fun as a more casual and quick game, but I am finding that if I want to play a flicking game I just grab my crokinole board, as it has all the tension of Ascending Empires without the overhead.

Players represent an empire in space, starting in their own corner of the board, and expanding out across the galaxy.  Breezy, super-quick play game where players take one action (which takes about 15 seconds), then pass the turn on to the next player.  Actions are recruit troops out to your planets, build structures, research technology, mine resources (VP's), or the fun bit, move.  Movement is by flicking your wooden ships across the board to land on other planets, allowing you to expand and grow.  Basically, a tech-tree/expansion game, with the flicking gimmick seamlessly solving problems of distance and movement factors.  Game is over when a pool of victory points is depleted (earned for mining, or conquering opponents), with a few bonus points picked up for structures at the end of the game.  Simple, fast, fun - what's not to like.

The dexterity mechanic in this is a novel way to approach space exploration and conquest. I had fun with it, but I can see how it could be frustrating if you wind up with unhelpful planets near you or you just have bad hands.

How come every time I teach my brother a new game he always wins?  Exploring, battling, and colonizing by flicking - a mechanic that I feel, for the first time, accurately imitates what it would actually feel to zip through space.  This is a very fun game if you don't take it too seriously.  If you do take it seriously then flicking foibles, passive players that let aggressive players have the board without a fight, and not finding the planets you want can really be frustrating, but hey, that's the game!  The flicking will probably make or break this game for you as the whole game really depends on how much you embrace slap shotting a wooden disc with your pointer finger around this pinball machine of a game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a tough one for me to rate.  I've played this game roughly twice, (one 2P and one 3P that we had to call) and I enjoyed it.  

The Pros: I like the slow buildup; you begin the game by mostly leaving your opponents alone while you try to explore and develop research facilities.  There may be the occasional blockade but for the most part, everything seems friendly.  And then, you realize that there are never going to be enough points awarded through exploration to end the game, so you start looking around at your opponents planets.  This is where the game shines.  Combat is incredible and basically boils down to luck.  Can you flick your ships over to a weakly defended area and destroy it before your opponent fortifies?  I can't tell you how many times my ship went rocketing off the board (and therefore back to my supply) while trying to crush my husband's grey planet.  Frustrating at times, but this is a dexterity game.  Part of the fun is you can't completely control the trajectory so you can make some incredibly hilarious, unexpected attacks.

The Cons:  This game does not have enough rules!! Seriously, I know it's new but it's incredibly hard to find any help online for clarifications.  For instance, the rules state you can 'strike' a ship.  Okay, what does that mean?  Is it basically a push with less guidance?  Early on I challenged my husband's definition of a strike, so we ended up playing the whole game with just flicks (which really screwed me).  It wouldn't hurt to have a few pictures of 'legal' striking motions.  

For me, this game is TOUGH because I have incredibly unsteady hands (an inherited trait in my family).  Anyone playing against me has to be extremely generous with what counts as a flick because I probably hit each piece 1-2 times before it actually moves just as I try to hold my hand still.  Now I knew it would be a challenge, but after two games, I think I may just have to sit this one out until we clarify how to 'strike'.  

Finally, the game can bring out some hostility.  Early on, one of my opponents really used the ramming to his advantage, much to the anger of our third player.

So, if you're okay with not always getting the results you want when moving, and understand the basic point of the game is to engage and attack, definitely give this one a go.

Flicking through space. The colours of the planets are near impossible to tell apart for the colour-blind, but other than that, exploring with the chance of a bad flick and upgrading your character tech tree is fun. The late game is very developed and exciting, most players will be within a few points of each other and it gets easy to pick on the leader. It really comes down to whoever can squeeze out a few points.

45-60m, best with 4 players. 5+ plays.

I'm in love with the concept of this game. The perils of space flight, simulated with a flick. In yer standard Euro, there is a mitigation of skill with some sort of luck. Usually, this is done through the luck of the draw, the draw of a cube, or the roll of the die. In Ascending Empires, this is done through the skill of the flick. Ultimately though, this title is hamstrung by the substandard quality of the board.

It's simple, this game is the best game ever made, it's my favourite one. A real 4X game which can be played in less than 90mn.

Why do I use real 4X wording?
Often pretented 4X games have 1 of the activities of 4X missing, in this one you really have everything.
eXplore the planets around you and try to gain ownership of strategically placed planets.
eXtends your domain and try to block other player or put pressure on them by clever positionning.
eXploits your planets and develop new technologies that can give you key advantages during the game.
eXterminate your neighbours at the right moment to be the dominant domain in the universe.

Additionally, no need to refer to the rule book, everything is on each player board.

Of course there's the pitch factor to move ship around the universe which can frighten players but the pitch will never make you win or loose. The strategy of your development and your adaptation to what is done by other players is the more important factor in this game.
Pitch add fun and is also a risk management factor. Do you just go to the nearest planet (almost 100% success) or do I try to make a difficult move with my ship to establish a colony in the middle of my opponent territory to put pressure on him and force him to protect all his planets ?

A must try.

The only drawback, you will want to have it and it is now almost impossible to get as there is no reprint.

At first glance, Ascending Empires seems like the kind of game that I should love. Space-themed? Check. Planetary conquest? Check. Direct player conflict? Check. A flicking element for movement? Check. Plays in an hour? Check.

But somehow, the game has fallen flat most of the time I've played it. After two 2-player games, one 3-player and one 4-player, the only time I'd be willing to go back and play would be with the full complement of players. Ascending Empires needs conflict and tension to keep you interested, and with 2 or 3 there is too much room to maneuver around and avoid other players as much as possible.

Ascending Empires does a lot of things well. I especially like the range of actions you can take; there is a lot of variety in deciding just how you want to go about taking over the galaxy. And limiting players to just one action per turn practically eliminates downtime. The components are top-notch for the price, and the player aid has (nearly) everything you could want on it. I've only had to refer to the rulebook once, for rules on blockading and defending. Also, competing for a defined pool of victory points is a great way to make sure the game doesn't run too long.

But there are significant flaws, too. The puzzle board doesn't assemble very well, and it's annoying to have your ship go careening off when it hits a raised edge. A lot of the movement in this game relies on careful flicking and placement, so having issues with the board is a big deal. Also, the dexterity element isn't quite as prevalent as the box would have you believe. Don't get me wrong; you'll be doing a lot of flicking at planets and other players' ships, but most of your time will be spent putting troops on planets, turning troops into research facilities, turning colonies into cities, and so on. I don't think it's a flaw of the game, but I had different expectations going in.

One of the biggest problems with a 2- or 3- player game is that it's far faster to turtle and build up an empire instead of actually attacking the other players. Putting cities and colonies on as many planets as possible will give you a huge point bonus at the end of the game. But with fewer players, it's much easier to have two people fighting each other while one person slips on by. Obviously you need to be aware of that possibility, but even just a few turns of back-and-forth "I attack your stuff, then you rebuild and attack my stuff" will give the third player a large advantage. In addition, the victory point bonuses you get for researching technology first encourage a large amount of turtling, especially at the beginning. Explore your sector, don't bother with the asteroids, and get your tech bonuses as fast as possible.

Ascending Empires needs players need to be really aggressive to keep other players from pulling ahead. However, you aren't necessarily increasing your position; you're decreasing your opponent's. Your relative position might not be different, but it's still faster to grab VPs by doing your own thing. It's an anti-prisoner's dilemma; players do better through cooperating (turtling) instead of defecting (attacking).

Also, sometimes you want players to come in and take your stuff. Your tech bonuses aren't removed if your research facilities are lost, and if you're pursuing an initial generalized strategy (some of each tech color) to get the bonus ships and/or troops, you'll eventually want to free up those research facilities to allow you to specialize in a color or two. It can be worth the VPs gained by an opponent to turn around and place your research facility on a third or fourth planet of one color, especially if no one else has researched that level of technology yet.

As such, this game isn't as interesting as it should be. Instead of being forced to make hard or interesting decisions, you're encouraged to play nicely with each other. Really aggressively play is more fun, but you're also fighting the game system by doing so.

Also (this is just my opinion), some of the tech paths are seem a bit more powerful than others. In our games, the first player to hit the gray tech level that allows you to take a move *and* a second action has quickly run away with the lead. Being able to get to gray depends on your starting setup, and it's quite possible to have three research facilities on gray planets in your starting quadrant within the first dozen turns.

Finally, even though there's a limited pool of VPs, the game comes to an abrupt end. That's one thing that really bothered me about Starcraft; just as you were getting your tech tree going and qualifying for really cool bonuses, the game was over. It's a minor fix to expand the number of VPs needed to end the game, but I think that adding a few turns wouldn't increase the game time all that much.

Ascending Empires is a mixed bag. I would happily play it again with 4 players, it's just not good enough for me to keep in my collection. It's a shame, too; I had really high hopes for this game. But it doesn't do what I want well enough. Perhaps with more plays I'll grow to like it a bit more.

I really like this as a light 4X game despite the board issues. I want to make a custom board with no edges, but I am not sure if that will ever get done. The technology may not be balanced, but it really does not matter. If you get to a level 4 and no one else does, you will probably win.

We have now made a custom board and I find that it is really nice to not have those seams. Flicking starships is still hilarious or infuriating depending on whether it is you or your friends who are flicking.

I like the mechanics and the strategies...I hate the quality of the tiles. That's a deal-breaker in a dexterity game. The abstraction of temporal rifts or whatever is inexcusable.

If the tiles laid flat (without assistance) and did not fray at the puzzle joints so easily, this would be a superior 4x game, as it it is a good idea undone by poor quality components.

Fun tech building Euro with a heavy dexterity element thrown in.

Major demerit for the board though. The pieces don't fit together well creating lots of bumps that pieces have a hard time getting over.

Another well-received game from Z-Man.  

Set in outer space, it is a combination of dexterity and strategy with a lot of combat for area control. 

The game adjusts for 2-4 players, but we liked it best with four--there was more combat.  Also, you can modify the game so combat is heavier.  

Players were so pleased with the game we started discussing ways to make the board better-- 9, mid-weight puzzle pieces fit together in a large board.  Z-man warns of warp-age and provides two gel packs and a large reseal-able bag to protect the pieces from moisture.  Our boards were not warped.  However, the joints still created some rough spots for the star ships which a player flicks across the board.  This doesn't bother me--I think you have to learn how to become expect flickers and jump over these spots.  Others disagreed and thought plexiglass would work with round holes drilled where the planets fit (a round hole bit costs less than $10).  If this became a game you wanted to play often, this is perhaps a good idea.

Each player's turn moved very quickly.  Rules are nicely written and straight forward.  Play is not difficult.  There are several strategies to winning, and always more desirable choices than available actions.  

Photos don't do the game justice--looks much nicer and more interesting when it is laid out in front of you.  Each player has a board with a design that is helpful for play--this is of course what you expect with a player board, but it doesn't always happen.  

This is the store's copy and I know this one is going to be hitting the table.

I like the tech tree very much, as well as the distribution of the planets in each sector, which makes for a different game each time. But attacking one another is a bit more awkward and it also doesn't help that bumping the board junctions makes your ships lose balance. For a game depending a lot on dexterity, it's a shame that you've got a hard time executing your movements because of the surface.

My main gripe is on defending a planet, though. When it becomes obvious another player is going to attack a certain planet, all you need to do is place a spaceship there to defend it, best on the other side of the planet, so they have to move around to reach it. It'll take the other player a couple of turns to wipe out that spaceship. In the meantime you can recruit new troops on that or a nearby planet and the next turn launch new spaceships, bringing it into orbit of the planet that needs to be defended. To make it even worse, a player having specialized in the purple technology is simply almost unbeatable as at level 2, ramming his spaceships gives him victory points and at level 3 his spaceships in orbit are worth double.

Ascending Empires is a multiplayer conflict game with a twist. Well... It's actually much more than a twist because the starship flicking part is crucial to your space empire's success. It arguably is the game. The remaining game elements like construction and research are kept very simple, and this combined with only one action per turn makes for a pleasantly quick and lightweight game.

So how about the conflict part? Battles are decided by simple majorities, and the game rewards aggressiveness by awarding victory points for destroyed ships or structures. Since most losses can be compensated fairly easily, long or intense conflicts can actually be mutually beneficial instead of the usual death sentence.

If you like both multiplayer conflict and flicking then this is probably a good fit. If you only like one or the other, there are obviously better options around, and although I wouldn't refuse to play it if it was proposed I would almost always reach for a "real" flicking game instead.

A cozy, fast paced space 4x game.  The brilliance of the design is that each player only gets one action on their turn, which creates incredibly short downtime between turns.  The dexterity element is really very cool and makes this one stand out over the regular space adventure game crowd.  This game is really much more tactical than strategic, but it is meant to be a light space romp, rather than a heavy, exacting game.

I was taken with just how cool this game is.  I expected it to be a pointless flicky game--most of which of those I'm not a fan.

But the gameplay is fast and smooth, the flicking important but not the absolute dominating element of the game, there's a great mix of building, tech research, and combat, lots of interactivity.  It's not the best game ever, but hot damn if it isn't fun.

This has pretty much all the things I like in a board game. Not that it is common-place, but because it takes some common Catan-like mechanics, Crokinole-like dexterity and development "rule breakers" and just ties them together in a really enjoyable game. The turns go by nicely so you are never left waiting too long for your turn to come. The game can feel a bit samey at the beginning, with everybody doing the same thing.  But by the middle game, most of the planets are taken over and turns get rather varied.  By the end, it can be an all-out war to crush or be crushed, and VPs get sucked up like a ship to a black hole.  AE is nothing too deep, but definitely a real fun game and something I think a lot of people could get into. It's just fun to fly through space with the flick of the finger and get shit done!  Scales quite nicely and is one of the few games of this type that plays well with 2 players.  Some minor production issues, but otherwise, this is one of my favourite dexterity games!

The flicking aspect is fun -or frustrating-but glass beads for ships work much better, as mentioned elsewhere. The rest is kind of meh- the tech trees becomes fairly dull after a few plays, and the rest of the game becomes a bit unexciting over time. My boards never warped and the wooden discs flick quite well, so obviously there are differences in production, or folks just don't store them properly.  I did see that someone printed out the board onto a neoprene (mousepad) mat sized 36” x 36” & cut holes for planets- seems like a great idea. At any rate, it's fun for a bit, but then gets stale. 

Sold, but may re-acquire one day. Wasn't too crazy about the combat (flicking mechanism turned off some). But I still miss the game now.

This really turned out to be an awesome game. Even though the puzzle game board sucks and doesn't fit together right and warps easily. I'm still glad to have bought the game and hope to make my own replacement gameboard some day.

This game is fun and well thought out. I love dexterity games to begin with, but that's just one little element in the game. There's so much more going on and to try and plan for. Exploring, colonizing, research and development, building up and expanding your colonized planets and of course battling in space. Just an all out joy to play. I'd highly recommend this game to everyone, if you can get past the crappy game board.

RATING: 6
Neat little space game, but the flicking element is far more chaotic and frustrating than I expected.  Rather than having control similar to other flicking games like Pitch Car, et. al., the pieces are small, light, top heavy cylinders, racing over 9 board pieces, all with seams.  Each of those characteristics would be an issue, but put together, they make the flicking awful.  Based on several plays with different groups, it is normal for pieces to bounce, roll, radically overshoot, or otherwise move unexpectedly.  It's a strange dichotomy as the strategic elements are tightly balanced, and the dexterity portion is highly unpredictable.

Interesting space empire building game.  The economic engine is stripped back to its essentials and runs well.  The Crokinole-flicking for movement adds a necessary random component, though can severely disadvantage a player if they have poor control though.  Needs to be played in the right (not to serious) frame.  Also the game pretty much forces you into attacking others, which may not suit some.

For all of us looking for the "simple" galactic empire builder, this is probably as close as we'll get. Sure, it's stream-lined (low on diplomacy...meh, who needs that when you've got the ability to flick-kamikaze other ships!), but the essential elements for the almighty space game are here. The early game kind of crawls along, but after a few turns you start to see things grow and before you know it, it becomes extremely tight! That's when the confrontation and fun really kicks in.

The board is kind of funky and you WILL have at least one messed up shot because of it, like everyone says...I'm not really sure why they chose this over a few square tiles that you just line up next to each other.

Other Components: Amazing for the price! Wood discs for ships/planets. The four player boards are better than some mounted game boards.

I enjoy the dexterity part of the game. The tech trees are simple and interesting enough. What I dislike about the game is that it seems quite difficult to play aggressively.

Most 4X space games use dice to introduce an element of tension and memorable risk-taking, to spice up the heavy strategy. This game achieves the same thing with a much more thematic mechanic: flicking your ships across the galaxy. And I LOVE IT.

The rules are beautifully straightforward, and there are at least four different strategies which seem well balanced and are really fun to play (balanced tech, single tech, cities, military aggression). But your best laid plans may fall victim to the high level of interplay (and, sometimes, bare-faced screwage), so adaptability and opportunism are often what win the day.

I love the 4X genre, I love space games, and this elegant masterpiece is my favourite in both categories.

Bought in October 2014 (for £10!).

A civ-building game with a dexterity component set in space. Players colonize planets and gain resources in order to research technologies for both better actions and victory points. The universe is navigated by flicking wooden disk spaceships across the board to reach new worlds.

The board issues are regrettable, but somewhat overstated--it is rarely in your interest to do a shot 2+ boards away, and careful assembly mitigates the seams significantly. You can also swap glass stones for the starships if desired.
It's quick, it does all of the 4X, and it is pretty. You can minimize or emphasize the dexterity aspect to a certain extent, so you can alter your approach depending on how you feel about flicking. A very solid and innovative design.

RATING: 7
Fast, streamlined 4X space game with a flicking component (?!). Each player gets one action per turn, with a maddening amount of choices.  Exploiting inefficiencies with other players while minimizing your own will result in victory.  

I've played twice now (once as a two-player, once with four) - and to me 4 players is the only (best) way to play this game. 

Interaction is forced early and often with exploraing, resource/civ building, and tech-tree upgrades. It's the type of game where you must be aware of your neighbors and make conscious efforts (either solo or with the group) to monitor any one player that is amassing too much territory, strength, or resources unchecked. 

A player that is able to do whatever they want without prevention or intervention from other players can make hay and take advantage. "NIMBY" strategies fail in this game.

As for the flicking - I know that's been the outrage or acclaim that this game polarizes, but it adds not only a lot of fun to the experience, but intuitive, thematic gameplay. 

Ships cost movement points to introduce to the gameboard. Flicking is how ships move through space on the board. Combat (ship-to-ship or ship-to-planet) is resolved *after* movement, checking proximity and majority to determine who wins or loses.  Caroms, rolls, skips, hops, and "whiffing" on your flicking all count. If two ships collide due to a flick, both ships are destroyed (returned to your supply).  Going off the board in any way for any reason means your ship is "lost in space" (returned to your supply).

Because inefficiencies will limit or punish you, flicking and combat (i.e. losing a ship, or not being able to move it effectively) can really make you inefficient, which is why you must weigh the costs and risks with each move or attack. So the flicking, even though there's dexterity at stake, is still baked into the spirit of the game.  And it leads to some fantastic suspense, tension, and humor during the game.   

With flicking, it's married to the game's theme in that space travel is imprecise and unknown - and there's a lot of tension and suspense built up in certain strategies that *depend* on a successful flick. Lots of humor too with all our excuses as to why and how the ships moved - or in many cases, didn't move - successfully. 

This isn't a standard review, more my thoughts on it.  Bottom line - play this game with 4 players, no less, if you want the best experience.  And as for the flicking, even if you aren't a fan or expert, it's still well worth playing this game because it's never a make-or-break proposition during the game.

The newly infamous 4X Space/Flicking game, this one is a quick and fairly brutal little game, with a decent amount of strategy, but randomness brought in by the dexterity element.

I started this one at a 7, after one solo 2-player play; after a 2nd solo 4-player play, I am tempted to ding it .25 for the same puzzle board edge issues that many others have also complained of.

The game is still good fun, but the effect of the board edges does take some steam out of it by effectively preventing longer, go-for-broke shots.  (Or at the least I need to play this on a flatter table... )

Un juego emocionante, como muy pocos. En este se intenta conquistar la galaxia lanzando pequeños círculos de madera mediante toques con el dedo, éstas representan  las naves de cada facción, las cuales buscaran explorar, colonizar y atacar diferentes planetas. Simultáneamente se intenta hacer una carrera tecnológica construyendo centros científicos en determinados planetas que permitirán transformar ese  conocimiento en únicas tecnologías, las cuales permitirán beneficios en el transcurso del juego.

Sería genial que se crearan expansiones que generen un poco más de sabor al juego, como por ejemplo áreas alienígenas con efectos, oleadas de asteroides u hoyos negros...

I'm a huge fan of crokinole (and nobody will play against me because I don't know how to lose), so this is the next best thing.  Civilization + Crokinole = pure awesomeness!

After our first few 2-player games, we're trying to figure out how to reduce the power of battleships.  Between that and the need for a seamless board, and this game will be a 9+.  Tons of fun to play, easy to teach and learn, and scratches the 4X game itch in under 2 hours!

We made a custom seemless board in spring 2012.  Official variants ("wormholes") makes long-distance exploration even easier.  This game is among my all-time favourites.

I flippin' love this game.  I'm a big fan of civ-building games with tech trees, but games like that typically take a loooong time (4+ hours) and have lots of boring down-time between turns.  Ascending Empires is a tech-tree civ-builder, but takes much less time to play (2 hours, tops.  If you're being really slow about it.) and is a flicking game, so it's really fun to watch, even when it's not your turn.

I truly can not say enough nice things about this game.

This was the best "dudes on a map" game I've probably ever played.  And yet, I still really disliked the genre I believe.

I only played it once.  It still just became "Let's you and him fight so I can win."  It just didn't add enough to get over that.  However, it did add a lot:

Small incremental turns that move fast.
A cool tech tree.
Super-fun flicking and combat.

But still, just don't fight and you'll do well :)

Rating after 1st play.  All you Nancy's who complained about the board - suck it up.  I found that putting the board together carefully and finding the best fit for each corner eliminated a lot of the issues, and having one person hold seams flat while another flicks removed most other potential problems.

Gameplay is fast, fun and offers lots of chances to interact with other players, or not.  You can play ultra aggressive and have a chance at winning.  You can play ultra conservative and have a chance at winning.  It all depends on how the other players are playing the game, and how much you want/need to disrupt them at the expense of your own strategy.

An absolute broken mess of a game. Dexterity based movement combined with Euro-style scoring and combat resolution mechanics. But it's too fiddly to be a fun Euro, the dexterity mechanic is regulated to movement only, and the production values are absolute trash. This game is advertised with a playing time of 75 minutes. Maybe with two players but easily doubled or tripled with the "recommended" four. Complete garbage.

This has got to be my favorite "civ" type game.  Mostly because it is so light, and there is little to no down time in the game, the turns literally fly by.  

Each game is a different experience.  I love that there are several strategies to win, but a well rounded player seems to do best.  

This game rewards recklessness, and should for being dex based.  I also love that in order to get new techs you have to leave yourself exposed and hope that someone will come by and take you out.  It promotes overall confrontation.

You flick pucks around to conquer the galaxy, very fun, though the battleships maybe over-powered. Also, beware the board, this copies board had warped, which was a little rough on a flicking game.

It's an interplanetary engine-building game.  You expand your empire by moving you starships to other planets, literally, by flicking the disk-shaped pieces.  I find the dexterity element to be tolerable rather than attractive, and I doubt this will turn out to be a game I play a lot.

This is a bare bones 4x game that does a good job of making a few different tech trees and relating your progress to board positioning.  The dexterity aspect is more fun and controllable than I thought, and can be made easier via technology.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (January 2012)

What a FUN game. My girlfriend  loves it (so it is a must buy for me), sadly it is VERY expensive as it is out of print. Space opera is my favorite game theme (and books and movies too) so I naturally wanted to play Ascending Empires. The game components are adequate, although I would have liked more minis to represent the colonies and research building, however I like it as it is (wood cubes), it is very functional. I have heard the board had some troubles, but I have not experienced them. The board of the game I played fit nicely and was smooth.  On the other hand, it puzzles me why Z-man choose to do a puzzle board when the game contains a flicking mechanic, that`s (obviously) going to create some trouble.

This would be a bad (or somewhat decent) space development game if it wasn’t for the starships and its (great) flicking mechanic.  That mechanic makes the game very fun to play however it is not the complete game. The game has a surprising depth and as you can only do an action per turn you feel a lot of tension. The possible actions are well though and are complementary of each other, in short you need to do them all or fall behind. The game contains a healthy dose of luck as the planets are in random locations, however this luck is dampened because you can have ONE planet with 2 research stations, so it doesn`t bother me.

Most of the tech tree seems to be balanced, however the orange tech seems a little underpowered, have to play more to really see.

Other plus are that the game is really easy to learn, the player boards explain all the actions, it plays under 1 and a half hours and you don´t feel any downtime. 

A great game, I`m downgrading it to a 7.9 to reflect the fact that it is a really good game, but not one I would want to play every time. 

One of 2011`s favorites.

Flick your ship to a planet and explore. Add two troops that can then be converted to a research station and then improve your tech. Also you can build a colony and then a city. This part was light empire building and a little fun. At some point you need to fight battles and that is where the challenge of flicking the starships can become a pain. Maybe on a smaller table if you could move to better angles it would help. Flicking back toward myself and to the side was very difficult.

There are a few games in my collection, of which Ascending Empires is one, that won't get played very often. And yet despite that fact, I absolutely love everything about them. It's likely going to be a tough sell to play a civ-lite slash dexterity game, but I'm certain that the few plays that this game gets will be well appreciated.

Turns move quickly - and even more so once everyone has a grasp of what their options are. The fact that you only get one action per turn certainly helps that out, and gives you the feeling of a slow build of your empire. 

Ideally you'll need a lot of extra space to be able to really move around the outside of the board. Nothing gives a flick a grater sense of importance than having the entire group stand up to watch...

Fast, easy to understand, lots of options, and, on top of it all, is simply fun to play.

RATING: 5
2-player game seemed very unforgiving in structure, with a wrong move or an unfortunate sequence of shots being enough to create real disaster.  I found the physical components a drag - the seams on the boards made the process of judging shots annoying and the pieces were too light for my taste.  Game also ran towards the long end for us.  Frankly, I'd reach for Catacombs over this one for a dexterity based game, even though the theme appeals.

RATING: 8
Finally a multiplayer conflict game in the 4x genre I can fully enjoy. Replacing dice by fingerflicking is a great idea. Now, the only luck factor you can blame is your or the other players' dexterity. While my group judged it more as a fun game than as a strategy one, there's not much less strategy than in other full-blown multiplayer conflict games. As always, it's a game of keeping the leader in check and long-drawn battles between players help the others. The technology tree is a bit limited and getting the first orange advance seems a must but that's fine for the maximum playtime of 90 minutes. A weak 8 for the moment if it proves to have the replayability factor I hope for.

I like the idea behind the game.  I appreciate the effort made to mix dexterity with an efficiency/engine type game.  I'm not a big fan of the choice of theme, but that isn't too big of an issue for me.  It does seem a little bit like much of the game was ripped off from games like Catacombs and Goa, but again, I'm not too demanding about innovation in games either.

Still, something didn't feel quite right with the game.  It takes too long to get started, and your options still felt somewhat constrained.  The flicking element is fun, but the accuracy needed to be effective is hard to achieve on such an uneven playing surface.  And the game seems highly dependent on aggressive play.  We were all newbies to the game, but everyone doing their own thing seems to help the person that pushes the brown planet tech up run away with it.

I would like to play again and revisit my rating, but for now I feel disappointed.

A cross between Antike and Taktika. It takes the combat sistem of Taktika and somehow the flow of Antike in the sense that every turn you make one small action (and it becomes easy to go off plan) every turn. It carries the same flaws from Antike: it can goes on forever! Unless player stay focus on eliminating enemy ships and planet instead of turtling! Maybe with more games under the belt it will shine... hope so!

Aside from minor board issues (which do factor into gameplay...but only a little) this one was tonsafun. Big decisions on every turn, but turns are fast so it all clips right along.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A strategy game of space exploration, expansion, tech development, and conflict with a unique twist: to move your ships you flick them. You can move as far as you want but the farther you flick the greater your odds of going awry. Flick them too hard and they can easily go off the board (becoming lost in space) or careen off a planet and end up completely out of position. 

The game only has two negatives for me. One, the board isn’t perfect and sometimes this will affect a ship movement (sometimes severely). We just consider this the risk of space travel. Also, after some plays we did begin to feel that one technology (the Battleship), though fun, is so powerful that it affects the game in a negative way.  So, though I like the game as written, I much prefer it with a house rule to mitigate the power of the Battleship. The following thread describes our house rule along with the rationale for inventing it: 
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/710987/house-rule-ship-support.

Despite my small complaints, I think this is a really great game. The use of a dexterity element in a real strategy game proves to be not only innovative but quite entertaining. There are actually no luck elements in the game besides perhaps the risk of a poor flick (though that feels much more like it comes down to skill). Despite that, with the uncertainty of flicking and the ability to take calculated risks (with longer shots) the game manages to bring the same type of tension and excitement that you might get from rolling dice in a more traditional game of conflict.

Slightly odd game, the 'flicking' part was pretty fun but the empire building seemed a little too simple. 

Only played once. Spent the first half of the game expanding, researching & doing all the things i should have been doing and it was 'okay'. Then in the second half i just decided to go all out war and it was pretty fun... It also seems like a winning stratergy as you can gather LOTS of point by simply attacking everything and everyone.

For those who cannot read Dmitry's comment, here's a very rough translation.  The parts I was uncertain about are in brackets:

"I walked around this game several times, but in the end decided to acquire it.

-It's space strategy, which can be played in real time and [in teams]: (different from Twilight Imperium, for example)

-Obviously low downtime and not just [a flicking game].  It has cosmic [exploration, or possibly espionage], colonization, combat, and scientific research.  This adds planning (strategy) and [good ol'] diplomacy.

-It seems to me that the flicks take away from the complexity of the rulebook usually found in other games (at the expense of a description of who can move and shoot and how, etc.) and at the same time opens a number of unexpected opportunities.  Well for example it says "I have a 75% chance to hit" we [wonder], "But what if it doesn't happen?"

Players will colonize new worlds by building colonies, cities, and research facilities. They will develop new Technologies, and build up fleets of Starships. Ascending Empires is a fast paced game that utilizes a dexterity based Starship movement and combat system, and allows for many different strategies to be explored.

Board warping can impedes flicking style game play. Plexiglas over the board? Get a costume mat made? Right now due to the popularity of the X-Wing game, space maps are everywhere.

Great game. Easy to teach , to learn. A nice concept . But you have to like dexterity games. Even though you dont need to be the best Crokinole player in the world to play this one . 
The board can show some problems in the edges and make flick movement difficult causing you ship to flip and do not stop where you want . But you can press the edges down before you flick and thats gonna make you move more smoothly . 
My 10 y old kid loved this one , much more then Battleship Galaxies ...

Whoever thought using a puzzle board was a good idea for a flicking game should have their head examined!  Outside of that issue, the game is quite good.

LIKE:

* The four different types of tech and four special abilities in each of those types leads to some interesting combos which can be quite successful.
* I appreciated the kamikaze rule.  It can be a bit frustrating to lose a battleship due to a kamikaze, but one just needs to build up 2 knowledge in purple and people hesitate to destroy your battleship since s/he will be giving you two points when that is done.
* The game is quite colorful.  I like how the tech tree is tied to the planet color that you have your research stations built.  Be careful where you build your research stations as you only have 8 and can't move them (unless someone destroys them for you).
* Quite a few points come from destroying opponents which encourages conflict.  You can earn a fair bit of points via peaceful means, but generally more slowly.

DISLIKES:

* Puzzle boards were a horrible choice.  My puzzle boards didn't even want to fit together and appeared to be a few millimeters off.  I eventually was able to crush the boards together but fear that I may be damaging the board.  I must admit that I expect better from Z-man.

Played only 2player so far and it has been a blast! It feels like a full 4X-game that can be played in 90 minutes, with tech-tree, exploration, building, space fights, and everything very strategic. Turns are quick with minimum downtime. Although the flicking does introduce some luck/dexterity factor, I would still call it a pure strategy game. I would have given the game a 9 rating, if only the board would have been better (a lot of re-directing occurred in our plays whenever the discs crossed boards).

But if you like science fiction, then obviously what you want is a fourteen-hour long grindfest of sprawling space empires all trying to be the first to research Calculus so they can build terraforming stations or whatever. What I’m saying is, space games tend to only come in one flavor. Ascending Empires changes this, bringing the space conquest field into a fun, fast, and more appealing format. Yes, it has a flicky element, but unlike previous games with this element (such as Catacombs, which is now in the trade pile), this isn’t the only feature of the game. There’s a lot more going on, but not so much that you need to set aside an entire afternoon and your plans to ever know the touch of a woman to experience. The only, only, bad point is a huge one — the production values on the game boards are lousy, and this was almost enough for me to knock it out of the top spot, but I’ve had so much fun playing the game as is that I can’t really complain too much.

Seems like an interesting game. However, for your strategies to be successful, you must also be good at the dexterity portion. It's a mix of mechanics that doesn't work well for me.

Board pieces don't fit well together. Ridges in pieces sometimes interfere with flicking.

RATING: 7
I think this is a pretty decent game. However first impressions are the board didn't exactly fit nicely. There was bumps and what not and it will definitely spoil the board a little after a few more plays. However, the gameplay is interesting and there are different avenues to win at it and you do not need to depend a lot on flicking your spaceships. All in all, I wouldn't mind playing i again but I would hate to own this game as the board being spoilt eventually would just piss me off.

FOR TH E KIDS;Too fun! This is the first "dexterity game" I ever played -- the whole family had a blast. We were heavily into Twilight Imperium when we first played, so more depth would have been even better, but we hung onto this and now I can't wait to teach it to our grandson.

A very nice game that combines strategy with dexterity. Unfortunately, I am not very dextrous so my favourite tactic of attacking generated laughter in stead of casualties. Still it was fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Marrying dexterity and strategy is a lofty goal, but this combo of space exploration and disc-flicking manages to achieve most of what it aims for. This is probably due to not treating their idea as a mere gimmick, but polishing and refining it until it became a proper game. It shows in the nifty tech upgrades and how well they are balanced against each other, and in the lack of ambiguous situations in spite of healthy complexity.

Where it fails to elevate my like to love is in its lack of theme. I need a bit of dazzle in SF games, some sense of wonder, but while Ascending Empires paints a believable portrait of how a bureaucracy in the far future might look and feel, there is not a lot of drama or adventure. Its questionable whether disc-flicking is a mechanism that lends itself well to epic and dramatic battles, but the tit-for-tat skirmishes you get here, paired with the quick and rather painless rebuilt of any losses you suffered or inflicted, make for a particularly bland dynamic.

Nevertheless, this is a worthwhile effort, but in an ironic contrast to its somewhat loopy premise, you should expect more of a Eurogame feel instead of space opera.

Just a brilliant idea - flicking and space exploration are a natural mix. The flicking isn't just a gimmick here either - it fits with the rest of the game and the other mechanics, the technologies especially, are fun. My rating, though, is based on the Platonic Form of the game, not one bound by the ugly reality of the game board as shipped. The seems between pieces can cause real problems. Surely there was a better solution?

RATING: 7
The rating on this may rise.  It plays about 30 minutes longer than rated.  The flicking mechanism is interesting.  The board unholy sucks in my humid climate.  I'll have to fasten it to something or put it under flat heavy objects in the humidity for a few weeks perhaps.  Suspect it may seem repetitive over time without an expansion or house rules as the game is fairly simple.  (basically base rules + 16 custom rules-- sort of like Kingsberg building rule variations.

I wanted this game for the wrong reasons, and it failed to be the fun dexterity game with light space theme I was hoped for. To my pleasant surprise it's a fierce empire builder with exploration, conquest, tech-trees and the full 4X experience concentrated into an hour full of action. The flicking part is rather unemphasized, it's just a minor aspect of the game.

Initial thoughts after one play: This would have been a 'must buy' with an 8 rating when the board would have been flat.

So far so good.  I don't know if I own another game like this... where players need to build temporary alliances to make sure that other players don't get too strong.  I like the flicking mechanic, and enjoy the sometimes tough decisions you have to make.  There's so many things to do, and you can only do one at a time!  The board pieces are a small issue, but we view them as just one of the hazards of space travel.

A novel game with a few problems. The flicking is really fun, until you can't land anything making it even more difficult to take out a strong defensive colony. I appreciate the simplicity of the design and it should play fast but I found it to be overlong which is frustrating when you realize 30 minutes before the end that catching up is nigh impossible.

The puzzle piece board: horrible idea as it created notches of unevenness rather than the smooth surface required.

Pitchcar meets Twilight Imperium? Takes all the interesting things about 4X Games (colonization, fleet building, tech-trees and ground troops) and adds a truly unique battle/navigate mechanism. When you flick 2 starships at just the right distance to another player's and obliterate his fleet is one of those true "gamer moments". It's difficult to know where the rating will go from here, but the game showed a lot of promise in the first 3-player game.

The 4-player game feels like an 8 after one play. The 4 tech trees feel different and each feels relevant, the flicking is a skill but not a do-or-die skill. Long shots are tough, and trying to kill an enemy ship (without ramming it) takes precision and carries risk. I need to see it hold up to repeated plays, but first impression is great.

Very promising game of galactic dominance. Quite similar to Antike in many important ways. Love the swift turns, the flow of the game.

However, I've now played four games, and two of those have been two-hour slugfests. One game took less than an hour, and that was great. I want more games like that. If it was always that quick, Ascending Empires might deserve a 10. Now, I'm not so sure.

Indifferent.

Fun game!  The board puzzle edges can derail your movement at times (I call them rifts in the time space continuum :)  Don't know that I mind that so much.  In our 1st game it seemed to effect everyone equally, and you can press down an edge if you so desire.  I like this bit of randomness along with the dexterity.

The most telling thing for my high rating, is that I found it quite fun, challenging and competetive.  Both my 12 year old son and his friend liked it right out of the gate.  It's a winner in my book.

In this unique space game, one moves their ships by flicking pieces across a map. You can level up to gain technology advantages, build cities, colonies and research stations. You can also attack your opponents, destroy their ships, ram their ships or blockade their planets.

This is a fun game, but there is luck in the planets you explore, and whether people decide to gang up on you. You can mitigate the ganging up aspect by playing only 2 player. It is fun, and I would like to play more to see the different strategies, but I worry about the more than 2 player scenario, and someone could get picked on.

In this battle to explore, increase advantages, and destroy your opponents, Ascending Empires has interesting game mechanics. Very challenging one-on-one, especially if someone has better mastery of how to move the ships (wooden discs) around the board.  First player to upgrade a technology, quickly can take full control of the game.  This can create a runaway of the game and cause much frustration.

First impression (4 players): A space themed flicking game, it must be good! Sadly, it didn't live to my expectations. The basic idea is good, flicking space ships in space and discover/colonize plaents and battle but at least our game went a bit too long and wasn't all that much fun because of that. Problem in our game was turtling people started doing and it was a bit too easy since it is pretty hard to conquer a planet with strength of 3. The game would go on faster if there would be more action (and it would be more fun!) but I can't really see how it would happen. It just feels that if you don't defend yourself then you might get attaceked which in early game could probably be a disaster as you might not get to develop techs or just lose that momentum/resources and can't come back anymore. Perhaps I should give game another chance and try to be more aggressive but just cannot see how it would be possible really.

A rather clever design with very quick turns, and stylish components. Slightly longish though, and some elements of the game could benefit from a bit more strictly defined rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players take turns moving spaceships, building colonies, developing technology and eventually battle one another for galactic supremacy. The "ships" are little wooden pucks that players flick from planet to planet, often crashing uncontrollably into one another.
The flicking part of the game is fun. The available tech options, and the chance to score points through advancements, make the game far more than "Sorry! Sliders in Space".
There are some niggles: the ships are small in diameter and quite tall - they fall over quite easily. More significantly, it is difficult to prevent the joins in the board from interfering with some of the shots. In fairness, I think it is easy to overstate the problem.
Ascending Empires is fun, pure and simple. There's a surprising amount of strategy. The bits look good and do their job nicely.

Edit (Dec'11): Dropped my rating to a 7, and unless the game gets more play it may slump further. Unless all players are keen on a dex game, AE is difficult tom get to the table.

Euro-style empire expansion game aka victory point hunt with a mini tech tree. All done neatly, with the hook being that the movement action is a Crokinole flick of your token across the board, aiming to land within the orbit circle around the planet you want to land on / attack. Actions are fast and the game whizzes around - building spaceships, moving them out, colonising planets, building colonies for VPs, upgrading to cities for more VPs, building research stations to advance up the tech tree. The replay interest comes in exploring different approaches allowed by the tech tree (more movement points, give up stuff for VPs, better attack powers, etc). Game style can vary between friendly (when advances are easy) and full of pussage when opponents decide to use their spaceships for evil and orbit your planets to stop you doing anything on them. It's a game of gradual build-up and watchfulness on what your opponents are doing, with key decisions being when to be more directly threatening towards opponents and when not depending on how they're going - which can result in some king-making towards the non-involved players if the combatants don't get VPs for lost starships. You also need to be watchful of imminent threat towards yourself, which can come surprisingly quickly. An interesting game to play.

Based on one play: A really fun game, but it ends quickly. You build up your force and settle on planets to get more tech so that your fleet and men are stronger. After a few turns, it gets crowded and the fighting begins. You move around the board by flicking your ships and battles are simply based on total attack power, where you must have more attack then the opponents defense to destroy them. You get points for tech and kills, plus a bonus at the end for plants/settlements. Would like to play again.

What is a rewarding gaming experience? A game when you just are having fun or a complex game when both the opponents and the game system challanges you every time you make your move? Or is a rewarding game experience one when you having a pleasant and relaxing time, chatting while you're putting those colored train wagons on the map?

Ascending Empires tries to break some middle ground. Small World is more accessible and clean and 7 wonders offers just as much paths to victory with less effort. And if you want interactive and compative games there are of course more complex and rewarding ones.

It's not really a family game either, but close. I like it. Just two 4-player games with the family yet. Maybe the more possibilities will reveal it self after more plays. Or maybe it is one of those game that will grow old too soon.

My oldest daughter - 13 years old - who likes/tolerates Cyclades, Cosmic Encounter and Small World, seems to dig this game a lot. "A lot" it is in comparison to the "Euro-games" she sometimes have to put up with..

A very exciting space exploration/conquer game with dexterity element. Dexterity element adds luck in a way that more risk gives you usually better rewards - so it is very fun to play and practice your flicking skills. Game plays rather fast (1-2 hours of playtime) and still offers a lot of strategic options.

RATING: 8
Very original approach to the 4X space civ game that mixes the usual euroish economics engine with a very unusual dexterity element. Movement is done by flicking the ships around the board. Combat is also very simple: just place two ship within firing range and the target is destroyed. Strange as it may seem I think it kind of works.

A full game takes 1 to 2 hours to play, which is perfect. The economic engine is streamlined and well thought out and the flicking adds to the drama and it's kind of thematic. It's difficult to travel in space! Good stuff.

This is a high 7. I really like flicking, tech-trees, and space combat, and this game has those in spades. There are some things that are quite wonky (e.g., the ability to launch ships in a position to immediately destroy an opponent's ship), but I can easily look past the flaws. AE plays very quickly, as each player takes just a single action. Even in 4-player games there is very little downtime. I'm almost always excited to play this.

I heard about this game this morning on the 'on board games' podcast and was really interested.  After looking at the comments I'm really concerned about the component quality - the art and pieces look great, but the biggest issue could be the jigsaw board for a sliding dexterity game.  I feel confident that, unless the board is perfectly seemless (which is highly unlikely, especially after it has been opened after several months) the pieces won't slide as they are intended to.  Shame..

RATING: 6
If you haven't played, the precis is 4X tech-tree space strategy game... where the spaceships move around the galaxy by being flicked! 

But it wasn't really the game I expected it to be from that description. It's actually much more on the strategy side than the dexterity side. Because the planets stick up from the board, it's quite easy to land a spaceship without being overly precise, so it really feels more like the randomness level of rolling a die than a true feat of dexterity. It's nice that it gives you the chance of outrageous longshots if you feel like it too. 

I do not like the endgame timer though. There's a pool of VP that have to be collected to trigger the end of the game, and towards the end it really started to drag. If it hadn't been for my hyper-aggression (which earned me the title of 'space c*nt') it might never have ended!

A space exploration dexterity game with an action selection mechanic and a tech tree.  A fun game with the not-so-minor quibble that the boards do not fit together perfectly and disks will occasionally strike a raised edge and go flying.

I had a bad feeling about this from the moment I laid eyes on it. Dexterity and Space 4X ? Sadly, I was right, at least in my opinion. The marriage between flicking and building a space empire does not work and the two mechanics don't create the promised hybrid. I feel that the core game, apart from the flicking is really not that interesting a quite stagnant and dry. The flicking itself is kept at bay when it comes to the welcome insanity of outrageous attempts because usually, you will just go from planet to planet and flick very cautiously. But what the hell is the flicking about if not for shooting your stuff all over the place ? Also, the game takes too long, we played this for almost three hours and did not finish it, mostly because we ran out of time, but I also ran out of fun to be honest. The problem is that this game might be a novelty mix but it is neither a good dexterity game nor a good Euro game and I would rather play a better dexterity game or a better Euro game than attempting to squeeze it all into on play. This game could have been a winner, if only the playing were shorter. The board does not sit flat either, which is real shame, considering you need to flick your way through space. Disappointing.

This actually does what it says - a fast explore and fight game in space. The flicking part is fun, but not central to the game, but does provide a neat way of introducing some chaos into long-distance space travel. The game flies along because turns are so fast everyone pays attention. There is a temptation to pick on the weak, which counter-balances the possibilities of ganging up on the leader. The game makes it easy to mess with people a bit by blockading, but hard to really destroy a player. There is also usually fair warning of impending doom, as it takes a while to amass a dangerous fleet and the tech to support it. Not super-deep but really genuine fun. I wish the mining strategy seemed more viable...

A work of insane genius. Quite possibly the only 4X dexterity game in existence. The game is a ton of fun - just the right mix of silliness with some serious meat in the form of a light 4X. Doesn't overstay its welcome but plays long enough that there's actually some time to develop techs and expand your territory. 

The flicking mechanism also ends up encouraging plenty of player conflict as players miss their shot and end up occupying territory halfway across the galaxy.

God I hate the puzzle-board. It really wrecks what could be a great, different game. This is the first time I've marked a game down for component quality.

Ignoring that, the game itself is fun. Not hugely tactical, and I feel for the length of the game that the number of core decisions is perhaps a bit lacking - but it was a game I'll pull out on occasion purely because it's different and interesting.

Recieved in trade for Luna

Gone in math trade dec 2012

Seams on the board make the wooden discs impossible to use.  Replaced with glass beads and it worked better.  But ultimately, the first person to get the biggest ship is probably going to win more often than not.  Wheres the fun in that?

RATING: 7
I like what this tries to do. It mostly succeeds. One player was complaining that you only get one action per turn, but that's a good thing: It keeps turns moving quickly. 

I think there are too many VPs in the game (we ended up taking out 10 or 15). It could be that we just weren't aggressive enough, but it just felt long. 

Also, the puzzle pieces didn't quite fit together, and that just can't happen in a dexterity/flicking game. More than once someone's ship just dead stopped because the place where two pieces came together didn't fit. That's BAD.

This is a dexterity empire building game. It works pretty well, although I have terrible aim. The board doesn't help, as the creases between tiles really detract from the game. I'd like to try this with a smooth board.

RATING: 8
A really interesting conquest/empire building game, movement based off flicks can make for a frustrating game but I have found that if you replace the ships with glass beads they glide pretty smoothly.

I also like the potential for big gain from a single flick, but I completely understand why most people would hate this game. It is a very strategic area control game with man strategies however some people will not care because all movement is based off flicks.

I will miss having this game in my collection its just I couldnt pass up selling it for 200 dollars no matter how great the game is I had to sell to help pay the rent
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty drastic how the component issues change this from must-own to never-will. Yes, it's not that bad initially, but the copy I played on was heavily warped after 2 years, making the board even more chaotic. I couldn't do anything with one of the joints, even when it was a short flick.

A great pity, because the game is amazing fun, and the first to have flicking as a complementary, not dominant, mechanism (which wasn't the case even in Catacombs). You flick to explore, fight and move your ships around, but you still have to strategically colonize, build and manage your space empire. Flicking is even thematic in this game, because the further and faster your journey, the more likely you are to wreck. Just 2 actions a turn keeps the flicking fast and furious.

Definitely innovative, but a few drawbacks (besides the boards of course) keep this from a perfect 5 in design. The gray research track, which gives more flicks per turn, seems overpowered. The game length is a little weird, varying by how much conflict there is in the game. My first and only game involved total turtling, resulting in a long game that outstayed its welcome; perhaps the leader really needs to hasten the clock for this to work. And for a game like this, where you can be really behind the 8-ball if you just can't flick well, a catch-up mechanism would be very welcome (instead, it's rich-get-richer with the research tracks).

3+4

Flick your spaceship around the galaxy and conquer brave new worlds. A great little game with a fun mechanic.

Do yourself a favor and use glass tokens for your spaceship instead of the wooden discs that come with the game. Otherwise you will hit the board's puzzle style connection pieces, as it warps out of shape over time.

RATING: 7
Despite being awful at flicking games, I actually like Ascending Empires quite a bit. The dexterity element is especially crucial early in the game – if you are a far poorer shot than your opponents, then you will get outpaced fairly quickly in developing techs. Speaking of which, I like the stages of progress here; players explore around to establish presence on planets and develop basic techs. However, advancing techs requires territorial expansion, and so confrontation (and more flicking) is inevitable later in the game.

The tech tree was fun, the rules of combat were occasionally confusing but the highlights of the game for me were watching my weakly defended planet survive an opponent's attack as his ships flew into oblivion, and the launching of my Battleship.

I have only played this once. We got some of the rules wrong...I think! The rules are a bit unclear about the flicking part. Yes, this game involves flicking. But that is only one of the actions you can do.

I liked it, but it took a bit too long I think. I will certainly play it again, probably the game will be shorter once everyone knows it.

The components are nice.

And I suck at flicking!

Weird combo of dexterity and strategy in space. As is typical in my first games, I didn't fully utilize any sort of strategy, but could see how others were. The turns are so fast that I sometimes got stuck when it came back to me and I hadn't planned anything. I love flicking and who doesn't love space? I mean most of us live in three dimensional space! The board we played on was a bit warped so that caused some crazy flights and I'm not used to flicking on cardboard, but I think the game is well worth it.

A really fun, accessible, and stimulating Space 4X game. The ruleset is simple enough that you can learn the game in about five minutes (which is a breath of fresh air in a realm that can sometimes get over-complicated). The flicking mechanism is an interesting mechanic for this type of game, and adds a lot to the strategy and tactics employed. I could easily play this game over and over. The one knock on it though, and this is a pretty big one, is the inter-locking board pieces. I understand the reasoning, but I really wish there was another solution. First off, in assembling the board, you have to be careful to assemble it just the way it was cut, or the pieces won't lock right. The fact the publisher didn't label the four corner pieces so that you know the exact sequence of assembly is a huge oversight. Secondly, even when you get this assembled correctly, board warping will inevitably occur. I live in Colorado (an exceptionally dry environment) and my board still started to warp in just three plays, with edges of the board starting to jut out in the middle of the map. I can't imagine how much worse this would be in humid environments. This is very frustrating for a game that requires flicking small "ships" across the map, as they can hit one of those edges and careen in all sorts of directions. I read here on BGG about a few workarounds, and I plan to try one where I plop an acrylic sheet on it as an overlay, but it's a shame that such a purchase is almost mandatory for this game. The game itself is so fun, simple, and fine-tuned that it's always tragic to see production issues get in a way of this. Other than that, for the gameplay itself, I rate it highly.

Now we're talking!  Civ building with flicking usually would reel me in, but after a play I gotta have it.  The guys that design these things are geniuses.  Really enjoyed the aspects of picking a tree to level and then flicking my ships to explore and attack.  Can't wait to play again.  *Update*  Played a few more times and something is bugging me.  The ideas are genius but it goes too long for what I want it to be and the mining mechanic really bugs me.  I actually wish the flicking was a bigger part of the game.

An intriguing idea of adding a flicking element to a strategy game.  Unfortunately, neither works that well.  The flicking was too basic while the strategy aspect didn't grab me either as the game seems to drag.  Flicking games in general have grown somewhat stale to me, so others may enjoy it more than I do.

RATING: 6
A 4X game that will play in under an hour plus a dexterity mechanic.  The gameplay is very simple and consists mostly of putting different kinds of units and buildings on planets and pushing disks representing ships around a board to attack opponents and explore new planets.

There is actually a decent amount of depth in the simple mechanics and pushing the ships around and watching them bounce off planets is a lot of fun.  There are a couple issues with the dexterity mechanic though.  The segmented board pieces don't fit together perfectly and can cause ships to flip and veer in the wrong direction.  Also the ships are a bit small to be flicked like they should be and can flip over all on their own.

Other than that it is expertly designed and distills the fun of a 4X game into a manageable amount of time with a fun, almost "toy-like" coating.

I've since decided I'm not really a fan of playing dexterity games.  I like the idea of them but when I actually sit down and play they never turn out like I want them to and they almost always leave me disappointed.

A big disappointment. A good concept, and some fun parts, let down by a poorly designed playing surface, and a game that does not scale well with smaller groups of players. In particular, the game can really drag with two or three players, and it's not a game that really does well as a "long" game. Much better in, say, a 75 minute session at best. There are some who think it'd be a better game with a self-produced re-designed surface, but ask yourself this question: after paying a high price tag for this game as is, is it really worth it to go that extra mile?

I've had my fill of this game. It was certainly fun at first, but the dexterity requirement is a turn off for many I game with. Because of that, we usually have to play 3 player, and that range truly sucks for this game. If two players attack each other, the third can just coast to victory virtually unmolested. Only recommended with 4, but since I couldn't get that number to play anymore, I traded my set.

It helps that I like dexterity games, but I was still skeptical that "flicking + strategy" could possibly equal anything other than "fail". But the flicking just adds the same sort of minor random element you would get from occasional dice, only less obnoxiously.

Fantastic light-hearted fun.

I lowered my rating on this one after having more bad games than good ones. It's an uneasy balance of dexterity and accounting and the issues with the components don't really help -- Taktika is now my strategic flicking game of choice.

I WANT to like this game, but it falls short for me. The game system is simple and smooth, with interesting economic choices. The flicking is critically important, but dull compared to other flicking games. My big problem is that most of the game is about stopping other players from doing interesting stuff; that doesn't make for a fun experience. Battleships also cause problems; they are too powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid. The unstable ships and bad boards hinder the experience significantly. I think my primary complaint is that it's too much euro and not enough AT. I'm not sure how to describe it but there's very little sense of how well each player is doing. There's a definite arc to the game but there's no feeling of player development. 

The graphic design is exceptionally dull. Can't say it much more clearly than that. 

The rulebook seems to cover everything but is a complete master class in crap with a stupid big font, too much white (black) space between lines and paragraphs and spread over 4 times as many pages as it needs to be amongst other lesser evils. I suspect this was all an attempt to make the game accessible but it has the opposite effect.

Will happily play but not sure I need to own it.

Initial Play : With some reluctance from my wife, who described the board as all black and ugly, we launched into our first game.  I was not really impressed at first and it seemed too simple.  She made the first attack in search of resources and it was on!  I attempted to develop multiple high level techs only to realize I could not.  She developed Orange tech and built a battleship.  She commenced destroying my planets and basically owned me.  At the end we felt it was a good game.  We actually discussed future strategies and things we could improve on.  That does not happen often.  There is more to the game than first perceived. I see the subtlety of the differing ways to get VP now.  I also see this a an easy game to make variants and new scenarios for.  Can't wait till my next play.

Update : Played the 2 p Variant - Lost Empire.  I like the scenario and it works well.  It keeps the game short.  I don't think 2p is the best number for this game but it's still worth it for the fun.  It's a pretty straight up build and attack game with 2, with the tension coming from trying to snag resource planets quicker.  More plays may reveal different things but I think I need to see the 3/4 player game for that.

The board is kind of a pain in the ass and I will be doing some customization.

Flicking the spaceships around is surprisingly fun.

I was really skeptical about this game, it looked like pitch car in space. but I can't give it less than a 10. The game play is simple and you might feel after just a couple of plays that there is not much more to it, but if you use your imagination there are loads of strategies.

Important : don't get hung up about defending your home world, at first it seems sensible to build a protective wall around it, this makes slow growth . Get your ships right out there, get attacking quickly. harass and blockade other player planets to slow their advancement, then scoot off into the distance guerrilla style.

Take full advantage that every ship you shoot down, every planet you devastate not only damages other player empires but shortens the game, and that is the brilliance of this game, by being focused, taking risks and gambles, being prepared to lose the odd planet, you can control the speed of the game,

be ruthless, wipe them out!

A great big 10 from me.

Dexterity games just don't do it for me (Animal Upon Animal isn't dexterity; it's a game of your ability to deal with stress) and the mixture of tech trees and flicking are two of my least favourite mechanisms.

Space crokinole is AWESOME.  I had a blast playing this, it has a high fun factor as well as decent mechanics hidden behind it.  It's nice that the tech charts have stuff that is useful across the board (unlike some games).

The downside here is the puzzle board and their printing quality.  The edges (which we dubbed as tachyons) sometimes cause jumping or stalling depending on the table, which is a shame for an otherwise great game.  This obviously isn't for everyone as it requires an amount of skill and dexterity, but complete failures can be a laugh regardless.

For the first ten minutes of Ascending Empires, I felt the visceral thrill of space exploration.  Flicking my starship across a dark galaxy generated real excitement!  Unfortunately, the dexterity game is far more interesting than the strategic game, and it's marginalized by it.  This is just a simple tech-tree slog.  Sure, turns happen fast, but when it takes three of them to get anything done, why do we have so many repetitive steps?  The collision rule discourages conflict, too.

Fun experience and it's got a well deserved space in my game collection for being something really different. Be prepared:  Tactics and strategy get a fair share, however the flicking is really crucial and can make the game. Of course, you should know that in a flicking game.

RATING: 9
Initial play--pure strategy with a dose of skill involved.  Not many games can claim that.  Grey tech is key to either running up or stopping.

Four plays in, and a few more thoughts have materialized.  

This is one of those "what-in-the-world?" games.  Pseudo-civ, tech trees, exploration, and flicking?  Don't be fooled by the mention of flicking--it really is pretty deep as far as strategy goes.  It contains elements of Goa, Endeavor, and Starcraft as well as one of the best games of all time--crokinole.  

The flicking element almost acts as comic relief--it can be a very heady game, and the flicking brings moments of do-or-die tension.  Most of the flicking requires that you merely get close to a target--not hit it.  Because players must flick within 1/2" to 1", it does lend to a bit of skill based gaming.  

Sound weird?  It is.  It should make you curious, and you ought to check it out.

RATING: 8
One of the best dexterity games out there, and the chaos of the flicked ships is a natural metaphor for the wacky dangers of space travel. A definite crowd-pleaser, with just enough tech and construction options to give you some choices, but not so many as to overwhelm.

I rated an 8, it probably 8.5-9, though, I have only played once, so I will say 8 and see how the next couple games go.

I enjoy the fast pace of the game, you only get one action per turn which can make you choice very difficult, especially when your opponents will take advantage of you at a weak point which you may have while developing tech. So yeah, for how simple the rules, the game is great!

What a great blend of 4X and Dexterity. The only flaw is that the puzzle board is a great big pain in the balls to fit together and after 10 plays the thing is just beat to hell.

Dexterity wrapped up in a real board game, what's not to like here. This is a cool game.

I am usually a harsh critic of dexterity games, but this one has plenty of nice strategy which de-emphasizes the dexterity element in a good way. Opportunities for direct attacks on opponent's positions abound.

The Only problem with this game is the board, it does not fit together properly in all spots, and causes the board to not sit flat and stops ships or changes their direction.  I have tried every possibility with the puzzle board and can't get two sides to sit right.  With that said, it is my kids current favorite game, and it is a lot of fun to play, easy to learn, and it does not take 2-3 hours to play.  Under an hour most of the time (not including set-up).  Expansions should make this even more interesting in the future.  If you want to add luck, we have created a black hole variant with a eight sided die. Fun

Temática espacial. Hay que conquistar planetas sobre los que puedes construir colonias, ciudades o centros de investigación para avanzar tecnología. Puedes atacar otros planteas si entras en su órbita o naves enemigas si estas a distancia de ataque. Divertido, combina bien el movimiento de naves tipo chapas con cierta variabilidad estratégica. Lo unico malo como en todos los de temática espacial, el tablero, algo asbtracto e insulso.

RATING: 10
An impressive piece of gaming! It'd be a great game even without the flicking. A medium weight space exploration game that's very fast-paced, with a good level of strategy, and a variety of play styles. The ship flicking "gimmick" helps keep it even more interesting, with the uncertainty of movement executed wonderfully. (The board edges are annoying, but not game-breaking by any means.) I see myself playing this quite a bit for years to come.

Al taught this one, all out interstellar WAR!! with pinging. I'll need to understand the rules more clearly with a full read (I'm not one to learn from being taught a game by someone else, I need to read the rules completely.) The game is great, and Jeff's monster board is fantastic, can't wait to try it. Played again at ConnCON 2013 in Stamford and did much better! I want to play much more of this finger flicker. Great game!

The game felt a bit scripted, especially in the start. I'm slightly worried how much there really is interestig replayability here.

RATING: 7.5
This game would get an 8.5 rating from me if the board fit together better. But I'm tempted to rate it even lower... it's a major problem having edges sticking up when you need to be able to flick pieces from one section to another.  :(

RATING: 7.5
Played twice. Interesting blend of 4x and dexterity games. The game plays fast and there is little downtime. In fact, most of the time you are reminding people that it is their turn again! The rulebook does have a few holes and the Battle Cruiser strategy does seem like a no brainer, however, there is good depth, some great fun moments and I look forward to adding it to my collection.

RATING: 7.9
very enjoyable-  a game with a dexterity element in place of a random element, and it's not the ONLY thing that you do in the game (compared to most dexterity games, where the dexterity element IS the game).  

I've experienced no particular problem with the boards,  and here's the thing-  for a board of that size, you've only got a few options, and the puzzle-piece style keeps the price down.  if you don't care about price (you're in the vast minority), then go buy a $3 plastic sheet from Wal-mart or Lowes.  you don't even really need to cut holes in it.  For this to be a seamless folding board of that size, everyone else would be paying $20+ more for the game, meaning it would get carried by less stores, bought by less people, and probably not printed in the first place because of that. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
4x crossed with dexterity is an interesting combination that comes together well.

I like how quick the turns are with players only allowed to take 1 turn per action.  This can still create AP with some players.

I wish the boards were smoother to allow for more accurate flicking.

RATING: 7
It's a light combat dexterity game with good interaction. Turns are quick and the technology paths are pretty fun. The Dexterity movement system is alright, but with the tall ship pieces and the gaps in the board ships roll on their side far too often. You always get to keep technology and ships/troops gained from buildings: even when they are destroyed. It's a nice touch that makes losing battles less frustrating.

There's a high chance that with more plays the rating will improve. If the components/graphics were better I would immediately jump this to an 8.

RATING: 9
Ingenious and great fun.  All kinds of little gambits and tactics emerge as you get familiar with how the moving parts fit together.  Everyone will focus on the flicking mechanic, but I think the one-action-per-turn mechanic may be the critical element here; it takes what could be a very long thinky game with a great deal of downtime and makes it move quite quickly.  Don't get so seduced by this that you fail to plan your moves; planning can matter a [i]lot[/i].  Also:  nothing makes you wish you owned enough purple planets to get the +2 VP every time someone rams you like building a battleship.

Dexterity - flicking your space ships to explore or battle AND a tech tree.  Interesting mix of mechanics.     

Not a masterpiece, but one I could see playing annually.

Game arrived, stickers applied, short intro game played. Very fun for now, very difficult to flick as you would like.

-- Edit.

Finally I have to say that it didn't clicked for me. Very VP-based, and (at least with 2) I see ramming as real problem.

RATING: 6
I haven't played a lot of 4X games, so I don't know how other games of this type handle things like the unknowns of travel through space.  All I know is that the flicking of discs across a board is a fantastic way of doing so.  At first, the flicking put me off (one bad flick at a critical point could spell doom for you), but later I realized that this is almost like the fog-of-war effect that comes from the roll of the dice or the draw of a card in most wargames.  Having a little unpredictability is good, and adds a nice tension to the game.  The momentary angst that precedes a tricky shot turns into excited whoops or sorrowful groans, and it adds a lot of fun to the game.

The game isn't perfect, though.  It can get a little tedious at the start of the game, and it can take a long time to accomplish small things in the game.  Still, the turns typically move quickly, and it's hard to begrudge a player for taking a little extra time to judge a flick when the turns do take a little bit longer than usual.  Like I said, that adds to the turn angst, so it's definitely a beneficial part of the game.

2 plays: 3 players

Πρόκειται για ένα αρκετά πρωτότυπο παιχνίδι μια και συνδυάζει κλασσικό διαστημικό area control / exploration παιχνίδι με dexterity!
Το ότι έχει ένα στοιχείο dexterity μέσα, δεν το κάνει "χαζοχαρούμενο" παιχνιδάκι - ίσα ίσα. Δεν είναι παρά ένας διαφορετικός τρόπος μεταφοράς της κίνησης και των μαχών. Από κει και πέρα έχεις ανάπτυξη, εξερεύνηση, ανακάλυψη νέων τεχνολογιών κλπ. Όλα δεμένα με έναν πολύ ωραίο τρόπο.

Seems like the flicking was just tacked onto an otherwise sort of dull engine building game.  

The game works well enough, but the flicking isn't really that much fun, and the rest of the game is entirely ordinary.

RATING: 6.5
I would rate this one so much higher if the board was more functional. I will have to re-rate this one after I've seen it in action with some kind of plexiglass barrier for the playing surface. 

As it stands right now it makes for some really distracting and frustrating moments during the game. Having said that a 7.5 is still pretty good considering this obvious flaw.

I love the game - just not the little grooves that pop up when I'm trying to move my pieces around. I need to get this to the table at least a few more times this year.

The flicking gimmick is about the only thing this game has going for it. The game takes off well with all players deploying ships and troops to the four corners of the Galaxy, but once all the planets are claimed the game slows down considerably. It's far easier to grind for points than to actually attack opponents, so the ending of the game always feels bland.

I keep thinking this game would be cool if only it didn't have the slow build-up or the distracting resource planets.

In other words, this game would be so much better if it were Catacombs, Taktika, or plain old Crokinole.  Oh, wait...

Was shipped with 2 of one board piece and zero of another.  Waiting for Z-Man to ship the replacement before I can play and rate.

still waiting on the board from zman...

Board is in the mail and should be here in a couple weeks.  Cant wait to play this!

After receiving replacement, the board is still not good.  Its absolutely amazing that zman designed the board as they did.

6 for what would be a light entertaining game if you manage to fix your board.

I really enjoy the flicking but I'm bad at it.

The rest of the game is 80% of it though and it's quite good too. I played some non-gamers and they picked it up OK eventually. Gamers had no problems, but it's deeper than it appears.

Initial concerns about the board disappeared once play began and everyone started enjoying themselves.

It does make me really want Catacombs...

Looks nice, interesting rules, but the terrible production quality of the board (the pieces of my copy simply don't fit, causing seams and nice little ramps) makes the game literally unplayable. Probably a great game if you're lucky enough to find a well produced board in the box. I really don't understand how a designer/company can let such a crucial part of the game be flawed by mediocre (at best) production quality...

Sadly this game is broken in my opinion. I really really really want to like this game. I love the art, love the pieces and love the theme. I even like the dexterity aspect of it (even when I lose due to a bad flick). What I cannot get past is the imbalance of the technology tree. Whoever reaches the top of the grey branch (and thus receives an additional movement action on top of the rest of their turn) wins. I have won using it and I have lost to others when they use it. Every time someone gets there they will become unstoppable. Because of this if you start in a sector that has less grey planets you really have no hope of winning. I've played this game 6 or 7 times desperately trying to like it but I just can't.

Also, one of the most vague and unhelpful rulebooks I've ever read.

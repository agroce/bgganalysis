I liked Onirim (though the shuffling was a bit much).  I thought Urbion was more a math exercise than a game.  Sylvion, is the first of the set that just grabs hold and won't let go.

The game is a fantastic solitaire experience.  Every decision is important, and it's painful watching the cards lost in the draft.  

The art style is great, and the theme really comes through as you watch the fire make its way across the glade to your forest.

A difficult, rewarding solitaire experience.

The deck drafting is pretty cool, but can also be kind of annoying if you play multiple games.  I don't find the game very challenging.  I do lose games, but that's because I couldn't get the cards I needed early enough to "get on top of things"; or the first few rounds went very badly. If you like tower defense games, you will probably like this game.

This is my absolute favorite of the Oniverse games, though all of them are great. The gameplay is just as vibrant as the theme and artwork, and the difficulty for the base game is pleasantly challenging. I'll be honest that the game kicked my ass the first time I played, but once I got the hang of it, I won more often than not. When this happens, just add on an expansion or use of the ravage pawn. I find this game highly replayable, and there are many different strategies one can enter into a game with. The only drawback to this game is the large physical footprint. I can't always play this if I can't find a large enough playing space at a given time. Still though... phenomenal solo/cooperative game.

почитал правила. выглядит довольно любопытной tower defense по типу Plants & Zombies, с некоторыми элементами декбилдинга (вначале игры есть фаза "найма", по ходу игры - механизмы дискарда, как с руки, так и в коробку). 

дополнение (включённое в коробку) добавляет плохие карты в колоду защитников (от которых нельзя, к сожалению, избавиться штатными методами дискарда), а также хорошие карты а-ля Гендальф, которыми можно воспользоваться в любой момент (если "нанять" их в игру). 

p.s. обе первые партии забывали тянуть карту вместо убитого фонтана.

My first experience of designer Shadi Torbey's series of games set in the 'Onivers'. This is a beautiful solitaire game (that can also be played by two players)- the box itself is a work of art. Gameplay is quite simple, yet engaging. In this tower defence style game you are trying the forest of Sylvion from a horde of fire 'elementals'. The loss-to-win ratio is not as punishing as it is in Friday, another single-player game I really enjoy.

RATING: 4
I suppose it should have been obvious.  I dislike many co-operative games because they seem too much like us against the system puzzles.  I dislike many cube pushers for their solitaire-ish feel.  It was kind of inevitable that I wouldn't enjoy a game like Sylvion, designed for solo play.  Sylvion appears a well designed game. As in a good coop, the system ratchets up the pressure as the game progresses.  There are also options to adjust the level of difficulty.  Thematically, the struggle of fire versus the forest and its wildlife works.  I just feel no desire to play it again.

The childlike and surreal character of the artwork is appealing.  Production quality is good, although, as others have commented, the box insert favours style over function.  The rules are clear and an easy read.

RATING: 6
This card game features some of the most beautiful cards I've ever seen or touched. The components are just spectacular.

Sylvion is a really, really difficult co-op and solo game. I have beaten it solo using the advanced rules, but I've never won playing with two players. Blazes are just brutal, and there are so many of them. The card drafting mechanic in the advanced rules are awesome. I could just draft over and over again and call it good, but testing my drafted decks against the game is awesome.

The game state has a big footprint, but everything packs away nicely in a small (and super-cool) box for easy transport. If I know I have spare time and a table when I travel, I take this game with me.

I love this game. Since now, it's my number 1 game from the oniverse. The game is addictive, both the deck-building and the "defense tower" parts.

RATING: 8
This game is deceptively difficult, and it's wonderful.

The premise is simple - It's like Plants vs Zombies, except the zombies are fire elementals and it's all played with cards. Toss in a few more mechanics, a great presentation, and interesting art, and you've got Sylvion.

The rule book does an excellent job of teaching you the game. Some of the cards have symbols on them showing they're part of an expansion, and you can leave those out for your first game. So, you can learn the basics, then add one or both in-box expansions into the mix to get the full experience. It's a great way to learn all the mechanics without being overwhelmed by the rules.

I've only played the game solo so far, but each game has been intense. I've lost a few rounds, and I've won a few rounds by the skin of my teeth. If you like solitaire games and the feel of base defense games, I recommend Sylvion!

RATING: 6
Traded. Sad to say that I'm disappointed on this game. I really wanted to like this but, unlike Onirim, it turned out this is not a keeper. Game play is quite fun at first and I even considered keeping this just for the sake of one player drafting mechanics which works amazingly well. But after all, I felt the game is very swingy and it's all determined by the fire elemental's deck setup. Regardless of what you do in the drafting phase, the bad elemental deck configuration will crash you, if not let you pass the game with no effort. Taking a bigger table space and longer play time made its impression worse. Real bummer because I thought the art of Sylvion the best in the Oniverse.

Another surreal, simplistic, beautiful game from Shadi Torbey's Oniverse line. In this one it has more of a tower defense feel where you're stopping fire elemental ravagers from destroying a forest, using fountains, trees and animal cards for your defense. The Basic game is likely good for teaching new players, but I'd head straight for the Advanced game since it adds a cool sort of 'draft' phase where you recruit your deck. Some small expansions are included in the wonderfully packaged box, and help give this some added replay. Doesn't quite give me that same haunted feeling Onirim did, but it's still very high quality and unique.

Is a good example of a tower defense type game in card format.  The flow of the game feels a bit like plants vs. zombies with the fire working against you from right to left.

The best part of the game for me is the drafting portion where you are gathering your forces.

There aren't too many tough decisions in the game as most often times the choices are pretty apparent, but several times throughout a game you will end up with a tough choice.

Game is not as easy as it may appear, although it isn't terribly difficult either.  Most games seem to be competitive till the end.

The only worthwhile way to play is with all the expansions and the advanced mode.

I'm sure players will probably tend to gravitate towards strategies that have worked for them in the past, while they try to branch out some.

Initial Impression: The designer has done it again. A small box, a few high quality components, and simple game mechanisms make for a compelling solo experience. The addition of basic and advanced games, and variants in the box promise long term viabilty. Having only played the basic game so far, I can say that I'm finding the game challenging and am looking forward to what else the game has in store for me. This is one of the few solitaire games in my collection that I'm tempted to try with a partner, as it looks as if the decisions would be that much more grueling. Now on to the Advanced game ...

This is more of a stressful activity than a fun game to play, in my opinion. It feels so out of control. I don't mind luck in games. In fact, most of the time, I feel like luck makes many games more interesting and accessible to more people. But in this case, luck (good or bad) makes the game almost feel like it's playing itself. There are clear optimal solutions each turn and those solutions are dictated by luck of the draw of what you get in your hand and how unlucky you get with the fire.

Played a game of this using just the beginner game to learn the rules. I was destroyed on the 6th turn. It seems to me like you really need to do the drafting to get the better animal cards to have a fighting chance. The Oniverse games have all been slam dunks for me, and Sylvion fits right in to the family.

This is a tower defence type game in which you use trees and animals to prevent fires from making it from one side of the play area to the other.

For a long time, I've had no reason to play solo games. I've got both a partner who loves games and kids who love games. However, for several reasons, I've been having more chances to play solo games lately. Enter Sylvion. While I've played more brain-burny solo games, I'm not sure if I've played one that was as brain-burny in as short a period of time. First, you draft a deck. Then, you play the deck against the monster's deck. There are decisions to make at each step and the decisions you make in the drafting have large impacts in the attack/defend phase. I'm currently playing with all the expansions and the tension is ratcheting up to a level that it gets hard to win. I'm also looking to add in some changes to replenishment soon. Really enjoying this.

I'm finding the game a bit too easy, even using the two-card draw, with all the expansions and the ravage token. These increase the challenge somewhat, but I'm still just watching the fire burn on the horizon and I'm never worried about it touching my forest. 

There could be more variation in the available cards with more abilities for better combos. The decision of choosing cards to pay for other cards would improve if the trees were more useful in the main game, even at the end of the game I find I never need to plant any. 

The artwork is my favourite of the series.

RATING: 9
Sylvion is probably the best solo game I've ever played (not that I've played very many).

It is a fun puzzle to figure out, but has many interesting decisions throughout. The draft in the beginning can be agonizing (especially with the expansion added in).

In the meat of the game, you're paying for cards you want to play with cards in your hand. This is one of my favorite mechanics because it means you are always faced with tough decisions.

The presentation in Sylvion is gorgeous and the gameplay is engaging...what more could you ask for?

Tower defence kinda game with a drafting aspect for building the player's deck at the begining

Cons:
Takes quite some space on the table
Has a preparing time that might turn off some people (I'm fine with it)
Box too small, even without the insert, to fit sleeved cards.

Pros: 
Deckdrafting makes all games different. 
Adjustable difficulty.
Challenging.
Stunning packaging, like all its Oniverse sibblings.


Oniverse: Not sure which is my favorite yet, but I definitely payed this one more then the others.

Deck building meets tower defence, with a great theme. The game feels tense, up until the last moment. Each decision is an informed probabilities bet at worst, or a hand manipulation exercise at best. There is enough game in this little box for ages. Highly recommended.

At first I thought this was over-difficult, but then I figured out the general strategy and now it's a little too easy, ahaha.  If you play co-op without talking, though, it's still super super challenging, so there's that.  We haven't won a co-op game yet.  Still a nice solo player experience, and when I set it up at coffee shops someone always leans over to ask what it is. Lovely artwork.

Excellent game. Smooth, quick, fun with agonizing decisions. Sylvion is a hit!
My first couple of games, I tried to play this like a traditional tower defense game and build towers that were impossible to destroy....all towers in this game can be destroyed. On my third play, I realized that I would only play the least amount of cards in my hand to take care of the current threat. Hand limit is 10. When I played the "good" I was holding onto I found I got through the deck faster to get the "good" cards back into my hand quicker.

Rules Notes:
-When a fountain is destroyed, draw a card!
(I did not see this rule until my 4th game.)
-Hand Limit is 10 cards.

Ofrece una muy buena sensación de Tower Defense. Pero por el momento, lo encuentro bastante fácil. Aún tengo que poner el pawn en juego, a ver si así la cosa se complica.

RATING: 6
First impressions are that this is WAY HARDER than any of the other Oniverse games.  After two devastating losses, it is not at all clear what I could do to get better.  This isn't necessarily a negative, but it makes the game seem impenetrable.  

Further play would require extensive study, which I'm not sure I want to devote to a solitaire game that already takes ~30 minutes to play (including the initial draft, then setup, then teardown).  

I dunno, it just seems out of place with the other three games.

Right now, I would rank this after Onirim and Nautilion, but above Castellion.

[b]The theme:[/b] In [thing=143405][/thing], you are playing as forest, trying to protect from incoming blazes. There are various nasty cards that increase the power of those fires, move them closer to your trees, etc. You can extinquish those fires using fountains of appropriate strength and woodland animals help you a lot, as well. So I believe the theme to be very well incorporated in the game.

[b]The components:[/b] [thing=143405][/thing] is "just" a card game. Those cards, however, are of very solid cardstock and the artwork, the same as in [thing=156336][/thing], is very intriquing and dreamy. 

[b]The fun:[/b] If you like challenging puzzles, the game sure is fun! There is no interaction with other players (obviously), but it is indeed very challenging.

As I opened the box I fell in love, the box insert is amazing, not very practical but beautifully produced. The cards are good stock and the artwork is again superb.
In this game you are forest spirits battling against a raging fire and I really like the two player mechanic whereby one player plays cards and the other must meet the cost. This creates a very interesting dynamic.

I have only played the basic game so far which doesn't use some 50% of the cards included in the box which consist of an advanced game, two expansions and an appendix all to make the game harder.

Delightful card game about protecting a forest from fire. I love that Smokey the Bear feeling I get when playing. Jokes aside I enjoy the game and it plays well. It takes a bit more table space than I'd like but it's great at 1 player and the 2 player rules aren't bad either.

Primarily a solo tower defense game. Not quite as portable as Onirim as it takes up quite a bit more table space. Do yourself a favor and don't stick with the basic game more than once or twice, the advanced game is much better. Clever solo drafting component followed by solid hand management with a lot of difficult, weighty choices. The art, while a touch odd upon first seeing it (much like Onirim), is very fitting. Don't expect to win this one nearly as often as Onirim.

Great game for 1-3 players (officially 1-2, and technically it's a solo game with optional cooperative mode, but I've found that it tends to attract non-players as observers, who enjoy giving strategic advice). Shame it takes up so much vertical desk space, due to using essentially a 6x6 grid worth of standard-size cards.

Great game in the Oniverse series.
I like the take using the tower defense mechanism.
The drafting is quite mandatory.
I don't like the expansion Betrayals and extraordinary feats, but I love the "The elements" and The ravage token expansions.

I wouldn't mind have more expansions for this great solo card game.

A tower-defense style game. Artwork and fire token are nice. Gameplay is ok.
Couple things that we don't like it that much is it require too large footprint to play game on standard table and tends to manipulate mistaken/forgotten move during each step because everything looks confused.

Its a lovely production, and I always like the art, and as a game it was interesting, but not something as inviting as Omiron.  Assessment based on the introductory game only, but the overall feel of a tower defence game is there, but its is a little too mechanic for me.  Kept as it might be something I eventually will come back too (rating 6.312, Aug 16). UPDATE: To be honest, life is too short to come back to it! (Rating 5.324, Nov 16) UPDATE: Let go (Jan 17).

Sylvion is Torbey's meatier solo game set in the Omniverse. As straightforward as Onirim and Urbion are, Sylvion is a multi-layered card game with several juicy aspects that come together brilliantly.  A little more time and patience has to be invested in order to make it work well, but the payoff so far has been worth it. Also key to note is the continuing involvement of artist Plessis, who is as important to my enjoyment of this game as the designer. Her art retains everything that she showed in the first two games, and yet there is a luscious, more mature hand at work now.  Beautiful presentation from Z-Man as well.  If I am concerned about anything, it is that this game is apparently exceedingly difficult to win.  In Onirim or Urbion, there was enough luck to turn the tide in your favour, even if your game wasn't going so well. There is much more to control in this game. Even though luck plays its part, there is a card drafting and placement mechanic at work here which requires careful consideration. This also makes for a longer game and one where you can't keep your fingers crossed and hope everything is okay. The advanced game is where its at, but the introductory rules also have enough to explore.  Overall, Sylvion shows great growth in the designer, artist and publisher. Simply marvelous stuff here.

This is challenging Castellion as my favorite Oniverse game.  The card draft really adds to the game and the deck you draft does matter a lot.  This game and Nautilion seem to come right down to the wire on the last turn quite often.  Many times the outcome of the game is determined by which cards I manage to draw on my last couple turns.  There are a lot of tough decisions to be made during the draft, and even tougher ones to be made late in the game.  The variety of cards and their interactions make this game a bit more complex and involved than Onirim and Nautilion at the expense of table space and game length.  I am glad for the compromise.  If I am in a hurry, I grab Onirim or Nautilion.  If I want a bit more of a challenge, I grab Sylvion or Castellion.  Edited Dec. 28th  I have upgraded Sylvion to a 10.  This game ended up second, right behind Ghost Stories on my favorite Solo game list this year.  The more I play it the more I like it.

Another wonderful production, much like Onirim. It was nice to realise that the little figure actually has a purpose in this one. Card art is still really neat, but more childish/less mysterious compared to Onirim.

Messed up and were only drawing two cards initially and game was crazy hard. Played again with drawing three and game felt too easy. Need to play advanced rules still/find how the game hits that difficulty sweetspot.

Sylvion is the third game in the oniverse, a card game combining deck building and tower defence in one game. Great artwork. The box is fantastic and an example for the board game industry. This is not my favorite oniverse game due to longer gameplay

RATING: 8
Now I'm not usually a huge fan of solo games, but Friedman Friese's Friday showed me otherwise. So I thought I'd try Shadi Torbey's latest (upon hearing that it's a bit more complex than its older sibling onirim) and it is definitely a hit!

Beyond the extremely pleasant aesthetic (which extends to the game box itself this time around -- what a treat!), there is a challenging game which offers difficult choice. From the very get-go, you have to draft your deck for the game. This becomes a tense process as useful cards may disappear if you don't pick them now, but the distribution splits them up in interesting manners. 

Then onto the main game - a "plants vs zombies" style defense game in which you must protect the forest from the blaze. You use fountain plants to put out oncoming flame-lets, in addition (of course) to a few tricks up your sleeves. These tricks, in the form of forest animals provide all sorts of useful abilities (e.g., destroy a flame, peruse upcoming flame decks). However, every card has its cost to play (in cards). The flame also has a few tricks up its sleeve to make your life harder (e.g., a flame spirit that emblazons the flame-lets already on the field). 

Accordingly, the game is filled with all sorts of small yet tense decisions that aren't always obvious or easy to make, but deeply satisfying. What's better, the game only takes up the space of a 6x6 grid of cards, comes in a small box, but offers a somewhat larger game-space feel to it.

Great unique universe. This game is part of a series of game by Shadi Torvey, immersive solitary games. Like a dream that might be nightmare, like a Tim Burton movie. En este juego (diseñado para disfrutarse en solitario pero que permite hasta dos jugadores) hay un grid 4*4 por el que se desplazan los ataques del Señor del Fuego hacia el bosque primigenio que tú debes defender. Tiene una mecánica mini DBG que mediante el uso inteligente de las cartas te deja detener o destruir el avance del fuego. Muy bueno!!

I don't have much appetite for complicated solo games that take 2+ hours to complete. I tend to get bored and lose patience playing by myself for that long. However, I do travel sometimes or need to occupy myself quietly while my wife studies, and Torbey's card games are great for that. I used to enjoy an occassional game of solitaire, but I have not played plain ol' solitaire since playing Onirim a few years back. I enjoy all of his games, but Sylvion is the most thematic of them and plays almost like a full-fledged tower defense board game. All in about 30-40 minutes.

The premise of the game is that fire elementals are attacking the forest and you are the last line of defense. If you can't stop them, the forest will burn. In the full game, the elementals attack in four rows. Each row has a stack of 16 cards, which makes for 16 waves of attacks, potentially (there are cards that can remove a wave before it attacks). There are elementals from 0-3 in strength and various support cards, which can increase the strength of the elementals, give them a burst of movement, or force you to discard or remove cards from your defense deck. With your defense deck you can set up fountains to douse the elementals, trees to heal the forest, and various support cards that have a variety of helpful effects. To win, you have to defend against all elemental cards AND have a fully healed forest at the game's end. It is not easy. The elementals are quick and relentless.

The full game has a crafty drafting mechanism for you to build your defense deck, which is a little game unto itself. When finished, you really only have about half of your defense cards available for any given game, forcing you to adapt your strategy by what you were able to draft. Sylvion is beautifully designed, beautifully illustrated and even the box is beautifully crafted. It is not as quick and easy to break out as Onirim or Urbion, so it does not replace those games for me in all situations. You need a fairly substantial bit of space to play. But when those are not concerns, then this becomes my Oniverse game of choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After the grand-slam of Onirim, I had high hopes for this. To their credit, they really shook up the formula and made a clever little "tower defense" kind of game; I was worried this game might be too similar to Onirim, but thankfully that was not the case and it is its own creative package.

Unfortunately, it just fell flat for me. The number of interesting decisions was pretty small, and the majority of the game was a case of "yeah, there's only really one right move here and anything else will cause me to lose". The expansions didn't do anything for me either.

I think some people will really love Sylvion though. It's well designed and high quality, and is a unique, fun idea. It just didn't personally do much for me.

A nice solo experience. Right now I like the gameplay more than Onirim, though I find the theme of Onirim more appealing than Sylvion. Sylvion requires a longer set-up time than Onirim, but is easier to shuffle. I don't like deck building. I really do like 'Sylvion building'. ;)

I think it's amazing what Shadi can do with a deck of cards.

This game is harder to win than Onirim, but easier to win than Friday. This games motivates me more than Friday.

If you track Torbey's games as installments of his exploring mechanics, Sylvion is the deck builder, however it bucks every trend of the genre.  Rather than deterministic deckbuilding (and the hours of non game time it takes to do), your deck is made each game by clever version of a draft that limits your control and shifts the focus from synergies and maximizing probabilities to flat-out opportunism and a hope that you can add some of that other stuff too.  The decks are pitched against each other on a grid, and while novel and thematic, it ends up making the AI deck feel less predictable, more alive, as each turn is scripted by the draw of 4 cards in different locations that can interact with you, each other, and the other cards on the board.  It's as stylized a take on mechanics as it is a theme and it creates does well to create an AI that feels more like an opponent than just a problem.  I would expect no less from his effort, and no less from the result.

Oniverse games are always lovely. This one is the longest and most complex. I prefer the simpler ones, but still I enjoy the higher strategy here. The drafting bit is relaxed, it's where I get to plan strategies and awesome combos. The defense phase, however, is when the plans are chucked and hopes are dashed. Even when things seem fine the game can ramp up so unexpectedly.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  I received this as a gift and was pretty excited to give it a go.  Urbion was an okay game, but the hype I built up in my own mind didn't help me to enjoy it enough to keep it.  Anyway, Sylvion is another card game in the Oniverse series, and this one is basically a tower defense game.  Ravage cards (fire) will move from right to left across a grid of the player's cards (various "blockers" and "destroyers") hoping to keep the Forest safe from harm.

Eh.  Again, another okay game that just didn't quite click with me.  I liked the gameplay enough, but that Mobilization phase is just ridiculously fiddly, and quite obvious, IMO. It can be fun to manipulate the board state as the game progresses, but I'm not sure the game is as interesting for the length of time involved.  I do like the art, but I think there are just too many checks in the Cons column for this one. And knowing I have several other small or filler solo games that are better (Limes, Onirim, Star Realms, etc), I think this one should be sent to another home.

The art and theme in this game are tremendous - the difficulty in the co-op mode of play is ABSURD.  I haven't played it single player yet, but the basic premise is delightful: the plants, creatures, and spirits of the forest are banding together to defend against the onslaught of a wildfire.  All personified, and also all gorgeous artwork, the denizens of this game populate a classic tower defense mechanic, all rendered on cards making for a small package in the box.  And the box, surprisingly enough, is perhaps the best artistic accomplishment of the game - you open it to find cardboard flames in two flaps which you must clear away, to even get to the components and set the game up.

Well worth purchasing for a challenge, or for a fun solo game when fellow gamers aren't available.

After really enjoying Onirim, I went back to Sylvion and still find it questionable: it feels really fiddly to me.  For example, The simoon cards can have you swap out 8-12 ravage cards with their blaze versions.

Edit: played a two player, i found this way slightly berter as your partner has to discard there card for you to play yours.. adds another level of concideration.. my girl friends gave it a 9.5 out of 10.. so my ratting has got to increase based on that..

Enjoying this so far. I really liked Onirim until I 'solved' it with my wife and it became a game we didn't feel like we won by good play, but instead based on the deck. This feels less like that and there are more meaningful choices, especially in 2 player on when to use cards or save them for spending. We haven't even moved on from the introduction game yet!

Fingers crossed this one has better legs in the long term.

Sweet tower defence -style soloing. Maybe a bit unwieldy/more fiddly compared to Castellion and Onirim and not as quick, but that's not a big problem for me. Especially since on the other hand this one has more theme to it. Shadi Torbey simply rules.

RATING: 6
This is my first one player game so I don't have a lot of similar games to compare it to. At first I had a difficult (read impossible) time beating this game. After a couple games I figured out a bit of a strategy that made a lot of sense and started winning me games. 

What I like:
The drafting is fun and unique, and when you get to take some cards you really wanted to, it feels good - likewise, when the cards you wanted get taken away from you, there is a feeling of loss. There is a bit of strategy involved in building a deck, and using it to its fullest potential.
The A.I. is pretty cool with the effects that happen with each special card in the game's deck (as opposed to your deck). It really does scare you when something bad happens and you have to think through what your best move is.
When you win, it feels like an accomplishment. You definitely won't win every time, and when you do, you feel like you really won.

What I don't like:
If you draft a deck that doesn't have enough of one type of card, you could be destined to fail. There is just nothing you can do if you only have 2 cards that can destroy something with a power of 4. It's pretty much game over. The same goes for if you build a good deck, Cards are taken out of your deck at random or the ones your choose, and that happens fairly often. If the good cards in your deck happen to be the ones taken, it could spell disaster.
I also feel like there might be just a few too many of the bad cards in the game's deck. Sometimes I feel like it's a little unfair, but that does add to the part I like about winning and feeling like I actually accomplished something.

Overall, this game is good, but I would only recommend it to people who enjoy one player games in the first place. It's not going to convert anyone. It's a good way to pass the time, but it's not that enjoyable for me.

Shadi Torbey is a genius for solitaire games, this is another piece of awesome for those of us who play solo, one thing I noticed though, is that the "introductory mode" tends to be much, much harder than the actual "advanced mode" with all the rules, it can be a deterrent (I couldn't win any indtroductory wins, whereas I was able to win some of the advanced mode). But fantastic game nevertheless.

Beautiful card selection tower defense that I only played 3 times in duo, 1W 2L. First game was a humbling learning experience. 2nd, we took a very different approach and won. 3rd, we got toasted mid-stack. There's strategy in the drafting but even from the beginning, you already hope good stacks don't get destroyed; then it's mostly hoping for high number fountains early, hoping 0 fire and +1/4 don't show up together, hoping fire catches appropriate defenses, last long enough and have sufficient trees in your deck.

[b]Sylvion[/b] was sold via auction 2/14/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Similar to Onirim, Sylvion is a very fun solo game with amazing art and despite thinking I'd play a bunch of solo games last summer while I was home I never did. Part of the reason is when I think about setting up a solo game I talk myself out of it and usually end up on BGG for a bit. On top of that at least one of my kids is usually willing to play a game with me, so solo opportunities don't come around very often. All that said my original thoughts still stand and I still think Sylvion is a great game, but it wasn't getting any play at my house so I sold it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Some of the best artwork I've ever seen [-]in a board game[/-], period.
- This art in the game creates this surreal world which really immerses me in the game.
- I love the way you draft the deck of cards you're going to play and it also increase replay and encourages you to try different deck compositions.
- This is a tower defense game that I don't need a computer to play!
- You can easily set this up and play in 30 minutes or less.

Up until recently I haven'y played many solo games [i](well since playing Risk solo as a kid)[/i], but I was drawn to this game and Onirim because of the art. I'm happy to say this game also delivered on creating a really fun solo game that is quick to set up and delivers a fun tower defense style card game.[/i]

The basic game seems to be one of reducing and cycling the deck as quickly as possible to retrieve and replay the best cards, whilst counting down the worst cards in the bad deck. Which doesn't make for too many interesting decisions, and leaves you tossing on the winds of fate, which can be quite brutal. The advanced game provides a very cool pre-game deck-building mechanism which definitely adds a nice spark (and a rating point), where you choose batches of cards to build the strategic approach you'd like to take into the upcoming battle. This element, and the included expansion variants, are going to provide enough exploration time to feel I've had value.

It's beautiful! One of the best looking games I own (if not the best). In a very fairytaleish way. Just like Wes Anderson movies.

I love the theme (fire elements vs trees and animals in a battle to save the woods).

The game itself is just OK, both solo and 2p. If you don't like the artwork and the theme, don't bother. If you do go out and get it!

Personally I prefer Onirim, which has a more simple and addictive feel to it, exactly like a solitaire. Far and away better than Castellion.

RATING: 7
Quite a bit harder than Onirim.  I would not say it is better than Onirim because Onirim serves a different purpose for me.  Onirim is a very portable game that  has a small footprint and is quick to set up and play.  Onirim is quite easy to play several games back to back and you can win a lot if you stick with the base game.  Sylvion, once you have moved past the introductory game, requires your full attention.  It takes a little time to set up and the drafting phase is very important.  Every turn requires wise decisions and you have to have good timing as to when and where to start populating the battlefield with trees.  It is much more of a complete "game" than Onirim.  And man does it feel good to win since it does not happen very often.  And you really do feel like you saved the forest.

By the way, there was a discussion in a thread debating the quality of the art.  (Well, it really was not a debate.  It was many against one).  The art here is phenomenal. The artist chose a whimsical style that mimics what a (talented) child might come up with.  The elemental cards don't look like fire; they "feel" like fire.  The impressionistic images on the Sylvion cards are simply brilliant.  The stag with trees as antlers creates connections that just would not be there had the artist drawn a realistic animal.  Great stuff.

One last note:  Sylvian absolutely destroys Urbion, which I never really liked to begin with.

Alright, where to begin with this game? First off, hands down, the art is wonderful in it. Very beautiful, very dreamy, very reminiscent of a kids book. The packaging is spectacular. Components are very good, although I would have preferred a linen finish on the cards. The game is also quite the table hog.

The difficultly of this game is strange. Obviously designing a solo game is particularly difficult. You can't make it too easy or the game is boring, make it too hard and the game isn't fun. I found a lot of the difficulty comes with the cards coming out in a specific order. If you get slammed the first turn by a few zeros turning into 4, it's pretty much game over. Yes, you can mitigate it, but again, it's through a random card draw.

I found the basic intro game good only for teaching. I suppose that's what it's there for, but honestly once you have a game or two under your belt, switch over. Much, much better game. I'm usually someone who sticks on basic difficulty until I feel confident to move on, this one is practically required after a couple games.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the game. It's a bit fiddly sometimes, but I've grown to accept that from Shadi Torbey and his solo games. If you want something that plays in about half an hour and isn't too brain burny, check this one out.

[b]Expansion 1[/b] - This is a nice addition to the game. It provides alternate ways to win (however difficult they may be) and adds some powerful versions of other cards. To balance this, they have cards that are dead upon drawing that you'll either discard immediately or discard another card and remove the betrayal card permanently from the game. It doesn't sound too problematic, but drawing those at the inopportune time really can hinder your progress. I really enjoyed this expansion, I just wish they had a card that referenced all of these since iconography is gone from them.

6/10

[b]Expansion 2[/b] - This one has some incredibly difficult cards to deal with and extends the deck now to 20 cards each. But to deal with the added difficulty, they give you a few super powerful geyser cards that can just wipe out any fire cards in a row. I liked this one quite a bit and I for sure am going to have this mixed in 100% of the time. The other expansion seemed less necessary to me, but a good change of pace. It also looks like some of the cards are missing a letter as to when they trigger. (A) for the geysers and (B) for the Acid Rain which is mildly frustrating.

8/10

I have yet to try the fire elemental token.

Solo or Co-op, deck draft and tower (forest) defense, set in the 'Oniverse'. The deck draft and set up is probably preferable to the constant shuffling of Onirim. Modular expansions and difficulty settings provides a fair amount of variety.
Love the semi-psychedelic, dreamland artwork (particularly the animals: squirrels!); the box quality and design is really unique.

RATING: 7
I’ve had a little run of solo gaming this year, kicked off by Onirim, so I had to try the sequel. It’s a more involved game and greedier with table space, but similarly addictive. Playing a dozen times in quick succession, one of the things that must be really hard about designing a solo game strikes me. Games have a learning curve and in a multiplayer game the players hopefully get better together, allowing the challenge to be maintained. But in a solo game, the game has to do that, and if the designer is not allowed computer AI, that's tough! The way Shadi Torbey tackles that problem (in both Onirim and Sylvion) is by adding a huge number of options for tweaking the difficulty settings as you learn the game. It works well, and it needs to – the game is so much more fun when you’re on the edge of losing than when you’re winning easily.

Expanding my 1-2 player collection. Fascinating little gem with loads of depth as you drift into advanced and expanded play. Love the idea of defense deck building prior to the main battle.

In reality - not really a 2-player game but great solo.

RATING: 8
Currently my favorite fast solitaire game - beats "Onirim" by a bit and "Friday" by several miles. Good advice - skip the basic mode even in your first play. It's just bare bones, automatic and uninteresting. The real fun starts with the advanced mode.

Both the recruitment phase and the main battle phase are great. The former is a deckbuilding affair - you create your Sylvan deck which you later use to fight the baddies. (Fear not, the mechanics are simple and intuitive; it takes several minutes most, but the decisions are important.) And then there's the battle phase, which is basically a tower defense game. Ever played "Plants and Zombies"? Then you know everything you need to know.

It's also worth noting that the production values are top notch! Art is subjective, but personally I love Oniverse, and all the little details, like the thematic box and the little fire meeple... Just wow!

played only the intro game but a really interesting mix of deck management with a timer aspect.  There really is a sense of urgency, struggle and desperation as you literally are putting out fires. SO much so it almost feels like you are being beaten by a club.  This is not a good thing because being beat by a club isn't fun. Lets hope the game doesn't continue to feel this way. I do love the artwork on the cards but unfortunately it really does make it difficult to decipher the cards.  After a few more plays this game just seems so difficult that random luck is the only way to win.  The decisions in the game are boring and this game just feels like it plays itself.  Less fun each time I've played.

The base game is ok and bit too easy.  The advanced game gets much more interesting, and the two expansions add a lot of tactical and strategic variation.  It's good to start with the simple versions to get a handle of the game, but don't judge the game too swiftly!  With everything folded in the game is superb.  It's a bit too easy, but the game includes recommendations for how to raise the difficulty, which I need to try.

An excellent game exhibiting several clever ideas that fit together well.

I also find myself liking the art and theme more and more.  At first, I didn't like the art style, but the more I look at it the more I see subtleties of the art that suggest a very bizarre (but coherent) world.  The art is also very good at reminding you of the card function, and at being absurd without being silly.

Only second game I've played as solo. 1st was Friday. Really liking Sylvion so far and definitely agree with the Plants vs Zombies vibe that people have mentioned. Only played twice so far and both were introductory games. Will probably do it this way a few more times before I feel comfortable stepping up to the other difficulty levels. ..... and then there is still even the expansions to look forward too. Everybody should give this one a try. It's very thematic and the mechanics and card play just make intuitive sense and this helps make it easy to pick up without getting bogged down by trying to remember too many new rules. Sylvion really lets you go right to the fun!

Extremely fun to play, interesting mix of hand management, strategical and tactical decisions. The drafting at the start adds another layer of complexity. 
The advanced rules are good, adding the expansions makes for a lot of variety. There are different victory conditions, depending on what cards are in play.
Very well done.

Delightful art, small package (big footprint), tower defense style game. Interesting game play with some meaningful decisions. However, we've found the round structure to be a bit clunky and the game has not yet given us much of a challenge. Perhaps a few more plays on higher difficulty settings will push this higher up.

Solid solitaire card game! If you can find a copy, add it to your collection! I actually picked this one up while out looking for a different Shadi Torbey card game called Onirim.  I found out that both games are currently out of print, and most online retailers have doubled the price of these normally inexpensive games. My local gaming store had a copy of Sylvion at the original price so I grabbed it. I didn't expect to like it as much as I liked Onirim, based on all the playthroughs of both games I had seen on YouTube. Turns out I was wrong. There's actually an app of Onirim so I've been able to play both games. Onirim is great, but I like Sylvion so much better!

After few first plays on the introductory difficulty, I'm pleasantly surprised. After Onirim, this one is a bit more thinky and more strategic. You have your deck, but you go through it multiple times, sometimes you just get rid of some cards just to get the ones you need. It really makes you think and worry. Onirim is a more relaxing and takes less table space, but if I want something I will think about more, this is deffinitely the one I'm picking. If I want a quick play or play on the go, I'd pick Onirim.

But I must say I'm intrigued by Shadi Torbey's designs and I actually wait if Urbion gets a reprint. Since I play mostly solo, because my friends are usually not that much into gaming as I am, these games are just the thing I need. And since it can be played even with 2 players and it actually poses a greater challenge with 2, I just love that.

Can't wait to play it some more.

And as a side note, the artwork is awesome. It falls into that "dreamy" world well, there are whales in the forest and fishes! Why? Because it's a dream world. These things really get you into the theme even though it's just some cards.

With Oniverse games I found out I'm really getting into the theme unlike many other card games. Just drawing those elementals, they look like they'll burn you on the spot. And the box is awesomely done. The fact you go through fire and forest to find a rulebook... Love it. Also the rulebook is very cleverly put together, gives you information in the right order and it doesn't feel intimidating, the writing there looks inviting in fact and those pictures help it a lot.

Thumbs up for this game, giving it 8 due to too few plays and also it takes more tablespace, takes longer than Onirim, which is a bit of a drawback to me, but the game rewards these things with good play.

I never quite know how much control I have when playing a Shadi Torbey design; I played a lot of Urbion and the more I played, the less I felt that I was actually making a difference to the outcome. Sylvion, at least on my first few plays, feels more as though I'm actually having an influence on whether I win or lose. I've enjoyed my first five plays (2 basic, 3 advanced) and let's see what future plays bring...

The art is the first thing that draws you in, and the box has a nice felted inlay.  Easy to set up, and can be made harder by the included "expansion."  It is a "tower defense" style game. I've played this one player and two player, and I enjoyed the one player game more.  The two player was okay, but with the combos of Ravage cards coming up, we just didn't have the resources with 2 cards a draw to combat it at all.  Will replay it with two and update, especially since I get the strategy more now.

This is a solitaire tower defense game where you control fantastical woodland creatures (plus a whale?) trying to save a dreamland-type forest. I love the artwork, a highly but I've seen a lot of reviews out there hating it. I think it's one of the cooler 'box opening' experiences out there, for a little game. It's a fairly intense, and just the right amount of difficulty; you can feel like the fires are under control and then have sudden flareups take you to the brink. I think it's designed well from a progression standpoint: I've beaten all of the expansions now (included in the box), but I certainly couldn't at the beginning. I think the theme, artwork, ramping up of gameplay and master make this a nice game to get; I like it!

I was mostly drawn to Sylvion for the whimsical theme and art.  The art is great, and the box even opens in a really cool way that shows a forest on fire.  It can also be played 2 player co-op, so I hope my wife can enjoy it before too long.  I've only played one game solo with the standard rules, and the strategy seemed fairly straightforward.  But the difficulty is adjustable and there are expansion rules in the box, so I'm looking forward to exploring the game more.

Really didn't know what to expect after Onirim (a game I really like) and Urbion (a game I don't like at all). This seems to be the best of them all.

There's a unique card-drafting phase to begin with that's packed with decisions. Once you have your deck, you start the game with only the cards in that deck. You'll never gain any more cards, but you will lose cards from your deck each time a certain enemy card comes out, and each time you cycle through your whole deck. This game has a lot of interesting hand management and deck management going on.

Have only played one advanced game so far so my rating could go up or down with more plays, but so far I really like it.

Pretty satisfied after a runthrough of just the base game.  Won on my first try which means I know I'll need to step up to the advanced game and expansions after a couple more tries to get used to the basic mechanics and strategy decisions.  

One thing: this game has an ABYSMAL instruction book.  Really hard to make sense of what the game actually was, and I needed to watch a couple playthroughs online before I had a grasp of what was happening.  But once you are on the other side of that, it's quite fun.

About [thing=143405][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=143405][/thing] is a tower defense type of game, only the tower is a forest and the attackers are Fire Elementals sent forward by the bidding of the Fire Lord - it is probably wildfire season and he wants to do his part, and he is also mad.

The game is set in the Oniverse, home of [thing=94389][/thing], [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=143404][/thing].

In order to fight back, the denizens of the forest got together: so the Fountains gush water, the Whales shepherd the flames, the Stags and newly planted Trees heal the damages, the Squirrels spy on the plans of the Fire Elementals, the Fish feed, no, no, not food, feed power. It is necessary to resist to the attacks until the Final Assault comes. 

[thing=143405][/thing] mix phase of draft, when the deck is built, then a bigger phase of battling the Elementals. Everything is done in about 30 minutes.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The basic game has two ways to be played: Introductory and Advanced. In the Introductory, the player deck comes pre-built (so no draft phase), there are only two types of special cards in the Elementals deck (Blaze and Simoon) and the plays lasts for 12 rounds. The goal is the same of the Advanced mode: resist the attacks and heal the forest.

I just went to the Advanced. In this mode, the play starts with a Mobilization phase, in wich there is a very neat draft of cards, where some are lost every round, thus there is a feel of urgency, gamble and risk. Very nice indeed. Though I heard that some players, in order to play faster, just skip this phase - they shuffle the deck, cut in about half and start playing. This won't affect gameplay, however, how the draft phase was done here is a really nice and easy way to build a deck.

Then comes the Battle phase, which will be the main part of the game. The board is set with Edge cards forming the, well, three edges of a 4x4 grid. The fourth edge of the grid is formed by the Elementals deck, which is divided in four piles of 16 cards. Every round, the top card of each of the four piles will be revealed and its effects applied. Several cards will be Elementals cards, and these are the ones that will move in the grid and the ones the player must prevent from reaching the other side - every Elemental that do makes across, deals damage equal to its strenght (from 1 to 4). Other cards will be the support cards: Blaze (make Elementals stronger), Simoon (make Elementals move faster), Desiccation (player loses cards from hand) and Demobilization (player loses cards from the discard or one random from the draw deck). After this, the player will draw three cards (and starts the Battle phase with eight cards) and can play as many cards as she wants and can pay to use.

The goal of the player is to resist the advancing Elementals, not lose all the life of the forest (12 health, which are the Edge cards), then, after the Final Assault, when every Elemental in the board advances until is destroyed by a Fountain or hits the Edge, if the forest is fully healty, the player wins!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Lots and lots. Everything is a decision in the game. It starts from the draft phase, in which you choose cards to build your deck. The cards are set in rows, and, every time, after you pick a row of cards, a full row of cards will be gone. So you can choose to take a row with fewer cards (but good ones) or choose to wait, until the row has more cards (a row can have from 1 to 4 cards). Risk and reward.

Then, afterwards, more decisions when considering your hand of cards. This happens because of a rule I like very much: several cards have cost to be used, and you pay this cost by discarding cards. Is the same principle used in [thing=28143][/thing] or in [thing=8217][/thing], both favorites of mine. This simple rule makes for me hard decisions - you can use a neat card, but in order to do this, you will have to discard another very good. Or you could wait until the next turn, when you will draw 3 new cards, but, by then, something terrible can already happened.

And not only which card to use is a decision, but [u][i]where[/i][/u] to use it is also, as the board is a grid, and the positioning of the Fountain cards are key to make a good stand against the Elementals. Also, several cards affect the decks of the Elementals, but you must pick which to affect.

Also, the game leaves several aspects in the hand of the player to choose. The designer could have made the Demobilization card just have one straight effect: lose one card at random from the draw deck. Simple. But the game allows for a choice: either lose two you pick from the discard or one at random from the draw deck. The Desiccation is the same: either lose two cards you pick from your hand or one at random.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
Almost everything are good things.
- The draft phase is great: filled with decisions, tense, and an easy way to allow for more choices and increase replay value;
- Tough choices throughout the whole play;
- Artwork, as expected, is awesome and even the inside of box is made as a work of art;
- Includes two expansions that further increases options and replay value;
- Language independent - and the symbols are easy to understand and remember.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Though not as much as in [thing=71836][/thing], there are still a good deal of shuffling decks in here;
- Random parts make harder for applying a strategy in the game, so most decisions are tatical - almost literally you are always trying to put down fires;
- The box could be a little bigger - the cards with sleeves don't fit right and even the manual suffers in the edges;
- I saw that there are concerns about the low difficulty of game, but, up to some point, the game offers ways to increase difficulty: draw 2 cards instead of 3, start the game with some damage. Also the Elementals expansion makes the game harder overall, and the same is valid for variant using the Ravage pawn.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
[thing=143405][/thing] hits its theme very well, as there is always this tug of war: do something now or wait to have more discard options. Is indeed like a battle: deply forces now, or wait for the enemy movement, to see what the other side is planning, to wait for reinforcements.

You will feel like a General, trying to defend your homeland, use your armies, in order to face off the enemy. But, as in a war, sometimes the resources simply aren't going to be there ("Where are those damn Pigeons?! Where is my water?!"), and you will have to make the best of what you do have.

[thing=143405][/thing] offers a lot in its small box. It is a complete game, built in with lots of replay in mind. [thing=143405][/thing] hit a note with me and is souding in my mind strongly so far: I just can't stop thinking about it and its possibilities. A very neat design, with several nice things.

Single-player tower defense type game where you are protecting a forest from advancing fire spirits trying to ravage it. The basic game is way too easy. It gets interesting in the advanced game where you draft your deck beforehand, and then work with what you have. Might still be a little easy, but add in the Ravage token, and oh man, there's the challenge!

RATING: 8
Follows Onirim's stunning artwork & exceptional use of expansions/variants to scale the challenges. This rating presumes the full game (advanced + all expansions).

Utterly different than Onirim while keeping a similar (pleasurable) spirit of play. Aesthetics, theme, and mechanics blend beautifully.

Onirim is inward thematically - wayfinding in a dreamscape. Sylvion has an opposite outwardness in theme and gameplay, battling fire elementals to save a magical forest, and the play area is a changing landscape laid out in a large grid. The timing & push your luck decisions use the randomness of the cards just right, and even these factors are highly mutable game to game as you can tinker with having more or less control with the way you build your deck in the opening summoning phase.

The opening summoning phase is a well conceived, a very quick, in-game deck building sequence to establish your deck (which will approximate 1/2 the forest cards, but this can vary widely in size based on your strategy). I don't like deck building games, but this nails it as a fast & pleasant game opener that you can give weight or not as you desire, and as you gain experience you'll use it more as a player-driven means of handicapping yourself instead of pure advantage-seeking.... just an exquisite way of framing a 'well played game' for yourself, be it a uphill challenge or an easier route. All this just hangs together with a clever feel for timing & effort. 

Sylvion differs from Onirim, too, in that the game plays a separate deck against you, and that deck changes with the expansions, not just your deck. 

The whole idea of saving the forest from the fire, with animals providing support in the form of special effects (look aheads; hand, deck & economic manipulations; strikes) really is sweet & spirited both. And the fire deck attacks not only the forest but your hand and deck. 

It has a similar addictive quality as Onirim. Climbing the ladder to mastery & then letting you change things up dramatically to keep the challenges coming as well as deepening the play & riffing off the core ideas. In the case of Sylvan, the expansion cards you can draft, along with loading you up with more choices & dangers, can explore much more risky win conditions that still keep together that artful whimsy that makes the whole much more than it's parts.

Sylvion is an unusual tower defense game in the mold of Plants vs. Zombies... except brains are required in the Oniverse. 

The Advanced game is virtually the same in battle as Introductory.  That is where the similarity ends.  The deck building, or Mobilization portion of the game is engaging and stands out as its own mini-game worth playing out multiple times to develop a deeper strategy and explore the sort of decks you come up with.  

Sylvion goes even deeper.  There are interactions with cards that create an ongoing deck rebuild as they require you to remove 1-2 cards in your discard pile from play.  This happens before you reshuffle the discard pile when your deck is empty and from a Ravage card that depicts a Squirrel on crutches.  But this mechanic (and squirrel) is your friend because the way the initial deck building is implemented having some cards you do not really need in your deck is inevitable.  Deck thinning is good!

Artistic direction in its simplicity and style creates the Oniverse.  The way the images are put together reminds me of people who are emotionally disturbed and so it probably is striking that chord with me... as in the art is like the hand drawn hallucinations of a real living unstable person's vision of the world... a person that I have known.

Scoring thanks to lines42

At the end of the game you score points:

+1 point for each Edge card on its Bloom side.

+1 point for each unspent vitality point (as per Tree cards) on the battlefield.

-1 point for each Edge card on its Desolated side.

-1 per Ravage card in the Ravage stacks, except if you win by an Extraordinary Feat card´s ability, then:

+1 per Ravage card in the Ravage stacks.


A score of 12 or more points is a win.
Note that in theory you can score 12+ points even if you lose the game, but that is hard to pull off, so I wouldn´t mind counting it as a special-reward "win".

I first played a the cooperative two player version of this at SPIEL, and really enjoyed it. We also tried Castellion, twice, and both games were interesting enough that I walked away owning all three current Oniverse titles.

I play this at The Siege (advanced game) level, with The Ravage (pawn), and all the expansions: Extraordinary Feats and Betrayal (#1), The Elements (#2), and Below Ground (#3). I think that the game is very good, and the drafting phase is great. However, the game needs a reference sheet. I hate flipping through the rules to find what each card does every single time I play the game.

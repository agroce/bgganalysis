kind of cool.  All cards have a roll for enter and exit of play.  so to play a card, you have to roll.  to destroy any card in play, you have to roll.

lots of placing treasure and then cards to guard the treasure while other players are placing monsters to steal your treasure and bring them into a free-zone when anyone can kill the monster and claim the treasure.

Seemed a little slow with 2 players.  might be better with 3 or 4.

It's neat, but didn't really stand out as having lots of fun.

RATING: 5
Some text on the cards, that you have to constantly read - your cards and pretty much every other card played on the table. With a lot of players you don't really remember what cards everyone else has played in his/her play area, but it's obviously important to know, it's very annoying to stretch out and having to read it over and over again. The art is nice, in a cartoonish fashion.

It's just a deck of cards, and you have to use 1 die from another game, or a coin.

Light fun for my son and I. A take that game that rewards good card draws and good timing of card play. It can be a little frustrating when you don't get the card you need to win, but if another player has it, there are several ways to get it to your realm. This really balances the luck of the draw component of the game.

A good aggressive card game. I have so far only played it with two or three players, and it is a VERY aggressive game with few players. There are only so many people that you can play those nasty cards on. Because of this, I think it will be slightly better with moer, and I think my rating might rise when I have tried it with 5-6 players.

Edit: played it with six now and it was better, but who wins is mostly a random decision.

RATING: 6
This was fun & wonderful art!  Nice fast paced game.  The random dice roll was hedged with strategic card play, and was balanced between everyone anyway - bad roll? Then make a more conservative second action and replenish any lost cards.  Play is fast and random loss is mitigated by smart card play and speed of game progression, easy to catch up.

We liked it.

Boring "take that" game with an added level of randomness because each card requires a die roll to bring it out (and to get rid of it once it is out).  The artwork is cute, and I like the theme, but the game takes forever to finish and is so tedious I can't see ever playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
FANTASTIC! However, the first time playing, i thought it was too simplistic. But after a couple of games, when the concepts clicked, i got it and love it. It is theme rich, and has some suprising depth of game play once you figure out certain card combinations. For what it is, a fast, easy to pick up, heavily replayable game, I think it is quite successful. The diversity of cards (some more than others) makes each game very different.

Played group and team versions! This game gets better and better.

RATING: 5
For the price, this isn't all that bad of a game, but it's not one I would want to play much.  Lots of chaos and luck, with the theme being one of the more appealing parts of the game.  I do like the artwork, though.  On the plus side, younger kids can understand this game fairly easily.  The price of entry being able to read at probably the 2nd grade level or so.  Fans of heavily thematic but chaotic games like Killer Bunnies would probably like this.

Luck of the draw and dice rolls to play cards.  Sounds like a randomized nightmare, but instead it plays as a fun little take that game.  The victory condition is possible to achieve on your second turn if you're lucky, so the game rarely outstays it's welcome.

Similar to Munchkin, but better because it doesn't have all the silliness.  This is an adventure card game with lots of randomness from the card draw.  You acquire companions, items, treasure, and places and you can play Events and Creatures to affect other players.  I dislike all the chaos--it's very likely that you will not end up keeping any cards you play in front of you for very long before another player discards or steals them.  Suffers from "bash the leader", making for a longer game.  Overall, I thought it lasted a bit longer than I would prefer, but not by much.  It IS better than Munchkin :)

I groan when I think that I paid $20 USD at my FLGS for this game. That being said, a simple, fast playing little game that could conceivably end in 2 minutes. (Depending on the hand you're dealt) I enjoy fantasy themed games, especially dungeon crawls. I picked this one up based entirely on the theme alone. I've played this several times with my wife, and we enjoyed ourselves. I would suggest coming to this game with very low expectations and relishing it for what it is - a quick "take that" kind of game with a fantasy dungeon crawl theme. If you can pick it up for less than $10, then consider it a nice little filler game to pass the time.

An enjoyable take that genre game. A lot of choices and variety of cards. It can definitely draw out longer than the 10 minutes listed in the rules. Solid theme and I like some of the mechanics in the game like the wild lands where creatures can grab other people's items and run off to. Anyway, it's fairly easy to teach and our group has enjoyed our playings of it.

RATING: 8
As a 3-player game, this is an 8, maybe even a 9 as a fast, fun diversion.
As a 4 player game, it is a 6 or 7, depending on how much time there is to spend on playing.
As a 5 player game it's a 5 (not horrible, but so long there are much better games to be played in that amount of time.)

Having played this multiple times, 3 player games went an average of 20 minutes. 4 player games went an average of over an hour (because of one endless 2.5 hour game) otherwise they averaged 30-40 m inutes, and a 5 player game took over 2 hours. The 4-5 player games were all by experienced players.

The 3 player games were fun and addictive. The 4 player games were similar except for the long 2.5 hour game. It was fun to have that epic game once, but it grew tiresome in the latter stages. The 5 player game was not very fun, as we had hoped to get in a quick game before playing other games; unfortunately, the game was not quick.

Basically, if most play an offensive game, the play times can be kept shorter, and more fun can be had. If most play defensively, it is still mostly fun, but prepare for prolonged "trench warfare".

This game is reasonably fun and is easy to learn. Gameplay can range from 10 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending upon card draw and player choices and that could either be good or bad. The artwork is fun and descriptive. There is certainly a screw-you factor to this game.

Got this off Thoughthammer for ~$8, and this was a very pleasant surprise. Easy rules, good artwork, simple & fast play. If I am rating this game based on my usual strategy game criteria, it rates lower. However, rating it on its own merits, simple, quick, and fun play, I give it the 8. With 6 players, it can drag a little, as the treasures don't come out quick enough, yet it doesn't suffer from "Mille Bornes Syndrome" (where the number of hazards quash any fun, because just as you ready yourself to play again, some 'tard puts another hazard on you; gee, that's fun). In a two-player match, the Stink Eye card is a problem, but not so bad it ruines the game. I'd say this works best for 3-5, and can be played by all ages. Fun for both a family game, and a quick filler on games nights.

Reminds me of Groo the Destroyer Card game, except not as good.  Seems like it is far easier in this one to hold people back from victory than Groo, and Groo takes FOREVER to finish with 4 or more players.  I can't imagine how long this would have gone had I been able to stay to see it complete...maybe 3-4 hours?  The only way you can win is:

1 - get a lucky draw
2 - don't get your lucky draw slammed by interrupts
3 - roll the entries on a die

That is 3 major random elements to victory to making it only slightly less random than Fluxx.  Still, it has its merits...it's hillarious.  You have to take it for what it is...a "take that" game.

RATING: 4
Too random for my taste - as a player I want to care about the options I have. But if my options are rendered meaningless by high randomness, it's frustrating to me. Also, I've found that we came across unclear rules terms on some of the cards, and had to make many on the spot interpretations/ rulings to mend that problem.

RATING: 6
Quick and surprisingly fun, with a fairly significant variation in play time (I've seen two player games range from 3-20 minutes).  This is not a strategy game; pretty much every game will be decided by a combination of dice luck and draw luck.  One would think, given this, that the game would get frustrating pretty quickly, but it's saved by two things: first, the short playtime, and second, the fact that each of the 100 cards is different, which (so far) keeps the play fresh and interesting.  Decent filler, good travel game, and great with younger kids (age 7+ should be fine) who will love the card art.

RATING: 9
OK. I have to give this game a glowing review because my play group loves it and I really like it too. This game is casual, normally quick, and fun. I suspect the rating is low because the mechanics (some characters are overpowered, it relies heavily on dice, and the STINKEYE card) are a little wonky. However, the game is still playable.

It has a feel like Munchkin but with less stress over backstabbing others because you can win if you play skillfully enough even if you get trashed a couple turns. And ganging up normally doesn't happen in the same sense as Munchkin does.

The goal is to get three treasures, one of each type (gold, silver, bronze). Other players can steal from you or destroy your items so you have to play your hand carefully. 

Usually you can win if you have one treasure out, a couple of dice boosting cards, and the remaining two treasures in your hand or in reach.

Nice game. I would recommend to anyone.

This game is great to play in teams. The best is 4-6 players with 2 or 3 teams. It's tons of fun once you have learned the cards in the deck and know how to play them.

Simple 'D&D' themed beer & pretzels card game. Players roll a D6 to bring cards (representing creatures, treasure, items etc) in and out of play. The object is to get a Bronze, Silver and Gold Treasure Item into play.

Fun at first (cute graphics) but soon wears out its welcome. Too many players bog the game down and clawing at the leader just prolongs the agony. Too many of the cards are 'samey'.

A light dungeoncrawl theme-based card game.  Heavy on dice rolling.  Random.  But light, quick, and fun.  Replay value is high because it is so quick.  I like the mechanic of having to roll to get your items/creatures/traps into the game.  It is unique.

[Studio 9 Games edition] {Beer&Pretzels, fantasy; sabotaging, set collection, dice-rolling} It's supposed to be a hilarious game like Munchkin. It should be a shorter game than Munchkin, too. However, it's not that in reality. My first impression is that it is even worse than Munchkin because there are more 'take that' cards in proportion than Munchkin. Therefore, the game can't end at all. Maybe, it would be better if more 'useful' or 'defensive' cards are provided. 

[Update] I tried this game with a group of 3 players and 5 players. We terminated it in both occasions after 30 minutes of play, when we can't see a definite end time (none of the players had more than 1 treasure when we terminated the games). Unless I am convinced that we have played it wrongly, I have no more interest to play this game again.

Easy, funny game.  The artwork is great.  The D6 rolling with the easy modifiers reminds of playing Steve Jackson game books.  It plays so fast that we get a few games in under 30 min.  Definitely not to be taken seriously but played with a sense of fun.

It doesn't seem like there's an awful lot of strategy. Mess with your opponents until you can play a gold treasure, then on the next turns play your silver and bronze for the win.

This is a completely arbritrary and silly game, but for some reason I found it a lot of fun.  I like the theme, and the game sort of tells an adventure story as it goes along, funny things happen, and at some point, someone will win in interesting fashion.

RATING: 5
A chaotic card game,  this is best experienced as an  occasional divergence between two players.

Considering the type of game this is,  I am probably in the minority, falling somewhere in the middle on this one,  as I think it would be more apt to the extremes.  

The design has some merit and the effort is incontestable,  clearly apparent through the many different card designs that are contained within.

The game can be a daunting task to endure at times and the frequency that you find yourself reaching for this one,  ostensibly with quivering hands,  should be kept to a minimum.

This game is one that I came across randomly while searching around on Thoughthammer. The design and art are both by Aaron Kreader. The beauty of this game is in the theme. When playing the game, I feel like the players are doing exactly what you see on the cover of the box - trying to get all the good treasures and keep them safe from other players or creatures grabbing them. The game is short (with 2-3 players), the art is wonderful and cartoony, and it's so easy to teach and learn. We've had a lot of fun with this game.

This game did indeed remind me of Munchkin. Thankfully, it is quite a bit more streamlined, and turns end quickly once you get to know the cards. The game is also very easy to teach, and the rules are clear and coherent. Furthermore, it plays fine with two. Still, the game fails to offer something new and it reminded me of the fact that I am no big fan of games in which you find a lot of theme but no system. The lack of a system makes one game finish quite fast, and another drag on forever. I would rather play a card game that is either more involving (Anima, Dungeoneer) or more original (Fairy Tale, Bang!). Admittedly, that is a matter of taste.

Good game but chock full of 'take that' cards, a style of gameplay we're not keen on.

I'm still learning this game but I already love it. Each card is different with fantastic artwork. The creatures are hilarious. The great thing is that you can play this game if you only have a short break. It is easy enough for my niece (age 10) to play but still interesting and fun for me and my husband. Great game!

Treasures and Traps is the adventure card game that puts you on a quest for riches. Each card can open the door to a tricky challenge, a magical assistance, or a valuable treasure.

The approximate playing time is 10-30 minutes for two players. Add 10 minutes for each additional player.

Be the first player to get a Gold, Silver, and Bronze TREASURE card into your realm. Your other cards give you the powers you will need to keep others from winning.

A game that I'm happy to take on camping weekends, since I don't care if it's split, mangled, or winds up inside a ravenous badger.

Yet there are a few nice touches to [i]Treasures & Traps[/i], if I'm being honest.  T&T is automatically better than any other take-that game, since cards require die rolls to enter play.  So there's always a chance that your opponent will blow his roll when he tries to kneecap your troll with his fairy princess.

And it's nice that creatures don't steal cards outright, but instead move them into the neutral zone so that anyone can take a shot at them.  This means that players can set themselves up for a "creature attack" + "attempted steal" double action - but, again, this only works if both die rolls are successful.  Which is where the light tension and mild fun come into play.

Having said all of the above, this is a featherlight game that won't see play outside of a national park because it's long, repetitive, and relatively weak.  Close, but no fantasy cigar.

UPDATE 07-08-15: We have played two, 2P games now. I don't like the auction element as much with 2 players as I do with 3 or 4. That could be an issue long-term. We'll see if this ends up staying in our collection because of this.

I like the patching part.  I like the auction for tiles part.  I like the *idea* of the engine-building part.

I don't like the disincentive to get more than 3 workers (each worker is roughly equivalent to 2 food per round, so once the per-round cost for the next worker is >= 2 food there's no reason to buy them).  I don't like the too-slow incrementation of tile power (it creeps upward without any real or interesting variation).  I don't like the increased length due to careful play during the auction phase (I wouldn't call it AP as I can't blame people for wanting to get it right and be thoughtful/careful with a crucial element).  I don't like that the *optimal* engine is extremely limited (2 wheels, 3-4 purple, and you're mostly good).  I don't like that the seemingly-primary scoring mechanism (voting) isn't more powerful and significant.

Since I like the underlying theory, I'd consider attempting to address some of these except it's a lot.

I'm open to more plays to see if my impressions are accurate.

The patching is cool. Really cool. I like it a lot. But there are a lot of elements to the game that just seem like they have messy, rough edges. I'm not sure how I feel about the game's arc or balance. I hate to see certain players simply abused because one or two are doing well and there's nothing they can do about it anymore (or worse, be the player being abused... I admit, I was an abuser). More experience and the right players might make me like it a bit more, but who knows!

Very interesting game with a unique patching mechanism.  Our first game went a bit long and we have to stop after the 2nd era.  I did have the lead at that point.  Style wise it was very reminiscent of Nations, but with the added spatial component.  While I recognize that this is what makes it a bit unique in this increasingly crowded topic, it is not something I typically care for.  Rating might go up, but at this point, I'm not going to pick up a copy unless it gets discounted.

Patchistory is a beautiful civilization building game that provides a similar "itch" to Through the Ages.  Simple but introduces some interesting challenges with the puzzle making and also the campaigning portion and setting up a strategy with the prosperity cards.

Tentatively an 8, but could go higher with additional plays.

Bueno:

- Juego de civilizaciones. Se siente el crecimiento y la evolución, hay líderes, maravillas, etc... Eso es positivo si te gustan este tipo de juegos.

- Vistoso. El puzzle de ir formando tu territorio es un reto en si mismo. Los componentes son bonitos.

- Hay interacción entre los jugadores (guerras, amenazas, ayudas, alianzas, rutas comerciales).

- Muchos caminos para optar a la victoria.

No tan bueno:

- Un poco lioso y denso. Hay que controlar 8 elementos en un track y es fácil equivocarse. Casi siempre este error favorece al infractor. Curva de aprendizaje elevada para un juego de estas características.

- Un poco azaroso. Si salen losetas que se adaptan poco a tu civilización o si no puedes ganar la subasta correcta, puedes ver como tu civilización crece de un modo anómalo y verte fuera de la partida demasiado pronto.

- A 4 jugadores puede hacerse un poco largo. Creo que mejor con 3.

- No es un juego nada fácil. Poco intuitivo y propenso al AP pq hay que evaluar muchas opciones.

11/8/14: Best compared to Through the Ages.  I'd have to say that it's less fiddly, and emphasizes war more.  It seems very important to get trade routes going with everyone so that you can attack them in the later half of the game.  Warfare can generate so many points that it seems non-optional.

I like having to bid for tiles.  I suspect that we overpaid in the bidding process for tiles.  To me, a lot of the meat of the game is here.  Another fact that I liked is that the game seems more measured at the end, where with TtA, the last age seems to be mostly just a set up for the game end scoring.

This game seems ripe for expansions.

Our initial play with 4 and no experienced players took five hours.  I see it speeding up, but I don't see it clocking in at under 3, which is fine with me, but a problem with others.  Plays well with 3-4, not sure how much I'd like it with 2.

Rated a seven after initial play.  Rating may go up with further play.

at first glance this looked to be some sort of meatier 7 Wonders, but after my one play it seems clear that it is more of a less beefy version of Through The Ages.

The "Patching" is a clever idea (and a little reminiscent of another card based civ game: Innovation) and perhaps a little too abstract for some.  There is some interesting puzzle-lile challenges to playing cards into your patchwork tablue but take step back and it's hard to see a capital-C "Civilization" in front of you.

Still this is worth a look for people who want a Through The Ages sort of game with less book-keeping and quicker play time.

After our latest play I am convinced that the two player game is not working. Sad, because I love the game but I won't play this ever again. No chance to avoid or even win war. I was producing points for my opponent. The game design has so many flaws, it's ridiculous. 

I have never played the game with 3 or 4 players. Maybe this won't be a point with that player counts. Since I am almost exclusivly playing real games with just 2 players, I am done with the game. Sry to say. I wanted to like it. It has so many brilliant mechanism. Especially the patching is wonderful. But it has no balance.

The core mechanics are quite inventive, but the synergies inherent in wonders and heroes are a little too potent for balanced play. The runaway leader issue is indeed brutal. Three players might work better than four, as the Tragedy of the Commons will be less present.

RATING: 7
First Play: Build quality and componants are better than I anticipated. The rule explanation is a real brain burner and I struggled at the start to hang all the elements together. I think its fair to say that the first game must be written off as a learning game.

The random draw of the tiles can cause angst but you need to be willing to overlay something that works for something that's better. It can be annoying when you repeatedly fail to draw the construction tile that you need. Knowing what tiles are coming up and appreciating the combos is a skill that develops in time, however this is not a game with perfect knowledge. The wording on some tiles is a little hard to understand first time out. I significantly misunderstood the benefits of one wonder.

Overall its a deep and strategic game that needs multiple plays to become proficient but I'd happily play again. Lets hope it is reprinted with a fresh look at some of the language with regard to terms and description.

Bought 2014 edition

Second play and an unexpected ending. I was languishing in 'very' last place. I had managed to achieve no useful combos and with two turns left, managed to grab the hero that forces a war immediately and scooped 20 points and then Big Ben. With little else to do but take political cubes, this one card got me 70 points and a 156 point total for victory. If victory can be obtained through the right two cards falling into your lap, I'm afraid this just isn't a game for me.

2013. 2-4p. 

Others say: Very long (2h++ for first game). More fiddly than TtA. Military is extremely important because it can allow you to steal cards from opponents (and they cannot defend).

Shumyum says: Very cool game in theory. A complete mess in practice: runaway leader(especially annoying in such a long game) clunky rules and tile situations, not-quite-there quality and an auction system that doesn't work well at all when there is a worthless tile up for bid.

RATING: 7
Patchistory has all of the resource management that I typically love in this sort of civ game (like Through the Ages and Nations), but with the added layer of the patching.  This really adds a lot of interest, as not only do you have to consider the resources you need, but also whether or not the card you want to add even fits into your civilization reasonably.

It's also great that in any given game, you'll only see a portion of the cards in the game, making each game very different.  If you're the kind of person that wants to head into the game with a strategy, this may annoy you, as you have to respond to the cards that come out.  For me, I like the tactical responses you must make, so it's great.

Now, on the downside, there are other games like Nations that I prefer to this, which do a very similar thing, meaning this will rarely get played despite being pretty good. The main thing I dislike in Patchistory is that you can feel stuck, with no way of digging out. You really can't shift gears quickly in Patchistory, whereas you can more easily to respond to things in a game like Nations.

Overall, a good game that's just unlikely to see much play due to superb competition in the genre.

Patchistory was the new hotness at Essen this year. I picked up a copy, but I did not expect to like it enough to keep it (especially with second-hand copies selling in the triple figures). I generally don't like civ games, and I rarely even like civ-themed games, such as 7 Wonders. Yet something about Patchistory struck a chord with me. The game itself is rather simple. Over the course of 15 turns, players purchase 4x4 landscape tiles at auction and "patch" those tiles in their civilization by overlaying or tucking under current tiles. The tiles produce resources that can be used to produce the standard civ-game accomplishments, such as population, money, culture, and military might. The "patching" mechanism is really interesting and very challenging. We also played the "hard" game, which was deliciously brutal in the early ages (we quite literally couldn't do anything vaguely useful some rounds). Our first game took around 5 hours with 4 players, and we had plenty of rules questions to suss out. I'm sure it will go much faster in the future, though probably never under 3 hours with 4 players, unless we become more comfortable with simultaneous play in a game like this. I can't wait to get it back to the table, and I've already purchased sleeves for all the landscape tiles. With any luck, this will be a game that sees plenty of play around these parts.

RATING: 7.5
This civilization style game is unique due to the patching which makes it very different than basically every other civ games I’ve tried. Also, you cannot just patch in any way you like, but must not exceed 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7 in the three areas - something which constrains you quite a bit and changes the tiles you want to bid on, as maybe you want a tile but don't have room for it.

I like that there are many different paths to victory, and that they depend on the tiles, wonders and heroes which are revealed (you only use about half of the cards in each era – and they are double sided, so the variation is tremendously good!
War is prominent, but not even remotely close to how important and devastating it is in Through the Ages (which is why I don’t like TtA), and sometimes you can make excellent combos, like the one time a player built Taj Mahal and a lot of wonders which netted him 14 points a turn, which can be hard to stop, but that’s a rarity. 

Overall Patchistory seems balanced, and it’s up to the players to stop other players becoming dominant. How to stop is quite simple: you just need to win the auction for the tiles they want. But then, of course, you don’t get the tile you want yourself… This auction is a big feature of the game, but I hate how the rules say that the losing player still pays the entire amount he bid; this should be house-ruled to half the amount or something like that. Another thing I don’t like about the game is the length; it takes 2½ hours with 3, and I really do feel like the game would have benefitted from one less round in each era (although, of course, that would change the balance of the game).

The patching mechanic is ingenious. Unfortunately, the rst of the game isn't.

RATING: 6
This is, in essence, a civ building game with an auction as the main mechanic. The auction is Amun-Re style where everybody wins something but the twist here is that you can never decrease a bid, even if you move it to some junk. The biggest problem with the game is that you are bidding on stuff that gives you more bidding power, so it is very easy to find yourself with a crappy engine and no way to upgrade. When stuck here (as I was my first game, and other new players my second game) the other players who got the good engine pieces effectively get prime choice every auction because they always have the most bidding power. I really think there needs to be a variant where you can choose to not win a tile to receive your money back, or else your really effectively in a no win situation for a 3+ hour game. Other than that problem, the game does have a neat way to grow (patch) your civ even tho the board size constraints doesn't really add much for me and just feels gamey in a bad way. All in all, it's not terrible, but it may be too long for all of its weaknesses.

Would be at least a point lower if I actually played by the dumb rules that stipulate hidden-trackable information. Of course I don't play that way, but I also have to suffer the complaints of those I hoist my house rule upon, which is annoying. Why people enjoy trying to remember things is beyond me.

Rating would be another point lower if I played by the actual bidding rules, which break the game. Simple fix is to allow bidding amount to change when outbid. A better fix, that only works with experienced players, is to use New Amsterdam-style auction.

Anyway, the game. Patching is interesting. It seems a little weird that you have a large array of political options (the action point part of the game), but use them so infrequently. Movement is a bit tacked on. There's not much spacial significance to each players patchwork, except for the difficulty it creates in adding new patches. Player interaction is kept at a minimum -- pretty much just the auction -- up until later in the game when wars start firing.

Loving the game but the patch cards curl.  That is not a small issue, constantly having to straighten the cards.  fantasy flight square sleeves solved the problem, also put a heavy book on them overnight.

The patching is the best part of this game and that leads to some engine building.  The book keeping is the worse part.  The flow of the game tends to be bid/patch/book keep.

Very unique mechanism which is why I will keep it but other games have a better and faster engine building mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The core innovation / mechanic of patching made me joyously happy the entire time I was playing this game. (I'm rather fond of spatial puzzles.) It even felt thematic on some deep level: old parts of one's civilization being changed by the new, or new possibilities which fail to take hold in the face of the established. There seem to be rather more tiles in each era than one is apt to see in a given game, which in concert with their double-sidedness ought to avoid pre-calculation of build sequences, as well as providing a bit of a buffer if a card or two are discovered to be unbalanced (simply omit them).

Other things I really liked: that military dominance could be used to good effect without an all-out war (and in a more predictable fashion than TtA) but with some cost in the political/trade arena; that in most cases you could play simultaneously; the possibility for hero/wonder-centric strategies; and the end-of-era voting - specifically, that it awards points based on number of votes rather than level of dominance (or flat rewards), which is very unlike most civ games I've experienced. (Though thematically, I've no idea what it represents beyond "political clout is useful".)

On the negative: I'm slightly wary of broken combos (though keeping in mind that with experienced players, it might be like Glory to Rome - when all combos are equivalently broken, none of them are overpowered), but not overly concerned unless they're endemic enough to overwhelm simple house rules and tile omissions. I would have dearly loved some purple cubes to help me plan/track my political actions more readily. The occasional need to shift one's civilization on the table becomes more and more fraught as the game goes on (placemats might help, but what if you build off the placemat?) Like most civ games, early VP acquisition seems like a waste of time that could be spent building up to the larger endgame point sources. (Perhaps grant +N% VP at the end of each era?)

But these are all nits; the only real reason I'm not making plans to try and acquire a copy is that I have so few chances to bring games of its length to the table.

Patchistory is a strategy board game with cards that symbolize historical heroes and wonders, with the whole game being divided into three eras. During the game, you acquire these cards through auctions and expand your territory by placing cards so that they overlap one another in a 5×5 space in the first era, a 6×6 space in the second era, and a 7×7 space in the third era. When your land—that is, the layout of your cards—is well built, the card functions are activated. You can earn victory points with diplomatic actions, domestic politics, war movement, the actions of production, etc., and at the end of the game, the person with the highest score after the third era wins.

Prosperity Tiles and length are this games downfall.  If the randomness of the goals wasn't bad enough (you can cause all long term goals in an area to not be scored by pure chance!), the length and the constant upkeep and endless resource exchanges with the general supply will make you never want to play again.

I really thought I was going to like this game.  Nay, I thought I'd love it.  I dig civ games that aren't all about picking up the sword and attacking.  Basically, I like tech trees, which civ games almost always have.  Well, this game doesn't have much of a tech tree.  Some of the heroes and wonders let you break rules, though, which is nice.  But it really does force you down a path of military and fighting, if you get forced to take the otherwise crappy military.  The rules were very unclear about what exactly happens with military attacks, as well, though I'm sure that can be cleared up.  The worst part of the game, for me, though, is that because there are only ever the same number of tiles as players, there isn't a lot of choice in what you get.  Someone will get something crappy, maybe multiple people will.  Further, a good tile can even turn out crappy because of the placement rules (can't partially cover, can't cover water, etc).  I was unable to even bid on a tile with culture until the end of the first era, and by then with only one book I was unable to start routes, get more workers, or do anything interesting.  The same issue came up later when I would have given anything for food, and instead had to waste those precious books converting stone, because no grain tiles came out.  At least with games like Through the Ages and Nations, there are a lot more cards/tiles that come out each turn/round and you can often get what you need.  This game ends up being like Quarriors in that even if you get the thing you need to come out, it might still not help because of a luck element (orientation here).  Disappointed.

First play - quite a bit to take in and thinkier than I thought it would be. It's very much in the same vein as 'Through the Ages' but I think it may turn out to just edge it for me as

The patching is very cool, that's for sure. Coupled with the limitations on how large your play area is allowed to be in different ages it actually sets some constraints on you without being cumbersome.

I have some issues with the game though. First of all it seems like if someone gets ahead in money they can buy whatever card they prefer each round and thus increase their lead. Secondly, military is very powerful unless you manage to build up your military yourself. In our game one player fell behind and losing to a couple of great victories takes you out of the running. Historical? Probably, not sure how fun it is though. Thirdly, the game runs a bit long. I'm sure you can get the playtime down with more plays but as it is it was close to one hour player player.

Interesting twist on card style civilization game.  It is different enough to stand on its own.  We struggled with play time in our 4er teaching game.  It was a *lot* longer than 2 hours.  This is a meaty game.  More fiddly stuff to keep up with than Through the Ages.  But I find myself liking it.  My concerns thus far...Is politics (books) too important?  Starting with just 1 book may not be enough because if you get locked out of more books, there is very little that you can do to get back into it.  I guess eventually one should fall to you, but in our game they were alway high in demand.   Second, military is still very important in this game.  Imagine TtA without defense cards.  That's how a "threaten" works.  You automatically win something..and if you win by enough (5), you take that something from the loser.  It can be pretty harsh as it is even easier to get locked out of military.

But I still want to play again very much.

[b][FirstPlayImpression11thDEC2013][/b] Wow, I have to say I was skeptical about this game at first. The patching sounds funny and doesn't make any sense for a Civ game. Two very unknown designers made a game about Civ for Essen'13 and suddenly it was the talk of the town. Really, that patching mechanic alone made me steer away from digging more info about it.

Now that I've played, it is now my three best crop from Essen'13 (the other two are Russian Railroad and Madeira). 

It's a very simple game to teach for a Civ game (at least my friend who taught us the game made it look like it). All players start with identical setup, meaning no players start with any unique nation that gives you special ability (like typical Civ game). I have my doubts about this, and this reminds me so much of Clash of Cultures, which I haven't played. In CoC, all players also start with identical setup, thus made me have 2nd thoughts on getting this game. In Patchistory, the lack of personal/unique characteristics to your Civ is certainly not the case and because of this, I really want to try CoC now.

Surprisingly, I really like the patching mechanic in this game. I have serious doubts about it initially, but it turned out to be a really cool thing and a really fun thing to do. Every turn, players WILL receive one card for you to patch and depending on which Age it is, you have a certain size/limit on your grid. Because of the restricted grid (a 5x5 in Age I), and the fact that you WILL receive one card for you to fit in your grid, it has that crucial element where you need to carefully patch the card. With all the patching, you'll form a really nice looking playing area that sort of represent your Civ. The way that you nation is developed is really abstract but it really works. This is like Through the Ages, where you don't have a map, and you can't really see how your Civ looks like but you get to see what's going on behind the scenes, where all these are represented by cards. Same thing as Patchistory, except that now the cards are done by patching it to your existing cards.

I like that this is a big Civ game, but the texts are kept to minimal.

I love how there is an actual route track between players, which is represented by a small route board that you placed between you and the other player. You can actually see that you are travelling across the land to other players nation. In the beginning of the game, each players have established a route track with his left neighbour. You can form route track with other players by building one. With this route track, you can also wage a war when you have reached at the end of the route track.

The combat feels like TtA, but a lot simpler IMO. When you have reached at the end of the route track, you and your neighbour put up a fist and simulateneously reveal thumbs down (means war; become attacker if there's war) or thumbs up (ally; become defender if there's war). If both players choose thumbs down means they're both the attacker. If both shows thumbs up, they can choose to form an ally route track. Any other result will wage war. 

At the end of an Age, there's a scoring phase where each players select one of their prosperity card secretly (you are given three during setup; play one in each Age). They are shuffled and revealed. Now all players will make a secret bid with their voting cubes for each prosperity card. Prosperity cards are cards that award VP for players who have the majority in the achievement shown on the prosperity card (e.g. Most military, most politics, most wasteland). The number of VPs that you scored is determined by the number of voting cubes on the card. Player who have the least on the achivement being scored will instead need to give out VPs. This is a really neat thing in Patchistory, I really like it. The voting mechanics is really cool, where the number of voting cubes revealed in total will be the amount of VP that you scored, as well as the amount of VP that the player lose (if you have the least in the achievement being scored).

The components in this edition are a little thin but not really thin. It's hardly noticeable since my friend sleeved all the cards. The coins are really large and that is a good thing.  

It's a little long (pretty standard in Civ game) but at least it's not as long as TtA. In our four player game, we took about 3-3.5 hours to get it done (not including explanation) and I think that's really acceptable. 

The other 2 gamers who were also new to the game like me also expressed how much they like the game. One of the gamer, who normally doesn't play long games (we're talking about 1.5-2 hours) and only plays light to medium ones, said that he likes the game very much.

In our play, I saw that player who lost a war left them in a really bad shape (you lose 7 VP to the other if it's a great Victory - that's having 5 or more strength than you). I thought that this is pretty strong and felt like it's hard to come back up. When our game ended, the opponent who I waged war repeatedly turned out to win the game. This is a good thing and proved that being a war monger is not the only strategy.

This is really a different kind of Civ game, because of the patching and the prosperity card scoring. I like it a lot and hope this will get widely published.

This is a pretty fascinating system and for that reason alone, it should be played.  That being said, I felt that the game got a little long in the tooth and I would have liked to have seen some alternative scoring available.  I didn't feel like choices and strategy made themselves readily available; instead, the game takes a tactical turn especially with the tile auctioning - this might be addressed by a draft variant, but I'm not entirely sure.

Still, the game is pretty unique and you should at least make an effort to play it.  Buying it for your collection?  That's a little less clear-cut.  But for what it's worth, I would play it again.

TRADED IT!

The tile laying "patch" gimmick is the hook to get you to try the game. It is an interesting twist, but functionally it is a hassle to execute on the table.

Beyond that, the game is a perfectly fine civ builder, nothing revolutionary, but nothing terribly awkward either.

RATING: 8
This is a very entertaining civilization building game. I find it similar to Through the Ages, although superior in most ways. Definitely more fun. The patching works wonderfully, adding tension and making it feel like you are building up your little area, plus it looks great. The bidding is pretty rough. Most of the other mechanics are solid. I wish there was a way to ensure each player at least had access to a 2nd political action.

We laminated the tiles with 3-5 mil laminate. It makes a big difference to the functionality of the patching tiles. We were very happy with the results.

RULES TWEEK: We tested playing this game with modified bidding rules, in which you were allowed to bid points in addition to money 1:1. We also allowed people to lower their bids when changing tiles. The game was vastly more enjoyable, the bidding was more representative of the tiles values. Everyone felt the game was more fair and fulfilling. I would say this should be a 9, if you play with the "Better" bidding rules.

The decisions are much lighter than the mechanisms hint at, which makes the game far too long for its category.  The spatial aspect of the tableau is unique, but just doesn't drive me anywhere.

As many people have mentioned, this game has a lot in common with Through the Ages, a game I love.  However, there is a delicate balance in Through the Ages, and I don't think Patchistory found it.  There was a lot of beating up on the losing player, and that is unappetizing.  It can happen in Through the Ages as well, but isn't quite as bad there.

This completely fell flat my first play.  A zillion different rules, and the entire first Era was all about scraping by.  Having half the cards on the "Hero" sides just plain sucked, honestly.  Patching was interesting but ultimately frustrating because of the strict placement rules and proliferation of sea spaces.  Probably my least favorite civ game of the last several years.  I'd even play Clash of Cultures again before this pig.

From all the descriptions I'd read before playing Patchistory for the first time, I was expecting a unique game, turning the civilization genre on its head and doing it entirely differently. That expection certainly played its part in my disappointment.

The patching mechanism is quite neat but ultimately not too different from other games with topological constraints. In undoubtedly works quite well although it allows for relatively little forward planning, and the auctions are quite tense for the most part. The rest of the game is pretty much the standard civ game resource balancing act, however.

Patchistory is a long game, for my taste too long for what it provides, and with some card combinations being much stronger than others, especially towards the end, a lot of the build-up feels kind of inconsequential after the fact. I wouldn't be surprised if people who like Through the Ages or Nations like this as well, though.

RATING: 4
One thing I love is that this game represents a portion of military strength as purely defensive in nature – not in the sense of castle walls but on a larger national scale, considering this is a civilization-scope game. It's important to see the value security brings to the relationships between different countries, and to imagine that security as something defensive in nature and as something that can be signaled to the other actors (through how you deploy your meeples) is novel for this gaming, especially for this type of civ-like game. 

I also like the tension of establishing trade routes. Will your neighbor attack you or trade with you? You won't know until they make it down the track to reach you. 

I don't like it overall because it feels like a stuck together conglomeration of different facets. Part of that was how it was sold to me. I initially took this as focusing on growth in a neat way - how to expand you had to cover a part of your patchwork up and lose that stat or ability in the process. I didn't feel that problem as much. Instead of being constrained by having to decide what parts of my society should change, the vast majority of my tile placement was concerned with making a legal placement around the lake squares. Not in a "sea power is important" kind of way, but in a "this game is trying to do tetris and not doing a good job of it" kind of way. There were multiple rounds where I was unable to place a tile. This is a civ game, not a game of waterfront development!

Other elements are similarly harsh and not very fun. Trade wasn't that interested (despite what I said above), and in spite of what I said about military strength above conflicts between players isn't either. I can't remember what happened in our end game because the narrative completely broke down.

I like the patching part of the game.  The rules just don't 'flow'.  Too many phases, exceptions, currencies, etc.  Probably partly for that reason, it goes longer than it should.  Considerable amount of hidden, trackable information.  I like it better than Through the Ages, though.

Preliminary rating, but I found this to be inelegant, and fairly abstract for a civ game. Uses a variety of mechanics during the turn to score points.  There's an auction for tiles, a tile placement, an action point system, as well as several other mechanics. Graphic design is inconsistent and potentially confusing, and the gameplay has ap issues.  I found the tile laying and tile auction to be dry and not terribly balanced, as some tiles just won't work for a given player, making the auction into more of a penalty turn.  There are aspects that can be managed, but I didn't find much to pull me in or interest me, as ultimately, the VP mechanism is pretty bland.  I would say this is about as much of a civ game as KeyFlower, but doesn't flow nearly as well, or have nearly the same level of balance.

Opinion: another civilization game with good taste. Nothing new under the sun concerning this, but how you build your civilization is what is great, the patch thing. You have auction, building and manage resources, being the building part the best thing of the game (new at least), as you have to patch the land over or under your land, planning on the long run or you could be bidding in a card you cannot patch. The war is a good cold war, do not fall behind. Overall, is a great game I would like to play more

Pretty original Civ game which I found a tad long (first game lasted four hours and a half - rules explanations included). 

I liked it, yet I'm in no rush to play it again, or maybe once again and all my hunger for this game will be sated. 

Oddly I think that the box has magnificent art, which is not completely matched with the overall art of the game out-of-the-box. 

UPDATE
Ok, I had a second run of this game in order to confirm my first impressions. There are, in my opinion, at least two substantial flaws in this game: 
1) political points, if you remain at one point you're not screwed per se, but the game really lags along being your options pretty restricted; 
2) war is extremely important and overly powerful, you cannot ignore your military, and if you can bring war on your foes for a significant amount of times the game will be yours. 

There are good ideas to this game. The whole "patching" mechanic is very original and makes for interesting choices (if not a little random), and I totally dig the "caravan" like merchant route. 

Yet these features cannot really mitigate the very long playing time, the randomness of some events that happen due to the other players' choices (for instance voting draws usually result in no point for anyone), and the fact that, after all has been said and done, I really don't find this game all that fun given there are better titles out there for the same subject.

Quite a good long civ game. Lots to explore and lots of card variability.  I am not that keen on war in civ games.  Although this game has that potential, the cost of war and the things you give up to wage war keeps it from being an overwhelming part of it.

Update:  War is key to the game and is the heart of many of the interesting decisions - not for pacifists.

The patching is interesting in the way it forces you to choose what to cover up and lose. It does feel like you're building an increasingly functioning empire.

Patchistory might as well be the illegitimate love child of Through the Ages and Innovation. Now, you're probably thinking "aren't they like oil and water?" and you would be right: TtA is highly procedural and strategic where Innovation is largely impulsive and tactical. That's where our little friend Patchwork comes in as a helping hand (or third wheel if you prefer) helping each meet somewhere in the middle (under a techni-colour quilt).

More seriously, Patchistory is an incredibly innovative take on the civ genre by abstracting much of the civ-building (e.g., monuments, technologies, production, etc.) as patching new tiles onto your existing empire. Every tile added modulates what you can do as well as your relative position to opponents (like with TtA and Innovation, relative position means everything like with dogmas and aggressions) across a few different currencies (e.g., culture, economy, politics, military, agriculture, etc.). The patching not only produces a narrative of how your empire grows, shifts, and changes, but also provides difficult and complex tactical choices. In short, sometimes you must make sacrifices to move forward (i.e., cover up perfectly good parts of your empire to put in place something better). These deicisions are never easy, but they occur frequently enough as the game provides restrictions as to how big your empire can be (as well as sea tiles which make it increasingly difficult to work within the space). 

Like with both Chvaatil's TtA and Chudyk's Innovation, there are multiple combos, and there are combos that are simply broken, and part of the game is trying to either prevent them from happening or acquiring one that is equally broken and keep leveraging it (e.g., Napoleon+Stealth Aircraft+Bismark+a fair deal of transport means a succesful war destroys the opponent's empire, steals money/culture, and earns an additional 5 points for good measure).

The auction (or blind bid with 2) provides a great opportunity to leverage economic power to choose what you want (what you don't want others to get) while providing a dangerous path for those who are simply bidding up the prices (you don't get to bid back down!). This system doesn't discourage wild bidding but rather makes wild bids memorable and timely: bids are at once more cautious and more pronounced when they need to be (tile valuation can shift radically depending on the situation).

Lastly, descendants (which I have a hard time not calling workers) provide a means of modulating civilization on the fly -- as many tiles have an additional bonus for having a worker present and there are opportunities to move your descendants around (how much depends on your transportation value) to respond and be flexible (e.g., war coming up? move to your military/defense; planning on sending your dude to the Silk Road next turn? move a few workers to the discount/additional trade product spaces). Not only are your absolute values important, but also how flexible your empire is in responding to threats, boasts, and snarls sent your way.

I don't feel like there's anything *new* here, but everything 'patches' together so well that it feels fresh.

Patchistory is an interesting Civ game with lots of very clever facets to explore.

Players create a new civilization using 4x4 patches which must overlay part of another patch, following several simple but gradually more restrictive rules.

Fully visible patches function, overlaid patches are 'steamrollered' to make way for new culture- and culture points earned during the game, from war, art, or other mechanisms are the sole victory condition.

Every one of 15 rounds players lay a new patch, staying within a certain size restriction, retaining orientation, and making difficult decisions about how the visible buildings will support their culture.

While there are some slightly clunky bits in turn order, it's an ingenious and almost endlessly variable format for civ building.

Holding off an initial rating, but I can see this taking a very high rating- based on 1 3-player game so far.

The game of BGG.con 2013 for me! I love civ games as a rule, and this one really brings something new to the table. It's mapless, but the trade routes foster strategic interconnection in a way that mirrors what a map would give you. The tile-patching mechanic is novel and puzzlish; you can shape your civ to your wants/needs, but you've got to be clever about how to do it. Some folks grouse about that puzzle nature, but in the end it offers something similar to the situational restrictions of a map-based game, just in a conceptual framework rather than a simulationist one.

And at the game's conclusion, you've got a fantastic, beautiful overview of your civ's history laid out. I love looking at the map in Clash of Cultures at game's end, seeing the sweep of minis across the continent, but Patchistory's tile mosaic is just as evocative; it looks like the title credits of a Ken Burns documentary or somethin'.

It's fun, it's thinky, it's gorgeous; it's my favorite game of the con, and maybe of 2013 altogether. I can't wait for a general release in 2014! (Here's to hoping for better translations, though!)

Too AP and too long for what it is. Early eras feel to have too little meaning aside setting up for the big finale. I generally like tight games, but this feels somehow too tight and therefore not very satisfactory. Would probably get better if one played this more, but no burning desire to play this more.

Early lack of political points will kill you and similarly decent lead in money lets you pick the best tile out of 3.

At first it seemed a usual Civilization game with some fun aspects - Patching. It is something similar to Fun Factory or Galaxy Trucker. After one game it seems that the only thing here is patching. Usually in Civilization games there should be a moment, when you balance your resources to your opportunities and are able to grow pragmatically. Here the "book" factor was so annoying that the game-play changed from civilization to worker placement at one moment. Or maybe that is the main point of the game - tactical civilization game where you plan your actions in one round and do them during the next.

I hope to change upwards my mark after another play or two.

Based on my first play, Patchistory reminds me mostly of Through the Ages. Throughout the three era, a person who makes the best civilization is going to be the winner. During the game, players use several action choices to make better future, such as diplomacy, politics, production and war etc. The most attractive point of Patchistory is patching its civilization cards. Civilization cards represent not only geological  features, but also heroes and heroines. The civilization cards are auctioned off. The auctioning and patching phase is the most important part of the game. In Patchistory, the military factor is more essential than other civilization games. Because of the powerful effect of threatening and war, it is quite hard for underdogs to keep up with topdogs. As far as I know, the author of Patchistory pursued the goal of making a civilization game with plentiful tactical choices like Through the Ages, and rules brevity like 7 Wonders. In my opinion, the author achieved success in strategic factor, but didn't realize rule simplicity like 7 Wonders. Patchistory is far more difficult than 7 Wonders. The game is more likely Through the Ages style civilization games. For this reason, the playing time of Patchistory, unlike 7 Wonders, takes about 2 to 3 hours at least. Besides these shortcomings, I am certain that Patchistory is a nice civilization game. The game provides its own enjoyment on making civilization by patching civilization cards. After the end of the game, don't miss the chance of appreciation on the accoplished civilizations made by each players.

This is one of those games that is so ludicrously fiddly that I highly doubt that many people will ever play a full game correctly, that is, without getting some clunky rule wrong or one or more players making an error in the constant bookkeeping that each of them must do. Seriously, if I could put a secret camera above every game of this played from now til forever and track the stats, I think that more than 75 percent would have significant, game-altering errors.

Some graphic design and production choices in this game also drove me nuts. For example, the purple resource (politics) is the most important resource in the game, as it sort of governs how many actions you can take; its icon is a book. The wooden disc that you use to track how much “politics” you have is colored purple, and a purple dot is used on the player aid to signify politics. Most places where the book icon appears, it’s on a purple background -- but not always! Maddening. Why oh why is there not a purple circle behind all the book icons? Similarly, “transportation” is represented by both the color orange (you track it with an orange disc) and a wheel icon. But some cards have both an orange quadrant and the word “Transportation” printed in that quadrant, but yet do not have the wheel icon and thus do not provide you with transportation. Perhaps I would have liked this game better if it had been printed in black and white.

There is sort of a phase/turn tracker tile in the center of the table. This tile is all text, with phase names including "Diplomacy & Management," "Negotiation & War," "Production & Worker Maintenance," and "Heroes & Wonders Maintenance." Holy ampersand management maintenance, Batman! There is a gear icon on cards that is tied to one of these phases, but it doesn't appear on the phase tracker tile. Wow.

One of the resources (the black one) is called "resources." Just wow. 

The auction mechanism is good. But for that, play Peloponnes. 

I found the actual heart of the game -- fitting cards into the “patch” network you’re building throughout the game -- interesting and kinda frustrating but in a good way. The sort of thing that would have me coming back for more if the game as a whole wasn't so bloated and underdeveloped.

Muy buen juego de civilizaciones. Para mi por detrás del TTA y Nations, pero por delante de Clash of cultures, Historia o el Civilization de Sid Meiers.

El principio del turno con la subasta tiene mucha miga ya que, si algo se le puede achacar al juego, es que pueden aparecer combos muy burros e incontestables, por lo que hay que procurar llevarte lo que necesites o por lo menos no permitir que alguien vaya cogiendo todo el rato lo que necesita Después de la subasta, la mecánica principal del juego, la colocación de las losetas, me parece muy bien hecha (lástima que las losetas sean un poco maletas en cuanto a calidad)

En cuanto a las acciones a realizar durante el turno pienso que están bien en cuanto al coste que conllevan, dando esa sensación de no poder hacer todo que tanto gusta, pero que permite ver un desarrollo en tu civilización, ya que poco a poco vas pudiendo hacer más. El tema de las agresiones y "la negociación" pienso que están bien resueltos, genera la tensión justo cuando recibes un ataque, ya que al atacante le compensa, pero al que pierde no lo estás sacando de la partida.

Otro de los grandes aciertos del juego, sin duda, es la votación de final era. Mola un montón. Eliges qué categoría de las tres que tienes se va a puntuar esta era. Se muestran todas (una por jugador) y a pensar como meter los votos. Tremendo ese momento en el que con tus votos quedan empatadas a menos votos las dos cartas que peor te vienen y no se puntúan :-P

another civ game that does a lot of things well but his some problems:

1) while struggling to get more resources/food/money isn't so much of a problem since you can get one of the others and use the exchange action (assuming you have enough transport and enough politics to spare on trading every turn!), but if you are struggling for military/politics/culture and no patches of those type come out or the competition to get them is intense then some players can easily fall far behind and find it a nightmare to catch up.

2) since only x patches come out each round where x is the number of players, it can be incredibly random/frustrating trying to get the patch you want to push your civ in a coherent direction. It would be better if it was done like other games with more patches available, and getting cheaper the longer they remain unbought each round.

3) figuring out your current production status can become incredibly fiddly and easy to make mistakes when you start to get wonders/heroes that have conditional production (eg 1food per 2 wasteland tiles).

In summary: The patching bit is fun but the rest is too fiddly. If you fall behind on military/culture you're stuffed unless you get lucky with the patches/construction tiles

OK, where to begin... I am so fucking tired of soulless spreadsheet games like this, where I get to spend hour after hour after hour adjusting my little income tracks, all the while being pummeled turn after turn by an opponent who has managed to get a slightly higher military rating than me.

I am completely baffled what anyone sees in a game like this - it's "fiddly" and "repetitive" explicitly made into game mechanics, with a ton of "beat up on the player who's behind" thrown in for good measure. Yikes.

If the whole exercise took 30 minutes I would look more mildly on it, but we played for 4+ hours.

The whole "patching" mechanism is marginally clever, without really representing anything thematic.

On the whole, slightly less painful than Through the Ages, but slightly worse than Nations.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2015)

I bought Patchistory on a sale and only because a friend said it was a novel game. He was right, Patchistory is an unique civilization game and I truly enjoy it.

I always read rules on the iPad so I downloaded a version of the rules here on the geek. It was a huge mistake as those rules seem to be translated with Google Translator, they were awful (perhaps the worst ever). Understanding the game from them was almost impossible and I had many doubts. Then I read the rules that came with the game and they are much better, but still they lack some clarity in parts (later, I also found them online) so I can safely say the rulebook is not the best I have read. The rules aren’t that complex, but there are many rules and phases so the game has a medium weight. The playtime can surpass easily the 3 hour mark.

The art is great and the game components are also really good. They overproduced the first player token. The tracks depicting your empire information is very crowded and reading information from them isn’t very quick or clear. The tokens can topple rather easily, however this is a minor complaint. 

The gameplay is truly unique. You have to patch cards together so every time you do something you will get new developments but (maybe) also lost others. This decision is not trivial and I love it. This mechanism is very novel and it replaces the tech tree that most civilization games have. With 8 element to track and develop you have to carefully consider your options. To get new cards, you have to bid for them each turn but the bid isn’t a straight auction, every time you get outbid you can put more money in or bid the same amount for other tile. You lose all the money you bid, I love it.  
 
Perhaps it is too unforgiving of early mistakes, in our games some players couldn’t recover from bad decisions in the first era. I’m not saying this is a negative (in fact I like this), this makes the game much more harder and tense for me. It is also very tense because you have to feed your workforce every turn and the end of an era you have to pay to maintain heroes and wonders. The penalty for not paying is rather steep, I also love this.

Military is very well done, at first I thought it would be a dominant strategy but the players who pursued it didn’t do much better than the pacifists, that’s great for me because it means the game is balanced and no strategy seems to dominate. The cost of going for a military strategy is very high and it prevents you from developing other areas of your empire.

Another aspect I enjoy is the hidden information, I always enjoy memory challenges.

I’m not really sure if it is best with 3 or with 4 players. With 4 the playtime/downtime can be too much, but perhaps it is more balanced with 4 players. Time will tell, for now I prefer to play it with 3 players to keep the downtime low.

Bookkeeping is very high, but this doesn’t bothers me (although it bothered some friends).

Bottom line, Patchistory is one of the best civilization games I have played, perhaps only surpassed by Through the Ages. I love it and it has a permanent spot in my game collection. I will buy the promo tiles right now. It has a good chance to get an improved rating with more plays. Good stuff.

Edit June 2016 - After four plays I'm finding the auction is severely hindering my enjoyment of the game.

Patchistory has the greatest upside potential of any game I played at BGG.CON 2013.

It is as fresh a take on the civilization genre as Through the Ages was at the time of its release.  The patching mechanic, though it may be a bit athematic, unquestionably works.  The auctions sometimes allocate a set of "good" tiles to the players, sometimes represent choices of the least bad options, but are always tense.

My play group had concerns about potentially unbalanced combinations of tiles, particularly involving stacking worship discounts.  At this point I am willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume I will gain the ability to mitigate these as I gain expertise at the game.

The patching mechanic at the heart of this game is original, fun and excellent. I think the auction mechanics as published make a strong economy a little too powerful. Some suggestions make sense to me to incorporate, such as allowing the bidding of culture points instead of money in a 1/1 ratio, as well as allowing the reduction of a bid if going from one auction lot to another. Without these changes, the player with the most money will go unchallenged (because those with less money would take on all of the expense and all of the risk of challenging) and so not only be able to keep of their money, but also get things cheaply. That's too much of an advantage! 

I want to play with these changes. Without them, I fear that a player who focuses almost entirely on their economy will be able to buy whatever they need regardless of how they develop in other ways. The auction rules as published is what keeps me from scoring this otherwise excellent game any higher.

Preliminary rating. The tracks remind Through the Ages, but the intensive auctions and the way of building your empire, putting your tiles up or down the previous ones, make this game unique. The interaction system (trade and diplomacy) is also interesting.

Much better in practice than I thought. This is mostly due to the auction and patching mechanism which is quite delightful. Not a huge of the game beyond that but it's fine.

One play left me flatter than a pancake. This games puts the Charlie Daniels in fiddly games.  In fact, I think this game is more fiddly than if through the ages impregnated mage knight with a Sasquatch...yikes. I think the suffering equals genius crowd will love this puzzle as if they birthed it themselves. Three hours of peelings ones skin in order to keep awake.

I think there is an awesome game here and I think it would be fun on an ipad and probably 1/10th of the time to play it.  As for human play this game needs a major elegance in mechanics upgrade for me to want to play it again.  First game with three people took five rounds till someone had enough political points to do anything.  How boring.  I also found the bidding mechanic very dissatisfying similar to cleaning dog poo off my lawn: necessary, functional in order to let people frolic without lovely surprises, but ultimately a smelly romp of unpleasantness.

You might wonder how do I really feel about this game? Duped by the hype.  New formula for a game release...release 100 copies at Essen and watch the I want it because it is rare crew dance around the pyre ready to rip their lungs out to get a copy.  Damn I got burned but luckily I am still breathing. Yes I am one of those devolutioned dorks that loves rare games....damn it Jim I am doctor not a soothsayer.

The auction is probably the best part of this game. It's so agonizing! You have you carefully consider your options, and others' preferences. The ability to ally with other players is great, the whole trade route mechanic is brilliant. Players can be incentivized to play nice. Of course military might still bring in lots of points. My only real complaint is the length of the game, I'm not sure it brings enough to the table to warrant it.

Refraining from rating this one yet. Only played once with three players, and it took close to 3 hours with teaching. I'm not sure how much of that total play time is the result of having players unfamiliar with the game, and how much is just the time that Patchistory takes to play. My hope is that when it hits the table again, having everyone familiar with the game will cut down on the time considerably.

Because there's a lot to like here... It's a nice build up from your simple civilization to your end-of-game empire. There are a variety of options to score you points - do you pursue military dominance, or focus on the production of culture, or enlist the special functions of historical personalities and world wonders, or optimize your civic actions and plan for a wealth of votes at the end of the era. Each offers its own strengths and weaknesses and presents different strategies to mix and maximize. 

Some great things going on in this game; I just hope it takes a little less time to explore them next time.

Competes with Through the Ages and Nations for table time. My choice is clear: Nations. It's the only one that poses a real alternative to military. Patchistory is on par with TTA for me. 

Staying in touch with the military leader is the name of the game to avoid being threatened repeatedly. It's not as bad as TTA but still a prerogative to do so. The patching aspect is a nice element, the auction is tricky. Trade routes weren't used much but that might have been our group. The structure of the game is clear and well-developed for an effort from a small publisher, only the handling tends to be fiddly. An ok game but I'm not sure if there's a place in my collection in the long-term with Nations not getting played enough.

A game of three parts: A fairly generic auction, a unique and interesting spatial optimization puzzle, and a very harsh civ-builder engine. The gameplay is interesting because of the way the other two aspects feed into the auction.

You need to balance the needs of the civilization, the constraints of your own board layout and the available tiles, the possible interactions with other players ("can I let that player who already has a higher military also have another action point?"), and the board constraints of those other players. Normally I don't care for the "figure out the proper auction valuations of every item and player" mechanism. But it works here since the board state is so easy to read even from far away, and since the problem being solved is somewhat novel and thus interesting.

There's some possibility this game has brutal runaway leader issues, but figuring out that for sure would require more plays.

Much better production values than I was expecting for a 50 game limited run.

A civ game with a tile patching mechanic (i.e. interweaving tiles together). Despite the original mechanic, this game is a bit dull. At the start of the game, you only have 1 Action Point, and most actions cost 2 or 3. So its a slow paced game with nothing to do.

Some ideas were good, like battles with no downside (encouraging wars), but some mechanics were out of place, like movement and trade routes.

Overall not too impressed. I'd rather play other civ games over this one.

Offers a bit similar playing experience to Nations with some clear similarities and some very different building blocks. Here you're also building your own board out of partially public tiles and you have a similar flow of time with similar tight resource management and also similar kinds of resources. Even the game length and weight are same-ish. But Patchistory has it's own interesting patching mechanism and it's more about building a vp engine than Nations. There's also a bit more of direct conflict here, but the game doesn't strongly encourage warring and it's also very much possible to run a successful pacifist strategy. That option differs civ from war. I think the sweet spot for the game is with three players. With four you add an hour to the play time and three is also tighter since all the civilizations are more closely connected to each other. Somehow it also feels like you could have made multiple games out of this as it can feel like the whole game is just a pile of mechanisms. The combination of mechanisms however works well as a single game due to the way the mechanisms smartly feed on each other.

It's a nice twist on a civ game that's similar enough to other civs (resource production and use, etc.) but very different with the use of the Patch cards.  P likes it and she hates civs!

The patching is brilliant, unfortunately the rest of the game just doesn't live up to it. Additionally 120 minutes is not realistic. 60 minutes is just ridiculous.  60 minutes would leave 4 minutes per turn.

Still getting to know this game, but after every game I think about things I could have done differently. While at times you can feel like there is a run-away leader and you can get shafted for bidding, I think largely those are the results of poor decisions. Yes there are some ambiguities with rules for some of the tiles, but the game is a gem and worth working through.

Patchistory is a strategy board game with cards that symbolize historical heroes and wonders, with the whole game being divided into three eras. During the game, you acquire these cards through auctions and expand your territory by placing cards so that they overlap one another in a 5×5 space in the first era, a 6×6 space in the second era, and a 7×7 space in the third era. When your land—that is, the layout of your cards—is well built, the card functions are activated. You can earn victory points with diplomatic actions, domestic politics, war movement, the actions of production, etc., and at the end of the game, the person with the highest score after the third era wins.

This might become a 10 if all the questions regarding the rules get ironed out in the lost in translation Korean to English rule set!  The patching aspect of the cards really is fascinating and causes quite a bit of havoc/brain-burning/frustration bound with the limitations of each era (5x5, 6x6, 7x7).  One has to think about the future when patching cards in the present and water rooms also cause havoc.  Thankfully, there are options that allow you to fill in the water with wasteland if you take the reclamation action.  Whatever you do, make sure you do not short yourself on political force.  Without much political force, you are dooming yourself to a painful game - one can manipulate the rest of the game fairly well as long as one has enough political force.  There definitely appears to be various paths to victory, certainly to gaining points.  The temptation will be to focus on your own engine, but you need to get over that temptation and bid to deny opponents their desired tiles as well - pay attention to what everyone else is doing.  

There still is some ambiguity in the rules which are a little frustrating but will be ironed out over time hopefully.  As well, the game is extremely fiddly - be prepared to be constantly counting and re-adjusting your resource stats constantly.  My first four person learning game took us just slightly over 4 hours (included 30-45 minutes of rule explanations).  I'd recommend waiting for the English version - hopefully they do publish another large printing in English - there is a lot of pasting up that I had to do for my Korean copy!  I'm also not convinced I like the auction format for the first auction of the game, but I'm uncertain how to get around the first player advantage otherwise since everyone starts with the same amount of money.

Another entry in a line of recent civilization-lite sort of games.  The most interesting wrinkle in this one is the mechanic of patching in various tiles to your network.  The tiles incorporate standard resource development buildings, heroes and monuments.  The auctions of the pieces to patch in is conducted in an interesting way as well.  Not on the level of a Nations or Through the Ages for me but a nice diverting civ game nonetheless.

A civilization game that is lighter than through the ages and is much easier to play but has some depth.  You draft patches, place on your board and then take actions.  You can move pawns and resolve any conflicts.  You then gather resources and pay maintenance.  At the end of three eras the game is done.  The game is always different because you patches are two sided so you don't know if certain abilities will come out or not.  

I like the fact this is simpler than through the ages and less fiddly but I don't know if it has the same depth.  The auction of the patches can be brutal if you are outbid for a patch you really wanted.

Strong game but I would say just short of excellent.

I don't think the 2 player version of this is very strong.

If your deepest dream is to spend four hours playing a tableau-building civilisation game, this is the perfect game for you. The "patching" mechanism is really cool.

This is a great game. But this is not a short game. The rules are not too complex, but the rulebook is daunting, because it was poorly translated from Korean.

The box says "2-4 players" but it really needs 3 or 4 players. The 2-player variant is an awkward patch on the rules.

I was all over it last Essen, but got screwed when the guy at the stand told me I could pick up the example copy on the Sunday, then reneged when I showed up.  Finally played it in June '14.  A bit undecided.  The patching is a pretty cool gimmick.  It makes no sense, but the whole game is so abstract I shouldn't worry about it.  The individual mechanisms decent enough but in the end the game goes on quite a bit too long.  Two hour max would seem about right for as light a game as this is, but it instead pushes past three hours.  You can really screw yourself the first game, as I did, but I think I would not be so stupid the second time round.  Anyway, I am debating whether I should have a copy or not, as it has some unique feels to it.

One aborted play at the end of the second (of three) eras. What a slog. The first era I barely kept my head above water. The second era was better but still felt like work. I'd try it one more time perhaps, but overall just not worth the work or time involved. Patching is cool, but it seems all too easy to hem yourself in with sea spaces and find half the tiles up for auction unplace-able.

Played a second time, felt slightly less screwed, finished the game and had a much better experience. But it's still too long for what it is, I don't care for the trading aspect at all, and if any of my opponents went military I'd probably rage and never play again.

This really does a lot of thing right, and manages to feel fresh and unique. The auctions fit in well and lend weight and reason to the economic growth of your civ. I like that they can be unforgiving, though some dislike this.

The central patching mechanism is really neat, and there are amusing moments when I bid on a tile that I really want, then realize that I can't fit it onto my board within the space limitations.

Conflict is handled pretty well too (usually a weak point of civ games). Combat values are open knowledge and can be boosted by a hidden resource (collected publicly throughout the game). 

It does everything it does in about 2 hours, and does it very well. This is the best civ game I've played to date.

My self and two other reasonably experienced gamers tried to learn Patchistory from the rules at Cancon, we were making little headway and getting ready to give it all up as a bad job when one of the kind boardgames library librarians offered to teach; after another half an hour’s explanation we were set up and ready to go. The game itself has some intriguing ideas and gameplay where in each phase players add to their ‘patchwork’ through an auction mechanism. The trick seems to be getting a good fit where you don’t cover over too much of what you want.

Our game proceeded okay until it became apparent that one of the other players was racing away with the lead with a heap of monuments as my trade route wasn’t facing him there wasn’t too much that could be done to stop him other than build a trade route, send a caravan, choose war, prepare for war and finally attack, all of which would take most of the rest of the game. We gave up after two eras and didn’t bother playing the third.

Overall, it was an okay gaming experience, a bit convoluted and not that much fun (and I like civ building games). I am sure experienced players get a lot out of enjoyment this game, I am equally sure that I am not inclined to put in the effort to acquire this experience. Would not purchase and would only play again under duress.

This game came as a huge surprise. I'd played TTA and not enjoyed it and when I found out that Patchistory was another civ game that used similar ideas I didn't have high hopes. 

I love this game. It streamlines many of the needlessly complex civ ideas found in other games creating a quicker (a 4 player game will take 2+ hours) and simpler (yet just as rich) playing experience. The patching mechanic is brilliant and really does give you the feel of expanding your empire. There are plenty of tactical and strategical decisions to be made. Looks great, plays best with 3-4.

The patching mechanic is very clever, very fun, and results in a lot of interesting decisions throughout the game. Seeing my civilization change over time and comparing it to my wife's was really fun! However, the 2P game just has a number of wonky rules which really hurt the game.

The blind-bid auction isn't very fun. The fact that in 2P, players have access to both sides of the tiles being auctioned makes the auction even less interesting. Voting at the end of the era on prosperity cards also isn't satisfying. For each of these, we actually tried variants in the middle of the game in the hopes that it would improve things. It did, but not enough. Except for the patching mechanic -- which is truly wonderful -- I felt like I was playing a less-baked version of Through the Ages. And by the end, I wished we'd just played Through the Ages instead. Too bad.

RATING: 6.2
This is a different type of "civilisation" game embedding abstract tile placement with engine building mechanics. Being "different" it should appeal to me a lot as I like to play games that stand out in some way or another.
Unfortunately, there are some issues which concern me.
My main concern is the auction mechanic. If you are overbid on a tile and do not have the cash to outbid then you must move ALL of your bid to another tile. This means that you could, and nearly always do, end up with a poor or unplaceable tile for a huge amount of cash - not only failing to get a good tile but also draining your cash supply. This is just far too brutal and is likely to mean that you cannot perform useful actions during the round.
I am also concerned about the tiles, some of which are very effective and essential to get your engine building started in Era 1 (politics, coins, food) but most of which are indifferent. So if you fail to get a good start, chances are that you will not have the cash to outbid players that have, snowballing the auction issue.
I think the auction issue can be overcome with a house rule that you can reduce your bid if you are outbid, but whether this will sufficiently reduce the tile choice issue is something that will require a further play.
There are also production quality issues with the tiles (very thin card stock).
The underlying mechanics and theme are sound, but the game would benefit from balancing tile powers, resolving the auction issues, revising the rules and streamlining the fiddly game round structure (maybe removing some of the resource types?), to speed the game play up.

Needlessly complex and fiddly. Tries to cram too much into one game, where the obvious draw is the "quilt" you create to help define your civilization. The first era drags on so slowly that I wish you could almost do a modified setup to make up for it. This would have been a wonderful game if they had slimmed-down the rules and focused more on the patching portion. As it is, this game can barely stay afloat with all the mechanisms weighing it down. I'd love to see the patching idea utilized elsewhere though.

Patching history is fun. Buthave a lot of unusefull things. I would totaly cut out the diplomacy phase and the voting phase.

Closer to TTA than Nations. It's another civilization building game, using the same "prodction track" system, this time with spatial placement invovled for the tech tree, and voting as the "event" card for additional scoring. There are some new interesting concepts here, and I think in some part this game is not as harsh as TTA, while being less random than Nations. I like this game a lot, although I am not sure if I need to own all these similar games.

After first play, I have to say that I expected more. The basic idea of patching your civilization is perfect, but unfortunately it comes with a lot of extra baggage that the game did not need. I wish they had just taken the patching idea, ran with it, and ignored most of the other clutter. Like for example they could have gotten rid of the trade route boards and somehow implemented the same thing in the patched civilization.

I also think that the game needs some balancing. Seems like some strategies are incredibly weak compared to others.

Heavier civ game with a lot of bookkeeping and an explanation process that doesn't work for people on the newbie side of intermediate. The auction and patching didn't play out with as much delightfulness as implied by the buzz (i.e., Rahdo). So the game ended up being a bit of a brainy slog. Granted this was a 4er learning game that was a bit too complex for one player, but it's one of those games for which reading through the rules twice is not sufficient. We plan to try it again, however!

Civilization engine with very tough economy, based on a unique spatial puzzle. Lots of different approaches to point generation depending on which cards you happen to get. Also has lots of variability based on which cards enter the game.

The playing time is quite long, so I'll probably avoid playing this with four players. Does not feel long during the game though, at least not with reasonably speedy players.

The Stuntkite rulebook improves over the original but still has quite a bunch of ambiguities and inconsistent terminology.

Il gioco mi ha conquistato e coinvolto. Tra i tanti e nuovi giochi di civilizzazione trovo sia quello che più si avvicina al capolavoro Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, o meglio quello che più mi restituisce la sensazione di crescere una civiltà.

Unsure of how I feel about this game. It's simple yet there is a lot of rough edges around the rules. The quilting aspect of it felt interesting, but the bidding and cultural feel felt a bit lackluster. Military felt really strong and being able to keep ahead of it made bashing on the weak incredibly worth it. I'd like to play it again, but I feel like the rating may drop to a 5 or even a 4. Really neat concepts, but looks like it may be overhyped.

An extremely well done civilization game. Auctioning is the core mechanism, in Pelloponese-style, there is a sense of a map, as you can see your empire growing and there are trade routes to other civilizations. It seems that there are indeed multiple ways to victory, albeit military cannot be completely idles l ignored. The engine building is well done. Very long game, especially with four players, but recommended!

A different take on the 4X civ building style of game. Kind of a mix between a card game and a tile laying style board game. Certainly has some interesting ideas in it. The main tile cards are quite thin, though, which is a bit annoying. At the end of the day, there are heaps of good 4X civ building games, and while this is different I'm not sure it's one of the best ones.

The second edition rulebook is still super rough, so I highly recommend getting the re-written one here on board game geek. The game was a very satisfying civilization game where you place cards on your board to produce resources such as money to bid on more tiles with, food to feed your people with and points to, you know, have points. At the end of each of the three 'ages' you also bid votes on various scoring criteria players have in their hands. The game has some player interaction in the form of trade routes, diplomacy actions and simple and easy war rules.

An interesting mess of a game. Definitely one that's only worth a few plays before the novelty of the 'patching' wears off since in all other respects it's just a clunky version of Through the Ages. As with most abstracted civ games, military can cause massive point swings that nobody can do anything about. Serious balance issues with some of the cards.

1. It didn't offer anything of value to me that TTA doesn't offer better
2. It was too long for its depth
3. The bidding for patch cards was annoying and seemed imbalanced to me. It allowed too much luck based on when patches came out based on turn order and money in reserve. 
4. The hidden goals weren't fun
5. The tie breaker was stupid
6. It lent itself toward AP really really badly without enough fun/depth to compensate. 
7. It wasn't very good for two players (not a deal breaker but annoying)
8. The way war worked wasn't particularly interesting. 
9. It had runaway leader issues which can be fine but it felt like the person could become leader based on lucky timing of when the cards came out and then keep leadership fairly easily. 

The patching was pretty cool and some of the concepts were good but not enough for me to stick with it.

After 2 plays I have to admit that Patchistory is a very unique game and the central mechanism "patching" is innovative and works really well. However, this game is just no fun to me. I am not a big fan of civ building games anyway.

Actually, most mechanisms are frustrating. The patching is very often frustrating that you cannot fit in the tiles well and leads to you puzzling for quite some time to find a solution for a tile. When managing your civilization (your actions) you often cannot to things you like to do. I also do not like the auction rules: If someone outbids you on one tile, you cannot decrease your bid when switching to a inferior tile, which you just overpay. Yeah, that's frustrating too (the only worse auction mechanism is blind bidding, winner takes it all, but everybody pays their bid). If players' with higher military strength pound on you, it is no fun either. Additionally, this game is just too long with 3 to 4 hours.

In total, I acknowledge that Patchistory is innovative and very well-designed (apart from the auction and the total game length; also honoring heroes or wonders seems way underpowered and was never used in my two games), but I really just do not enjoy any single mechanism. This in combination with the much too long play time, I do not want to play it again.

Patching is a nice new mechanic but I don't like the auction bidding system to get new abilities. Felt like a good game idea requiring another revision of the rules to be polished.
It's possible to have little to do in your turn, if you can't  get additional political points which are action points.  With the default game providing 1 action point, unless you win the bid for further action points, some actions are outside your reach until then.
Hoping this was a misinterpretation of the rules, so reserving a little.
In our first game, we didn't have any wars etc so views may change.

RATING: 5
Not for me. Long, fiddly, tons of unclear rules even with the faq. Too much mechanics, too few interesting choices. Too much randomness in what tiles come out and in bidding. Too random start, seems impossible for all players to get up to 3 political actions before end of age 2 and be able to mitigate the early draw randomness, and take the actions. At that point you should not be building up your engine but rather executing it. So regardless of what you do or how much you bid, some players will be unable to change much of their situation before the final third of the game.

--Jul2014-- This is very entertaining.  It might be a bit slow; but it's charmingly cool.  I like the 3-4p auction rules a good deal better than the 2p ones - though the ability to select from two sides of the same tile in the 2p game is delightful.  It's possible that there's also a greater appreciation that might come once the patches are known and their distribution understood.  But for the moment, I'm definitely looking forward to more play.

Another great civilization game that goes its own way. A bit comparable to "Nations" or "The Golden Ages", maybe a mixture. Absolutely new for me and really innovative was the patching mechanism.

RATING: 8
Well i got this game like a month ago and after some games i'm able to finally say something about it. This game is really good and it's one of the few that really try to mean business when it comes to "civ games without a map". Even though it's really abstract, you can sufficiently feel the simulated part of it, and it's a good feeling to see you empire getting larger one tile after another. 

The much contested auction system is not really that bad, even if it can become an issue when playing with people that insists to take note of what you produce ever turn (you show it in the said phase), maybe even continuously ask you to remind them. Even so, however, being the player who got more money is not always a solid advantage, cause you are able to surpass/control one player during the auction but not the other one-two, and your advantage itself become less meaningfull when there are more than one really good tile at stake. Moreover, focusing too much on currency will put a player behind when it comes to other resources, to military strenght, minerals, transportation, and so on. This is actually a very important point of the game: it's really easy to build up military strenght and then lacks minerals to wage a succesfull war (incredibly amusing is when a third player helps the supposedly losing part by offering him minerals...which may turn the tide of the war :D), or have a lot of Politics but then lacks either Leaders/Wonders or resources to really take advantage of those actions. Fairly common, too, is the lack of food or transportation. Even if the game is a little luck based when it comes to certain resources showing up or not to during auctions, you are still encouraged to strike a good balance that can satisy all your needs, instead than blindly focus on one thing only. The Threat action, too, can feel a little annoying, mainly because, differently by wars that gives you sufficent time to prepare for it when they are coming and a whole turn when you are actually going to get attacked, you can't defend against it and you may even get threated over and over every turn. Still, using three Politics points to get at most 5 VP or 4 coins is not always the best thing to do, and a player with more Politics, resources, leaders/wonders ect., will usually be able to get more VP by it's own during his turn.

Even the downsides of the game are actually linked to these points. First of all, the game don't scales that well in three players, mainly cause you are going too see less tiles, and that gives less variety to the game as a whole. Moreover, when playing in three there is no risk to lose points in the vote phase, and that makes the phase less important. The vote phase itself feels a bit random, expecially the first one, during which you will often see few to no votes at all in play. Lastly, the final turns can feel a little dull, either cause the is the chance to get tiles that can't make such a difference (mainly the basic ones), or because the game itself is a bit too much long and stressfull, and it's easy, during the last era, to just want to finish it and therefore "drop it" a little. 

All in all, however, i think this is an awesome game and i long for some expansions that provides more tiles or some new mechanic.

Civ game in which, as usual, players build their engines to get the food, money, population and resources that allow them to grow. The influence of Through the Ages can be seen everywhere, but this time the cards, which represent lands, seas, wonders and leaders, are auctioned. Players then have to put them in their kingdoms, which is a grid that grows from 5X5 spots to 7X7, depending on the era. They will have to use their geometrical skills to find the right place for the cards, without covering valuable spots. The sin of this game is that it over stay longer than its welcome. Perhaps with several plays this won't be an issue.

Excellent stuff here.  After being lukewarm on its appearances when it first came out, I slowly warmed to it as more and more about it was released.  It was my #1 target to play at Lobster Trap 17.  It was easily as good as I expected.  Excellent bidding mechanic, similar to Peloponnes, where if you go all in on a tile and someone outbids you, you might get stuck with a tile you don't want that you overpaid for.  The political system is great, especially the Aid action that works kind of like revenue sharing.  The patching element adds a great tactical layer that forces you to make some hard decisions and keeps your civ in a state of flux.  I found myself at times making difficult choices just to keep other tiles alive.  This could easily go to a 10 with additional plays and immediately goes onto my must-buy list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Biggest failure of this game is that once you bid some amount of money on a card and get overbid, you cannot take any money back.  This is a big problem when the value of the cards are grossly imbalanced, so having 1 more coin than the other players can result in you paying $15 for a fantastic card and them paying $14 for garbage.

The rest of the game is in general very messy.  The mechanics are just all over the place.  There are some good ideas here but the game needed a lot of work in balancing the cards and mechanics to make something that is actually a good game.  The rule book could also use a great deal of cleaning up as it isn't clear and does not address several issues that seem to come up pretty often.

Actually, I take it back.  I could forgive all of these problems if the game was actually any fun, but it isn't.  The entire game revolves around the bidding and figuring out where to patch in your newly acquire tiles.  Once you have done that it is mostly just accounting.  This is the among the worst games of this type I've played.  The only reason I don't give it a lower rating is that the patching mechanic is somewhat interesting, but the game itself is so flawed as to be almost unplayable for me.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice. Patchistory is a civilisation game I kinda dig despite its drawbacks. For one, it uses an auction system which I am rather fond of, which is also found in [thing=26566][/thing] and [thing=54998][/thing]. What makes the auctions doubly tricky is that players can never reduce their bid even when moving their bid to another card that they don't especially want. This can be tough on players who end up overpaying even while losing out, but the system encourages players to bid conservatively.

Second, the patching mechanism is plain clever. Covering a portion of your grid every round often requires difficult tradeoffs, and also results in players valuing each tile differently during auctions. It does lead to some weird anachronistic issues, but any scenario which sees Moses working with Karl Marx is a good one in my opinion. The other parts of the game are equally abstract, but fit together well as players balance resource production, military power and VP generation.

Now for the drawbacks. First, Patchistory is a long game – games take around an hour each player, and I especially feel the time strain in the third age. Second, keeping track of the various resources can be fiddly as players constantly recheck their grid to ensure they're taking in the right amount. I personally don't have problem with this except when the grid is substantially messier towards the end, but the other people I've played with find this a major issue. 

Lastly, military power appears to be a dominant strategy and the game seems to revolve around countering this. Thematic or otherwise, I wish the design didn't constrain players' strategies so tightly. Still, the upsides narrowly edge out the less desirable bits and I've enjoyed the experience so far; I'd certainly play this again if the conditions are right.

A very good civilization building themed tableau-building game. While comprising a lot of mechanics, the game flows very well. A bit too long with 4. The voting phase can unbalance this game a bit - a possible house rule would be that everyone has to put out their voting card at the beginning of an era instead of at the end of the era.

I really enjoy Through the Ages, so I thought this game would have less depth and not be as good.

I found I was wrong. PH is less fiddly than TtA, and military--while still important--was less dominant. But the most fun part of it was patching your civilization. I've played a couple other games where placing buildings provides a bit of a challenge (Antiquity, Princes of Florence), but tile placement in this game was far more taxing--and fun.

RATING: 7
1 play, 2er

It's a civ game with a very unique mechanism: the patch. Your civ is represented by a grid of squares of different colors, representing different types of buildings, people, advances, etc. You acquire new blocks each round, and add them to your civ -- covering something while also expanding outwards. You will eventually get to a 7x7 grid or so, with higher level stuff covering most of the basic things you started with. It retains all the usual civ elements -- advancing tech, leaders, wars, etc. -- but uses that unique patch system to do it. And it's all so pretty in the end!

One down side of the patching: those cards like to slide around (Brian's copy was sleeved)! And they're kind of flimsy, too! Not a huge problem, really, but still.

Rate at least a 7 after the first play, but could go up -- need to try this some more.

RATING: 10
This instantly became my favorite civilization game.  Most civilization games I don't particularly care for because while I like the mechanics of a game like that there is usually so much time investment, set up, fiddliness, and calculation that goes into playing a game like that.  I would much rather play a civilization video game where all that stuff is handled for you and you get a much more robust experience...often at the cost of the social interaction and face-to-face competition though which in itself is a great reason to play board games.

Enter this game.  It is a civilization game and will take a while, 2 hours with experienced players, that could stretch as far as 3 on first plays with new players.  A lot of the other stuff is gone though, and what really makes this game stand out is its originality.  Instead of the usual researching technology, building buildings and units, and moving across a hex or square grid for diplomacy and war almost everything is handled by...well, essentially patching together a quilt.

Each round players are going to draft patches.  These patches are 2x2 square grids (although some patches have "rooms" that take up 2 or 3 squares or even the entire patch) that you patch into your existing civilization, this always requires you to cover up something, often losing a previous location although there are wasteland spaces that can be covered up for no loss.  The locations on these grids can be anything from basic buildings earning you more resources every turn or military/political might among other things.  Or they could be great heroes or wondrous constructions that give you special powers...at a maintenance cost each turn.

This whole mechanism is fascinating to me and makes it so you can play differently every turn.  There is a lot to juggle and despite its charm is not a game for the feint of heart.  This is a heavy game and there are a lot of balls in the air.  Each of these patches changes your position on EIGHT different tracks that manage your production and civilization status.  There are many things you can do post-patching each turn, and the scoring is done in a complex way where each player submits and then votes on scoring criteria at the end of each of 3 eras.

The game does have some faults, though I think they are mostly aesthetic or ancillary to the actual game.  The first is the quality of the components, specifically the patches themselves.  I got sleeves with my copy which remedies this but if you're not a sleever, well, they are thin and fragile.  The artwork on a lot of the heroes and wonders is alright but, and this may seem silly by comparison, not the symbols that represent all your resources and might.  The symbols could have used better graphical design and the colors and printing and even layout of a lot of the tiles seems off.  I do come from a background of graphical design so maybe I'm more susceptible to this than others but the tiles aren't very pretty in my opinion.  Finally, this is a Japanese game I believe and the English translation of the rulebook is atrocious.  The Q&A in the files section here isn't much better but big shout out to the rules rewrite by Capoeirista.  This thing really helped me understand how the game was played and can be found in the files section.

Each round each player acquires a new card split into up to six sections, which must be "patched" into their tableau, as in Honshu or Edo-Yashiki. Most sections contain a number of icons which move the player up a specific track, but some provide special powers. There are then various actions players can take, probably most importantly the conflict actions based on military power.

It's interesting and original but the inability to reduce bids if overbid is somewhat problematic and can put losing players into vicious cycles -- there is no compensation in the form of more money to use in the next auction which they may well also lose. Compounding the problem are military rules that essentially encourage picking on the weak.

Other than that, a fascinating and unique game. Next time will play with an auction variant.

The design feels loose and slippery -- in need of a strong developer. 

The tools to handle all the accounting you need to do are insufficient. Extremely easy to make mistakes.

The card overlap mechanism sounds good in theory, but in practice is sloppy and impractical.

Bidding seems overly punishing. If there's only one tile you can use, you have to (a) fight for a tile and risk losing a pile of cash to gain nothing, or (b) let another player have it for cheap.

The game goes on way too long. It's not nearly engaging enough for a three hour game.

Not sure where the hype for this one is coming from. I think we are in an age of "easily impressed."

Is there really anything that happens in era 3 that doesn't happen in era 1? Or are you doing a lot of the same thing again and again? Would the game be any worse if it was 90 minutes shorter? Okay, you'd lose the strategies for scoring small amounts of points frequently, but that's it.

Being low on money tends to make the bidding pretty uninteresting, and beyond the very first auction, I only participated in three of the 14 other auctions... As a result, the tiles didn't really come with a choice. Losing military also isn't much fun. Oh, look. My opponent just scored 15 points. Now I have to give him 7 of my points too? Marvellous.

In all fairness, this was on of the more interesting civ games I've played, they're just not for me. I think Patchistory might just be the best of them (TtA, Nations etc), I just don't seem to like civ games. The constant struggle of not having enough of anything you need never crosses over in to fun for me.

Also, in our game the two players who interacted least came first and second, by quite a way. Those two players bid on the same tile twice but had NO other interation for the whole game.

Another civ game. another time military, leasers, wonders and so on.

But you don`t buy cards like in TtA or Nations. The secons thing is, that you must play the card that you get on your "board". Your must overlap some card(s). That causes taht sometimes a card would be very good for you, but you don`t have place for that card.

That 2 things make Patchistory a different game from TtA and Nations.

A civ game that I need to play again before I can be decided on whether its really good, or just another in the line of "be the biggest military jerk to win".

It also seems to be (as with most civ games) that there is no real catchup mechanism. If you get behind in generating stuff, it is not like you can make some magnificent come back, you can only keep plodding away.

I won my first playing and there wasn't much conflict - I won by a lot. I spent the entire third era loading up on votes to score my goal and ended up winning first place in both items (32 points). That and the pyramids I was saddled with to start the game did it.

What a fantastic new mechanism, what a unique concept. This is the progression the mechanism "tile-laying" has been waiting for. Seriously, the Patching is a stroke of genius. However, my experience was marred by the first-game impression that, whatever you do, do not fall behind in economics! I have the strong feeling that you can compensate whatever resource you are falling behind in the beginning except for economy and that you are destined to be on a downward spiral from there. Heck, I'd go as far as saying what good is the exchange "action" for? Why don't you let people trade in the resources they need without having to spend one of the rare political actions for? My two opponents could easily compensate the lacks they had. I had plenty of food and could not compensate for the lack in coins at all. And that really sucked. Even more so considering I love the unique style of this game and I also liked to see a game with an auction mechanism again. Haven't seen one of those in quite a while. 
------------------------------------------------------
The second session revealed exactly the same flaws as the first one. Taking the money route early on is just too powerful a strategy, especially when the auctioned tiles let only one player take it. Plus, Montezuma is soooooo overpowered and unbalanced, it hurts. Lowered my rating

Refreshing mechanic.  I feel like the Political Actions are a little under baked.  There should be a bit more to that part of the game, especially early on if you get stuck with 1-2 actions.  The special buildings seem to be built rarely.  Game runs about 45 minutes longer than I feel it should.  But other than that it's a pretty solid, if fiddly affair and the quilt building mechanic is fresh enough to keep taking it out for a play every few months.

Patching mechanic is great, auctions can be brutal if you have less money than the other players and end up with a poor tile for lots of cash (although should you have lots of money you will want to force players to pay high for those).  Nice civilisation game.  However 4 hours for 4 players is too long, and I didn't think it worked as well with 3.

Surprisingly great abstract civilization game. Patching and resource management combined in a beautiful way.

End of round scoring is mostly luck, you can't see what the goals are until scoring time and then if your luck is bad you will not only not score well you will lose points.

The "Patching" mechanic looks really interesting, but the game seems to be too fiddly with too many "currencies" constantly being adjusted.  I'm wondering if the fiddliness would kill the novelty of the "Patching".

Played once(and stopped in the middle). Not my type. My rate may change with future plays(I plan to play again in 2 weeks). 

I personally would like you to set aside the comments from Koreans when considering this game for their comments could be biased.

Patchistory has some interesting ideas, but the experience itself fell flat for us. The game felt really REALLY long for what it was, and then in the last round someone ran away with it with what seemed like a degenerate strategy. In fairness, these issues could be due to the fact it was our first play, but I'm skeptical.

The economy is brutal, but not in an interesting way. Getting your economic engine going seemed more about the right tile coming up than anything else; the economy itself is very simplistic. All of this wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't have so much time-consuming process you have to slog through. 
 
Also, the patching mechanic wasn't as compelling as I'd hoped. The fact that it's entirely tactical - you add just one tile to your tableau each round without knowing what tiles are coming up in future rounds - felt unsatisfying to me. I would have enjoyed the spatial challenge of planning ahead for future placements, or at least having to place several tiles at once. As is the mechanic felt like it didn't live up to its potential.

My Through The Ages killer.  A better civ building game by far.  The patching mechanic is neat & fresh and the player resource traking boards are brilliant due to being able to see at a glace where everyone is at.  Long game at 3 hours but worth it

Civilization game with rather unique building mechanism. Games can vary depending on which cards enter play.

RATING: 9
I can't say that this is the best of the civ building games, but being essentially a tile-laying game, it's certainly the most unique. Fitting each great person or invention into your cultural tapestry is an incredibly challenging and satisfying puzzle. There are decisions at every turn, all with long term repercussions as your tableau expands.

The weird thing is that despite the huge abstraction, the game does a nice job of simulating conflict, diplomacy and exploration...even though you are just auctioning off and placing tiles each turn. It's a fascinating design.

The only downside is that the nature of the game tends to compound errors. If someone gets sloppy or misunderstands a rule, it will churn, over and over, until the end of the game. This is hard to track, as some of the information is hidden during play. The game isn't hard, but it is long...so realizing after 2 and a half hours that someone flubbed how votes for victory conditions are generated can really be demoralizing. That being said, if you can get through a game without it derailing, this is one of the most unique civilization experiences out there.

It's got patches that is a neat idea for developing a configurable civilisation. Just the rest of the game is a bit dull and overly long.

A civ building game much like Nations. 

You'll either be charmed by the "patching" mechanic or find it to be kind of annoying.  I thought it was annoying, making the game very fiddly and sucking away a lot of the fun.  Also, with 8 things to track, I'm sure we made a lot of mistakes along the way.

This is a complex civilization building game where players patch together different influence tracks to gain different resources for the next round I have not played this game much, and there is a lot more to it than I can express here, but I enjoyed the game and would like to play it more in the future. The main down point though is that this is a relatively long game and it card be exhausting for people learning the game.

Civ building euro centered around auction and tile placement of heroes and wonders and development of your commerce, industry, production, politics and culture. Each player builds their own tile area. Building and expanding your unique patchwork by overlaying the 2x2 tiles is such a fun and engaging puzzle of managed sacrifice. The mechanic reminds me of Ravens of Thri Sahashri. I love thematically how overlaying tiles is symbolic of burying the past technology with the new. This game is a parfait of interrelated layers. The constant tradeoffs birthing work force and feeding them, moving workers to activate tiles towards short term needs versus attainment of secret era objectives, establishing trade routes to force or threaten war, aid and negotiation. Using votes to get the most points from blind revealed area conrol objectives are all great. Turn index tiles clearly indicate and organize game play of the three eras comprised of stages and sequential action rounds greatly aids in preparing for future moves.

Interesting twist on the civ genre with a cool spatial puzzle built in.  The auction mechanic is fun, too.  Nice replayability due to the tiles being randomly flipped each game.

This game is really neat, and looks great, and even though our first game took way longer than it should have, we'll definitely play it again.

If I have a complaint, it's the same as everyone else: the tiles warp horrendously. I was so impressed with how everything looked, the fact that the tiles warp under any condition just made me so mad. I ended up buying square sleeves, and also Tarot-size sleeves (which had to be trimmed down) and left the tiles pressed under D&D books for a week. After that, the tiles are basically flat. The opposite corners come up a little, but they sit mostly flat. Now, the only problem is the thick cardboard pieces for resource tracking, which also flex slightly as they sit out. Can't do much about that.

Also, my kingdom for a way to organize all the pieces! So many fiddly bits, no included bags, and the box insert is really ungainly and I'm probably going to just replace it completely.

Becomes much better after a few plays. The lack of political points at the beginning seemed to be a flaw but actually is ok and can be worked around when you learn how to make use of the other resources. 

The rulebook is pretty bad though. And finally the structure of the game is not interely intuitive. Despite these points of criticism the patching is an absolutely interesting novelty combined with other good stuff : trade routes,  political actions, extortion and aid, the voting for vp 

The game feels tactical at the beginning depending on the tiles you get you start to develop a strategy. 
I have seen a few interesting strategies from only wonder/heroes and no politics civilizations to vote dominating strategies. 

This is also a game with some amount of spite. You might as a weak military player get threatened, stolen all of your gold and not being able to recover for a few turns.

There is probably a good game in here, the whole patching, trading route bits are all fine, but the game is too fiddly and long for me. Also the auction process can be a bit destructive, if you end up in a bidding war , lose and end up paying a high amount for a crap tile.

Easily the best 'in an evening' civ builder games.  There's just something about the abstract way you build your society and the impending countdown as a neighbor makes their way down the trade route that keeps the game interesting and fun.

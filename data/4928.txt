Classic deduction game.  Despite some drawbacks, the game is still highly playable and enjoyable.  The roll and move mechanic dates the game, but the deduction mechanism is still valid and current.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

In 1999 and 2000 I played Clue 200+ times on the internet with the patched Hasbro Clue CD. With this playing time, I realized it was far more a classic than Risk or Monopoly.
This edition had an extra murder weapon and beautiful components

Again, no way to count the plays here, was SO fun back in the day, got this for free when I bought RISK 40th, REALLY cool purchase that night 40 bucks for them both new at retail. Anyway, components of this version are nice and this is the keeper volume for me, I will bring it out in the right atmosphere, and it still holds up OK. I think it is getting a harsher rap because of its age than it deserves, but all in all I am glad it sits on my ever crowded, always growing gaming shelf.

Very nice edition of the classic game.  Used to play this a lot when I was a child.  Revisited it with my own children, and was amazed to discover there's actually a fair bit of strategy in asking the questions.  Shame about the roll & move aspects.

**I've changed my rating for this.  I still love Clue, and I especially love the 50th Anniversary Edition, which is gorgeous, but this is a more accurate reflection of where it should stand in my collection. I also would like to reiterate here that Clue takes an undeserved beating on this site.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The "Anniversary" aspect of this version of Clue makes it more enjoyable to the regular version.  The game itself lacks any true strategy so I've always considered it more of a luck game that has a "watch the other players" aspect of having fun while playing it.  We will usually recommend playing Riddles and Riches intead.

RATING: 8
Also a nice collector's edition... also played with, not "collected". I have always liked Clue... I know it is a light game, but those can be fun as well!

One of my daughter's favorite games. We love to play it. A classic that still feels great. As you can see, we have a few versions and they are all fun. The 50th Anniversary edition is simply beautiful.

Really nice metal player miniatures and extra large weapon tokens, I may have to use them for my PnP Kill Dr Lucky.

I enjoy the deduction, but two player games are a bit limiting.  My wife would rate it a 10, which is why we have the 50th anniversary edition.

Love this, my favorite 'classic' American board game.  A nice side-effect of this game is it helps the younger lot learn a bit of logic and strategy.  The bits are nice, the tin box is not very sturdy (ours bent rather quckly).

This is a better version of Clue. This game has an extra weapon- Poison. The game pieces are actual mini-characters.

Clue is pretty basic as a deduction game (which I'm fond of). The one thing I hate about Clue is its roll-and-move system.
This edition features very beautiful components and artwork.

Family game aka "Cluedo". Wholesome fun, hunting down the killer in this classic "whodunnit". Simple, undemanding. I have the 50-year Collector's edition in both English and French with its superior components which I bought in Canada in 1999.

My wife likes clue, so I am forced to play from time to time. There is way too much luck involved, although the anniversery edition has some nice bits. I'm thinking of buying her Mystery at the Abbey as it looks to involve some more strategy along the same lines of gameplay.

Same rating as original Clue.  They did a nice job with the components and production for this anniversary set.  The pieces and weapons look nice, and the Invitations are a nice touch.  I am not too fond of the board itself, but it's fine I guess.  Personally, I would go for a retro-looking Clue if I got this game again, but I have Clue Master Detective which I think I prefer.

RATING: 6.5
A Very Nice special edition of the regular Clue game, with an additional weapon thrown in (The Bottle of Poison).

Everything in this edition is Top Notch... from the playing pieces to the weapons to the board and even the cards.  The die included in the game is oversized and the weapons are also larger than in the standard edition.  There are nice cardboard "Invitations" included that you can clip your clue sheet to.  It makes a nice "backing" to write on.  Everything fits right into place in the Collectable Tin.

Certainly a game worth owning, especially for the people who have always loved "Clue"!!

THE classic deduction game. Not as much fun as an adult as I remember it being as a kid; a bit formulaic. However, it is still one of the best "non-designer" or childhood board games.

RATING: 6
Okay, this is only good with NON gamer groups that think they are kind of swank.  They will like the real string made rope!  They will like the plainess  of the board!  Maybe the architect will get out his mechanical pencil and draw on the board if you are lucky!  Try not to care that the "revolver" card is represented by a pistol; you will just wish it were a real pistol if someone does draw on your board.  Grrr.

Nice bits, I would pull this out if anybody ever wanted to join in, more likely to try the yet unplayed 221B Baker Street series! (I've finally started playing 221B Baker Street, and it is fun, different than Clue in many ways but with the same boring track movement by die roll, which can net utterly wasted turns).

What can I say... I like Clue.  Although better variations of it have been produced, such as Mystery of the Abbey, the game play Clue provides is light, enjoyable and appeals to non gamers.  It brings back some fond memories for me too.

The game components are top-notch, especially in this edition, and well worth the price.  The artwork is great and keeps getting better, in my opinion.

This certainly isn't a game for everyone, but you could do much, much worse...

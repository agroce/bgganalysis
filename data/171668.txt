I found The Grizzled quite intense and stressful, which I suppose I should have expected considering the theme.  We didn't have any fun playing the game - it was depressing and very difficult (which is probably the point of it all).  We played it through twice but on the third attempt we were feeling pretty miserable so packed it in and played Takenoko to lighten the mood and cheer us up.  I do absolutely love the artwork.  The beautiful illustrations fit the theme perfectly and the components and cards are all top quality.

RATING: 10
So much fun! It has deep meanings about showing your vulnerabilities (hard knocks) cards at a good time, supporting each other through our traumas, beautiful and cool looking art work. War is shitty, and damn does it feel like war. Haven't played with the expansion yet but the game alone is amazing. Worth the money. I think it might be good to play with someone you know who has been through an actual war and let them know that you support them cuz just about everyone coming back from an actual has traumas just like in this game. Love it.

[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

The Grizzled is a co-op game that's attempting to replicate the discouragement and camaraderie of trench life during WWI. Unfortunately, it replicates it a little too well -- this is just an incredibly difficult and depressing game. 

We played several rounds and didn't win any (after I dropped out they played three more) -- my father-in-law finally beat the game, but I think I'd find such a challenging game interesting only until I beat it. Once beaten, what's the point? You're just doing the same thing again -- and probably failing, too.

I was drawn in by the hype of this, but after playing it, the narrative is not there but something you have to make up. The difficulty of the game doesn't seem to be in the decisions you make, but in the brutal randomness of the draw.

I don't think the game is challenging, I think it's challenge is a mask for the brutal randomness of the deck.

The Grizzled affects players at a very deep level. The fact  that the artist, Tignous, was murdered by terrorists and has helped to craft a game that exposes the horrors of war is so significant. And the fact that these game creators put their own great-grandfathers and relatives who fought in WWI as playable characters is nothing less than incredible.

RATING: 5
The most notable achievement of The Grizzled is the total absence of one dominant player plaguing so many other co-operative boardgames. The rules state that you cannot discuss the content of your hand. It sure does make the game a lot harder for players to win, but if you do not mind a challenge, I reckon it only as a positive.

However, sometimes it felt that the game was even too hard. Threats accumulated so fast on the no man's land that we often witnessed a player withdrawing without even playing a single card. I not sure how fun is that if you do not get to contribute to the game in any way. Some people might find the role of a bystander totally satisfying but I felt sorry for the team. Some of the cards robbed you of free will as well, thus being very detrimental to the gaming experience. This might be thematic and needed for the balance, but a game should involve meaningful decisions instead of being a simulation.

What I have read of the World War One helped me in understanding the game. I was even able to visualise myself crouching in a trench in the most inhuman of conditions. It was also quite surprising to see how quick our group transformed from individual players to a team supporting each other without any trace of selfishness. 

The Grizzled is an experience. Personally I did not find the game and the decisions I had to make the most interesting, but the process itself was thought provoking.

RATING: 7
The theme and tone of the misery of the WW1 trenches is perfectly echoed by the bleakness of this game.  It's very hard to win and you are constantly battling to survive.  It's a bit grim and not exactly a game you'd play at Christmas.  It gains for mood and originality, loses for being a bit random.

Mechanically, nothing to write home about but the setting, theme and personal touches (character names for example) is appealing. 

Played with 2 different groups and felt that the self-identified "gamers" kept searching for the meat and the "non-gamers" concentrated on the feeling. The latter group enjoyed the game more than the former.

I learned the game and played it through solitaire.  Note: this may be cooperative, but it is NOT solitaire.  It's a pretty decent little game.  I don't think the theme is that strong, but the play is fun.  I will update after I get the multi-player experience, as I suppose that will make this go up.

RATING: 5
Not very uplifting.  Kinda neat, but didn't really interest me enough to own it.

There don't seem to be a lot of decisions that need to be made, so it's less appealing to me than other co-operative games, even at a lighter weight.

Oddly enough, this game is a lot more fun when you're losing, and it's very boring when you're winning.

RATING: 8
A unique game. In most hard Co-Op games that are hard, they constantly keep you stressed with a sense of hopelessness that makes you want to rise to the challenge. Grizzled is the only one for me that is constantly giving me a sense of hope. The theme of WW1 and the fact I know quite a bit about the history may steer the theme more strongly for me. But for example, if you all withdraw in a round with a lot of cards in hand, you all still succeed in the mission but maybe not well and thus makes the next missions harder. That being said, you still succeeded at something and if all are trying and know the rules, the game mostly ends with a possibility of victory (I lost in a game with 5 cards left to victory.). The gameplay is also easy to teach, play and finishes in a reasonable time.

Downside is some people just can't seem to not give away their hand and would flout the rules to get a win. 

Overall, heavily recommended, a thematic game with strategy and a lot of hope like what drove most WW1 soldiers through the war.

Good concept but I'm just not made for co-ops, it seems.

Worst rule book I've encountered yet. Despite being a fairly light game the [lack of] rules make it seem much heavier than it should.

When beating co-ops I don't get a thrill of victory, rather an 'ah, ok we won.' And losses feel empty when no one gets to walk away with a victory - a feeling of wasted time, I suppose. A personal preference of genre rather than a slam to the game which seems well-balanced and made.

RATING: 8
Something I don't think I've seen before: a push-your-luck cooperative! Nevertheless, it's a very good game due to the great difficulty in actually winning. Your decisions are based on trying to interpret why your fellow players have played the cards that they've chosen. This difficulty comes (in no small part) from the very restrictive communication rules, which (unfortunately) are very hard to enforce. Hanabi (a considerably better game) has the same "enforceability" problem, but it's not as much of an issue as in this game. Commissioned (better still) solves the problem completely, but only half the time, as player silence depends on a die roll in that game. Regardless, The Grizzled is a lot of fun and generates a lot of laughs, which brings me to a problem I have with the game...

...it's a lot of laughs. The Grizzled is much ballyhooed as a game which immerses you "in the horrors of World War I", the description I most frequently see. But the mechanics are so abstract that it could easily be re-themed as...anything! The art is good quality cartoonish art; but it left me with the feeling that the game was Asterix and Obelix meet Sgt. Rock. It's still a great game but it treats the theme far too lightly IF a publisher is going to promote it as an attempt to show gamers the horrors of war. I certainly felt not an inch closer to my great-uncle and grandfather who fought and were wounded on the Western Front. Perhaps if you could (like in Dr. Knizia's, Lord of the Rings) deliberately sacrifice your own life for your comrades, and if the art didn't portray a French group of Sgt. Schultz's, then the thematic idea might work better. 

If you want a better "feel" for the war, I would encourage you to play just about any old-school strategic-level wargame about the Great War. I clearly remember how grim it was after each turn in Guns of August to look at the dozens of counters you lost that turn, and thinking that each counter represented tens of thousands of men! The only thing that comes remotely close to that in The Grizzled is losing: you see the war-memorial card with the names of the player-characters engraved on it, and know that those characters are based on real world poilus.

RATING: 9.5
I can't stop thinking about this game. The theme of friendship and love in the darkest of times, the subtle yet chilling theme of the horrors of war, the disturbing real history of the development possess say nothing of the War itself. The game is unlike any other and I'm fascinated by it. In any other game with the same theme "surviving" the War would mean something along the line of hit points or casualties, this makes it personal. In a lesser game "moral" would be a useless token that goes up and down on a track, in this its the point and meaning of the game. 

At Essen this year I got my copy signed by  Juan Rodriguez, one of the designers. He signed in my box lid "May you and your friends find peace and happiness in this lifetime" A game with a strong message like this is otherwise nonexistent.

The best cooperative games ratchet up the pressure from the very start.  The Grizzled certainly does that.  The best cooperative games offer real choices and tough decisions about which to choose.  The Grizzled offered me a sense of getting hosed by unlucky card draws, with no way of averting that through clever play.  Indeed, The Grizzled actively limits my choices.  I want to support the comrade to my right but I can't because my supply tokens point the wrong way.  That's plain annoying.  

The artwork is charming and production quality is good.

Interesting co-op card game about surviving the horrors of the trenches during the First World War.  Quite a sombre theme, made more so by the fact that the characters you play bear the names of real soldiers who fought and died in the war.  On top of that, the artwork was produced by one of the artists killed in the Charlie Hebdo shooting in France.

Challenging and enjoyable game that's easy to pick up but hard to beat.

A challenging cooperative game that really captures the correct tension of being at war, even if simply playing cards that resemble threats is pretty abstract.

There are simply not many small co-op card games like this out on the market, so The Grizzled would be special for that alone, but the theme of soldiers struggling to help one another survive really comes through in this one, the artwork is nice and cartoon-like but not silly, and there is always a bunch of tension with the Hard Knocks and other Threats. Fairly unique mechanically, there's a feel of spreading the misery just enough so you can scrape towards your victory.

I find the artwork and the story behind it quite interesting. For those that don't know, the wonderful art was completed by Tignous, who was killed in Charlie Hebdo shooting. It really adds a special type of novelty/charm/backstory that most games don't have.

That being said, I didn't enjoy the game. Part of the reason is that cooperative games aren't my cup-of-tee. But more than that, there really isn't much meaningful/concrete information to work with. For its price/speed, I suspect many gamers will be satisfied with this game. But the game wasn't for me.

What a good co-op game. It's a tough game, made tougher by the fact you can't really share much information with other players. It's a heartfelt game, what with the theme, and the art, and the back story behind it. But most of all, it's a very interesting puzzle, which gets randomized differently every single play.

I love this game. It might even go up in rating in the near future.

Although I'm not very enthusiastic with coop games, this one has a simple mechanics and that helps for me.  Basically, the players need to get rid of the cards in a stack, but playing them on the board follows the basic principle of not repeating the same symbol 3 times.  Add some spice with powers and weaknesses on the characters, and a helping mechanics between characters at the end of the round.
Quite nice graphics for a not so easy game.

Initial Impression: There's alot of game contained in that little box. The artwork is cartoony and minimalistic yet feels appropriate. Without knowing the contents of your partner's hand you must deduct what they hold and make the best decision for cardplay. The game is a cooperative puzzle that only gets better the more we play it. We've found that we have a bit more control with smaller numbers of players and I feel that we'll need to beat the game with a smaller playercount before ramping it up. Every game leaves me with the "one more time" feeling. This is a cooperative game that I truly enjoy playing.

First Play: Had heard stories of brutal uncompromising play and minimal chances to come out alive, but hey, what did I have to lose? It's clear that the cards can fall nicely or harshly and guesses for the Inspirational speech can be ....'inspired' or useless. It would appear that our 5 player game was lucky and inspired and we managed to survive. Like all co-ops a win for the team is never down to one player performing miracles so the collective effort results in a muted conclusion for me. Perhaps a sense of futility is what the game is trying to conjure?

RATING: 6
It's cooperative but tough. Great art. Bonus points for an extremely unique theme executed well. As for the game itself, there's very little strategy and most decisions are fairly obvious. Most of the tension just comes from the fact you can't really talk to each other and essentially everything you do is bad. There's a fairly significant amount of luck with how the cards get distributed. This game is probably easier to win with fewer people but I haven't played enough to confirm. At 5, it seems almost impossible to win.

RATING: 8
So far, I am incredibly impressed with this "anti set collection" game. From the gameplay alone, the game seems fairly unthematic. But the art on the cards and your imagination can come together to provide a story for what is essentially, a game of avoiding three of a kind. Some creativity can turn this VERY CHALLENGING, elegant co-op card game into a soulful, poignant remembrance of those who fought in the first great war and a reflection on the brutality of war in general. Don't pass this one up.

RATING: 7
This is a very difficult and strategic co-operative card game.  When playing with 4 or 5, I find it very enjoyable for the challenge that it provides.  However, this is a game where if one person makes a mistake, the entire game may be lost.  

Playing this game at 2 players was absolutely awful.  It adds a third, robotic player that adds a level of randomness to a game that requires a perfect level of strategic execution to win.  Randomness, therefore, can kill a well executed strategy.

The theme comes through nicely with the mechanics. It feels like you and your buddies are stuck in the trenches, struggling to survive the horrors of war. It's very challenging, which is good for a cooperative game. Sometimes the luck factor seems strong, but of the games I've played usually we are just shy or winning or only barely squeaking a victory. It is easier with fewer players.

Tough and heart-breaking co-op with theme and art that moves me.  You must see Marco Arnaudo's review of it titled A Poetic Game About Being Human.

It's not for everyone, but with the right people, it's both a direct and subtle special experience.  Unique!

Wow.

This game is hard. Really hard. Incredible hard. Just one or two bad draws and it is over. That can be really frustrating, like Ghost Stories.
But unlike that it makes you want to play again. instantly. "Ok, last game."..."Holy cow, ok, THIS is the last round!" "But you said..." "Give me the cards!"

Although it constantly beats you down this game is incredibly fun. Quickly explained, very fast played. Great game.

The only flaw I have is the printing of the German promo cards. The hard knocks have a lighter print on the back and the soldiers are from different artists that have an oddly mixed artwork.
The cards for the retail version are great, my complaint is just for the promos.

This took us roughly five games to beat. It's a coop that can be brutal at times and doesn't hold back any punches.

Generally I don't like my coops to be quite this brutal, but this one plays so quickly that I don't see it as being a problem.

My tip is to use your luck ability and speeches as much as possible, they can really turn things around.

The key to enjoying this game is to find the "sweet spot" in terms of what kind of communication and coordination to allow. The rules are intolerably vague and harken back to the original "worst communication rules ever" in Shadows over Camelot: you can talk but you can't tell people what you have in your hand. How on earth is that supposed to work? FWIW, here are some of the topics of conversation that we allow: "can you currently play a card", "if I do X (remove a card, play a card type), does that leave you with a play?", "who do we think is most in need of support tokens". Generally all topics relating to speeches are off-limits, and we don't allow direct questions about specific cards in-hand (i.e., "do you have a shell card"). Also, once one player has withdrawn we no longer allow questions or discussion about support. Now, this is just a bunch of rules of thumb that work for our group, but I think you need to find a spot where the players can talk and coordinate without being able to directly find out what people have. If there is no ability for players to coordinate, the game is just random and boring. If you just play with open hands, there isn't enough here to be interesting. The interplayer dynamics need to work. The fact that the designer couldn't do this himself is obviously a major lapse and in a less fundamentally interesting game, it wouldn't be worth the bother to do the work that he should have done in the first place. But The Grizzled *is* interesting and unique, and pretty inexpensive, so if you can find a good spot I've found it a fun addition to the collection.

It's one of the few games we like to play back to back to back to try to win. It gives some real high five moments when you work together well, and the Hard Knocks give the game so much character and life. Solemn game, serious theme, excellent game-play and just gorgeous art. Played the game with an Edith Piaf record in the background and it made for one of the most unique and memorable gaming experiences I have had. R.I.P Tignous.

It felt rather free of decisions in my one play of it. Get cards. Play the ones you can play. Hope to not get hurt too badly. Hope to win. It reminds me of The Isle of Doctor Necreaux as a game where you just kind of flip cards, seeing what happens, until you win or lose. A bit like Klondike, I guess.

I was pleasantly surprised by this co-op game and how tough it was with 4 players. We never came close to winning, but it was still a lot of fun trying to survive the war. You survive a mission by everyone withdrawing before there are 3 cards added of the same type added to the central display. However, if everyone withdraws too soon that will add more cards to the next round bringing you closer to losing so you still want to play as many cards as you can while avoiding a set of 3. It definitely seems incredibly hard in our 2 plays, but I look forward to more plays and may even look into the solo or 2-player rules to see if it is worth a pick up on that alone.

An entertaining light-ish co-op card game with a lovely art style and some interesting mechanics. (Interesting mechanics which only [i]really[/i] work if you follow the rules as written with regard to keeping yer piehole shut during the game; n.b. folks who like co-ops in particular because of the social lubricant factor.)

You could do a lot worse if you're in the market for a quick/cheap/portable game for a group of the sort of people who like co-ops; I enjoyed my playthrough and would like to try again. If the game falls down at any point it is a fault of over-ambition: it's aiming on some level to evoke the horrors of trench warfare and the simple heroism of the men just trying to get through it together, and the game just didn't seem mechanically capable of raising the emotional stakes to the level that would bring that to life for me.

I don't feel as if the game's random elements are controlling my actions or the flow of the game TOO much, though, and it actually adds a lot to the game's theme and the whole "a most desperate time" feeling. And that's a good thing! All in all I find the game interesting, challenging, tricky and very thematic.

Deseando jugarlo tras la lectura de reglas. me parece un cooperativo con un tema bonito y un arte en las ilustraciones sobresaliente.
Tres partidas tras el estreno. El juego te tiene en tensiÃ³n constante al no permitir mucha comunicaciÃ³n entre los jugadores. Muy buen cooperativo.
Jugamos una cosa mal en el estreno que nos hizo perder todas las partidas. Las fichas de "suport" que se tienen en cuenta son sÃ³lo las de ese turno, no el conjunto de todas. De esta forma el prestar apoyo al compaÃ±ero es mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil que como nosotros lo hicimos (y aun asÃ­ casi ganamos una vez :P) TambiÃ©n considerÃ¡bamos como un sÃ­mbolo a tener en cuenta el sÃ­mbolo de suerte de cada personaje, cuando en realidad, dicho sÃ­mbolo no se tiene en cuenta para contar cuantos sÃ­mbolos ser ven en mesa.
Una vez corregido estos fallos, lo hemos jugado y hemos ganado. Ahora toca jugarlo con la creciente dificultad que supone incluir el modo de las trampas en las cartas.

A fantastic little co-operative game, that at it's current price of under Â£20 it's well worth a purchase.

The sheer stress brought on when a fellow player places a threat card into No Mans Land, and you have to somehow work out how to slowly clear your hand without failing the mission.  The fact that you are supposed to play with total secrecy as to what cards you have in your hand, and when deciding which support tiles to use, adds to the drama.

Not for the faint-hearted.  I will always tell new players that they should expect to lose, particularly when the Trap card mechanism is in use.

The game play is a little simplistic for my taste. The theme and resulting "story," is notable for depth, considering how simple the game is, however.

It is a little depressing, and for me that marks the score down a little, I have to admit it.

It's a polished system and very, very tight without room for error. Unfortunately for me errors are not avoidable as you simply cannot determine a real probability to what you should do to survive.

That's a little too real for me! LOL!

Respect to this game, just not one I will play a lot, I can tell.

One of the best, most challenging, cooperative games I've ever played.

Fun and evocative coop that captures the theme pretty well. It's initially very hard, but like most coops you get better with play.  The expansion throws some nice wrinkles in to keep it interesting. Definitely get the second edition rule book. While the first edition covers everything it does it in a somewhat confusing manner.

DonÂ´t get fooled by my "weak" rating on this filler, this is a great, great coperative game and my rating isnÂ´t higher only because...well, because itÂ´s just a filler!
The suspense and the tension are always present in this game, as the common final task is no piece of cake. But still, the game is very amusing and the theme is very present, even if this is a game about war that has nothing to do with a wargame! Great job and great game!

RATING: 6.5
A co-op game where players are limited in how much they can communicate with each other. This prevents a single player from dominating the decision-making, but it also makes the game very difficult to win. The artwork is good, and it's fun to play with players who get into the theme (especially when it comes to Hard Knock cards). :)

You feel the desparation and hopelessness that comes with war.  The bombings and gas become routine parts of life.  But your fellow soldiers are there with you, keeping you going.  For a small card game, it is incredibly immersive.  Similar to the Lost Expedition.

RATING: N/A
Tried a 3p game (with the expansion, but without traps). Seemed to go okay to start, but escalated rather quickly, then I had a hand full of hard knocks.

But rules don't seem clear whether we can win or lose if players have 4 hard knocks (with the other victory conditions fulfulled).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some might say this game plays itself, but that's only true if you fail to consider speeches, lucky charms, and support (basically, if you ignore most of the game). Sure, there are cards you can't play at times and cards you can, there are safe times to play them and bad times to play them, but you still have to make guesses and decisions on what to do and what everyone else could do, and this leads to a lot of tense moments wondering if you'll pass a given mission, or get through all the trials in time.
The game really seems to capture dealing with your own personal conflicts and weighing them against the actions of others', who are also trying to sort through their own problems, in a way that lets everyone survive.

[November 2015 - 8.2]
What a great little co-op. It bucks the trends of so many co-ops out there. The most ironic aspect is that there isn't a lot of communication allowed in this "co-op" and you just have to hope your fellow players will help you out when you need it the most. This prevents any one player from taking over the game.  Two: its a pretty short game (about 30 minutes) and easy to play a couple of games in a sitting. The art is fantastic and the game itself is well themed and creates emotions.

Coop, World War 1, Card game, each player hidden cards
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A beautifully created cooperative card game about brothers in arms surviving the trenches of World War 1. As a WWI enthusiast, I feel this game captures the feeling of the desperation and brotherhood of the great war better than any other. It is simple to learn the rules of, but the difficulty is exactly what you would expect of a game representing such brutal times. If there's a game that I feel emotional just thinking about, it's this one.

Ok, for the most part, this seems to be a well-liked and highly rated game.  Unfortunately, I guess I'm one of the few that just doesn't get it.  The odds of winning seem so minuscule that there just doesn't seem to be much point in playing. I know that a lot of people really like this one, especially my best friend, but something about it makes me vaguely uncomfortable, and I would be happy if I never saw it come to the table again.

RATING: 8
A nice clean cooperative game that doesn't feel like many of the other clones out there.  Players silently try to work through the Trials deck of cards together, trying to get to the Peace card.  However, the Trial deck is being continuously topped up from the Monument deck, so you have to work faster than the game.  A lovely, poignant game that can, depending on how the cards fall, be quite straightforward, or devilishly difficult.  Small box size, easy rules, and the different feel means this one will stick around for a while.

Ok, I don't feel the theme. I have heard people say that the game feels stressful, feels like you're in a unit that is breaking down mentally. Frankly, I don't get that when I play. The game is fun, it is stressful and does generate moans and cheers during play. It isn't a game I'll be ridding myself of anytime soon. I just feel the theme was oversold. What wasn't oversold though was the art. The entire package, from interior box lid, to rules to cards to counters are all amazing.

It's okay.  I think it gets a lot of attention for its theme, but the theme is weak.  You could do this game with anything and it would say little more or less about the men of WW1.  Still, as a co-op challenge, it's quite good and requires a lot of collaboration, only you're limited by what you can say.  Interesting game.

Co-op, Light

Nice light co-op.  Unique and cute artwork and while the gameplay isn't very novel, it's entertaining and fun.  My biggest knock is while it has mechanics that solve the Alpha Player problem, they seem contrived and if they aren't followed exactly, the game is very easy.  For games in the same feel/mechanic I wouldn't play this over Samurai Spirit, but it's definitely better then Hanabi for me anyways.

I have yet to win this game, and that's probably a good thing.  It's a fascinating game, as it's more about the experience, and it shouldn't be easy.  It's a little unusual as far as co-ops go, because there's a limit to the cooperation; you can't share all knowledge.  I'll definitely keep playing until we win, and probably several times after.

A cute game about WWI soldiers navigating the hazards of the battlefield together. The goal is to get dealt hazard cards, play them to the table without triggering a mission failure, and remove them from the deck. If you drain the deck entirely, you win. 

The choice you have each turn is that you may play a hazard card to the table or you may drop out of the round (but your cards in hand stay with you soâ¦). If three of the same type get played, then that mission fails and you have to put those cards back in the deck. The trick here is that you're not supposed to communicate with one another about what cards you all have otherwise itâd be easier to coordinate who should/should not play which cards. 

Iâve yet really see if the game shines in this regard as our learning play was marred by rules confusion from the poorly written (translated?) rulebook. Fortunately, some people were able to instruct us on the intent of the rules as clarified in some second edition rulebook. But it made learning and playing such a simple game a lot more annoying than it had to be and colored my first impression of it. I saw enough that I liked that Iâd certainly try again with someone who has all the ambiguities worked out.

The Grizzled is a beautiful game with a coherent theme that achieves what it sets out to do.

Everything about the game is beautiful from the cartoon style (think HergÃ©'s Tintin, to the atmosphere it creates and the cohesive way it brings your band of brothers together to overcome insurmountable obstacles.

Expect moments of tension, desperate plays and near misses as your group fight the uphill battle.  With all that said while this game is not overly difficult it does make you work for it.

This is a great game.

This game manages to convey a great deal of emotions with its theme and graphics. I didn't expect such a strong experience from such a little game. However - and that's a deal breaker for me - I feel like the players don't have enough tools to counter the effects of dumb luck. If you draw a bad hand of, say, a lot of condition cards, and some of those condition cards happen to combo and make the game impossible to win... well, there's not much you can do about it. I only played one game, though, so I might have missed a few possible strategies. UPDATE: After playing a second game with the right rules (I found out we made a few mistakes during my first playthrough), I can say that this game isn't as hard as I had thought. I still don't know if I like it, though.

An interesting take on cooperative gaming - people have to work together and it is VERY hard for anyone to control the game board. The game is very difficult to play as well. Maybe with more plays, it will make more sense, but the games I played felt like decisions were limited, and the risk of the game was tweaked in a way to make failure likely. 

I am could be wrong, but game play wasn't inspirational enough to make me care to dig deeper.

"Oh no! There's two gas masks floating in the air! I sure hope a third one doesn't show up!"  

I really expected to love this one.  I read a bit about it, and almost bought it.  Thankfully, I had an opportunity to play it twice on two different days.  Simply put, not fun.  I am happy to play very difficult co-op games -- I *wanted* that -- but there still has to be some payoff, some story, something to make me enjoy the experience.  This had none.  I never felt like we were DOING anything, accomplishing anything. Even with Hanabi, which is a completely abstract numbers game that has NOTHING to do with its theme, we at least build stacks of cards that indicate SOME sense of progress.  That, coupled with too few interesting decisions, makes it not worth my time.  I'd play again if someone really wanted to, since it played fairly quickly, but I'll likely suggest something else instead.

Great game that really makes for a tough co-op. The art is amazing with a tragic story. A solid game that requires true teamwork to win.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting theme with unique artwork. I'm not sure I get the same vibe as the game and other reviewers promote though. It IS a difficult slog through bad situations, and you have to work together without direct communication. In a way, it's like a better, more difficult version of Hanabi. In terms of mechanisms, there isn't anything really exciting, but it's a quick filler. I like it, but it doesn't replace more extravagant co-ops where the crap piles up quick in any sense.

Rating is based on only one play. Tension was definitely felt but I felt like I had little control on the outcome. This may be by design to represent the helplessness of the war but, if that's the case, the game was too short to really feel involved.

I'd like to play more to see if some strategies emerge, just like at Hanabi.

The Grizzled isn't a game I'm ever dying to play but there's something very charming about the table talk. Everyone is just getting punished over and over again and you're so focused on making it through a battle without too much left in your hand. 

I don't know if I need to own it but I would rarely turn down a play.

RATING: 6
Comparable to Hanabi in terms of the feeling they give me while playing but they are different design-wise - I've beaten this on the normal mode but never have I beaten Hanabi. They are both equally enjoyable experiences to me but Hanabi might have gotten over played so this is a fantastic way to spice it up. I think they are probably the same difficulty at normal mode but Grizzled can ratchet up more.

RATING: 7
Components: not bad, the cards are a bit thin
Complex: easy
Weight: family game
Players: 3 or 4
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: cooperative
Decisions: enough for these games
Opinion: a group of friends are enrolled in the Great War, and you have to survive... but altogether. For doing so you have to survive several missions until the peace comes around and you have done all your tasks.
This means that in your turn you have to play cards into the mission, and there cannot be more than 3 menaces of the same kind there. You can also use your amulet to discard cards or give a talk to help your mates. Beside this, there are cards that are wounds, and could be really nasty.
In a nutshell, you have to decide when to play cards to the center, play a wound, use your amulet, give a talk or go back to the trench. The best part of all this is that you cannot talk about your cards, or who you will support at the end of the mission, avoiding one player to lead the group making it the typical cooperative game

I was recommended this game by my fellow board game geek & friend. 
In the beginning, I was quite skeptical about getting it.

However, after watching couple of videos I was hooked by it's unique gameplay and style. There was a deep tension building up as the game went on. 
It's a small cute box with beautiful illustrations, doesn't take much time to setup and it's easy to teach.

I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone, even those new to board/card games.

Will get the At your Order Expansion soon.

Got a chance to play this (Finally) and man it is the most difficult co-op game I have ever played. The game oozes theme, but its not due to a mountain of text, or clunky systems. The struggle itself and the constant threat to your team mates and mission is where you really get the feeling that you're just trying to survive a horrible set of circumstances. The art is good too. This is a simple game that I'd be comfortable explaining to new gamers, but boy is it a challenge (we lost on easy mode). Can't wait to play again, and will probably pick it up to continue filling out my stable of micro-games. 

Got in a second play. Won this time. Still a neat, beautiful little coop game.

A dicsÅsÃ©g Ã¶svÃ©nyein avagy âSajnÃ¡lom! TÅ±z!â
Az egyelÅre kis hazÃ¡nkban beszerezhetetlen kooperatÃ­v jÃ¡tÃ©k tÃ©mÃ¡jÃ¡val azonnal megnyerte szÃ­vemet. A Nagy HÃ¡borÃº harcaiban, borzalmaiban folyamatosan ÅszÃ¼lÅ barÃ¡tok megprÃ³bÃ¡ljÃ¡k tÃºlÃ©lni a mocskos lÃ¶vÃ©szÃ¡rokban, vÃ¡rva a megvÃ¡ltÃ³ bÃ©kÃ©t (bÃ¡r helyette sokszor a halÃ¡l Ã©rkezik meg).
A jÃ¡tÃ©k nem kÃ¶nnyÅ± (hello Ghost Stories Ã©s tÃ¶bbiek), melyben kÃ¼lÃ¶n kihÃ­vÃ¡st jelent, hogy bÃ¡r egy csapatban kÃ¼zdÃ¼nk, a rendelkezÃ©sre Ã¡llÃ³ kÃ¡rtyÃ¡inkrÃ³l, tÃ¡mogatÃ³ lapkÃ¡inkrÃ³l nem beszÃ©lhetÃ¼nk a tÃ¶bbieknek.
Egy jÃ¡tÃ©kban 2-5 fÅ feladata eljutni a bÃ©kegalambig Ã©s felhasznÃ¡lni a kezÃ¼kben lÃ©vÅ Ã¶sszes lapot. A lapokrÃ³l csak annyit, hogy az 59 kÃ¡rtya kÃ¶zÃ¼l csak egy jÃ³ van. A tÃ¶bbi minimum kihÃ­vÃ¡s, de inkÃ¡bb Ã¡tok.
A kÃ¼ldetÃ©s elejÃ©n lapokat kapunk kezÃ¼nkbe (minimum egyet, de lehet tÃ¶bb is), majd egy akciÃ³t vÃ©grehajtunk Ã©s kÃ¶vetkeznek tÃ¡rsaink, amÃ­g az adott kÃ¼ldetÃ©st sikeresen vÃ©grehajtottuk vagy elbuktuk. A lapokon 6-fÃ©le fenyegetÃ©s talÃ¡lhatÃ³ (valamikor tÃ¶bb kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zÅ is, plusz fincsi csapdÃ¡k). Amennyiben 3 egyforma megjelenik a kÃ¼ldetÃ©sben, azt elbuktuk. Viszont minÃ©l tÃ¶bb lap marad a kezÃ¼nkben, annÃ¡l tÃ¶bbet kell kÃ¶vetkezÅ alkalommal Ã¡tpakolni a hÃºzÃ³paklinkra a morÃ¡l paklinkbÃ³l (de minimum hÃ¡rmat). Amint a morÃ¡lpakli kifogy, a kis csapat veszÃ­tett.
A lapok kÃ¶zÃ¶tt talÃ¡lunk olyanokat is, amelyek csapÃ¡st jelentenek a tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g rÃ©szÃ©re Ã©s azt az adott szereplÅhÃ¶z kell csatolni. Ha valakinek 4 Ã©rtÃ©kÅ± csapÃ¡s kÃ¡rtya van a birtokÃ¡ban a tÃ¡mogatÃ³ fÃ¡zis utÃ¡n, a csapat szintÃ©n veszÃ­tett.
Hogy ne csak rossz dolgok tÃ¶rtÃ©njenek, minden karakternek van egyszeri jÃ³szerencsÃ©je (bÃ©r visszaszerezhetÅ), amivel a kÃ¼ldetÃ©sben talÃ¡lhatÃ³ egyik lapot el lehet dobni. Valamint az elsÅ kÃ¼ldetÃ©s utÃ¡n lehet lelkesÃ­tÅ beszÃ©det tartania rendelkezÃ©sre Ã¡llÃ³ jelzÅk erejÃ©ig, ami szintÃ©n hasznos.
Aki nem tud, vagy nem akar mÃ¡s akciÃ³t vÃ©grehajtani, marad a visszavonulÃ¡s Ã©s felkÃ©szÃ¼lÃ©s valaki tÃ¡mogatÃ¡sÃ¡ra tÃ¡mogatÃ³ lapkÃ¡k (kÃ¡vÃ©) kÃ©pÃ©ben. Ha sikerÃ¼l valakinek tÃ¶bb kÃ¡vÃ©t adni, mint mÃ¡soknak (egyenlÅsÃ©g nem szÃ¡mÃ­t), az megszabadulhat 2 csapÃ¡sÃ¡tÃ³l vagy visszakapja jÃ³szerencsÃ©jÃ©t.
Majd a kis kÃ¡vÃ©zgatÃ¡s utÃ¡n a kezekben maradt kÃ¡rtyÃ¡k szÃ¡mÃ¡nak fÃ¼ggvÃ©nyÃ©ben csÃ¶kkentjÃ¼k a morÃ¡lpaklit, egyben nÃ¶veljÃ¼k hÃºzÃ³paklinkat Ã©s egyre fÃ¡radÃ³ hÃ©tkÃ¶znapi hÅseink indulnak az Ãºjabb kÃ¼ldetÃ©sre.
Ha valamilyen csoda folytÃ¡n bÃ¡rmikor megpillantjuk a vÃ¡rva-vÃ¡rt olajÃ¡gat szarukÃ©pletÃ©ben tartÃ³ biolÃ³giai repÃ¼lÅgÃ©pet (alias bÃ©kegalamb) Ã©s nincs egyikÃ¼nk kezÃ©ben sem kÃ¡rtya, nyertÃ¼nk.
Na ezt kihÃ­vÃ¡s Ã¶sszehozni, azonban maga a jÃ¡tÃ©k egyszerÅ±, gyors Ã©s nehÃ©z.
KiprÃ³bÃ¡lÃ¡shoz ajÃ¡nlom a jÃ¡tÃ©k BGG oldalÃ¡n a fÃ¡jlok kÃ¶zÃ¶tt elÃ©rhetÅ szabÃ¡lyÃ¶sszefoglalÃ³t is. :)

This game is just heartbreaking, as your soldiers take on debilitating injuries after another, you' re just hoping to last a bit longer, even though you know, you will in fact lose the game for everyone on your next turn.

That christmas card is possibly the best component of this game.

A very very good game.

Didn't click with our group at all. After 3 plays no one wanted to play it again, and it was really hard to pinpoint why. One person didn't like the fact that you only ever get 3 support tokens. One person thought it didn't have a good flow to it. For me it just felt like something was missing.

Perhaps this game was partially a victim of my own expectations, but I didn't really see much to recommend this. The art is nice, but other than that the gameplay is shallow and frustrating. There's a fine line between showing the futility/desperation of war and having few meaningful choices, and to me the game was heavy on the latter and light on the former.

This is the kind of co-op that makes me say I don't really like co-ops. It's difficult, which I think is a reason for its popularity. Yet it's only challenging in that you have to get pretty lucky or "figure out the trick". There is no real opportunity I could see for teamwork or clever play. In fact, communication between players is limited. This makes it "more difficult", but only in the sense that it allows the inherent randomness to adjudicate the outcome even further. Nice artwork. Probably won't play this again unless everyone else really wants to.

Not a game I enjoy playing, but it is definitely a great game.

Strangely thematic--theme is about cooperatively surviving war. You have to essentially play all/most of the cards to win the game, and ALL cards except one (Christmas) are something bad. Feels very thematic. Very impressive.

I have miffled feelings about the [limits] on what is "allowed" to be discussed (ie: who to support, playing cards, etc). It does help mitigate the alpha player syndrome, but not having *clear* limits on speech limits annoys me.

I really liked this game until I played it. The Mechanics made sense thematically, I was sure I was going to enjoy it and the decisions you make but alas, they all feel bad like when you make a speech and it does absolutely nothing to help your cause, because un-luckily no one has the the particular threat in their hand. Also when you look at your hand and the whole hand is hard knocks cards, this happens a lot actually more times than I would ever thought possible. The game ask you to be strategic, but you have no information to go off of, or complete randomness. you vote for support but even then its random because no one can have any idea what the other players are going to vote so its just a crap shoot if someone gets it. Even if you knew who someone was going to support, that information is not consistent because they may not even have the support token to do what they want. In conclusion, I experienced Lots of bad feeling moments, futile frustration, The game ask you to make a decision but then says but you have no information to guide your decision, do you choose heads or tails, now flip a coin. The people I play games with could probably get to the point where we could consistently win this game, but none of them have any interest in playing it again. Why would they, there is no part of the game that made them feel good about their choices. It's like shooting blindfolded at a target and if you accidentally hit the bulls eye the game says good job you win.

With a captivating theme and some of the best artwork to grace a game, The Grizzled seems like an absolute slam dunk. The problem is that the game is way too difficult and provides precious few moments of interesting decision-making. Most decisions are either made with nowhere near enough information to make a solid choice or so much information that the play (or lack of play) is obvious.

In war, it may be better to be lucky than good, but if that's the way a game is designed, it's not going to be an enjoyable experience.

Quick little co-op. Very little collaboration is allowed, and that indirect (you can call attention to open information that the current player may have overlooked). There are a few cards that heavily distort things; it seems like managing those is key.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2015)

As it is a Cool Mini or Not game I wasnât expecting much from it, however, I confess I had some fun playing it.

The Grizzled is a cooperative game set in the World War I environment. The theme is cool but I almost didnât feel it through the game, only some of the hard knock cards convey it. The art is gorgeous.

The rules are very simple, you can explain them under 5 minutes. The gameplay is also very simple with mostly obvious decisions. The game is hard but it isnât hard because the decisions are difficult to take. It is a hard game to beat because 1. You cannot communicate anything about your cards to your teammates  and 2. It has lots of uncontrollable luck (you have to make decisions without knowing the cards of your teammates, pure luck here). I like the part that you cannot communicate with anyone, this eliminates the âalpha player effectâ most Co-Op games have.

On the good side the playtime is rather low (so I donât mind much about the luck factor).

Bottom line, I would play again if requested, but it is a very light game for me, full of obvious decisions and lots of luck. It is definitively not a game for me. I will sold my copy of the game ASAP. The Grizzled is perhaps the best Cool Mini or Not Game I have ever played.

What a great co-op game.  Comes in a small box which makes it very portable and plays quickly so it works in multiple situations. The game is very hard! If you are playing at the full 5 player count I would highly recommend not using trap cards however at 3 players definitely use them.  Can't say enough good things about The Grizzled love it

The Grizzled is a great small box co-op. Communication and working together is tantamount. The game is difficult, but rarely feels unwinnable too early in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very impressed by my one play so far.

Regarding the gameplay, I usually avoid co-op games due their tendency to descend into the experienced alpha player basically telling everyone else what to do. I want to play a game, not just follow orders - why not just play it solo? However, there are a few simple rules in here limiting what information players can share that prevents that from happening, so kudos for that. This means that each player has to make their own decisions based on what they know of the game state.

The love in the theme and presentation shines through. The first group I tried to get to play backed away - a co-op game themed on a group of conscripts surviving the trenches of WW1 is a tough sell. However the second group was more amenable, and once they got into it really enjoyed it. It's a good game, but the presentation, support rules (through which the players have to help each other recover at the end of each mission) and the reasons why the designers created it (expressed in the notes at the start of the rulebook) somehow make it a more involving experience.

I had really high expectations for The Grizzled when I first heard of it and saw it played a couple times.  When going over the rules and playing around with it trying to get a feel for it, it seemed like it would be a pretty fun game.  However, it really isn't fun.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game.  It's just really sad.  I don't generally get caught up in themes, but this one just really wears on you.  Add to that, it just seems impossible to do well with certain distribution of cards.  I'd like to try it again and at the same time, I'd rather not.  Man, I don't know.  Beautiful game though.  Love the art.

RATING: 7
[floatleft][ImageID=2595195][/floatleft]This is a fully cooperative card game with a WWI theme. Cards in the game usually have 2 of 6 different features. Three terrain features: night, snow, rain and three combat features: whistle, shell, gas mask. There are also hard knock cards which have no features and instead get assigned to a player and have various detrimental effects. 

A game is played over a variable number of rounds until either victory is won or defeat is suffered. The cards are split into two decks, the monument deck which if empty causes the players to lose, and the peace deck which if empty causes the players to win. Each round the players choose to  each draw 1 to 6 cards from the peace deck. At the end of the round if the peace deck is empty and the player's hands are empty they win the game. If not a number of cards are moved from the monument deck to the peace deck equal to the number of cards in player's hands, or 3 whichever is greater. This provides a wonderful uphill struggle for the players to fight against. They can choose to draw only 1 card each and have an easy round but that will not actually help them much in the long run. A lot of the fun in the game is managing this clock and deciding how risky to be.

[center][ImageID=2718713 medium][/center]

The actual game play in a given round is pretty straightforward. Players take turns, on your turn you have a few options but usually you play a card into the centre of the table. The centre of the table can hold at most 2 of each card feature. If a third feature shows up then that rounds ends immediately. Players are not allowed to communicate at all about which cards are in their hands. This part of the game is very light and luck based, but there are some strategic elements at play and fun decisions to be made. There is also slightly more going on in this phase that I haven't bothered explaining.

I really enjoyed the game, for a 20-30 minute game I think the level of luck is perfectly acceptable. There is often some post-game table talk as players are finally able to divulge which cards they had and why certain actions were taken. There are three difficulty levels in the game and you can easily create a more-or-less challenging game by moving cards between the two decks at the start of the game. The art is also very nice even if the theme and game play don't exactly mesh that well together.

RATING: 6
The outstanding feature is the great artwork by the late Tignous who tragically was killed in the terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo editorial office. The artwork alone succeeds in evoking the atmosphere of trench warfare in WW I.

Other than that, Les Poilus is an average cooperative game that can be hard on the players. The few actions don't leave enough room for clever moves as cooperative benchmarks as Pandemic offer in spades. There's just cards to get rid of, no spatial component. Exchanging information on cards is prohibited. Each group has to find a consent on allowed communication. Winning Les Poilus feels like solving a patience. Sometimes, this is what I'm looking for but as a game there are better cooperative games around.

The expansion probably wouldn't help my enjoyment as its main effect seems to turn up the frustration level.

A solid co-op that you will enjoy once you sort out some of the pesky little rules.  For instance, after the first game we figured out that we were doing support all wrong, that it wasn't about who had the most TOTAL support, it was about who got the most support THAT ROUND.  The subject matter is actually kind of heavy, so thematically it can be kind of a downer.  Try to keep it light.

Don't get the hype. Every turn, choosing a card to play is a meaningless decision, the push-your-luck aspect is not even there (because you'll push it until right before it breaks), the game is high-randomness and low-decision.

Unfortunately this didn't have the theme come through for me like I thought it would.  I didn't feel like I was running missions, it just felt like I was matching cards.

Overall a disappointment for this player.

RATING: 8
This unique cooperative card game is a gem. The rules are very simple, though I have found it surprisingly difficult to teach. I think that the secret to getting the idea across is to start by explaining the flow of cards - the idea that they will flow from the Morale Reserve to the Trials pile, and from the Trials into our hands, and from our hands onto the table, and from the table to the discard pile. The rate at which they flow from Morale to Trials increases the more we fail to play cards from our hands onto the table. To play as many cards as possible in a round we have to try to anticipate what cards other players are holding, and try not to let hard knocks get in the way. And finally, each player in turn will have the opportunity to increase or decrease the flow of cards from the Trials pile into our hands - remembering that any cards left unplayed will cause the Morale pile to drop...

The Support cards are also quite hard to explain. For some reason it's not easy to accept that you depend on a process that random to get support from your comrades.

So far, however, everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it and wants to play again. And that's always a good sign.

An emotional tour de force co-op game that attempts to emulate trench life in WWI. Not too many WWI games out there, and this is a solid one. Simple and elegant, but very difficult. Players all have their own hand of cards, abilities/problems, which helps with avoiding the typical pitfalls of co-op games.

A semi-cooperative game where you try to survive a mission with your friends but can't really exchange information. A unique game with unique mechanics. The only downfall is the game is weighted very much in the favor of losing. We played 4 times before we won and it's very easy to go from full health to death in 1 round, but all-in-all a good game.

The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where players win or lose together.

Each round, the current team leader will choose how many cards every player draws. Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.

I had heard about this game when most people here on BGG heard about this game, when it was first published in Europe shortly after the Charlie Hebdo tragedy. The art was definitely evocative of that French comics style, which peaked my interest in what the game had to offer. When I heard the back story for the setting of the game I was really interested. Luckily I was able to snag a copy of this at GenCon this year and I have to say that this is much more than just a boardgame. Rarely do board game designers seek to expand the hobby into such design spaces, but the designers did here and they really and truly succeeded. The Grizzled is a game about war, but it is not a game about the glory of war, or great nations fighting for the future of the globe. Instead it is a game about friendship, loss, and the trauma of war. Each player plays as one of six famous friends who one night promised that they would all return home from the trenches of WWI alive and sane. The game simulates these friends in battle going on missions, and overcoming obstacles in a very abstract way. Through the gameplay you come to feel the terribleness of war, and its effect on all those who go through it. Players will be stricken with Hard Knock cards which will force the player to play a certain way in certain circumstances. All the way shelling and gas attacks and air raids are happening all around the friends. Players will give speeches to bolster their comrades, and sometimes a little luck will be just what you need to succeed in that final mission. Sometimes you will cheer, but soon the horrors of ware will catch back up with you and you will be climbing up that hill once again. I can not recommend this game enough to players who are willing and want to explore what game design could be.

Great 30-40 min gateway cooperative game without alpha syndrome. It gives you clear focus on what you should do in the game, compare to other "big" convoluted cooperative games which requires good planning and spatial reasoning (Pandemic, Forbidden Desert...). Also in those "big" games you are getting directions of other players what you should do on your move, especially if you are beginner and you are in fear that you will mess the whole game. So you are not making any decisions for you self at all. You are just getting orders of other players what to do. And I don't like that, because you are not involved in game.
But this game solve this problem, because you cannot tell other players what cards you have in you hand, and tell other players what should they do on their move. The interaction goes through actions of other players, so everybody is making dessicion for yourself which impacts other players and game. Therefore I like it much better than those "big" grandiose games. Also its great for traveling because of if its friendly compact size box.

RATING: 9
A 9 may seem like a high rating for this type of game, allow me to explain: everything in this small French card game just works so very well! Seriously, the comrodery and passion of the players grows and evolves with the game, we groan together, curse at it together, and all cheer together when we manage to win. The trials faced in the game are a hallowed facsimile of the awful events of war and violence that serve to underline the theme of The Grizzled. This game brings people together under a banner of friendship, punctuated by a stark anti-war message. Half game, half art, all fun!

This is an absolutely beautiful game, from the charmingly grim artwork to the actual gameplay. I'm not a wargamer, and in fact I'm often very turned off by the almost pornographic affection many gamers have for real-war themes. The Grizzled's theme appeals to me both in how it's presented and how the gameplay goes. And I like the gameplay itself; a cooperative game that isn't more whack-a-mole or hidden traitor is always welcome.

It's a grim game, to be honest, and it's hard as balls, but there's a there there, and every bit of it clicks with me.

Granted, I play this game solo only and I assume e.g. the supporting would make more sense with more players. Why does The Grizzled differ so much in rating from Samurai Spirit, when the former has much less of the swinginess and player elimination for portions of the game that the latter has? Well I do have to say the theme has a significant effect. WWI while not a theme I dislike doesn't have the underused theme aspect of Samurai Spirit, especially with how novel it is that you get to turn into animals. Also, I don't like the artwork of The Grizzled, and the weird phrasings on the cards kind of annoy me for some reason. There are also some logistical things: Samurai Spirit is one of the few non-party games that plays well with 7 whilst The Grizzled plays a more saturated player count (this actually is very significant), and the font of some of The Grizzled's cards are really hard to read, including some that I almost misread and only caught because my first interpretation didn't make sense.

Now on to the actual gameplay: I think in this game it is very abstracted you are just trying to avoid set collection, which makes the theme not come through very well. This is alleviated somewhat by the negative ability cards, but since you are trying to get rid of them, some of them are just parts of sets anyways, and they aren't the unique ability of someone, they don't feel very personal. Sure, Samurai Spirit's kiai track is pretty abstract too, but I would say the round end penalties already are as thematic as the negative ability cards of The Grizzled (The Grizzled has more variety but Samurai Spirit's makes more sense why it is happening), notwithstanding character abilities that are more interesting than just get rid of one card with a matching icon, and the addition of kiai abilities.

I know supporting would probably work better with more people playing, but I don't really understand the point of it. Sure, there's some tile management of not being able to support, but it feels like just a mechanism tacked onto the game to try to make the game's puzzle more challenging rather than something that actually made the gameplay better. In contrast, you only support very rarely in Samurai Spirit, but doing so feels like you are really changing up the game.

I don't like the lack of sense of progression in this game. I guess this aspect is in fact thematic that you are stuck in a quagmire, but it is frustrating how slowly you whittle down the deck sometimes.

One thing this game does do quite well is needing to hand manage well, and puzzling out who should play what, what should be left for future rounds, how many cards to draw per player per round, and when to use your single use tokens. In this regard I think it does a lot better than Samurai Spirit: you won't feel like you lost just because you got unlucky, and there is more strategy despite both having to manage the wellbeing of all its members and also the no man's land/rest of the raiders deck and striking the right balance. However, I think the risk-reward aspect of should I draw in Samurai Spirit while not as mechanically sound adds more tension to the game, whereas here it is mostly just an optimization puzzle.

Great co-op game.  The theme is well integrated in the game, the components are excellent, and the art really brings the theme of the great war to the forefront.  It's a very hard game, expect to lose often, but that is what I want from a co-op game.  For me the best co-op games are the ones that challenge you to the end.  Lots of excitement, laughter, cursing, and despair while playing the game, emotionally alive and fun to play.

RATING: 7.5
A tough Co-op card game set during World War 1 - Play cards to the array (no mans land) each card has a number of different symbols / enviroments on them (eg gas mask or snow or rain) each player plays cards but the mission will fail if there are ever 3 of the same symbol/enviroment - The Deck is also full of hard knocks which are bad effects you can play to yourself - Once you cant or dont want to play a card you can withraw and play a support token face down - You can't tell other players you hand or what support you played. Also to help players the previous mission leader (this will go clockwise each turn) gets a speach token which can be used to pick a symbol/enviroment and all plays may kill a card from their hand if it matches. 

A very tough but enjoyable card game

Simple, quick-moving but VERY good game that is horrendously punishing, but keeps you playing. The carrot of victory is always dangling *just* out of reach, and despite losing game after game you will want to keep going to see if you can make it. Eventually you will, but it might take a while. Luck seems to be a bigger factor on occasion than outright strategy, and you can get horrendously overwhelmed early on and have very little hope of winning, but since a game only lasts about 10 minutes, it's not like you're waiting to lose for very long. Fantastic game.

Played 4 or 5 times.  Unless you play the intro game it's just too hard.  Also, I have no idea why they make it harder with more players by removing speeches.  It's not like 5 players have more power over the game than 3.  with 3 you're more likely to land someone with the majority of coffee mugs too, so 5 is already harder, and they remove speeches on top of that?

We didn't play this one. I got it when I didn't yet understand the type of games that work for us. I could never get this played because of the push-your-luck element and the fact that it's a co-op game where you can't talk strategy with the other players or show them your hand. Turns out my husband hates that in a co-op. I've also heard that it requires the expansion to play well as a two-payer game. I couldn't justify keeping it on the shelf when it was unlikely to ever make it to the front of the line to play.

So good! So brutal. Somehow, through an equal mix of evocative artwork and moving mechanics -- a phrase I don't think I've ever used before -- The Grizzled manages to evoke the hopeless, faceless futility and horror of trench warfare in play. It's frankly amazing, especially given its small footprint.

For example: You can only provide support to your comrades, even if you're the person who needs it the most. You can acquire a card that forces you to support yourself, but it's an affliction. So simple, but so moving -- and so beautifully executed.

Absolutely unforgiving, which is how I like my co-ops.

Top marks for the unique WWI theme, where the goal is simply to survive. The artwork is lovely, and the way negatives, both environmental and emotional, pile on the players does evoke the setting.

Finally got this to the table and boy did it fall flat. I actually kind of like it - but the rest of the group didn't and that means it's likely not to be played anytime soon compared to the other great games we have.
For the type of game it is - its just a bit too fiddly as far as the rules go. I'm sure they were trying to make it more "thinky" but our group just did not like it even though we pulled out the win on the very last card played.

@7 recorded plays in (and a number of unrecorded solo plays), I have never won - not even close. Proves to be a very challenging co-op game, one that I hope to get close to "solving" eventually. At the moment I'm at that "you're at the mercy of the card draw" challenge level, one that I'm sure will resolve into something else as I develop better strategies.

I really love the art.  We cheated on our play by using open hands to learn the rules and won, but it was close - on an easy difficulty (from At Your Orders!).  Playing by the rules, I'm certain it's very difficult and probably near-entirely luck based.  I am eager to play again and properly.

Play cards, never create a set of the same three symbols. Sounds easy. EVERY PLAYER needs to pay attention in order for the group to do well. It is easy to identify the weakest player, as they usually do the bonehead move that gets the group killed. Still love the game though.

Grizzled. Another co-op game - this time a card game set in WW1 Western front. At first I did not like the game at all, and it does require you to play it at least once to get the hang of it. I did enjoy it a bit more towards the end of the first game, but I would probably not buy it. Theme is ok, if a bit grim.

Well, I had to get the game to express my contempt for the cowardly terrorists that ended the life of the talented illustrator.  But I will play it because it is a good game.  A coop with a historical element that gets you into the story of the game.  They do manage to evoke some of the tension, and the stress of watching those lightning bolts roll out of the hands is palpable.  I decided to get the French version despite the text to stay close to the depicted theme, but we should learn the cards soon enough with a cheat sheet.

March '16:  oh, so close to a win!  Three cards left on the pile, but JeroenD not able to play the last card in all our hands!  And the difficult level, too!  Great fun.

Fun little coop game with an interesting theme.  Unlike similar coop games, where you can guess teammates cards by their reactions and plays a bit too obviously, this one makes you really think about the cards in other peoples' hands.  The mechanics of support and speeches are a neat way of giving players more resources.  We instantly wanted to play it two more times when we learned it.

Great co-op game; fun theme; particularly if your group embraces it.  Some of it is luck driven by the cards, but for the most part it is strategy, when you play your hard knocks, use your lucky charm, and give your speeches.  Limit the table talk and try to beat it legitimately.

Rating this after four plays (and one win - oh, what a difference understanding the rules can make!). I enjoy this game more when all players attempt to "use the theme." Instead of saying "I'm going to play this card, then I'm done", it's "Poor Gustave has developed a phobia of bullets. He'll withdraw from this mission and return to camp." Proclaim your speeches with gusto, fear the reducing morale, and empathize with the characters to make this game really shine.

This one *is* as hard as people say it is.  And, it can also be a serious downer (while playing it) as people say.  The difficulty of the cards and your frequent inability to contribute in any meaningful way as things go downhill really puts a somber tone on the game.  Still very good, but know that this one can really hit your emotions while playing it.

The Grizzled is a quick play co-op game set in the Great War. The basic idea is that the players are all friends from the same little French town who enlist and have their illusions of victory and glory shattered to the point where all they want to do is survive the war. In âAll Quiet on the Western Frontâ to enemy is rarely seen, the real struggle being one to survive a very dangerous place as a part of a system which seems utterly indifferent to their wellbeing. The situation is similar in The Grizzled in that the Germans are never seen other than indirectly through gas or artillery fire (though this could just as easily be misdirected Entante ordnance).

As the game progresses the friend incur various mental scars, phobias and suchlike, until the weight of it all is too much for them. These can be mitigated by support from their friends but there is only so much that camaraderie can do in the face of such horror. The two outcomes are that the friends survive the war and return home or that they will join the voluminous role of honour as part of this lost generation. 

I played The Grizzled with five, which I am told is nearly impossible, and we all fell victim to the war thrice with no real hope of survival. I enjoyed the challenging gameplay and really appreciated the theme. This is a very well-produced game with excellent artwork and top-notch production values. I enjoyed and appreciated the games and this is one I will look out for a future purchase.

Two other favourable points are that the game box is small and wonât eat up shelf space and that the rulebook also comes with a âjustificationâ for making a game with this theme. This game is so well executed that it could be used as an educational tool for high school students to help understand the effect of trench warfare on those who lived it.

RATING: 9.3
An exceedingly tense and punishing little cooperative game.  Each turn you are presented with a hand of horrible cards to play - any of which could lead to the loss of the game.  The main activity in the game is trying to determine which card is the least hurtful.  The game is balanced for 4 players: at 3 players it is too easy and at 5 it is too difficult. 

The At Your Orders expansion makes this good game greater! The missions help the scaling by making it easy to tweak the difficulty.  They also add more theme to the package without a lot of additional rules.

I really thought I'd have liked this one much more than I actually do. Part of it might be because none of my friends likes it, part of it because I tend to not like gritty themes in board games. 

I think this game also doesn't feel as thematic as people say it does. Nevertheless I will try to play it a few more times before settling my judgment. 

On a positive note, it feels harder and less obvious than most cooperative games, which is a very, very good thing.

RATING: 7
This is a sad game.  And I mean sad - not bad because it is a very good cooperative game. I play wargames that are decent historical simulations and shoot 'em ameritrash style games.  Interestingly, this small, abstract game makes me think about the senselessness of war and violence in a way that the other games don't. First of all, the art is wonderful and created by Bernard Varlhac who was brutally murdered in the Islamist terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo.  it's hard not to think about that when you first open up the box.  

Then there is the theme itself.  Players are soldiers, friends really, trying to survive the horrors of WWI trench warfare. Players can provide support to each other to help them overcome hardships and even deliver speeches to help rally and bolster the troops. Victory leads to peace represented by a dove flying over a devestated landscape. Defeat leads to the name of your character on a post war memorial to the dead. Poignant.

A fairly unremarkable cooperative game with a pretty poor rule book. I've heard some comparisons to Hanabi, but I think I like this one a bit better. If anything, this felt closer to Samurai Spirit. I didn't feel the need to play this again after a single game though.

RATING: 4
The gameplay of The Grizzled failed to engage me. All you do is taking turns to play cards to missions without exceeding limits until all players are out of cards. Most of the times, your decision space is so limited that you only have a few options. On the positive side, the hidden information mitigates the common alpha player problem with cooperative games, but this comes at the expense of a silent table.

For some reason The Grizzled is so difficult to teach! The basic idea is simple, but almost all the actions require rehearsal with new players.

It starts with the idea that withdrawing from combat is considered a success. From there, getting new players to understand where to send their Relief tokens is problematic.

I like the game, but I don't have the patience every time I need to induct a new player, so a trading it will go.

Hanabi-esque co-op, in that it involved thinking ahead to what your fellow players would logically have to do, and then deducing back to yourself. Except that your fellow players have their own thought processes, so it is that delightful resigned sort of frustration.

Although somewhat abstract, the tight mechanics really shine. Also of note is that it is much harder to "team-captain" this game compared to many other co-ops due to rules regarding not discussing certain information (such as the cards in your hand), making players use a certain degree of observation and insight to finish each mission successfully.

A fun, tough co-op! Doesn't work very well with two because of the more or less random "soutien" mechanic, but great with more. Really well integrated theme.

Awesome card game.  Explaining the rules and one could see people going 'huh' and 'does not sound that great'.  But then the first mission starts...  Three missions in and people are sweating.  Great little card game and I am looking forward to more plays of this.  Ideal for a lunch hour.  This is really a great cooperative and different game.  A lot of gameplay in a small box - we are really enjoying it.

Group consensus was that it is different to other card games and that replays are needed.

Not sure why this is rated as highly as it is. There's not enough information to make meaningful or interesting decisions. You play the cards you get, hope that the cards amongst the group are diverse enough to get as many out as possible, and choose the appropriate moment to withdraw so that any misery burdens you have are negated for the rest of the round. And either come up with a protocol at the end of each round as to how to pass tokens so as to remove a misery burden, or throw up some prayers that everyone's thinking along similar lines. The playing of it was fine enough, and it works, but it just felt like the game played me more than I played it.

RATING: 6
"I don't like 'cooperative' games like this one where you can't communicate. It accomplishes its goal of being an abstract game whose dismal theme manages to come through. It also seems more difficult to win than I prefer."

What I like:
- Some clever mechanisms
- Plays pretty quickly (15-30 minutes with 5p)
- The war is a setting, but there is no killing or gore. I would put the weight around 1.8, on the assumption there is hidden depth in card counting and carefully analyzing every choice everyone else makes. 

What I don't like:
- Not being allowed to communicate
- Seemingly brutal difficult (at "normal" level)
- Constantly being placed in a situation where all your options are terrible
- It seems to snowball when you start to lose

If this weren't cooperative, I would probably rate it a 2. It's one I'll play if someone else really wants to, but it would be somewhat reluctantly.

The Grizzled is a cooperative card game about surviving trench warfare during World War I.  I was surprised by this one--despite the seemingly interesting and immersive theme, the game was remarkably... abstract.  Players played cards that affected either the outside environment (by adding one or more symbols) or played "hard knocks" cards on themselves, which sometimes add icons and sometimes give you negative text.  If three of the same icon ever show up, the team loses.  Players can decide when they want to withdraw from the round (presumably if they'd be forced to play a losing card), but the more cards they can get play, the closer to winning they get.  I'm not really a fan of cooperative games, but I was expecting something more than a symbol-matching exercise here.

An interesting little game. I'm unsure of how much actual choice you have in the game though and feel like you're just getting lucky based on what people play and what triggers when the trap card goes off. 

I'd continue playing it and I'm interested to see what the expansion brings, but so far I've played it twice and won twice. Yes, both times we goofed on rules (although the second time it was the rulebooks fault [bad speeches rules]), but I don't know how much harder the game can be unless you just really unlucky draws. And that doesn't sound like very much fun at all.

This is a co-operative game that plays differently than others. Because players cannot negotiate during game play, you don't get the 'coaching' issue you do in another of other co-ops. It's also quick, which is nice. It's also really hard to win. It's a pretty unique mix of theme and gameplay.

RATING: 8.2
A true work of art. This is a game that shows you how games can also be art.

The inversion of the usual idea of a war game. Usually in wargames you command armies and wage war over terrain and great distances, and you outmaneuver and outsmart and outfire the other general or vice versa. It is about supply lines and dice modifiers and the glory of blowing the enemy away.

In the grizzled it is the total opposite. You are a poor frightened person in a trench, whose sole defense against fate is hope. Hope which wears very thin while shivering in the cold and rain and snow, hearing shells rain down from the sky which you are powerless to avoid. Waiting silently for that moment when everything goes blank. Protecting that small flickering flame of your spirit from winking out entirely. And the only consolation: your companions, who are just as miserable and terrified and helpless as you are.

You help each other. And in this game, when we are dead, I actually feel camaraderie with my fellow soldiers. The kind of bond that only mutual suffering can forge. And the glow of this game lasts long after we are done. The art of this game is on its psychological effect, and in being a form of communication from these long lost brothers in the trenches who are no longer here to tell the story. I salute you.

This is a really fantastic co-op game where players try to make it through World War 1 alive. It's a game where you take a deck of hardship cards, and cut 20 of them and put them on top of the win card, which represents peace. Thereby making peace something that you can see off in the distance. Then players get a number of cards to their hands, and have to play the cards one at a time to the center of the table. If a third copy of any of the six threats gets played, the players lose, and the cards that were played to the table go back on top of the peace card pile. If players pass out before that happens, then they make progress. The cards in the center go away, but then you add new cards from the remainder pile on top of the peace pile equal to the cards remaining in player's hands to a min of three. If the remainder deck runs out, it reveals a monument with the players names on it indicating they died in the war. If that wasn't enough, players also can get traumatized by hard knocks cards that force them to play or act erratically if they aren't gotten rid of quickly. The art is gorgeous, and the box and playtime is small. The game is really hard with 5 and easiest with 3 players.

An interesting co-op game thematically, but falls a bit flat in the gameplay.

It's very simple and easy to teach, but there's not a whole lot going on.

There are many better designed co-op games.

At it's core, Les Poilus is a game about risk mitigation, and racing a clock that is rapidly milling itself. You have to try and burn through the trials deck as quickly as possible, but you don't want to load up your hand either. You need to do lots of missions to get rid of hard knocks as quickly as possible. It's this almost press your luck element (especially as hard knocks accumulate, and traps go off) that leaves you constantly oppressed by the wear and tear of battle. This is definitely a tidy game of theme and mechanics as one.

Negatives first: the rules of this game are not explained too well. The manual leaves a lot of information to be desired. 

Once you figure out what you're supposed to do, this game was a real gem. It has just enough thematic flavour and aesthetic to evoke the horrors of war, as there is always a sense of dread while playing. Each mechanic does feel like it has a place and you get a great sense of camaraderie at the table. There is something really poignant about the win condition of seeing the peace card and it feels more satisfying than other cooperative games as a result. Would really recommend.

A simple abstract cooperative game that nails the theme and creates a dark hopeless setting where your only support are the soldiers by your side. The art attracted to me to this little gem, but the gameplay sold me in the end. Kind of brilliant, in its own right.

I really like this game.  It's a simple concept but is SO difficult.  You MUST play the other players.  Even though you are working together you must understand WHY people are making the decisions they are making to ensure you're working together in the best way possible - otherwise you won't win.

The expansion is great.  It's almost a "must" - I certainly won't play without the expansion anymore.

The solo variant is pretty good.  It reminds me of Friday in it's difficulty (obviously the games are much different).

So much disappointment. I put off trying The Grizzled but was so sure I'd like it. A statement about war? Check. Regarded as an emotional experience? Check. Art I loved? Check. Foreign and indie enough to let me feel pretentious? Double check! But even with all that, when I finally played it was just like every other card-driven cooperative game I've ever played. I truly ha ed Hanabi the first few times I played but after trying enough of these (and I count Onirim) I've decided that Hanabi at least doesn't claim to be more than it is. At least it's fun to play with kids, where The Grizzled just makes everyone feel bad in every possible way.

Just played this and really liked it. My group played roughly 6 times and didn't win once, but shockingly that didn't lesson my enjoyment at all. The game can turn from going well to unwinnable in a single turn, which actually proves to be really fun and not as frustrating as you'd imagine. Easy to set up, quick to play (especially if you lose quickly)and a great cooperative experience in general. I immediately ordered the expansion.

Reading the rules made me think it would be very thematic.  Playing the game left me bored.  It was random with an obvious optimal strategy that would either work or not beyond your control.  It just felt tedious, not stressful.

Also, the communication rules are vague and problematic -- a serious oversight in a coop game.

I really liked how traumas worked.  They offered short vs. long-term trade-offs, they were very thematic, and the fact that phobias go away when you retreat added tactical decisions that were sometimes quite interesting.  I wanted more stuff like that, and less icon matching and random card flipping.

This game definitely surprised me.  I received this game for my birthday and was not too sure about how good it would be.  The games is cooperative and those type of games are not very popular at our house. In this game players play soldiers uniting together to deal with the hardships of world war I.  players have a hanfull of cards they are trying to play through without causing hardships to the group in order to make it through the war.This is my favorite Co-op that I have played so far.

Pros: challenging cooperative play.unique gameplay mechanisms and game design. Very nice and unique artwork and production quality. Very small amount of tablespace required. Deep and captivating theme and gameplay.

Cons: 3-5 players only, bad decisions can end the game quickly. Rules are a little vague on what information you can and cannot disclose with other players.

Two player is very difficult. Players end up with a lot of trauma cards in their handâusually more trauma cards than threat cardsâmaking the speech token ability not very useful.

What I like about this game is that you have a set of cards that you have to deal with on your own. You cannot communicate what is in your hand, so you are individually determining what is good for the group which denies any possibility of an alpha gamer. However, you can't [i]just[/i] play your hand. You have to be very aware of what the other players are doing. Through simple card play and some limited information, you have to deduce what the group needs. Despite all of this, the rules are very simple. Neat game.

RATING: 7
Tried this with friends after a long day at UK Games Expo, which I wouldn't be crass enough to suggest went some way towards emulating a degree of war-weariness... Didn't get the rules right, but it was also hard to know what we should do cooperatively, bearing in mind what the rules forbid discussing - wasn't clear to us how the game is supposed to be played. 

Hope to try again under more auspicious circumstances.

Art and production are flawless, I'm hoping that there is a real game in there that isn't too limited by having to play in the right spirit.

Edit after finally getting my head round the rules thru solo play : there is a real game here, maybe with much determined by chance and an inevitable attrition - but it does work. Of particular merit (once understood!) is the way that communication restrictions limit the potential for Alpha playing, and the simplicity of the game lends itself well to a group getting into the same mindset - and so (hopefully) having a chance to win.

RATING: 7
Although I'm not a big fan of cooperative games, I was attracted to the theme and art here. I'm pleased that the programmed gameplay lives up to the rest of the package. It's not quite up to Friday's standard - particularly in replay ability, but being a multiplayer game it makes up for it with player interaction. You have to read your comrades' plays to get a hint of what might be in their hand. It's the reading of how your comrades are playing that prevents there being an absolute correct way to play... just. Looking forward to wringing more out of this with further plays.

I had very high hopes for this one. The theme and presentation are very appealing to me. The game is very hard to win. I guess that is the point, but I'm not really sure how to mitigate the luck of the cards yet. I'm not sure if the strategy is really subtle, or if it just isn't there. I think it's in part based on the group dynamics, which in my personal case may inhibit my enjoyment as I don't have the consistent game group that this game may require. In this way it is similar to Hanabi, a game that shines with a dedicated group that I love more in theory than in practice. 

My wife loves the game and I'm sure we will be playing this for some time to come and I will adjust my rating accordingly. I can see it going up to an 8 or down to a 6.

Honestly this game has it in spades!  Theme, Gameplay mechanics, and a co-op experience that forces you to make your own decisions to help the group.  And trust me, you'll feel the pressure of not wanting to let your "Band of brothers" down by making a poor decision.  The support phase is very cool as you withdraw from the front lines with a cup of coffee.

I was introduced to this game by my friend zagnaut. Thanks, Chris! Cooperative games can be both enjoyable as well as frustrating but this one definitely leans more toward the enjoyable end of the spectrum. I picked it up in only a few minutes and we were soon moving along nicely. We soon added my son to the mix and he too, picked it up right away. Simple in play but a lot more strategy than might seem initially. Yes, you can play the spoiler if that is your style but it certainly doesn't help in a winning strategy. The game can be played by only 2 people but 4 seems optimal.

An addictive co-operative that is quite challenging. It is certainly challenging to get rid of cards, as it seems that nearly all cards seem to jeopardize losing the mission after just the first one or two that are played. As a result, you are really facing tense decisions almost immediately every round, and the struggle to survive is palpable. What I really like is that since everyone is looking only at their hands and table talk is not really allowed, each player is making educated guesses to help the overall cause. Effective timing of what little resources are at your disposal combined with some luck is necessary to win. The WWI theme is lightly there and does add a little flavor to the game. After a couple of plays, we've mastered the Rookie level, but I think the Normal level is going to keep us challenged for a long time to come.

RATING: 8.7
Components - 1/1 Cards are good. Box is compact but nicely made. The rules are clear and straight-forward. The few cardboard tokens are nice and thick. 

Fun - .9/1 It's a quick playing enjoyable experience for 2-5 players. I've not met anyone who didn't have fun with the game. It's only drawback is the difficulty gets to people after several plays. You lose far more often than you win, and you can get so close to winning so many times yet manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Replayability - .7/1 Generally speaking there is 60 cards with 2 major types of cards (threats versus hard knocks). Depending on the ratio these two types show up drives the biggest unfolding of the gameplay. This means there is a fair amount of replayability. Given the short nature of the game we generally play 2-4 games in a row then move on to something different. We play frequently though so we've definitely gotten our money out of the game. 

Strategic - .7/1 
For only a few choices to make as a player there is quite a lot of power over the outcome. That being said, the game still does have some dependency on the luck of the shuffle. If threats are concentrated such that everyone has the same ones there is nothing you can do. You generally have to pay attention to what cards people are playing. Sometimes you actually want to fail a mission to help get rid of an additional card (or ensure someone gets the support token). This games finds a really good balance of depth for a simple & easy to learn game. 

Theme - .9/1 I think the theme in this game is powerful. The Great War was one that some nine million combat personnel never made it home from. The unique perspective of this game is that you aren't really focusing on combat. You're not trying to kill anyone, you're just trying to keep your brother in arms from succumbing to the many horrific faces found in this particular global conflict. You find yourself trying to constantly avoid letting anyone get too buried. When I play those elements come through the theme for me. 


Personal Rating - 4.5/5 This is a great co-op that can be taught very quickly, and takes a fair amount of time to master. I love that there's meat here even though the game plays very quickly. It makes for a great experience when you want a meaningful strategic game but just don't have the time to play an hour plus deep game.

This is a cooperative card game set in World War I.  One of the main selling points I've seen for this game is that players are not allowed to communicate with each other.  While in theory that sounds neat, needing to work together without being able to openly communicate what you need, it isn't so much a neat feature of the game as it is a needed rule for the game even to work.

The game is played by players each drawing a certain number of cards each turn to completely work through a deck.  These cards mostly have symbols and backgrounds on them, collecting 3 in one round fails the mission, there are also cards called hard knocks that cause negative traits that you can draw.  For the most part you can choose to stop playing cards at any time, which you want to do if playing a card causes you to fail a mission (unless a hard knock forces you to).  However more cards are added to the deck you are trying to work through equal to the number of unplayed cards at the end of a round.

The reason the "no communication" thing doesn't feel so much like a neat feature as an obligatory rule is if I could talk I would just tell my teammates what cards not to play so we could get through more.  The only way this ruleset works is if you disallow that kind of communication.  And past this gimmick that's not really a gimmick there's nothing that interesting here.  It is really just a card-based coop game where we are trying not to match too many symbols.  Some of the hard knocks cards do spice it up a little bit and it's not a bad game.  Just kind of plain considering how much good coop stuff there is out there.

This might be intriguing if you like the art style or theme/setting but neither of those really appeal to me either.

RATING: N/A
A bittersweet cooperative game set in the First World War, The Grizzled attempts to simulate the camaraderie and support that soldiers had for one another while undergoing some of the worst conditions imaginable.  The thing I'll say about this game is that there are a lot of hard choices to make and sometimes its unclear how you can possibly help your teammates and survive yourself.  So it nails evoking that fear and solidarity.  When successful (and we've only succeeded once), the elation is all the more powerful.  Seeing that dove of peace almost brought a tear to my eye.  I think this coop will only grow on me in the years to come.

RATING: 5.5
Beautifully illustrated co-op game about troops surviving the Great War. Players are dealt out cards, including threats played centrally (including night, snow, bullets, gas) and individual conditions (such as selfishness, wounds and phobias); if all available cards can be played before the deck runs out, and without any one player being too grievously hurt, there is a collective win.

I don't find the theme particularly well-represented (the support mechanism in particular is annoying -- you can't help the guy next to you because your only tokens go in the wrong direction?) and my first impression was that luck had unduly significant impact; I now suspect that it felt that way due to extremely poor play. Regardless, I think it's one to play for the artwork, and for the weight carried by the theme, rather than the gameplay. It's not in the same league as Hanabi, Pandemic et al.

Had fun playing this, but I don't think it will have long term appeal.  The support tokens are just too chaotic for the fact that you sometimes cannot progress without them going to the right person.  Often you don't have any real choice in what to do, and the only excitement is whether the deck will screw you.  It might make a potent metaphor and a decent first game, but I'm not sure how much more I need to play.  Played with 5 on Rookie.  Lost 1, Won 1.

Decent "push your luck" co-op game. Feels a bit random and uncontrollable at times (especially with getting traps early that just snowballs into huge problems). I also have a few problems with imbalanced Hardknock cards that can ruin a game if you get them too early.

Still enjoy it though for what it is as a filler. Really want to try the expansion to see if it improves upon it.

EDIT: The expansion really improves the game. Makes it much more interesting. This is the rating for the base game with expansion now. The base game itself is probably a 6.5 or so.

Really interesting mechanics. I usually dont like co ops but this made sense thematically and mechanically. Rules were fairly good; the play time is excellent, perhaps 20-30 min. A number of tough decisions. I worry abit about replayability, once we understand the deck thoroughly will our decisions become too mechanical? For now, it gets an 8 based on mechanics that are worthy of study, as well as the perfect playtime and a good number of tough decisions.

Very brutal co-op game with interesting twist of not allowing player interaction. We won our first game, but probably due to our violation of the rule of "no interaction". The "Hard Knock" cards assigned to players are the main reason why this game becomes more interesting. They force you to do things that in some cases will do harm to the missions. Definitely want to play this more to understand it more. :)

I didn't realize this game was a co-op (I love co-ops), so I didn't pay it much attention.  But I got to play it a couple times and was surprised by how much I liked it.  It took a while to wrap our heads around the rules, but the game play was decent enough and actually fit the WWI theme reasonably well.  The most interesting aspect are the trauma cards (I might have that name wrong) that give you semi-permanent negative effects.  It felt appropriate for soldiers being driven insane by war.  

I'm not really into the WWI/WWII themes much.  But, I also don't have a ton of lightweight co-ops in my collection. So, there is a chance I will actually pick up a copy of this.

I thought the iconography, which is critical in this game, was just so-so. The game works pretty smoothly and turns go quick. Ultimately, however, the game just lacks excitement. Even during my first play, things felt a bit repetitive by the end. Our group won on our first play of this (well - first play for me ... there were several Grizzled veterans present), but the victory left me feeling very ambivalent rather than thrilled by the achievement.

Brilliant, quick, coop.  This game is exactly what I was hoping for.  Plays well with 2 (in my opinion, at least) using the dummy player rules from the expansion.  Also plays well with up to 5, although significantly more difficult.

Its tense, as it should be.  I love Pandemic, but I love how this differs from Pandemic in that you are playing together but have to make decisions on your own for the good of the group.  

Took multiple plays to beat the easiest setting, which is a good sign.  There are two different ways to increase difficulty; adding traps or adding cards.  Makes for variety.

Great game to play over coffee.

We bought this at GenCon 2015 based on the hype and everyone telling us how amazing it was. The problem was that we didn't take a demo at the show and so none of us had any idea how to play.

I never played an abstract game that would introduce the serious theme of war in a more gentle way while keeping all the horrors of the conflict in. Just the fact that you're not playing against each other but you're all trying cooperatively survive the conflict is brilliant. I can say the same about using cards for dirty and grim battlefields or attacks on soldier's sanity. Who knows something more about the World War I and read books such as All Quiet on the Western Front will enjoy the story that unfolds on the table.

The Grizzled is a beautifully conceived political cartoon of a game, both aesthetically and mechanically.  

The art was actually provided by a French political cartoonist, shortly before he was killed in the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo.

Mechanically, the game is fairly workmanlike.  But these simple mechanics efficiently express some difficult concepts regarding war: personal sacrifice, the toll of living within horror, but, mostly, the brotherhood that develops among those who live within such horror together.  

Heavy stuff for a simple card game.  I'm impressed by games that strive to make a statement, and I'm impressed by this one.  However, it's not one I think would have a lot of replay value; my rating is reflective of that.

A pretty unique co-op game. It's different from the Pandemic clones and the tower defense style co-ops that are abundant.

In The Grizzled the players are playing cards to a central area. Each card has multiple symbols/threats on it, and you're trying not to match threats that are already in play. The catch is that you can't talk about the cards in your hand. 

The difficulty seems really high. I have won a couple of times on easy mode, but when you step up to normal difficulty it seems like it would be almost impossible to win (but I admittedly have little experience on normal mode so far).

This brings me to my one concern with the game. I'm not sure how much your actions actually influence whether you win or lose. Even if you play as strategically as possible, bad card draws can be almost impossible to overcome. I suppose this isn't too different from most co-ops, though.

Overall this is a fun game that plays quickly and seems to work well with 3-5 players.

RATING: 9
Every game manages to give you at least a few glimpses of hope that you can pull out a victory. Almost every game, however, ends in a depressing loss. That glimmer of hope keeps me coming back for more games, and wins are always satisfying. The overwhelming nature of every card adding perils makes this one of my favorite thematic games, even if the theme is inherently sad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Simple coop game with high difficulty and great thematic elevation, even with 3 players. Must be played "in the spirit" of the game, so for people who don't like staying silent about their hand it's a definite no-go. But, just like Hanabi, even though you aren't supposed to speak directly about cards in hands, there is still a lot of table-talk and planning. Love the leaders, the speeches, the tension, and the hard knocks with text that affects every single loophole in the game. 

I like trying to deduce what cards other players "aren't playing" and using Speeches strategically. I don't like that the game can get locked into a death spiral or that you can "know you can't win" and have to concede. It's also very very swingy depending on card draws. We won out first game, and LOOOOOSSSSTTT the next. And it is basically unwinnable in many cases if a player happens to randomly draw a ton of hard knocks. Support tiles are super integral to success, but they are, sadly, the least fun aspect. Luckily, it plays fast, so you tend to play twice in a row every time.

The Grizzled is a quick co-op game set in World War I. There are two piles of cards. One pile (the peace pile) you want to deplete as that is the way you win the game. The other pile (the war memorial pile) you don't want to deplete as that's a way to lose the game.

Every turn the new start player says how many cards each player will draw from the peace pile. Then players take turns either playing a card, withdrawing, using a special "charm" ability or giving a speech. Playing a card either means putting one of the cards from your hand into the common tableau or in front of you (if it's a "hard knocks" card). The cards in the common tableau will have a type of weather/condition (like snow, rain and night) and an object (like bullets, gas masks and whistles). If you ever have three of a type out, you fail the mission (which has some penalties). Some of the cards have nasty stuff on them, like multiple items, multiple conditions, or "draw and play a random card from the peace pile". The hard knocks cards go in front of the player playing them and have some detrimental effect on the game. If a player ever gets 4 hard knocks cards, you lose the game.

The charm ability, which you can use once per game, lets you dispose of a card from the common tableau if it matches you special criteria (like being snow, for example). Giving a speech lets all other players discard a card from their hand if they have the type you call out. Withdrawing means you no longer play cards, and you put a support token out, which will either go to the player to the left or right of you. If one player gets a majority of support, they can discard two hard knocks cards.

After everyone withdraws for a turn, you count the number of cards players have in hand and draw that many cards from the war memorial pile and add them to the peace pile. Additionally there may be hard knocks cards that cause extra cards to come out as well. The struggle in the game is that you want to pull more cards from the peace pile, but if you do that means you'll likely not be able to play all of them and will get more cards added to your peace pile.

I like the art of the game a lot. It reminds me of a sunday morning comic strip from when I was a kid more than anything else. The idea of the game is interesting, but the thing I don't like is that the game does what a lot of co-ops do to try and make the game a challenge. It just makes the game insanely hard and throws randomness in to try and trip you up. In our first game we almost immediately self-destructed, just because of bad card luck. You're only going to win this game if you get lucky and the cards come out in the right way. Sure, if you play badly you can make things worse, but even if you play perfectly, you're at the whim of fate. That doesn't make a good experience for me. I do like that it is essentially a co-op in a filler length... but I end up wanting to like this game more than I actually do.

About [thing=171668][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=171668][/thing] is a cooperative game set in the World War I, in which a group of friends fight together to survive the hardships - both personal and regarding the overall threats of war. 

Don't worry too much, though. [thing=171668][/thing] is mostly abstract, involving just card play, in a quick and intense game that lasts around 25 minutes. It can start talks about war and the men that fought it, but surely it doesn't contain nor represents the horrors of a war.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There are two decks of card: the Trials and the Morale. Cards from the Trials deck are given to players. Every complete round is a Mission. During a Mission the player can do, each turn, one of the following:
- Play a card;
- Withdraw and give support;
- Use a Lucky Charm;
- Give a Speech.

All cards, except the Christmas, are bad - either advancing the potential failure of the Mission, or giving player Hard Knocks, which are problems that the soldiers must deal with (like Hardheaded - you cannot withdraw while having 1 or more cards in hand).

Withdraw means the player no longer plays in that Mission, and the Support is a token with which the player chooses one other player to try to help get rid of Hard Knocks.

A Luck Charm makes one card from the No Man's Land (where Threats cards are played) be discarded, which increases the chances of the Mission being successful. The same is valid for the Speech, which only the Leader or former leaders have, and by using a Speech token, the player chooses a Threat and everyone (except the player giving the Speech) can discard from the hand one card that has that Threat. Speeches, once used, are removed from the game.

At the end of a Mission, either players won (by retreating safely or playing all the cards in their hands), which will give everyone that didn't already be able to give support to someone; or lose, which makes all the cards in the No Man's Land to be shuffled back into the Trials deck, and no one else, except those that withdraw before the end of the Mission, can give support.

Once the Mission is over, the support tokens are revealed. If one player was chosen to receive support more than anyone else, this player will be able to get rid of 2 Hard Knocks or recover their Good Luck Charm. If there is a tie in the support, no one gets it.

If the players, during the Mission, discared all their cards and the Peace card is showing (the Trials card deck is kept above it), the war is over, everyone is alive and players win!

If after the Mission, there are still Trials cards above the Peace card or someone has cards in hand, the play continues. The Moral drops (cards equal to the amount of cards in the hand of the players, or a minimum of 3), meaning that cards are taken from the Morale deck and passes to the Trials deck. The Leader token passes to the next player, and she decides which will be the intensity (how many cards will be from the Trials deck that round) of the Mission. A new Mission begins and play continues like this until players win, or the Monument card (bellow the Morale deck) shows up, which means that the players have lost. Players also lose if a soldier has 4 or more Hard Knocks after the Support phase.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which cards to play, considering the status of the Mission and the Hard Knocks your soldiers has already;
- When to use the Luck Charm;
- When to give a Speech (but not everyone will be able to make one);
- When to withdraw and to who give support.

Most of the time the last three decisions are more clear. Speeches are needed early in the Missions, when there are more cards in hand. Luck Charms, though most will be a once per game use, normally aren't worth to hold back, as its use won't increase in usefulness later.

Withdraw and play a card are trickier. With the card play the current status of the Mission says what you should or shouldn't play for Threat cards. If is a card that will cause de Mission to fail, you shouldn't; if the Threat won't trigger this,  you probably should. When the card is a Hard Knock is harder to evaluate, as the effect of them are continuous and can be really nasty, but holding them in the hand will cause the Morale to drop faster. Is a fine balance. But with good support, is possible to get rid of them, so they might be worth playing, even with their ill effects taking place, as they won't drop Morale and could be discarded - win, win.

Withdraw depends even heavier on game state and cards in the hand, so it is hard to say when to do it or don't. The simple is: if you can play a Threat, play it, instead of Withdrawing. If you can't, then Withdraw.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Marvelous art;
- Easy rules, making for a smooth gameplay;
- Very quick, with low downtime;
- Speeches are fun to give, especially if you require an actual little speech;
- Uncommon theme for cooperative games.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Not much actual cooperation during Missions, but Support can be key to win;
- No solo alternative out of the box;
- Luck of the draw can decice a game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In [thing=171668][/thing] you will be like in a war - not the WWI, though, but one against the game. You will want to play a card, but simply won't be able, and will need to withdraw. You might feel ashamed, for not being able to help more, but at least the cofee will be ready when everyone returns from the Mission. You might feel angry, that yet again, Charles made impossible for you to continue - he is like that since school.

[thing=171668][/thing] offers an unsual setting for the game do develop, and it is weird that is unsual, as cooperation in war time seems granted and everyone comprehends it immediately. Maybe is too "real" for some groups and households. Still, as I mentioned, [thing=171668][/thing] is mostly an abstract puzzled - there are no battles, do dead. A battle starting is a whistle card. Guns, explosives, firefight, are a shell card. Chemical attacks is a mask card. [thing=171668][/thing] isn't a simulation nor tries to make players feel in the proper war - this might be positive or negative to you, but it is what it is.

I wish there was more cooperation built in the gameplay, however, playing we did talked, complained and tried to work together a lot, which is nice.

In the end, [thing=171668][/thing] passed well in the test of taste: everyone in my group liked it and we ended up playing several times in a row, which I think will be usual for it, given its time frame and the ability of appearing to be close to a winning end, only for the Morale to drop, someone never being able to use all her cards and a defeat being unapologetic tossed in our faces. [thing=171668][/thing] goes well recommended.

1st impression: Intriguing little coop game. After two plays I'm not sure if there are depths I'm not getting my head around or whether the game is actually just simpler than I think it might be. Similar in many ways to Hanabi (each player has a hand of cards, the aim is for the group to play those cards in the correct sequence, but communication is limited) but a bit more random and therefore less analytical than Hanabi. This makes The Grizzled an inherently more fun game... except the theme firmly roots the experience in a dark, intense place. I could see a horror/cthulhu retheme of these mechanics doing well.

So-so co-op.  Some room for interesting decisions present here and there.  Can run rather long.

Support is massively important and can be pretty chaotic.  There can be some awkward dead time where some players are repeatedly doing almost nothing.  There's also some player count wonkiness (e.g. Support with 3 players is virtually guaranteed to give a benefit).

I'm probably  missing something with this game, after only one casual play.  Several people weren't into it, there was some light assisting and we won as a result.  I'm not sure what it is I could have missed, if the difficulty on the game is completely contingent on people not sharing information, then I wonder what the point of playing a co-op is? I'm not big on co-ops to begin with, but even more so the idea of a co-op where you can't coordinate seems really odd to me.  Aside from card-counting and taking slightly educated guesses, I'm not so sure what the strategy is.

RATING: 6
Not all that special as a game, but really wonderful and unique art makes this worth playing.  The game is so simple that it left me wondering "That's it?" after it was explained to me.  But it works.  The most unique thing about this game relative to other coops is that you feel very strongly about the other players.  You're spending a lot of time trying to figure out who to support, and looking at how you can set up the other players.  You're not spending so much time trying to beat a system, as just trying to get everybody through.  That feels a lot like World War I, despite the abstraction of the mechanics.  The dark and foreboding style of the art is wonderful, but it is leavened by a doodling line style that brings just enough lightheartedness to keep the game playable without being entirely depressing.  There's a grim humor about the whole game, which melds perfectly with WWI.

RATING: 7
The Grizzled is the most abstract war game I've ever played. Game play is sort of an anti-match three, as players work together to play as many cards as possible without playing any three of the same suit. This is complicated by the fact that most cards have two or three different suits on the same card. Instead of playing a suited card, players sometimes have the option of playing a trauma card, which allows them to dodge playing a regular card (that would likely create the dreaded three of a kind) but the price from doing that is some sort of effect that makes the rest of the game even harder.

If that was all there was to it, the game would be interesting for a minute or two, but largely forgettable. Of course, there is something more. The theme, 5 friends in a trench trying to survive the Great War is heart-wrenching. Turn after turn you go on missions, but whether they are a success or failure, nothing really changes in the narrative. When the game ends, you don't even know if your side has won the war. It just ends, and you have survived. It's almost a meaningless result.

Seriously. There is almost no way to finish this game smiling, win or lose. The art also does an incredible job of communicating the theme. The drawings are almost caricature, but the silliness makes the soldiers somewhat more endearing, increasing both your attachment to them as well as the sorrow you feel for their hardships.

Tragically, the artist for the game was Tignous, who was tragically murdered in the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in France...making the anti-war message of this game even more poignant.

This is a way overpriced game which tries to be thematic Hanabi, but theme is just in the illustrations and the limits of communication is just a sentence in the rules and don't feel organic. In Hanabi, it's not just that the rulebook says you can't communicate, you are actually deprived of information, and the whole game is about that. Here it's just not that elegant. The hard knock cards are the only thing that feel thematic. I like this game it's just not worth the price with so many other better ones out there. If it was the price of Hanabi, I might still have it.

You're probably going to lose the first few games of The Grizzled, it's a tough game. It's going to let you think you're doing well, getting very close to the end just before victory is snatched away from you. You'll grimace as you place the card with all six threats on it and hope your comrades can remove it or handle it without withdrawing early. You'll wince as you become mute, develop a phobia of whistles, and selfishly support yourself. You'll cheer when it's Christmas and one of your comrades gets just a little respite from the war. And you'll know defeat as the war memorial becomes visible at the end of that last round. Yet, you too might get to feel that surprise as you look around at your nearly dead friends with no cards in their hand while the dove of peace is visible and question this very tenuous win. It's a tough game, a fun game, and one worth trying.

I'm intrigued by this eccentric coop game. Set in the bowels of WWI trench war fare. The designers purposely wish to convey, in some small way, the horror and agony of close combat warfare but finding within its depths of despair true valantry, brotherhood, and heroics. Unique game objectives and interactive game systems take a few plays to figure out. Players take turns as the unit leader, there is an interesting set collection of bad things in your hand while managing the depletion of a survival stack, secret sharing (or hoarding) your supplies with your team, accumulating personal war traumas, and delivering a morale boosting speech that saves the day. I dig a hard, challenging coop that requires thoughtful teamwork, against the odds,  desperate for just a bit of luck. This is a heavy theme, but I appreciate that this game accomplishes this sense of teamwork while sharing a time that I, fortunately, have no experience of what it must have been like.

First play impressions:

Indeed, this is a brutal co-op and the artwork is just plain neat. Wife, once most rules were derived and grokked, loved the game.

I am not a fan of the rulebook.  For what is essentially an iteration-based microgame, the rulebook doesn't really cover all bases it should (will include examples if I ever go over this entry again).

Gameplay and feelings:

Brilliant game. The choices are grueling, quite on purpose. I can see a victory of this game to be very very satisfying.  Unsure if excellent strategic choices/well-hit mitigative choices will bring about a victorious outcome each time.  That will require many many more plays.

Of which.. I am down for.

Great looking game, that's strangely thematic for such a small package. I love cooperative games, and this one sure was fun. However, I had heard, over and over, about how hard the game is to defeat. We lost our first game, but then won the next one, moved up in difficulty and won even easier. This take a bit of the wind out of its sails to me, but give the small package I'm hanging on to it for sure.

Update: We played one facet incorrectly. We allowed the Speech-giver to also discard a Threat from their hand, which is incorrect. Only the recipients of the Speech are allowed to discard a card. This makes me much more excited to play this again. It also changes up the tactics of the Speeches quite a bit, as now you're likelier to select a Threat not in your hand. Interesting.

Simply amazing! Very hard to beat. Not quite a "fun" game, more a depressing game with the WW1 setting, but in a "good" way. To be clear: you will just win this game in 1 of 10 plays, but it's totally worth it. The success to survive the war with your friends is outstanding. The course and therefore the story of every play is always a little bit different and challenging. My personal secret tip. Even if the box is very small this game should be the main game for a gaming night, maybe it should be the only one played... Best played with 2-4 players.

This is a solid, quick co-op game with an interesting take on a depressing war theme.  Its intense figuring out how to get through each round and even trickier when the debility cards start piling up.  It is surprisingly relieving when you gain the most support and things start going better for you... surprising thematic in what could be a fairly dry card game if you approached it that way.  I don't think its going to replace Hanabi as my co-op filler of choice... but having an actual winnable/losable game and no memory element might actually make this more accessible for some new players.

A fun little, quick co op game. It's very hard. I love the artwork.

This is a VERY difficult game. Played about five times now, and have not won a single one, though I feel we got close in a few. So difficult but so interesting at the same time, and with such beautiful art, how could I not love it? Brilliant design, and I am psyched for the expansion!

One of my favourite. Beautiful, original, hard to win. And you do feel like those brave people...

Incredibly thematic for such a small game. Very difficult to win, which considering the fact that its about the horrors of war and the toll it takes on people makes sense, but it doesn't make me want to play it a ton. I really want to give this a higher rating. Artwork is top notch.

The theme matches the gameplay perfectly and really comes through. We have lost so many games and only won once.

Make sure you read the rules carefully. We played it many times incorrectly.

Currently my favourite co-op because every decision is tough and it plays so quickly and smoothly. I think the theme really comes through as well, both in terms of the comaraderie with your teammates as well as the hardships of war. I need more plays at 2P to see if it stays at this level though.

Hard! And emotionally stressful with the theme. But good!

Splendid co-op. The "no communicating" thing is done perfectly, fits the theme and mechanism of the game.

A real fun game, very hard to master, frustrating at times, but still glad to take a seat when it's being setup on the table!

Like Nuclear War, you need a big group of the right people.  The added features (MX missle, space platforms, sabateurs, spies, etc) add a lot to the gameplay.  My all-time favorite card is the propoganda card that says, "Your president gives another boring speech.  10 M (?) people leave the country as a result." or something like that.

Don't play Nuclear War without it.  It adds Spies, Space Platforms, Killer Sats, MX Missiles and my favorite, the Cruise Missile.  I was in a ten player game in college where a guy forgot he launched one.  Everyone just kept passing it along each time his turn came up till it ended up making the complete circle and KA-BOOM!

RATING: 2
Distinctly underwhelmed. It has almost every aspect of Ameritrash that I hate. A play time that is much to long for the level of fun it offers, complete randomness and a theme that still reeks of Cold War sensationalisim.

Chances of getting me to play this again are somewhere between buckleys and none.

They say the root of humor is suppressed anxiety (fear).  I'm not sure that explains why so many people, myself included, find this a completely hilarious game.  Some people understandably can't deal with it, but it was a great favorite in college days, back in the Cold War.  I've seen this played by 50 people all in the same game.  Yeah!

Thoughts? - [/b]A not entirely necessary expansion to a classic "take that" card game.  Now consigned to history, but enjoyable at the time.  Added additional depth and complication but not necessarily fun.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]Now gathering dust.

Will trade with Nuclear Escalation. Cards have been played, but are in good condition. Original box was long gone when I got it and I have put it in nice plastic deck boxes (from Upper Deck) with custom color inserts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Silly but fun game with the right people.

The deck of cards is of good quality, but the included die is horrible (it's near impossible to read from more than 30cm away) and the population cards should just be tossed and replaced - they're a joke, and not a funny one at that.

Still a fun game once in a while.

Didn't think this was as balanced as Nuclear War.  There were too many Secret cards.  Adding this deck to the Nuclear War deck seemed to upset the balance of warhead/rockets.  I'd give it another try though.  As a "take that" game, it isn't that bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Adds some nice other options to the game, so things are less predictable.  Though the combination of an MX and a 100 MT warhead on the first turn can really ruin someone's day.

It is unlikely this game will ever get played after the fiasco of Nuclear War; so the rating is based on NO PLAYS and is in fact based on the game from which this is an expansion.  If you want to know what I thought about Nuclear War, see my comment there; that justifies my low rating here.

It's an expansion for the beer and pretzels game of Nuclear Warfare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This expansion adds a few new wrinkles to Nuclear War: The space platform allows the owner to make 2 attacks per turn, making wars slightly more lethal.  This is countered by the saboteur, which increases the chance of a failed attack.  I recommend playing with all expansions as they provide more options for mayham without greatly increasing the complexity of the game.

This was a staple of ours back in college. I've got some HYSTERICAL memories of this one, like the time Joe got confused and launched a Frenchman instead of a warhead. There's that ounce of strategy to make the game interesting, but mostly it's just a gleeful, no-holds-barred massacre.

This irreverent game was all the rage in my younger days.  Today, I no longer find it interesting.  It is basically a card game with odd scoring mechanisms (blowing up people...)  Hopefully someone with a greater interest in counter-culture games will take this from me.

A good add-on to Nuclear War. The new population deck is worth it in itself ... but if your playing with more than 3 you probably need an extra deck. Why didn't they give you more of these cards with the game? OK there are crappy paper population cards if you have a pair of scissors and like PNP's.

Awesomely comical game! I used to own the first one, "Nuclear War" but (stupidly!) sold it.  I feel this one is better than just an "expansion"; extremely playable as an independent game of its own.  However, this is the second printing (1990s?), so the die that comes with it isn't the original "glow in the dark" one :(  No matter tho! Very simple rules and lots of fun!

OK - There's no real strategy here, but this is good, chaotic, shoot 'em up fun! Expansion melds well with base game.

I think we always played Nuclear War with this expansion, after the first game or two. I can't remember what distinguishes the core game with the expansion, but I do remember it was well worth it.

Not my type of game. Very random and not fun for me.

More Nuke War, and there's nothing wrong with that!

Crazy fun. It brings to mind games like Munchkin, but this one has the courtesy to end before everyone gets bored. Looking forward to getting the Nuclear Proliferation expansion, which adds variable player powers.

Silly fun.  Probably overkill.  My copy is mixed in with other expansions and probably damaged.

Fun, but not exactly compulsive play. Expansions add more variety without any more actual interest.

This set added spies, and the die which you can roll for extra fallout damage, or nuclear malfunctions. Great fun. It just adds to the crazy nature of the basic game. Just combine all three sets, and the booster, and have at it!

So many fond memories of playing this long into the evening after long days of coding. Will always be a high rating simply courtesy of the memories and stupidly fun play. 

I really need to bring this out to my various gaming groups as they would definitely enjoy the sheer entertainment value of these games.

This is the same thing as Nuclear War. Trust me, it's the same game, just the cards are a bit different. play this standalone or as an expansion:

Random yet hilariously fun card game about a nuclear war. Players "program" their turns 2 turns in advance, placing a third card face down and turning up the topmost card. A launcher followed by a warhead the next turn will cause population loss for a neighbouring country. And the population is also random - cards drawn that vary from 1 million to 25 million inhabitants.

Don't even think about this game if you like game with tactics. This is just a random "take that!" game that's great fun if you know how to enjoy it.

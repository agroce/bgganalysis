I always wondered why the coffee shop at work had a copy of this on their game shelf... who would dare play this one at work and why would they want someone taking up several tables to try and play it. I should have asked for it when they changed managment and lost the games.

I have wanted this game for awhile and finally found it. This is just the game I have been looking for. It is rated medium high for solitare play, which is very important as it is not always easy to find an opponent for such games.

The first of a great series of games in the midst of the Cold War.  On the heels of the Gulf of Sidra conflict with LIbya, Victory Games delivered a variable and very well done game.  The tutorial and scenario expansion way of teaching was great.  the random events and variable set ups and allied possibilities always made for different games.  I played every scenario multiple times and loved it!  A excellent mix of gaming and simulation.

Best of this series. While times have changed and the historical premise is less appropriate, there is a lot of everything to do for the serious gamer. Air, subs, and surface. Good planning is essential and targets are close enough together where you can never be surer where the next strike will come from. The unpredictability of rounds i.e. subs/air/surface also adds to the tension and excitement.

Joe Balkoski is by far my favorite wargame designer.  His efforts are almost always innovative and unusually playable (given that they are complex wargames).  I especially love the whole "Fleet" series that he designed for Victory Games/AH.  Sixth Fleet is the first (I believe) and the simplest.  Probably the best one to start out with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The first of the fleet series!  While later additions made rule changes that made the game even better, this one flows nicely and covers one of the most strategic areas in the world.  The advanced game is very good with many options and replayability is high.

Strangely owned one of these when I was about 10. I remember seeing it at a thrift shop for a couple of bucks and picking it up. I could never fathom the rule book and I'm sure it was eventually garage saled for a buck or something like that. My first and quite possibly last encounter with more complex war games was pretty much a complete bust! :laugh:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The only reason this game didn't score higher is because I have the later versions. There were a number of things that were left out of this version that were later added that I felt should have been there in the first place - such as cruise missiles. But it was a good game, and probably would have scored an 8 or 9 at the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The first of the "Fleet" games I ever played and my favorite. Even though the system got refined over the years I enjoyed the area covered by this game the most. I have many fond memories of playing this back in high school. We always had to play with logistics and of course Nukes!

One of the more accessible Victory Game titles (along with NATO). Not simple, but the rules are well presented and the subject matter is one of my favorites. Pet peeve - can't be helped, but the search/spotting procedure is kind of artifical: it's not like you don't know where the enemy sub is, in fact, you have it completely surrounded - you just keep missing that detection die roll - well, this can't really be helped, but it a problem with any boardgame where both players have perfect knowledge of the locations of each other's pieces...

The Fleet series of games were one of my favorites back in the 80s, especially as I bought 6th Fleet around the time of the movie Top Gun. Played all the 5 Fleet games to the death until I started university in 1990. Today, I am just rediscovering this game again and have even bought "Asian Fleet" to boot after finding this game still have a following in Japan!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Most dated of the Fleet series, but still my favorite -- shifting political possibilities in the Mediterranean give this iteration more variety than others in the series. Works surprisingly well solitaire, thanks to the randomly determined air/surface/sub impulses.

Played the heck out of this game in the summer of 86 with my little brother. Took a lot of work to get through the rules but it was worth it. Some of the sheen has wore off this game due to the cold war being over.

RATING: 4
My first "wargame", and it saw extensive play back in the days. Some of the short scenarios can be finished in an hour or two and the rules are not very long (for a wargame). I guess I could be talked into it by some of the persons I played it with back then.

Update: Played this game for the first time in about 15 years, and I have to say it was quite fun. However, I'll still leave it with a 4 - "could be talked into it on occasion".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Outdated subject matter, but still a good game. Short scenarios playable in an hour, or monster ones playable in 30. Two very different sides, US = hunters, USSR = hunted, but they can bite back!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Everything Balkoski touches seems to turn to gold for me, this is a fantastic game at first contact. By asking the players to commit their air forces to strategic missions in secret at the start of the turn, the game generates a grand game of chicken that is very evocative of naval warfare narratives.

Just lowered my rating to a 3. I consider this a 'nightmare game'. A nightmare to set up, a nightmare if the table gets bumped, a nightmare if you haven't memorized the rules. I wouldn't be too disappointed if I never played this again. Classic example of why computer games were invented.

I would love this game, except for the complexity. The complexity has kept me from playing it but 1 time. I totally loved it. But, I will never get it to the table (not until I'm retired and can find someone else who is retired who equally enjoys naval warfare). This is all that keeps this one from being a 10 for me.

well written rule book - what looks like a long set of rules is actually quite playable.  excellent 5/8" counters, very functional map design that includes all of the necessary charts and counter holders to avoid reference cards or off-map counter holders.  great historical briefing.

actual play of this and other fleet games has not really lived up to expectations.  the capabilities and ratings of many units is questionable, and the outcome of the game is very luck-dependent.

The Fleet Series is a lot of fun as a simple challenge between two players, as NATO tries to impose their superiority over the WARSAW Pact.

Game  gives one a chance to play with all of the billion dollar toys our government has bought.  The Med theater gives the game a nice strategic frame work.

Played this game twice and really enjoy the naval simulation it entails.  The interaction of aircraft and surface forces feel right.  The subs are a little weak though.  The Med isn't their best environment anyway.  Maybe the best of the fleet because of the lack of chrome and the multiple of the patrol boats and Libya.

Much easier game system than it looks, a lot of the rules are for the campaign game. Short fairly interactive phases every turn make for very little player downtime.

RATING: 8
I was a big fan of this series back around my college days.  I'd be up for a game even now (although my feeling is that 6th Fleet is biased in favor of the Pact, and 2nd Fleet in favor of NATO, primarily due to the different missile range on the Tu-16 Badger bombers.

RATING: N/A
The first game on Joe Bolkoski&#039;s modern fleet series, portraying the naval and air combat in the Persian Gulf.  Since the game was released, there were 2 wars on Iraq already and Saddam regime was now down.  What a difference the world is now since then.  The game introduces many modern military doctrines and concepts like Combat Air Partorl (CAP), area sea search, aircraft readiness, the strengthened role of aircraft carriers as distinguished from battleship, destroyers and submarines, and the joint operation between navy and air forces. Combined arms concept move from between different land forces (tank &amp; infantry &amp; artillery) to air and naval forces (bomber &amp; fighter &amp; battleship).  A much more effective regional war effort is amplified by the modern war machine capabilities.

I was never fond of SPI games because they tended to be too technical to me... Anyway, when Avalon Hill merged with Victory Games, I ended up buying this one because it was naval, modern and set in the Mediterranean Sea... When I opened the box I was dismayed by the soft mapboard! A few moments later I opened the rules book... only to get completely devastated again by the mindless complexity. It still is as good as new!

I was a late convert to the "Fleet" series (about 20 years late!), but now wish I hadn't waited so long.  The level of complexity is just right for the subject matter, the game moves along quickly, and the replay value is good.   Highly recommended.

I really like these Fleet games, though I have only scratched the surface - having only played two of the basic scenarios.  There are some great scenarios in Sixth Fleet.

I was stationed on the USS Puget Sound during the early '80s, this ship served as the 6th Fleet flag ship, so getting this game for me would be a wonderful nostalgic trip down memory lane, especially since I would recognize and be familiar with all the ships in the game, the Puget Sound was an auxiliary Destroyer Tender, therefore we repaired and maintained most of the 6th fleet ships.

This was one of my top games back then. The whole system is very interesting even with the unusual approach to naval war, as it mixed the strategic scale of the map with the tactical details in the rules.

Great naval wargame about modern warfare within an operative-strategic scope.

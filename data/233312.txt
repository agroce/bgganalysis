RATING: 9
Excellent game, suitable for both adults and younger kids.  I played with mine (Age 6) in the group for the inaugural game and he didn't need much guidance  in regards towards the general mechanics of the game.    Variability and story progression elements add to the replay value, as does the inherent randomness of the lost cards and the large amount of items available to change it up.   

I knocked a point off though due how information is indexed inconsistently.   Some things are beautifully indexed, and flow from one item to the other, while others do not.   2nd Edition should shore up this by perhaps adding a quick reference link (Or pg number, to look up terms when they first appear, similar to the provided QR codes)   Good example is "First Surge"/Surge mechanic which first appears on Pg 7, but took some digging in the glossary for us to figure out what it meant... (We didn't seem to see a mention of it in the rule book?) A quick link reference link would have saved/shaved some idle time for the group =)

Otherwise, a great game for the collection, it's light enough for the kids, enough depth for the adults.   The 'series' nature of the game allows groups to tailor fit the sessions and encourages the 'just one more' map aspect that makes it addictive.    Characters are very personable, and will cause the kids and kids within to soften up and invest in both the story and the build up.   Finally, the game seems geared for the ability to add or subtract legacy elements depending on the groups play style.

Thank you Plaid hat and Jerry for the the well designed and delightful game that caters to both adults and kids; eg A good entry game into tactical story telling!

Bought to play with my 10-year-old son, but he wasn't into it at all. A beautifully produced game which I think would be perfect to play with younger kids. But for us, there was far too much story and not enough game. Sold locally.

I enjoy stuffed Fables.  Each separate board feels different, which is really fun.  As such, the game feels less repetitive than Mice and Mystics, since not every board deals with battle.  The story is also quite well written.  

One of the heros, Stitch, does look quite creepy, and some of the minions are a bit scary looking.  That said, I do not think that the game should scare children unless a parent really plays up scary moments in the game play.  

Tom Vassel did note that the game really should be played with kids.  I played it with adults, and we still enjoyed it.  The game is quite fun for all.

It plays faster than you may think and its score is hurt by its lack of re-play ability, but there is a ton of material to go through before you get to that point.  Great family game!  We play with our 7 and 9 year old and it pulls them in every time.

Had the chance to play to Stuffed Fables at Gen Con and we had a great time. I have not played Mice and Mystics, which is from the same designer, but we had a blast with our little animated toys. Stuffed Fables definitely looked gorgeous on the table: the artwork and minis are very well made and the theme is perfect for families. The game is bit too luck-based with all the dice rolls and the types of dice you pull out of the bag but otherwise the gameplay and story are solid. Definitely a game I could see playing with my daughter when she's a little bit older.

Very difficult to rate this one. Playing with my son is great - he probably rates it a 10 or something. I have fun playing it with him. High quality components and art and story. But the gameplay is extremely basic. This is not a game I would play with a group of adults, or even just one other adult because of that, and the sheer amount of out-loud reading of a children's story that must be done.

Truly great game... I loved every minute of it! It is simple to understand and play, but the story and the way it tells that story is very innovative and intuitive. 

My suggestion to anyone new to it, is if you aren’t sure what you should do next, just keep playing and exploring and something will happen!

We are playing this as 2 player with either 1 or 2 Stuffies each.
Absolutely love this so far, charming, engaging and immersive. Love the whole storybook concept which really works for a game that is set up like a childrens' story about a young girl's toys. 
Fairly straight forward rules and a pretty good manual help to keep the pace good... This may be the game that I hoped Gloomhaven would be, but (for us) was not.

What a gem for families! I cannot say enough good things about this game. It asks your children to read, at a high vocabulary at that (opportunity to learn) an engrossing story that is very understandable and enjoyable for both kids and adults alike. The gameplay is fun, challenging and cooperative making for a positive experience for everyone. Importantly, the game is good for gamers who enjoy 'high level' games as well with the mechanics being somewhat (albeit basic) similar to table top mini games out there. This is a must try/buy for me - very happy to own it.

While the game is rated for age 7+, I've been playing it with 3 and 4 year olds. The theme is spooky - I reassure the kids that "we're brave, kind and strong! We'll protect the little girl and win!" I also simplified things. We haven't used any of the characters' special abilities or condition cards. I've told the kids they can spend their hearts on re-rolls, or to trade a dice back into the bag or discard pile. I've also told them they can suggest other uses for their hearts. We've only been playing it a few days, but they love it, request it often, and don't want to stop. They've also been incorporating the 'Stuffed Fables' world into their own play - creating their own stories while painting at the easel, and playing make-believe. Check out the plaid hat webpage for the coloring book - it adds two new playable characters, and blank character cards kids can use to invent their own characters.

Honestly, if you have kids and the gameplay sounds remotely interesting to you, grab a copy of this game.  What a fun way to spend time together.  Easily one of the best "kid" games I've played.  In the future, I can imagine tons of kids looking back at this game with nostalgia.   

Could someone make a small map skirmish game in a book for adults, please!  I absolutely love that about this game.  Just turn the page - new map and a list of rules that pertain to it.  Combine it with something like Summoner Wars where you have a pre-built group of units with different abilities.  Or we could draft our units and then hand pick from a deck the weapons/items we want to equip them with.  I'd give you so much money, Plaid Hat! 

These are just quick impressions based on 2 playthroughs of story 1:
-Love how each map is built into a book.  Makes it quick and painless to set up, which is obviously a huge benefit when playing with kids.
-Gameplay is extremely straightforward.  I was able to set up the first map and walk my 6 year old through his first turn without having to explain very much before we began.  He was able to grasp it immediately.
-You could really see the gears turning in his head and he was excited to talk about what we should be planning to do on each map.
-After just a couple of turns, my son asked if we could play this game with his friends the next time they are over.  He loves games, but has never asked to include his friends before.  
-Charming, charming, charming.  Beautiful art with an interesting story (so far).
-I'm excited to play it more.  While it is very simple mechanically and appears to have fairly light decision making, there's just been something magical about playing it so far.  Ridiculously charming as I said above.

Due to the length of the stories (spent about 75-90 mins on the first story), we may only be able to play this one on weekends.  So, it'll take a couple of months to get through the full game if we manage only one game/weekend.  Not sure it'll be highly replayable - I could see us playing through the story a couple of times.  I tend to get rid of games once I'm "done" with them, but I think I'll be hanging on to this one.  Hopefully, there will be some expansions in the future.

Do I think this is appropriate as an adults only game?  Hard to say after only 1 story.  I'm assuming it was a little easier and straightforward than the rest of the stories.  If all stories are going to take 90+ minutes, then this might be too light for regular rotation in a game group.  I prefer tougher decision making if a game is going to run at least 90 minutes.  With the current decisions being made, it would be an ideal 45 minute game for me, for repeat plays at least.  So far, if you want a light story game with a little bit of combat, I'd recommend at least giving it a playthrough.  Not sure it's one that will see a lot of repeated play with adults.  

If you want a challenge, this likely won't be the game for you.  This feels like what I would call an 'experience' game, where you kind of just go along with what the game throws at you and enjoy it for what it is.  In the end, your decisions aren't going to make a huge impact on the game.

Update after playing through the first 2 stories:
I was hoping for a bit more combat, even if the combat is a bit simplistic.  Very much a story heavy game, which is great for kids.  Will definitely hurt long term replay-ability.

Scenarios/chapters are short but you feel like your character came out of it changed. Progression system feels good because scenarios are so short. It also delivers on the fantasy promise... most games have very dry scenario/story design... this delivers on high fantasy and that is the best thing about it.

My only gripe so far is that early on its easy to draw a bunch of dice that don’t allow you do do anything interesting. This may get better with later character and story progression.

Really fun game. Definitely seems to have taken Mice and Mystics, and smoothed out the rough spots. Also seems like it took some inspiration from Near and Far with the book serving as the boards. Prefer this far more than tiles needing to be assembled. Gameplay is very basic, but I almost prefer that in my tactical miniatures/dungeon crawl games. Plus there's a ton in this box. Only downside for me is that the monster variety really isn't there.

An excellent family game, my daughter (10) thoroughly enjoyed it.   We did have some confusion over certain aspects of the game, but this is the first story game that we have all played.  
It is beautifully designed and very well built.  Quality card stock, printing, and miniatures.  Well worth the price from a craftsmanship standpoint.
I think there is enough randomization to offer some re-playibility, but that will be limited as the story line will be constant every time it is played.

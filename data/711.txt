RATING: 7
Overly long but the board is beautiful and it's one of my earlier euros, purchased in 1992 when you weren't quite sure what you'd bought until you got back home and opened it up. How things have changed in just 15 years.

Very nice game graphically, but too complex for the depth it has. From my previous 'board game era'. I got a 'Limited Edition' box, #715. Played maybe five or six times

I love some parts of it, and dislike others. I think some combination of Elfenland and Elfenroads makes for a fantastic game. As is, the original is overlong and needs the addition of future rules.

RATING: 7
Elfenroads is a clever balancing act between three interlinked resources; cards, money and transport chits. A surfeit of one will do you no good if you lack the others. Elfenroads is also a race to visit as many villages as possible in the game's eight rounds.  

Elfenroads is also an auction game, in which those essential transport chits are bid for.  While I enjoy auctions in games, the shear quantity of them (three per player per round) really adds to the game length.  I think I'll never play with the full five players again.  Nonetheless, there is real fun to be had when that big route comes off, when you manage to exploit the network another player has built, and when you manage to stymie an opponent with a well-placed chit.

The Doris Matthaus artwork is rather gorgeous.  Production quality is very good all round, with the giant wooden dragon first player marker deserving a special mention.  The rules are pretty good.

Almost the same as, but far more tedious than, Elfenland.

RATING: 7
This used to be my favourite game, but it has not aged well.  The logs and other blocking opportunities make the play much to direct to be enjoyable, and the luck element of card and tile draws is not inconsiderable.  Dated and does not compare well with many later releases.

RATING: 7
a wonderful game to learn about graphs, di-graphs, and plotting paths around graphs.  You learn this, of course, without knowing you are learning ;)  WONDERFUL graphics and excellent mechanics.  Would be a 10, but there are a few flaws in the game itself.  (that are discussed in errata...)

I enjoyed this for a while, but eventually decided it was too long and worth too much money to keep. I've got Elfenland and I never play it, either.

I well remember being enchanted by Elfenroads - quite unique in my experience at the time.  The possibility of serendipitous tile lays by others opens the way to opportunistic piggy-backing in a quite wonderful way - rare is the game where a player don't have at least one rocket-fuelled move - and what a buzz that gives you.  Of course, the game also leaves open the possibility of using your tile lays to right royally screw up others moves.  Great stuff.  Few games where flexibility is as important.  The autcion takes time but makes this a real gamers game - much more so than Elfenland (though the half hand-out / half auction variant is probably the best compromise).

RATING: 4
One of the most overrated games. Interesting ideas, but excessive length leads to crushing boredom. Elfenland + Elfengold is not without issues, but it&#039;s more moderate length is a big improvement. In fairness, may have seemed brilliant to Americans circa 1992, but today hardly worthy of mention.

RATING: 7.5
One of my all-time favorites, though a little long with too many players.  I think it's VASTLY superior to Elfenland (though I haven't played Elfenland with the Elfengold "expansion").  Alan Moon's best game by far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really a quite brilliant game for 1992.  Players must juggle cards, chits, money and then solve a route puzzle to visit as many cities as possible in 8 turns.  Backed up by some Doris Matthaus artwork that is simply stunning.  Alas, this game is very hard to find now, ten years on.

Very interesting expansion but the game just takes too much. Number of auctions is equal 2xplayers and with 6 players we played 3 hours. 3 good hours, but it's too long anyway.

In a world where I get to play against people who think like I do, this game would be awesome.  In this world, where people take forever to play this game, this game is less awesome.  I love the idea and mechanics, I just hate waiting for everybody to make their decisions.  If I had a solid computer version of this, I would play it a ton.

RATING: 5.5
Was allocated to play this game one night. It is a card drafting and auction game. You are moving around the map using the various methods, I.E. dragons, unicorns, Troll carts etc. Trying to visit as many cities as possible. It is not exactly pick up and delivery but you are moving around and it feels like you need to get the cards. I got screwed over a few times in this game, so there is potential for some take that moments in this game. That is why I don't think I have to play it again. It is too long for what it offers me. When I could play Caverna in the same time frame I would much rather do that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I prefer Elfenland, where you are less likely to become stuck because of lack of matching card/tile combinations. In addition, the auctions take up too much time, taking the focus away from the travel, which should be the "main course" in my opinion.

I've played this and remember that it is somewhat different from Elfenland because of the need to bid for tiles with gold. I suspect I would prefer this version, but it was so long ago I can't be sure.

I bought this in hopes of interesting the family, but they don't like it any better than I do. I wish I could give a cogent reason for disliking it, but I find myself unable to do so. The description sounds fine to me, and the game works as described, but I have no fun when I play it.

RATING: 3
Hard to rate after 2 plays, I'd say the game is broken. The role of money doesn't make much sense.  After all the chips are auctioned off, the money is only good for a tie breaker.  To me it seemed silly to ever take money, almost every chip that gets played either hurts or helps everyone equally, making money far less important that cards. Again like TTR, the deck was exausted prior to anyone moving a pawn. Ranking this high is insane, if this game were mainstream, I'd guess it would rate much much lower.

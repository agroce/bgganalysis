This is supposed to be a lighter, real-time version of Dixit. I think it totally fails in most aspects. The major problem is the cards. They are so simple, poorly designed and unimaginative while the cards from the original Dixit were suberb, full of little details and emotions. 
The rules are easy and the game is fast to set-up and play. Better stay away from this and stick to original Dixit. If something works dont try to fix it...

It's somehow a bit similar to Dixit, but not really Dixit.  Using a similar mechanics of making a comment about a strange drawing (with a totally different style in this case), and the rest of players trying to guess which was the referred drawing, but speed matters.
Not my style, but a nice game.

meh, it wasn't bad.  In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  But the speed can take away a lot of the creativity, and the abstract cards take out a lot of the wonder and imagination found in the main game of dixit.  It's just an inferior little brother who took on a lot of the genes of the mailman.

UPDATE: Played this against my 14 year old and her friend. I gotta say, it becomes more challenging and fun against older kids. My daughter's friend slaughtered us. She was much faster at getting her finger on the card than I was. Fun game. Worth having around.

OLD: Fun, but not a game I would play with anyone but my younger kids.

However a moderately enjoyable diversion, Dixit Jinx doesn’t even come close to give the same fun and pleasure as the regular Dixit does: moreover, the images of both games - Dixit’s core - aren’t even remotely comparable, as the ones in this edition are little more than mere sketches rather than beautifully and inspiring drawings.

All in all, Jinx feels like a whole different game than Dixit but this doens’t mean it isn’t any better than the latter.

Del 19/10/2012:
Me llegó por "el juego que rula". Es un juego familiar o party, muy muy muy parecido al dixit. Tanto que mosquea.. básicamente lo que ha cambiado es el sistema de votos.

Las partidas son cortitas y puede ser un juego entretenido. Apto para no jugones. No solo apto, sino incluso quizás recomendable. 

No es mi estilo de juego, pero jugaría gustoso una partida.

Del 15/03/2013:
Juego familar de adivinar qué imagen de entre nueve posibles se corresponde con la palabra que dice el jugador activo. Pero ojo, uno no puede ser muy explícito, porque si aciertan todos, pierdes puntos. Si no la acierta nadie, tampoco. 

Es un calco del Dixit, pero con unos dibujos más abstractos que tienen posibles interpretaciones.

A Este juego le tengo especial cariño, porque llegó a mi colección por haber colaborado en una iniciativa que surgió en la BSK: "el juego que rula". Lo probé allá por Sept de 2012. Al final se sorteó entre todos los que lo probaron por la geografía española y me tocó a mí. Tiene firmas y valoraciones de unos 12 o 13 jugones de toda españa. Es una copia única.

Le tenía especial cariño, pero no lo jugaba absolutamente nunca y no veía posibilidades de hacerlo, así que en junio de 2015 lo vendí a Galarth de la BSK, junto al quarto!, con entrega en mano en las clbsk a cargo de yamakasi (yo no fui). Ambos juntos por 13€. snif.

Dixit Jinx takes regular ole Dixit and adds a speed element to it, as players are trying to choose the correct card as quickly as possible from the set of 9 cards presented.

The first to put their finger on the right card wins the card, and the clue-giver gets any cards that were incorrectly chosen by other players.

Overall, the main thing I love about Dixit Jinx is the great pop art!  I bought an extra copy just to frame up some cards to hang in the game room!

Una vuelta de tuerca al dixit original con una forma de votación y de puntuar menos farragosa. Ademas impide la situación que se podía dar en el dixit original en la que dos de los jugadores conocían algo ellos solo y lo empleaban para puntuar.

RATING: 4.5
Dixit Jinx takes the leasurely pace and beautiful art of dixit and replaces it with a speed element and more abstract artwork. While the cards are beautiful in their own way, they lack some of the ambiguity of the original. The speed element is what breaks the game for me though. There's hardly any cleverness involved in giving hints and there's no sanctioning of wrong answers. Prefer original Dixit by miles.

Average game if playing by rules. 
We modified House rules: playing this as portable Mysterium, using cards as clues instead of verbal clues. Active player gets a hand of 5 cards, pulls the arrow for guessing the card on the 9x9 grid. On "easy" you can use 3 cards from your hand over 3 turns as clues. On normal you get 2 turns and 2 clues.

RATING: 5
Essentially a party version of Dixit, if that's possible.  Players race to place their finger on their guesstimated card, based on a clue provided by the caller.  The cards are in a 9x9 grid, and if two fingers hit the same card at the same time, first to call "jinx" evicts the other finger who must find a new card.  Fun, but felt a bit broken - we may well have had the rules incorrect.  The real question is, why not just play Dixit, or even better, Apples To Apples?

RATING: 4
A fun twist on standard Dixit, except instead of the dreamy art that makes Dixit so great, you are given strange, and seemingly boring images. But, don't let them fool you; the joy of this game lays within these weird cards because each player will interpret the cards differently based on their position around the table, and resulting perspective. This creates fun moments where people say things like, "Brush? How is that a brush? Its definitely a candlestick," and only after turning the card on its side does the player realize, "Oh...that's definitely a brush." Standard Dixit is better, but this is fun for a rapid filler.

RATING: 4
Not as good as the original, mostly because of two reasons. The first is the real-time aspect, but that is of course an entirely subjective dislike of mine so your view might differ. The second is the cards. Dixit lives through its illustrations, because they are unspecific, imaginative, contain lots of little details you can hook your associations into. The cards in Jinx, by comparisons, are simple, much less evocative, and far too representational. They depict objects rather than ideas or stories, and the game suffers from it.

--
Finally got around to play it today - not a bad game, I'd probably pick it over base Dixit (which I don't care for at all). Mechanics are streamlined and scoring isn't a pain, however the gameplay is all over the place - any "fun" to be had by the game is dependent on how good the clue-giver is on their turn; if other players don't get their references/clues, it's just a frustrating and boring ordeal (same as original Dixit), but thankfully this only lasts 15 or so minutes, not an hour.

I'm not sure if I can say that I prefer this version to regular Dixit wholeheartedly. There's something more elegant in its simplicity here, but the artwork (though great in its own way) doesn't evoke the same charm as its big brother. I suppose it's worth having both in my collection, though I could live without either them.

I've never played regular Dixit, so I can't compare, but the clue and guess formula is pretty fun, however the scoring seems to be slightly broken as you can game the system to diminish the leader, also it seems to go just a little bit longer than I really want in this type of game. I'd like to play it at least one more time before assigning it a rating. 

--After further plays I find this game a decent filler or something to play with groups that aren't gamers. Not my favorite though. Decent enough to not want to poke my eye out with a stick.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (December 2012)

I was painfully disappointed by this game (I´m a huge Dixit fan). At first it seemed like a good Dixit variant, however it fails to excite me for 2 reasons.

1. It matters when a player has his finger closer to the correct card. In other words sitting matters.
2. In a 4 player game, when 2 players have failed to get the correct card, the third player won’t try to get the correct card as the active player would get 3 points. This is the game breaker for me.

Also the art differs a lot form the “classic” Dixit and that is also a minus for me.

It seemed like a good idea, but this is a version of Dixit I don’t want to play again nor I want to buy it. Just play the real thing.

Floja, muy floja "versión" del Dixit, que realmente de lo único que se asemeja es en la mecánica de tener que pensar una palabra-frase-gesto-canción-etc. relacionada con la carta.
Dibujos demasiado abstractos, con lo que a veces se hace casi imposible tener que decir algo que no tenga nada en común entre varias cartas, o simplemente decir algo que sugiera la carta elegida.

Someone says a word or phrase that describes one of tiles on the table. The others guess by pointing. If the guess is wrong you can collect the tile. A correct guess gives that person the tile and stops additional guessing. It offers some fun, but is a little too fast as a pointing race for my taste.

Playing this game requires creativity. However, it is a little bit different than Dixit. In this game you cannot choose the card to describe, on the other hand, before saying the clue you already know the cards which will be available for guess. This allows to tactically create a clue in a way, that first and second guesses would be wrong, but the third one correct. A game is involving and interesting, although the cards are quite abstract.

Kūrybingumo reikalaujantis žaidimas kiek kitoks, nei Dixit. Čia aptariamos kortelės pats išsirinkti negali, užtat prieš sakydamas užuominą iš karto žinai, iš kokių kortelių reikės rinktis. Tai suteikia taktinių galimybių, sukurti užuominą taip, kad iš pirmo ir antro karto niekas neatspėtų, bet iš trečio karto pataikytų. Žaidimas įtraukiantis ir įdomus, nepaisant pakankamai abstrakčių paveiksliukų.

Provat gracies a "Juego que rula", gran iniciativa de labsk.net

Siendo el Dixit uno de los juegos que mejor me funcionan con cualquier tipo de público las expectativas eran altas y buscaba algo en el jinx que lo hiciera diferente al Dixit y no perdiera diversión. Si el Jinx lo hubiera conseguido puede que me lo hubiera comprado (depende de la parienta), pero en general desilusionó a todos por algunos motivos.

La primera deferencia es que el cuentacuentos no elige la carta, sino que en su turno se le dice aleatoriamente cual de las nueve cartas le ha tocado, de la cual debe dar una pista. Esta improvisación obliga a ser rápido en idear la pista, por desgracia muy pocos tienen esa agilidad mental y los bloqueos son frecuentes. En el Dixit puedes tener la carta con la pista ya a punto para jugarla.

Otro de los grandes fallos que tiene el Jinx es el sistema de votación, el cual premia mucho al cuentacuentos si varios jugadores han fallado. Nosotros eramos 6, cuando 2 o 3 fallaban los demas fallaban aposta, la cantidad de puntos que gana el que da la pista cuando han fallado varios motiva esta conducta creando una situacion absurda. Este es el fallo mas grande del Jinx, un sistema de votación/puntos muy mal pensado.

Concluyendo, el Jinx es divertido, pero no esta a la altura del Dixit. Una mecánica similar y un sistema de votación/puntuación incorrecto hacen del Jinx un juego mediocre, sobretodo comparandolo con el Dixit.

Dixit Jinx is a spin on Dixit, which is a game that I thoroughly enjoy. In this game you have a 3x3 grid of abstract cards placed out, which all have different art. On a player's turn they draw a card that references a particular quadrant on the board and then tell a story about that card similar to Dixit. It is then a race for each player to pick the card they think the story teller is talking about. To me this takes two big things I like about Dixit and does away with them: the surreal art, the player's getting to pick and put in other cards. I could see playing the base Dixit game with this type of variant, but again I don't feel like Dixit plays that long to simplify it or shorten the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Maybe better for younger players but the speed/no turn order thing was a real turn off. 

the picture are so abstract that it was very random.

A good strategy seemed to be pick the most common colour/shape that you can see on your pic plus the other and just say that "Circle!", "Blue!"... Not very good for the 'game' but a sure fire way to decent points.

Can't imagine why you would pick this over full Dixit

Jinx es un party game muy divertido, en la linea de Dixit, pero lo suficientemente distinto como para desmarcarse de este y crear su propia rama dentro de la franquicia. En apenas un par de minutos podremos explicar las reglas de juego y comenzar a disfrutar. Es curioso como añade dinamismo al juego el hecho de seleccionar fisicamente con el dedo la carta elegida. Un detalle que juega a favor de la participación e iteración de los jugadores alrededor de la mesa. ¿Podrás jugar sentado? Nosotros no lo hemos conseguido.

Nice, graphic design more up to date than the original one. Then, too few cards, so you are quickly running through the whole stack.

First impression (6 players): Shares the same basic idea with Dixit "try to give a good clue but not too good". Unfortunately here the way game goes doesn't really make the best out of the idea. In Jinx after clue is given the players try as fast as possible point with their finger the right card (out of 9 total) that matches the clue. Because of this this and how abstract most of the cards are it doesn't really seem worthwile to use too much time for clues. The game might work differently with less players perhaps but with 6 at least it didn't work all that well.

One thing I also didn't like too much is the fact that you're forced to give a clue about a particular card on table without any choices. As a houserule i'd suggest taking a couple cards and use one of them or even not using cards but giving a free choice as that might increase a chance of a good hints. 

One thing in Dixit games has always been a big part of why it's fun are those excellent hints some people give. I don't feel you can give them in Jinx because of mechanics and much duller pictures on cards, which is a big shame.

The normally pensive Dixit reduced to a reaction game with abstract cards replacing the familiar fantasy theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice cross between Dixit and any number of quick-reaction type games. Put out 9 pictures, the clue-giver is assigned a card randomly, give a clue that's semi-vague, and watch the others race to claim the card that they hope matches the clue. Hope the first few get it wrong and the last one gets it right as you'll get the wrong cards as points. If the first claimer gets it right, you'll score nothing. If everyone gets it wrong, you'll lose a point. Continue refreshing the pictures and rotating the clue giver until the deck runs out, most points wins. The game provides the essential Dixit experience and wraps up in about 10-15 minutes, so it's nice filler material that gives a fun experience. But it's pretty random whether you'll be assigned a card that you can find a clue for (in a reasonable amount of time) which will have that right feeling of vagueness based on what other cards are out. Making the came more random than Dixit, as befitting it's quicker time-frame I guess. But I'm also worried about how much longevity the small deck will provide, even if the pictures are is double-sided. Anyway, happy to join in for the occasional ride while it lasts.

I really like this, its a faster smaller cheaper version of its big brother Dixit.

Gives the same game mechanics, simplifies scoring and has a great amount of artwork on the double sided cards.

One great thing about the size is that you can throw it into your bag without having to consider what you may have to leave behind like you would if deciding to bring the original Dixit.

Fairly light game.  Probably not as good as regular Dixit.  It's easy to lose because you're being too abstract, or not abstract enough.  This game will definitely play different depending on the crowd you're with.  Rules can be slightly modified so that very young kids can play and compete, such as my 5 year old son, who scored some points.  But otherwise, it's not too difficult for kids to pick up the concept.

Cheira a Dixit que se farta, contudo, é um jogo completamente diferente, não só na mecânica (um pouco Junglespeedesca), como no próprio design das cartas, que se revela um pouco mais futurista. Além de custar metade do preço e ser muito mais fácil de transportar, explicar e jogar, a jogabilidade é igualmente boa e possibilita enorme variedade de jogadas por as cartas terem desenhos dos dois lados. Jinx garante mais gargalhadas do que o seu antecessor, no entanto, não é tão jogo quanto Dixit, que é mais composto e, esse sim, um colosso!

This game kind of fell flat for us.  It sort of feels like Dixit but it doesn't have the entertainment factor that Dixit has.  The scoring is kind of strange as people start to try to not answer correctly on purpose. End up kind of random.   It was just okay for us.

Didn't get scoring quite right, since these rules from French publishers are always atrocious and ambiguous. Not sure I agree with this spin on Dixit though. The portability and faster, more party-like atmosphere are fine, but I don't dig the art in this one, and Dixit is more a cerebral, quiet game.

I love [thing=39856][/thing]. It's a brilliant design with brilliant art. This game takes some of the elements I love and put it in a game that I really didn't like. It's no longer about the creative use of tips, it's about being the fastest. And while I enjoy speed games, that is not what I'm looking for in Dixit, and I don't feel like this game does a good job of making a fun speed game. And they did away with the great artwork of the original game. No, this game seems like more of a quick cash grab.

Hard to say this is like Dixit but it is similar to a dexterity version of Dixit. It's fun but very much dependent on the group and participation. I can see this as being too many fingers and voices flying about which may be part of the appeal to some. For us though this game is only good for smaller groups in a party type setting.

Speed dixit, with simpler more iconic cards. In this game, 9 cards are dealt our, you are secretly assigned  one to clue on, and you collect any cards that people mistakenly guess before the correct one is guessed (temporal ordering matters). Lose a card if nobody guesses.

It's a lot simpler to explain the rules to this, and it's a fine lighter party game. Lacks the lovely art of grown-up Dixit.

The playtime is lies, it goes long, or perhaps we had far too many rounds of none-guessed or immediately-correct guessed.

Well, I most definitely think now that [thing=119407][/thing] exists to make regular [thing=39856][/thing] looks better.

I enjoy [thing=39856][/thing] every once in a while. It works well and is fun. I just got some fatigue with it after playing too much when it started showing around here. Luckly, my group thinks the same, so [thing=39856][/thing] hits the table only when we are together in big crowds, including lots of people that don't play boards often. It is always a good time, and remind us why to keep [thing=39856][/thing] in the collection.

Then I got to know [thing=119407][/thing]. Awful game. Simply put, the game works like this: 9 cards are put in a grid of 3 x 3. Then, the player whose turn is up, takes one of card of a 9 card deck that shows which card, of the 9 in the grid, she must give a clue about. The other players try to guess the card by putting a finger in the card they think is the correct one as fast as possible, as the first person to put the finger in the correct card, takes the card (every card is worth 1 point). If two or more players put the finger around the same moment, the first to say "Jinx" takes the card. Now, for the clue giver, she gets points for every card touched that wasn't the correct one, [b]before[/b] the correct one is touched. So, say I gave a clue, and as this is a race, two players touch different and wrong cards, then play continues, and the third player gets right. This player takes the card (gaining 1 point) and the clue giver takes 2 cards (for 2 points) wrongly taken as the correct one.

This description might make [thing=119407][/thing] seems like regular [thing=39856][/thing], only with more restrains and the racing/speed element added to it. But no. The cards in [thing=119407][/thing] are lame in comparison - abstracts and with few elements to work. Then the clue givers have two options: give a clue too obvious (bad) or give a clue with very little to do with the actual card. This may appear to be also bad, but it works darn well, specially when playing with 6. As with 6 players, even a random clue (having absolutely nothing to do with the actual card) still give the player a bigger than 50% chance (5 players guessing between 9 cards) that someone will put the finger in the right card.

Yes, there might be times when no one will get it right, but the risk is worth it. In regular [thing=39856][/thing], the clue giver doesn't want to be obvious, as he wants as few players as possible to get it [b]right[/b]. In [thing=119407][/thing] the clue giver wants as much people as possible guessing [b]wrong[/b]. This is a really important difference, as this shifts the spirit of the game from clever clues to semi-random ones. Add the speed element, and even with bad clues, no one will be thinking too hard about meanings, and will only want to put a finger as fast as possible in some card, considering 1/9th chance to be a good one.

Also, points for getting it right play a way too small fraction overall. In [thing=39856][/thing], if you get it right, you gain 3 points, the same amount as the clue giver. In [thing=119407][/thing], the correct player gains 1, and the clue giver can gain 2, 3 or 4. And remember - bad clues have a higher chance to give more points.

Anyway, I already talked too much about a shitty game. My warning is: if you love [thing=39856][/thing], don't go on thinking you might like [thing=119407][/thing], as it promises to be more portable and a faster option. These things it indeed is. But [thing=119407][/thing] also twists and breaks into little pieces the fun parts of [thing=39856][/thing] - the smarts clues and innuendos, and the feeling of satisfaction when someone just gets in tune with the clue. [thing=119407][/thing] is a luck fest of random guesses in which bad clues are the best option.

Will definitely avoid [thing=119407][/thing].

The three of us playing this game spent most of our play time debating what the rules actually say, and later, what the rules would have to [i]be[/i] in order for the game's incentives to work as in standard Dixit. (I rate standard Dixit a 4.)

The private hands of cards to offer for a given clue have been replaced with a public selection of cards and only one player can guess each card. The draft method provided here is "first to touch it."

Played with the (incorrect) english rules as written.  Game was too short.  Played with the corrected rules- game was too long.  So lets ignore the bad rules translation, and the length problem-  the game is CLOSE to being a good game.  It really seems like it needs a bit more tweaking to be enjoyable enough to play more, though.  

For instance, as soon as two players have guessed wrong, everyone else should PROBABLY intentionally guess wrong, to skunk the storyteller out of a point.  Otherwise they risk giving them a lead that's too large-  which is to say, in most games I think being a consistently good guesser is not as valuable as getting a lucky giant swath of cards for other people being bad guessers.  So essentially, every two or three rounds, you should end up trying to skunk the storyteller?  Uninteresting, and doesn't reward solid play (as in, i THINK you should WANT to guess correctly a greater majority of the time).  Also, the "Jinx" rule seems more awkward in implementation than entertaining, despite being the namesake.

This game is trying to fly on the success of the original Dixit title.  Unfortunately, it just isn't good.  There's hardly any incentive to give meaningful clues, and the cards do not have the great art that was in the original game.

I'm not a big fan of party games, but even when I compare this to other games in the same genre, it seems clear that it is one of the worst.  I'd bring out an old outdated 80's era party game before this.

Best with 5 or 6 players.
Best play many games in a row, so metagame appears. I mean, instead of giving a tip for a card, you end up giving a tip for a previous tip for a card. This way it gets great.
There's a card in black with some white strips. My tip was "wait till the light is green!" refering to a zebra crossing. Next time in appeared, another played said "Serengeti" (serengeti -> zebras -> zebra crossing). And so on.

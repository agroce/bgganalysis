found this buried with all our other games and seriously thought about tossing it.  My sons saw it in the Goodwill pile and told me it's worth keeping.  They both started recounting a few things from the game and what had happened so I guess it's worth holding onto at least for their sake... which is cool but the shelf space would have been nice too.

Rated as a kids game. I would've loved this version of Stratego as a boy, being able to play with all of the special powers. My older son and I enjoy playing this together. He's still getting the hang of remembering all the special powers. The only downside I see is having to set up all your guys. But one nice thing about the new stratego is there's not nearly as many guys as before. The smaller board is a good change.

The only reason this version of Stratego gets the extra half point is because of the abilities of the various units.  Alot more variety and theme.  Otherwise, the original Stratego has it all over the new versions.  Especially in the component quality.  These new unit pieces toad the wet sprocket.  MB is obviously marketing specifically to the young kids.  You actually have to affix stickers to the unit pieces.  But, I guess I did buy it mainly for my son, so who am I to complain??

RATING: 6
A classic that was reskinned with a cooler theme but one row less for each army. I would say that means streamlined but they added some weird impassable terrain on the board to spice it up. Not what I expected but the core gameplay is still there and still fun.

I'm surprised by how engaging this game can still be after all these years (since original Stratego, I mean). I think the special powers and re-theme work splendidly. My 5-year-old was hooked on his first play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Often known as [b]Stratego: Fire and Ice[/b], this is a good-re-implement of [gameid=1917].  It adds special powers to every piece that didn't have special abilities before.

If I want to add a a little variety to the classic game, this is a good game.

But I would prefer to play "classic" [gameid=1917] (not the "classic rules" from this edition), since it has a bigger board, more pieces, and is easier to play with with the "classic" pieces. I rate it lower than [gameid=1917]. 

If I want to add a little variety to [gameid=1917], I would try [gameid=484].

In stock (although this version hard to find)

Stratego: Revised Edition has two rules sets: those of Classic Stratego; and the main rule-set including special movement and attack rules---new for most of the pieces. All pieces' powers are printed in the rules and on the gameboard. The board is smaller (8 x 10 vs. 10 x 10), and there are fewer pieces (30 vs. 40) than in Stratego. This edition is set in a fantasy realm with pieces such as Dragons, Dwarves, and Elves replacing the traditional Napoleonic soldiers and theme of Classic Stratego. One player is the Fire (Red) Army from Volcandria, and the other player is the Ice (Blue) Army from Everwinter (hence, the game's nickname Stratego: Fire & Ice).

Stratego Legends Lite is a pretty accurate description. Like Legends all the pieces have special powers, but in this game each side has the exact same powers for the same units. Also this game has 25% less units than other versions of Stratego - only three rows of soldiers, not four. This is a game that really requires 2+ plays to get the hang of.

One of the games that got me interested in the hobby. It is a bit tedious and overly time consuming. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a gem game in the way that it is timeless and could take on different forms. This particular game is fanatstic. the ability to play the game the way it was intended is still there and the ability to turn it around and make the game more complex by playing the abilities that correspond with the different characters on your side. The game itself is simple enough to learn and play (roughly 5 minutes to  learn) but it does take a certain level of skill on your part to out-think your opponent to achieve victory repeatedly with the same adversary. The other bonus to this game is that it is as inexpensive as a game could be and can be found virtually anywhere (Wal-Mart).

Even a game as good as this has its downsides, however it is not really the games' fault but the ever rising tide of boredom that rises in every human being. Stratego is really one of those games that are really good at killing 4 hours but for me not much longer than that. In 4 hours, you would have extinguished all decent placements for your Flag, Traps, and characters before your opponent starts to get wise to your playstyle in all ways possible. It's a two player game which cuts out anyone else in the room unless playing the winner of the previous game.

The Bottom Line: This game is well worth the money and is a welcomes addition to any gamer's gaming closet. The only problem I face with it is finding those willing to challenge me. I've established myself as the house champion (That isn't that major of an award out of a tired wife, a High school girl, and a 4 year old) LOL!!!! But what really weirds me out is that this game hasn't made it to Xbox Live in a BATTLE CHESS or ARCHON format.

One of my wife's favorite 2-player games. I find it kind of "eh," but the fact that she will play it, and wants to play it, really bumps up the score for me. It's capture the flag, only you don't have any clue who you're fighting until you run into each other. Like I said, it's okay. My wife getting excited about it makes it awesome.

Plays about the same as I remember growing up, though the board is a little bit smaller.  The special powers aren't always even; a couple of them are very powerful with very few counters.  However, it's a decent addition to the game, and I find it to be a little more fun than the original.

Having only played the original version, I can't speak for the special powers and how they influence the play (probably a lot from what I could see and imagine).

Stiil, the original game from my childhood that I like the most. This isn't saying much as rating goes - there are just so many games a lot better this days, and I'm not a fan of competitive 2 players games. But, if I'm asked to play it, I will likely say yes.

It's clever, and I like to choose the position of the armies and it is fun to advance towards the semi-unkown.

Perfect-- for my family: kids toddler to young adult, it's the right duration, theme, depth, and fun for challenging each other.  The psychological element involves more quickly than that in chess.

We've enjoyed the traditional ruleset, but the newer"fantasy chess" powers constitute a very different game, like "Stratego: Slaughterhouse!  " compared with the careful calculation essential in the original.  And as you can read in threads there's some question whether the new rules are in fact broken.

The classicist will have difficulty with the naff character artwork.  (Not to mention their cheap typsetting, printing, state-of-the-industry paper-light hollow moulded  plastic pieces, and their thin ziplocks, graciously refered to in the rules as "storage bags.") But the theme is more fun and attractive  to kids than a traditional one.  And the board design-- notwistanding its *own* livid printing, horrid typesetting and  amatueurs- only crib layout-- strikes a really epic composition of blue  against red when it's all set up.

I think this is the only game I've had to lay on the floor for-- otherwise I can't see my pieces.  A look at the images of previous editions suggests this problem isn't special to this edition.  Is there a good reason not to design them with a descreet 15-degree cant to prevent sore necks?

Whenever anyone is taking too long I say "It's not Stratego, hurry up."  This game is over before it starts (almost) and you can spend forever setting it up and playing. new versions speed up play but are still slow.

This is a very good economic game .  This is really more similar to an advanced version of Acquire or Imperial than it is to any route completion/delivery train game I've played.  There is a lot of player interaction, trading, and deal making but ultimately, you just have to run your lines as best you can.  Great game, looking forward to the large publisher reprint.

Some streamlining WRT 18xx and some extra fiddliness also.  It's fiddly at times because when yr calculating railroad income you don't always want to maximise it - you want dividends to rise every round to ensure that the stock price continues to climb. Therefore you have to keep in mind yr current potential income, your expansion opportunities (i.e. potential for building into new hexes and buying new trains vs current company money and possible increases in such from selling more stock or ditching old trains) and potential changes to city income and yr maintenance costs as new trains are bought. There also appears to be room for driving down the share price in companies controlled by other players by buying then selling shares in those companies, although I haven't explored that much yet.

Familiar elements such as a stock trading round followed by two operating rounds and rising train levels lull you into thinking that B&O is an 18xx game with cubes.  The routes are much more abstracted than an 18xx, not only because cubes replace complex track tiles, but because the trains don't run routes so much as service a number of stations.  The net result is to focus the game clearly on stock trading and running the companies.  I like that.  

The stock trading is quite free wheeling, with the possibility of both selling and buying multiple shares in a single player turn.  Interestingly, share value only increases when you declare a higher dividend than last round, creating a real pressure to grow that network, buy better trains and move the game along.  All the same, B&O is not a short game.  Don't believe the two hours quoted on the Eagle box - budget for at least twice that.

After Queen's lavish upgrading of Wabash Cannonball, the artwork of Eagle's new edition of B&O can only rate a disappointment.  The box, share certificates and company charters are plain ugly.  At least everything is functional.

+ Add the 18xx genre to the typical cube Winsome game and you get this. There's not a lot of stock shenanigans allowed here, it's all about competing for the most valuable cities, while ensuring a very progressive growth. If you grow too fast, your company will eventually become stale and not very valuable. Grow slow and steady, that's the point here. That and keeping a nice portfolio of the game's cash cows.

- I do miss the shenanigans, though. And it's terribly long without some of the helpers available here.

Preliminary rating after one play with 3 people.  I like it and there's a chance that my rating will go up.  Our first play was 4+ hours and we didn't quite finish.  It has several nuances that you won't find in 18XX.  The trains at each level get progressively cheaper leading to a bit of a train stall.  Because of this it may not be a good idea to buy two cities at the same time.  Cities serviced don't need to be next the next ones on the line.  Unlike 18XX, things seemed to speed up towards the end.

Overall I'm pretty impressed with it, and am looking forward to more plays.

A cross between the typical Winsome train operation game and the stock market of 18XX, taking some of the best parts of both. Game flows well and doesn't take overly long (just over 3 hours with 4 newbs), but a computer aid is a must.

I'm not a great Railway Gamer, so approached with caution.  Was very pleasantly surprised.  Think the lack of rails helped and the relatively unrestricted connection options.  Almost four hours with four in first game .  Quite intense.  Lots of sticking up.  But enjoyed enough to order my own copy.  Played subsequently with own group, but some did not like the intensity and share sale trickery.  Minor issue was that it was illogical for company to receive dividend on unissued shares, but can see that it was required as a game mechanic.  Recommended with caution.

I've been able to get this to the table 6 times apposed with varying player counts. I've played 3-5. This is a great gateway into 18xx. Its all of the wonderful investing into and running good companies without hostile track lays and token lays. Some would disagree with me but I've gotten a few ppl started into 18xx with this particular title. I still enjoy playing it. The rule set is simple and the iconography on the board is excellent and helpful.

I'm very enthousiastic about my first play. I can't rate it higher than 8 because we had no time to finish the game. So I'm looking forward to play this game again. Of course this game has a lot in common with the 18XX series but it has enough changes to make it a complete new game. First of all the shares are much better introduced then in Rails of Europe, where you can ask why Wallace introduced the shares. Here, the shares are the heart of the game. Buying trains (capital equipment) is completely different from 18XX, because here it seems that slowplaying is better. But the biggest difference and maybe also the best change is the way routes are calculated. The system is simple and fast, which makes the game also fun in a later stadium.
I'm very curious for the eagle games version.

Raised my score to 9 the second time. Now we have completed the game and it isn't short. (6 hours). It plays fluent but still there's a lot to count. But it's possible to work out a fast counting system.

3rd play : used the faster counting system and reduced the game to 5 hours.

I'm so thankful that everything was calculated for me (thanks super computer program!) This game would be a train wreck without it.  I'm not a fan of Chicago Express, nor 18xx, so Baltimore & Ohio is not my kind of game.  I'd refuse to play this with more than 4.  

I'm probably in the minority here, but I like Baltimore & Ohio better than 18xx.  In my rather limited experience, I found 18xx to drag the last few rounds as presidents would repetitively run the same routes.

Initial impressions:

None of us "got" the game upon the first play, that much was obvious by the style of play, and the way the game developed.

I was surprised at this, as I expected us to pick this up with no problem.  But it was very difficult to begin!

I see some good potential in this game.  Although the time commitment could prove overly prohibitive in my current surroundings, I think the game will see some good play in the near future.  I expect the rating to rise sharply with further play, although we so obviously didn't "get" the game that 8.5 seems like a safe initial position against future disappointment.

It provides, if nothing else, disparate yet familiar mechanics that meld together quite well.

I'll be digesting this one in my sleep for sure.

I am looking forward to playing this one again!

6-21-09:

With three games under my belt, I am enjoying the game quite well.  The streamlined ORs are fantastic.  That the game plays much more like an 1829 game than an 1830 game threw me for a loop - I've played mostly 1830-styles, and was trying to approach this one as such at first.  

1829 thinking has sunk in; with it, my appreciation for the game has grown.  I believe I do not enjoy 1829-style as much as 1830; I wait with salivation at the next game of this type, which features 1830-style rules, because the cube-building change is fantastic in its streamlining effect (although I have a soft spot for hex-track building, still; while it takes longer, I enjoy it).

Perhaps a problem for me is that I enjoy building the hex-rails in 18XX, and that's a large part of building-up your railway in 1829, which is so simplified here that it is simply not present; without it, 1829-style isn't quite as enjoyable for me.

The game makes up for it in other ways, however; in the Lokomotive Werks-style mechanics, in the different stock-portfolio-building mechanics, in the profitable/unprofitable mechanics.  These changes all make the game one complete son-of-a-bitch, and improve the game immensely.

I'm keeping the rating around 8.5 for now, as I'm both neither less impressed nor more impressed after three plays than I was with one; the rating may well improve up to 9 or 9.5 with further play; it's probably not going to 10.  It's certainly not decreasing below 8.5.

I will almost assuredly be playing more games of this in the near future; I await them with anticipation.

I've still yet to see a company go unprofitable.  IT may be a huge "don't do this, or else" that just doesn't happen; we may be missing a very crucial playing-style that culminates in unprofitability.  I hope for the latter.

7-30-09:

People are still quite interested in this game, which is great; there is a local lack of development in our tactics/strategy, hopefully we will grow - I pointed out a fair number of things players could have done better, which would have given them better scores; hopefully it will become heeded next time, which should increase the interesting decisions and interactions in the game.  In anticipation, I upped from 9 to 9.5

Still no unprofitability.  Might have to do some solo work to figure out how to use/force it in a good situation.

A nice blend of 18XX and cube-rails (Chicago Express and Wabash Cannonball).  The stock price advancement scheme does a good job of keeping stocks from rising in value too quickly.  As with most 18XX-style games, my main complaint is the length of time required to play.

Chicago Express meets 1830. Interesting rail game that mixes mechanics from Chicago Express overlaid with elements from 1830 (train tech, stock market, portfolio management). Managing the relationship between personal cash and company treasuries gives this a 1830-like feel yet without the complexity of Private vs Public companies or the track building aspects. The computational elements almost need a moderator or spreadsheet approach to cut down on the time in the late game it takes to determine optimum revenues. While a trap for those inclined to AP, it is really not as bad as all that in my view once you get the hang of it - say on a par with Age of Steam in that regard.

An enjoyable experience that will scratch some of those 1830 Itches without the marathon time requirements. I'm impressed so far after just one play.

Played for the first time NYDay 2017.  Despite the BGG posts to the contrary, I found this to be very similar to 1830, without the track-laying issues and bankrupt-then-pass-the-trash-to-your-opponent nastiness.  LOOOOONNNNGGGGG game (first play took ~7 hours with 4 all-new players.  Definitely AP-prone game, too, but I would like to play again.  If this could be played in 3 hours, I could see it hitting the table somewhat frequently.

RATING: 6.5
An 18xx that 'dare not speak its name', though it seems to pan out at a similar length to 1830 - whose setting in terms of era, geography and railroad companies it also mimics. The length is mostly due to the very footery income/profitability calculations and the town income/technology increases, which I thought beforehand looked like interesting variations to the standard 18xx formula but afterwards am far from convinced are worth the time they take. The cube track laying, which simplifies and speeds up that aspect of the game works well and should really speed this up in comparison to a standard 18xx but any gains are lost by the rest of the game, which overall offers less interesting decisions than 18xx and seems overlong for what it offers.

RATING: 6
A few plays in. So first up, this is a clean and fairly streamlined game, nice board, decent components and simple rules.

It's a game about return on investment, about getting that little bit more value out of your dollars than the next player. How and why that happens leads to interesting guesswork and judgements over where to invest.

Where it falls a bit flat for me is the start. The private company auction at the start of 1830 creates a unique position for each player in each game, but here the featureless start offers copycat play and symmetrical positions.

Once those break down it plays well. I find the opening tiresome.

RATING: 2
18xx-style game, but simpler.  Stock market not as elaborate, rail system simplified, and the ability to affect the leader(s) (dumping stock, etc.) is constrained.  Still a lot of fiddly math, though, resulting in delays while players optimize their deliveries from turn to turn.

After a second play, this game's rating has dropped significantly for me:  just AWFUL.

RATING: 8
(As of 6-21-10, need to update after AWESOME second play.)

Rating of 7 is after only one play and not very meaningful as a consequence. My first play, I was completely unable to wrap my head around some of the more fundamental dynamics of the game. This may end up being what ultimately makes the game very interesting or what drives me away. Future plays will determine that. I could not have played more incorrectly. For whatever reason I had a monomaniacal focus on share value, not realizing (calculating?) that dividends were an equally important source of wealth. Who cares if your shares of 'your' company are in the can if that company is throwing off tons of cash every business round so you can invest in the companies other people are driving up (and either ride their coattails or drive the value down by selling)? There were also so many little 'races' in this game - like capital equipment purchases, getting to big cities, having turn order when you need it - that need to be juggled, I felt overwhelmed. But feeling overwhelmed by a game is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact it is quite good quite often. That said, I tend to prefer my games a bit shorter so that I can play them enough to learn from. Even if this one comes down to four hours, it might still be too long to be a real favorite.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/10587]Eddie Robbin[/url]'s Baltimore & Ohio is the latest member of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/31040]Historic Railroads System[/url] and is part of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/43385/item/964378]Winsome Games’ 2009 Essen Collection[/url].  It is a particularly trenchant perfect and certain information game all about timing, timing, and well, timing.   In broader character, Baltimore & Ohio is [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov]Rimsky Korsakov[/url]'s [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Bumblebee][i]Flight of the Bumble Bee[/i][/url]: full of little surges and races, layers upon layers of them, never relenting, always rushing, all of the races critical and requiring full attention and an endless delicate dedication to the dance.

Baltimore & Ohio has been described as the Historic Railroads System meets the [wikipage=18xx], and there's some truth to the claim.  Functionally it is clearly a member of the Historic railroads System with a hex-map, track abstracted to putting a cube in a hex on the map, companies with shares, company dividends a function of company cubes in cities, etc.  Architecturally Baltimore & Ohio is a child of [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/937]1825 Unit 1[/url] (and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/16000]1825 Unit 2[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/15999]1825 Unit 3[/url]) with a glaring focus on (1825-style) portfolio management and timing (owning the right shares at the right times) rather than [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/421]1830[/url]-style market manipulation.  Spiritually, and yes the parentage is this complex, Baltimore & Ohio is the direct descendant of [url=http://kanga.nu/~claw/blog/2008/05/15/game-observances/early-experience-lokomotive-werks/]Lokomotive Werks[/url][1] with all of that game's extra-ordinary attention to exacting cashflow, turn order, and timing -- just carried forward into a larger and less relenting game[2].  Of the three, Lokomotive Werks has the dominant genes, shortly followed by 1825.

The game itself consists of stock rounds alternating with a pair of operating rounds.  Initially 6 companies are available (B&O, B&M, C&O, NYC, NYNH&H & PRR).  Later in the game 4 more companies become available (Erie, IC, Nickel Plate & Wabash).  During stock rounds players acquire shares and manipulate the stock market.  During operating rounds companies operate and may generate dividends for their shareholders.  The game ends at the end of a set of operating rounds in which the highest level train is purchased (common), or when a share price reaches $375 (unlikely).  The winner is the player with the largest net worth (portfolio value plus cash).  There are few surprises here.

The rest of the model model is mostly familiar but does have surprises:

1. As has been long-suggested for many 18xx (perhaps most frequently by [url=http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/]Robert Jasiek[/url]) player turn order is ordered by ascending player cash at the start of stock rounds
2. The stock market is linear with par value ranges an increasing function of the largest train purchased by any company
  - Sold shares reduce share-value by one slot, no matter how many were sold
  - Share values increase only if the company pays a dividend that is larger than its dividend from the last operating round
  - Share values go down if the company has shares in the open market, or its dividend (paid or withheld) is less than it was in the last operating round
  - In all other cases, whether dividends paid or withheld, share values remain unchanged
3. On their turn a player may sell any number of shares from any number of companies, and then buy any number of shares (of one company)
  - Companies are incrementally capitalised as shares are bought
  - Each company has a different number of track cubes, limiting its potential reach and growth with some like the B&M and NYNH&NH being very small (but adjacent to great cities) and others like the C&O having a great many track cubes
4. When determining a company's _dividend run_, all the trains the company owns are summed (eg two 2-trains, a 3-train[3], and two 4-trains gives a total of 15) and then that many cities connected by the company's track are selected to generate the dividend (without regard for sequencing or locality).  Thus there is no route tracing, just a simple connectivity check
  - The actual dividend a company pays is equal to the sum of values of the cities hit by the company trains, minus a maintenance fee for each train the company owns, divided across the 10 shares in the company.  The fee per train is equal to $10 multiplied by the size of the largest train purchased by any company, making smaller trains increasingly uneconomic over time

The board is rife with layers of short and long (timing) races.  The number of companies allowed to connect to a given city is equal to the size of the largest train purchased by any company, thus there are races to get to more desirable cities first, locking other companies out.  As city-capacity increases immediately when a new level of train is bought (and track is built after train purchasing), there are also races to be in position to buy the next size train and then immediately fill the newly accessible more-valuable cities.  There are also races for special locations on the board with dividend-increasing coal tokens.  As companies operate in descending order of stock value, stock rounds easily become positional dances attempting to force advantageous relative operating orders for specific companies so as to get them the good cities, good trains, good coal tokens etc[4] before some other company does[5].

Similarly, as there is such an advantage to being marginally lower in cash at the start of a stock round (to get first dibs on the best shares), there is often a muscular struggle in the operating rounds to run companies to pay as much as possible while having the controlling player end up with $1 less than the other players so as to secure the better turn order in the upcoming stock round.

This latter turn-order positioning is made more complex by the difficulty of increasing company stock values.  There is a strong incentive to run companies for less than their maximum dividends so as to ensure stock-price increases by reserving future dividend increases by counting not-as-good cities for a dividend and then swapping in better cities in future dividends[6].  Getting the dividend sub-reporting for continued stock-value increases combined with maximising personal cash while also securing good turn order positioning can be difficult.

Those are not the only timing layers.  There are yet more at different layers and levels, all open to inspection and manipulation.  One trick is to hide cash in increased share value which would otherwise affect the player's turn order.  As companies are incrementally capitalised as their shares are bought, and all shares sell for the current stock value, there is not only a race for good operating order, but for various combinations of good turn order positions, operating order positions, good board positions/access, etc.  For instance, the right new company floated at the right time, with the right par and thus the right capitalisation, and thus the right operating order (even after player-market assault), can pay great dividends while preserving the player's turn order position, and be ripe to be dumped immediately in the next stock round, capitalising either buying all the best shares or floating a new company with the right par and the...etc.

As another example, there are also timing games that can be played with trains.  In one of our games the NYNH&H, a very small company that can only reach 5 cities, already owned two 3-trains and  had enough money in its treasury to buy an additional 5-train.  Of course that gave it a total train capacity of 11 when it only connected 5 cities, but no matter.  It then withheld its dividends and in the next operating round sold its 5-train to the bank[7] and used that money along with its remaining treasury to buy the last 5-train, thus selling a 5-train to buy a 5-train and accelerating the end of the game while also leaving an opponent's company unable to afford the larger train it needed and thus forcing it to withhold dividends yet again.  Similar little timing games around the trains exist through-out the game.

All the little races and plethora of timing games, with every detail counting, sum to a larger fight to control the pace of the game and thus the length of the game.  However rather than game-length being the defining centre of the game as it is in Wabash Cannonball, it is more an emergent and less directly-controlled property formed by the amalgam of all the little races.  Due to capital concentration, ability to control the game's development speed and thus length with lower player counts is greatly reduced.  For the same reasons, the importance of game-length control, and the ability to affect it, also tends to increase as player-count increases.

Baltimore & Ohio scales across player counts similarly to the 18xx.  As player-count decreases, control increases and the timing games may be played with ever-increasing finesse.  As player count increases, capital is diluted across players, and control not only decreases but shared-incentives becomes more important and a whole new layer of emergently collusive timing games become possible.  At the higher player counts the patterns start to stylistically resemble 6-player 1830's, and at the lower player-counts, to likewise resemble 3-player 1830, complete with not only the different pacings, but the different values of different companies at the different player counts. The result is that 3 players plays very differently from 4 players, which in turn plays very differently from 5 players (I've not tried 6 players yet).

Expect your first session of Baltimore & Ohio to take between 4 and 5 hours, possibly a little more.  With experience that play-time can be shortened down to around 150 minutes, but it will require both skill _and_ discipline as with that increased skill comes greater ability to predict, control and thus play with the many many layers of timing in the game, pushing the game back up toward 4-5 hours.  Perhaps surprisingly it is easier to push play-time down with increased player-counts, as with more players timing-control also decreases, making a great many of the more subtle and time-consuming timing games unviable.

4. Most of our games have spent more time in stock rounds than operating rounds.

Not 18xx, but obviously owing a debt to 1830 (with a dash of Chicago Express). The knock on it is that you could just allow an extra hour and play 1830, but the difference between a 3-hour game and a 4-hour game is highly significant in practice with my group. We'll see how it goes.

Traded away after a substantially difficult time persuading anyone to play it. Le sigh.

10-04-13 - Played twice, and I love it.  It's a great game, but plays best with the max. number of players who are well-versed in the rules of the game.  Generally, it seems PRR and NYR will have a large advantage in games with newbs, less so in games with experienced players.  The Coal aspect of the game bears more attention in future games.  I think it can create a runaway leader, especially if coupled with PRR, which starts nearby.

This game has some superficial similarities to 18xx titles, but some important distinctions.

I love the way the train obsolescence works. You voluntarily scrap a train when it just doesn't pay for you anymore.

There are some tricks to manipulating market value of your shares. In reality this game is just a stock investment game. 

My one concern with the game is that the track development becomes pretty formulaic with a couple playings. There aren't a whole lot of shenanigans or ability to block opponents. So then its just a matter of playing the stock market and the train rush.

Since a player can conceivably (and usually SHOULD) buy up all 100% shares of a new company in the mid-late game, that removes a lot of the intrigue from the game. Since I can't really do much to hamper a company with track, if another player is allowed to get 100% of a company they're going to tend to make a lot with it. 

Still, it plays in a reasonable amount of time and provides a lot of meaty decisions. I enjoy playing.  Make sure you have a calculator handy (or a spreadsheet).

The basic gist of Baltimore, as has been said previously, is the cube rails system of Wabash meeting 18XX, in more ways than one. It's easily the biggest game that Winsome has published since 2006's Wooden Shoes and Iron Monsters, and is an interesting evolution of the cube rails system.

The structure of the game is similar to 18XX, there are stock rounds followed by two operating rounds. The companies come out in two waves, each company having 10 stocks, but in the cube rails tradition, different companies have different numbers of track cubes available. Companies begin to operate as soon as their first share is sold, and, in a familiar twist, they have to buy trains to run routes where the end goal is driving up the stock value by paying out dividends to the share-holders.

Where Baltimore blazes into new ground is the way it handles trains and the nasty question of increasing net income. The trains operate in a fairly similar way to 18XX, though more abstractly, but in this game they not only cost money up front, but they also have a maintenance cost that increases as the game goes on. Hence, they don't rust out from under you, but they sit around wasting more and more money as the game goes, this generally leading to voluntary scrapping by the owner. The other key is the need to keep increasing the companies net incomes. Stocks only move up in value if their net income has increased that round and they have paid out dividends, so there is a constant need to improve routes or buy trains if one wants to keep the stocks circling upward. 

A final interesting wrinkle of note is the lack of restrictions on stock holding, which means players can actually own 100% of a company if they so desire. Having a company like that can be quite beneficial for the purposes of raising cash and because it is possible to buy multiple shares in a single company on one stock turn, it is not all that difficult to pull off. However, as in most Winsome games, the intuitive early plays are the incorrect ones. Because of the ease of owning your own company, players tend to be suckered into that kind of stock buying pattern in the early game, but because of the early game money crunch all this leads to is under-financed companies that create a mini train rush and then a midgame stagnation because no one can afford more trains. Having the early companies like the Penna and the NYC properly capitalized is crucial.

As in many Winsome titles, controlling the game length can be crucial. The big early games companies like the Penna and the NYC can reap huge income in the late game with multiple big trains if the controller runs them straight and eschews some early game profits. Players need to keep a careful eye on how these companies are run, if the controllers are playing them for the late game, then aggressively starting companies and then flipping the stocks back into the market and then reinvesting the money can be a crucial way to rush the end game, of course, at a price. Decisions like this are fascinating to me.

This is easily the biggest game to have come out of this series, and it's not short. The 3 hours listed here is not unlikely for experienced players, but the first game took somewhere around 4 or so. Not a problem for me, but be sure to budget enough time for it. Baltimore is an interesting game that I expect will receive a fair bit of table-time in the coming year. It's going to be more of a challenge to get onto the table than its brethren because of its added length, but this is an extremely interesting evolution of the Historic Railroads System and it shows how much breadth the basic idea of cube based track building has.

If I have minor niggles it is mainly in the route-planning part of the game. The runs are both easier (because they are abstract, no contiguous cities requirement here) and more book-keeping heavy to calculate than 18XX because the cities have values that change with each technology level and the expenses for the trains also continuously ooch up. While relatively easy to deal with in the early game, this makes keeping track of late game runs somewhat onerous and has resulted in us pulling out the pen and paper and writing down the runs that we want to take in ascending order. The problem is that even when you write this down, you can't go too far ahead because a technology change can make an entire set of notes obsolete. I wish this was just a touch cleaner because otherwise I think this game is tight and nicely implemented. I also would have liked to have seen some light changes to make it scale a touch easier down to 3. With 4 or more things seem fine, but with 3 there are a few too many companies to manage, which can slow the game down. I would have liked to have seen a couple of them removed in 3 count games (along with some trains) to keep the game somewhat more manageable.

In any case, I think this is a great game and in comparison to the short 18XX games I've played (18AL, 18GA, 18Scan) this is a much more satisfying package. The 18XX games seem to translate poorly into shorter experiences, while this game feels just right at its present length. Tight design, good stuff, and I see this receiving regular play for the foreseeable future. It's good enough to have supplanted short 18XX options almost entirely for me and I sold my 18AL/GA copies after I played this a couple of times because I think it flat out does the medium length stock based train game better. I'm eager to see what future iterations of this new evolution of the cube rails system are going to be like.

The game is alot of fun. I really enjoyed it. I like building a company and then buying and selling stock in those companys to make money. It fits the 18XX style as best as I can tell. Its my first 18XX game but after this ill be looking at others.

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic game. I have never played an 18xx game before, and I really loved this variant. The stock element to the game is well done. The mechanic is reasonably simple, but effective. There are clearly a lot of different strategies you could use to win, and that an opponent could use in reaction - for example, flipping in and out of companies quickly, or building them to maturity with steady dividend payouts. 

I like the track building mechanic that allows you to build out track without having to keep track of track maintenance. There is a minor problem with the dividend payout rules - a company's dividend payout should be discretionary. If all the shares are held by investors, the dividend payout ratio is 100% and no earnings are retained. This element is a bit gamey. The rules are poorly written and leave much to the imagination. Overall, in terms of the type of game I want to play, this is very close to my ideal. I would play this anytime, anywhere.

Preliminary rating after one game. 
Would be a 3 without the bookkeeping app. In fact I wish the app went further to track all money. The ratio of bookkeeping arithmetic to actual decisions is way too low for me. I'm also a little disinclined toward games with zero randomness, including setup. I just prefer a little more game-induced variation. This falls into a category of games I don't particularly like, which is where those who can and are willing to do a bunch of arithmetic in their head win, or at least have a big advantage. I don't particularly like arithmetic as an ever-present element of my thought-process when trying to play a game.

18xx lite. Good that it was playable in ~3 hours. I don't think the replayability is particularly high though.

Calculating company incomes is very tedious: Pick a subset of your cities, add their incomes, add coal income, subtract maintenance; repeat until the number is good (better than before, but not too good to leave room to get a better number later again)... Then divide by shares each player owns if paying out...

The way "shares go up only if the earnings go up" drives
deliberate suboptimal earnings (so you could earn more later) added a lot of each fiddliness and is also counter intuitive. I'd prefer an approach which recognises stocks which are earning lots should be
worth lots. Especially if they earnt a lot last turn (rather than B&O's approach of they're a much better stock if they're earning almost nothing, but earned nothing last turn.

I have been playing this lately with my new group. We have a good time with this game. It was my first stock game and my first "Real" train game. The big catch with this game is the expansion and computer program. Without the expansion one railroad is at a distinct disadvantage. Also, without the computer program to calculate the stock prices and values the game can grind to a halt. With both of those in the game, it is quite fun.

This game tries to pack the 18xx punch in less time and with less complexity.  I'm not sure it succeeds in either, but it is still worth a play to see if it is for you.  There is really nothing in here that is better than 18xx. It is a bit shorter, but I'd rather spend another 1-2 hours and play 18xx.  It simplifies the tile placement by just putting a cube in there that represents a tile connecting to all other hexes.  Income is calculated by just adding up your cities.  But here's the rub, in many circumstances there is a decision on whether to operate for the most income possible.  This is due to the stock price only going up when paying dividends PLUS when the corporation operates for more than it did in a previous turn.  This means you have to accurately track what was paid the previous turn and which cities to "count" so that you can max/min the best way to increase stock price and maintain the best income coming in.  This is very arduous and the recommendation is to use a computer.  Any game that requires a computer to play, I'm not particularly interested in.  It's nice if someone else handles it via computer, but it's definitely a big knock on it for me.  And I haven't mentioned how I dislike players being able to purchase all 100% of a corporation from the get go...if they have enough money.  A dominant strategy when combined with the fact you can place out a number of "track" equal to the size of the train.  Buy 100% of a company, watch the value go from 0 to $200 in one turn.  No chance for other players to react/buy-in to share in the wealth.  IMO, this is a step back in the 18xx design.  And I think the replayability of this would be slim to nil due to the androgenous "tiles" and the omission of private companies.  I put 18xx games in the "9" rating area, but this is just a "5".

I wasn't quite sure I would get to play any new games this month, but this last week of it has proven my original perspective to be false. In this last week I played Gosu, then Baltimore and Ohio, and finally Kaigan.

Baltimore and Ohio was the best of the three, an interesting and tight share and railroad management game that takes some of the concepts of both 18XX games and Winsome's cube railroad games, adds in a few entertaining twists, and combines them into a satisfying, entertaining whole. 

The central idea sounds very much like a typical 18XX game, each player is an investor in a number of different available railroad companies, each of which builds track between various cities in order to increase the railroad's total income and thus the individual player's income. 

There are a lot of little systematic differences between this game and the typical 18XX game, but probably the biggest is the complete absence of the track laying of the game. You still lay cubes on the board, and use them to calculate how much income a railroad is making, but a lot of the agonizing choices in regards when and where to lay track tiles are removed. The new decisions that are added to the game are more than enough to make up for this removal, but if you were an 18XX player who enjoyed the subtle effects that the lay of a single track tile could cause, then this will probably not thrill you, however if you were a bit more neutral to ambivalent on track lays, then you will probably fine that the additional decision points to more than make up for the loss.

For players who are new to 18XX, or even Winsome's cube rail series, but who do not mind longer, more complicated games and find the idea of 18XX games to be intriguing, I suspect Baltimore and Ohio will be a good place to start. It is not technically an 18XX game, but it does a good job of teaching concepts that are useful in the play of 18XX games. 

Unfortunately I ultimately found it to be not as fun or dynamic as most 18XX games. It did not get played, so it left the collection.

Players are investors purchasing shares in ten American railroads, and running the railroads they are majority stockholder of. Mechanically straightforward 18xx clone, minus the hex rail tiles. One stock round followed by two operating rounds, buying/selling stock and playing with your companies. Companies expand across the map and make money, which is either reinvested back into the company or paid out to investors which can increase stockprice. Fun game for the first few hours.  The problem is it goes on for another three more hours, and the mathematics gets old quickly.  Downtime can be a real problem too if you are shut out of a company - you are consigned to being a spectator for 30+ minutes.  Fine design, poorly developed and just too long... a shame as the design is solid and a lot of fun.

Almost an 18XX, but even though I think the track-building mechanism is clever, the game as a whole doesn't quite work for me.  The whole dance around running for slightly less than the maximum so as to assure steadily rising earnings and stock appreciation is just an irritating drag.

18XX designers and potential 18XX designers have found that there's a knife-edge balance between a game that works and one that is missing something, and B&O doesn't seem to be on the right side of this balance.

I'm not a fan of share trading, so of course I'm not that keen on B&O. But it was an ok experience, probably better than 18XX thanks to the easier building rules.

This one is really more like a streamlined and accelerated 18xx game than a typical Winsome game.  Unlike 18xx, track building is simply a matter of dropping cubes into hexes.  There are no actual tracks that move through hexsides.  Instead, you're just trying to spread your blob/tendril of hexes into new and valuable cities.  The generous rules for cohabitation of these hexes means that there's relatively little competition for territory, which feels strange and, to me at least, disappointing.

But this is not a game about track development.  This is a game about how and when to smartly invest your money.  The stock market is definitely inspired by 18xx, but has some crucial differences.  Stock prices are much less volatile here, and a player is allowed to buy up any amount of a company's stock in one fell swoop.

Overall, I liked the game but would definitely prefer to play 18xx.  Baltimore and Ohio is a much softer, friendlier game than 18xx.  Trains never rust, companies can't really get boxed in or screwed on the map, and there's no way to gut a company (although you can definitely attack its share price).  I'm also concerned that the stock market is too liquid for a long game like this.  In other words, the lack of restrictions on stock buying gives too large an advantage to the player(s) with the early cash advantage.

I’m not very used to play train games more complex than Age of Steam and with playing this game it solidify my views of these types of games. I like heavy game and this is certainly a game with simple rules, yet pretty much depth despite static setup and without random elements. What might seem obvious at first isn’t because of interactions between players. So what’s my knock against the game?  There are too many calculations which for me obscure the game play. And even if I play using intuition I still have to count up. I know there are computer programs for this, but using that takes away the feeling of playing a physical board game.

Sort of a rebuilt 1830, with some of the same feel, but significantly changed system. Generally it places more focus on strategic development and less that the tactical track laying layer of 1830. Less emphasis and value on being the actual presidency of a company and uses different stock price drivers.

Fantastic game!
The rules are well written, easy to understand and very elegant. I especially like how the maintenance cost of the trains increase as the game progresses, forcing the players to get rid of the old trains and invest in more efficient ones. Rules are simple and clearly explained, but every decision is difficult simply because there are so many options. I really like that you avoid the track building fuss (no 18xx tracks, you place cubes), the no-luck stock-driven mechanism and the managable playing time. This game will work perfectly as an introduction to 18xx style games. 

As for the components and graphics, I seen a lot of criticism of the Eagle edition, something I find completely unfounded. The cards are solid cardstock, colors of cubes and stock certificates are bright and clear and the board is sturdy and very, very functional. Not very fancy, but I can hardly think of other games that are better made than this. Compare it to any 18xx game, and you will see what I mean. After having played it a few times, the simple, uncluttered board has grown on me- much better that the colorful graphics of some other train games, e.g. Queen's edition of Chicago Express. 

I really recommend using some computer software, as it does get very mathy towards the end. I have played with paper money, but it is obvious that poker chips would be preferable.

For me, this game is a solid 10!

There's something perverse about a game that punishes maximizing profit as this one does. The incentive goes to companies that show growth every turn, so be sure to run your company inefficiently now so you can artificially inflate the value later. Twisted, I say!

Whichever BGG wag labeled this 'CHI Expr meets AoS' wasn't kidding- this is a challenging economic train game, with lots of financial angles to take opportunity of, and not too much mercy for those whose mess it up.

Players begin as capitalists, establishing Railroads and/or investing in them.  A Railroad's income (delivery/tech level per city supported) - expenses (engine support costs at a given tech level) equals the Raw Profit, which RR presidents must then either parcel out to shareholders (including the RR if stocks are left unsold), or reserve for ongoing expenses.  But only if you (A) increase Profit AND (B) pay out dividends will (C) the Stock Price increase.

Figuring out how best to maintain that balancing act is where the fun comes in.  Definite appealing to both Winsome RR game fans, Eagle/Queen version fans, and those who like economic games.  7.5 on a 1st 4-player solo play, with upside.

RATING: 9
This is a great railroad game that lies in complexity somewhere between Chicago Express and 18XX. It simplifies income and route building, boiling it down to how many and specifically what cities are connected. The stock market is simplified, but not by much, as the manipulation game is still there from 18XX. There is no train obsolescence mechanism from 18XX, but older trains get very expensive to run fairly quickly due to increasing maintenance cost that is tied to the tech level of locomotives. No cubes to deliver, no tracks to lay. Just buy stock to get control of a company, and link as many profitable cities, before getting locked out. It is a great distillation of the key mechanics and fun from 18XX, without getting bogged down in the details. It is rather math-intensive (lots of addition), so calculators are highly recommended. I rate this an '8', with room to go up.

Update (09/27/11) 10+ plays: My original quibble with this game was that it seemed prone to stereotyped openings. After playing numerous times, the seemingly scripted play quickly diverges to a multitude of unimaginable possibilities. I now prefer this much more than Chicago Express, which is a quicker, more abstracted design. However, it is at least a 4-hour commitment for the early plays, and definitely not to be played with 5 players! I am upping this to a '9'.

Update (10/04/11): The Eagle Games reprint should give this game more visibility that is well deserved. It is simply a great train game that should be a part of every train gamer's library. It is accessible enough that even non-train gamers may find something interesting here. Further, this could be considered an excellent gateway game to the more complex and involved 18XX series. It may be a '10' waiting to happen, but only more plays will tell...

Update (10/14/11): Played with 3. Convinced that 4 player is the sweet spot. There seems to be not enough tension with 3, although the scores fluctuated throughout the game.

Update (11/24/11): Introduced this to four new gamers, where most were min-maxers and business-types, so they loved it. I had forgotten how interesting and varied a 5-player game is, despite it being longer at 4.5 hours. The game has a much slower initial development, due to players starting out with less cash, so there is a necessary greater inter-dependency between players. In a 3-player game, players have enough cash to almost completely buy out a single company. For the enhanced interaction, the longer time is well worth it. One compared it to Power Grid: 1) Links between cities have variable costs depending on geography; 2) There is a limit to the number of players in each city, depending on technology (similar to "step 2" and "step 3" in PG); 3) Locomotives are similar to power plants, since they determine how many cities can be serviced/powered up; 4) Catch up mechanism where lowest cash goes first in B&O, and fewest cities in PG.

Update (11/26/11): A 3-player game with two of the min-maxers from two days ago took about 4 hours. I am amazed at how much new players can take the game in totally new directions, destroying the notion that there is "only one optimal way to play". They enlightened me that having all the coal doesn't necessarily win, that the number of "pieces of paper" (i.e. stock certificates) is more important than the quality/appreciation, and that one should always take advantage of the 10% compounding of the stock price appreciation.

Update (12/16/11): A 4-player game with three of the aforementioned min-maxers took 3.5 hours. Concentration on the number of "pieces of paper" almost gave me the win (I lost by one dollar!), but I blew it by focusing on only acquiring high-income (but stagnated stock appreciation) companies late in the game. A late massive income boost by the C&O enabled a player with a hopeless position to comeback for the win. Because of this, the game continues to amaze me with the broad range of plays and resulting possibilities. At the end of the game, players cannot help but review how the game progressed, and where they made their key tactical/strategic plays and blunders. Being a perfect-information game, it does play like multi-player chess, with move/counter-move, tempo, timing, material advantage, position, turn-order, and other issues that must be comprehended. It is literally the min-maxer's playground for the mind.

Update (12/07/2013) 15 plays: It's been awhile since this hit the table, but all were reminded how much fun this is to play. 5-players took 5 hours, which may be too long for some. There can be some runaway leader problems, but it doesn't become apparent or materialize for several hours since players are so engrossed in making their companies run. Some call this "scripted", but after the first stock market round, the slightest change in play can morph into an entirely different game based on the "butterfly" effect. It is fascinating to watch it unfold over several hours.

A very interesting and fun train game that is a cross between 18XX and Chicago Express. That said, very lengthy and a lot of arithmetic. I am leaning more towards 18XX now but would still play. Not so much complicated as lengthy.

A really good alternative to 18xx if you do not have enough time for a full scale fight over shares. Only doubt I have after two games is that the order of action in the market might affect too muche the game result.

RATING: 7
Although not officially an 18xx, this is very much a stripped down 18xx-style game. It's perhaps unfortunate that it occupies the same geographic space as 1830, when the playing style is very much that of 1825. For my money this is better than the similar Poseidon as there's more competition for hexes and the theme seems more appropriate for a stock holding game. Some computerised assistance is really essential, as the players have the choice of playing for capital growth (by gently stepping up income) or going for the biggest dividends right away and the computer can handle all the maths. That's also my problem here. When a board game needs an iPad on the table to manage the calculations, then in my view the implementation is flawed, you may as well play the whole thing on computer.

Reminds me 18xx series. B&O is easier than 18xx originals on building rails and city linkages. It takes about 6 hours in my first game. It is much shorter than 1870. These kinds of games are specialized to those railroad game maniac. This is not really suitable for those who just stepped in boardgame.

We didn't finish our first game, it went longer than expected and time would allow for. It felt very much like an 18xx game with a few wonky rules. I need to play a complete game to determine if this can be played quickly or if it's just better to play an 18xx instead.

RATING: 7
"18xx without the annoying endgame of endless route optimization." 

"18xx meets Wabash Cannonball"

Those are decent pitches for the game, but are gross simplifications that don't give B&O enough credit as a stand-alone design.

The game is all about timing and knowing if and when to dump one company in favor of another. Companies tend to burn white hot and then die quickly as their trains become obsolete. Be careful of the husks of discarded companies that are left lying around, however. They can come back to life and be powerhouses in the end game under the right circumstances.

There aren't a lot of shenanigans going on with the board itself. With some exceptions, companies will be able to build into the cities they want to eventually. The key to most of the tricks in the game is the deck of trains. These trigger everything, such as city building limits, train maintenance costs, track building per turn, and income per city.

One of the most important consequences of buying trains is that the first 3-train allows for the opening of four companies that are otherwise unavailable. The first stock round following this event is especially crucial.

B&O diverges from most 18xx games in the way that it determines the stock order round. Whoever has the least cash when the stock round starts gets to go first. Whoever has the most cash goes last, etc. This allows for interesting and skillful choices in income planning and withholding.

I find the turn order mechanism particularly satisfying. During the stock round, players are able to manipulate the turn order of the companies. During the operating rounds, companies are able to manipulate the order of the players. 

After 4 plays, I'm interested enough to continue digging into this one.

(Note: I use "stock round" and "operating round" because everyone says those 18xx terms during play. B&O prefers "market round" and "business round". Take your pick.)

Won my first (and only thus far) by controlling Penn line and collecting 4 coal markers before finally connecting last city in my chain I'm required to connect to before other cities thus locking other lines out (since Penn line is a special case for some reason).

Obviously no one will let me play out that strategy again.  Not sure what to rate yet but would be willing to play a 2nd time to see how it plays out with real competition for the coal.

Baltimore & Ohio is an 18xx game in spirit, but challenges several of the core assumptions in the series.

First, trains do not decay and there are no forced train purchases.  Instead, trains cost more and more money to maintain due to the "tech level" (read: phase), and eventually are no longer worthwhile to keep.  Second, early companies are no longer necessarily at a disadvantage to later companies.  The early game companies have the highest track limits and thus retain their viability into the late game as long as they still have capital to spend.  Finally, track is abstracted into hexes though which players are assumed to be able to exit all sides as long as they have placed a cube there, and players own specific track.  This is at a price, as all track now costs money, making capital extremely tight in the early game.

B&O is different enough to be worth a few plays, and at 3 hours in length will not require pre-scheduling.

RATING: 8
Boy was this game good. The game turn pattern is a Market round (sell/buy stock) and then two Business rounds (train operations). Every company has the same share count (10), but companies are limited in the amount of track they can build and that limitation varies by company. One company can only build 4 track pieces while others can go as high as 22. One company is limited to a certain set of cities and another company must build in certain cities before building in others. The game punishes train companies severely for losing income, so there is a lot of pressure to constantly grow. If a company drops in net income, not only does the share valuation sink, but the President must also give up a share without compensation. So if you decide to trash a company, make sure you dump the Presidency on someone else first. :-)

Love these sorts of games and this is a good one. The rules are relatively streamlined and there's a lot of great options with tech levels, expansion, share manipulation. Another aspect I haven't seen before is that sold shares don't go back to the company but to a general pool. A train company can choose to buy its own shares back out of that pool, in order to build company value back up. Probably a great option if a train company that was trashed was looking to recover. My score on this could rise.

The game is a little lighter than an 18xx, but it still ended up being a long game, about 4 hr for 4 relatively non-AP players. There is a stock market along with the route building. Smart choices seemed somewhat limited by the train selected.

If I found myself stranded on a desert island with only 18xx-type games on hand, I'm sure I'd grow to be quite fond of them. Until then, I'm unconvinced that the length is justified. Well-designed Euros achieve the same sort of arc and depth in half the time.

RATING: 8
3 hours is very optimistic. Our first game took 6 hours. I messed up completely in the initial share purchase. As a result I lost the game just 30 minutes in but still enjoyed the remaining 5.5 hours of the game. Must be good!
The gameplay feels most similar to an 18xx game but is more friendly and less stressful. For an initial play I like this better than any 18xx so far. If it proves to be as variable it might be a new favourite train game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A pale shadow of an 18xx game that's not interesting enough to justify the still considerable play time. Exponential growth economical snowball game with no catchup mechanism, no break on the leader, and no real ways to trip the leader up either. Lots of rough edges, feels underdeveloped.

Operation rounds feel trivial, there's just a couple of optimal ways to run a company. Interactions between companies are way too limited: companies can't co-operate in any way, and can only minimally block others. The stock market doesn't discourage pathological stock trashing, with the only defense being to own 100% of a company, which just adds to the solitaire feel.

Train buying is the main mode of interaction. But whereas in an 18xx train buying decisions are often subtle, with every decision to buy or not buy having a butterfly effect through the game, here the decisions seem straightforwards. There's no real differentiation between trains, and the minimal effects from phase changes don't help.

Might work as an introduction to the 18xx system, but I'd worry about the newbies being put off by the experience.

RATING: 4
An accountant's railroad game. Dull, dry, and disappointing.

So mathy you need a computer program beside just to speed it up; otherwise it takes over 4 hours to play with 5 or 6. No luck means standard openings are well known and repeated each time ad nauseum. Many have mentionned the runway leader problem and I concur. You can usually spot the winner (or at least the top two) 1-2 hours in advance which kills the fun for everyone else knowing you can't catch up and leaves you wishing you were playing something else.

Sure the people with calculator brains love it the same way some people like solving logic puzzles. The rest of the human race should avoid it.

I've played twice.  Honestly this game has some merit.  But I'm not so sure I want to try again.  It is a demanding game, and comparisons to 18xx are inevitable.  The game shares the same theme and some familiar trappings (stocks, trains) yet is really a different game altogether.

One unfortunate similarity is the game slows in the late game just like 18xx.  In our last game, which I admittedly played poorly in, I was doing the banking for 10-15 minutes while waiting to take my turns.  I didn't really mind this, but the pace was slow and the arithmetic was demanding.

If you play this game you MUST use poker chips!

Not too convinced after a couple tries, not that it's a bad game per se, but I should have more time and opportunities to play 18xx to want to take a break from those and have more time for this.

A refreshing take on the stock marker for some parts, but compared to the threats of a regular 18xx train rush the tech levels are just unnecessary added calculation for no real gain. The demand for steadily rising company revenue seems like a cool diversion from xx too, but it usually just ends up limiting your (reasonable) options.

Excellent game that seems a blend of 18xx and Wabash.  Track was played Wabash style to some degree although train status dictated how much track could be built in a turn.

I love train games and this is one of the best.  It is supposed to be a lighter 18XX game simplifying many of the more complex mechanics while retaining the same 18XX feel.  It comes through.  Now, I will say that it is still very "mathy" and can take 5 hours if you do not use a player aid.  However, included in the files on BGG and forums are some great tools that help folks with calculations, distilling the game down to business decisions and taking the tedious math out of the game.  With these computer play aids the game will take 3 to 3.5 hours. An awesome game and a lot of fun.  

Artwork is a little spartan, but overall a good solid game.  

I would not recommend playing with the family.  It is more of a gamers game.

after first play.  want to play again to confirm the rating, as I feel I was just beginning to understand some of the levers late in the game.

Initial thoughts:

- love the easy track build
- love the "pick the cities you want to use" aspect versus tracing routes in 18XX
- love the capital equipment ideas (no rusting, escalating costs making things less profitable)
- the escalating net profit rules for stock movement were interesting, and I screwed this up several times (hint: you probably dont want to maximize profits every business round!)
- timing of share ownership seems to be a critical element (yes, we all pretty much got tied up in "my" company this first play - will have to be more mindful of that next time).

Play time is somewhat of a concern (3-4 hours), but I never felt that the game dragged.

Despite playing like a total idoiot, I enjoyed the game.  Made the mistake of assuming the stock market could screw you, and played too conservatively.  Do not like the gamey rules of increasing stock price with increased profits allowing manipulation of routes to getnjust ten bucks more each turn as payout.  Feels a bit lame.  But would play again, and this time I willnot buy two trains in the first turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It clearly belongs to the trade stock and run (train) companies style that I greatly enjoy in general, and thus a rating of 8 is natural considering that it is well implemented.

Compared with say 1830 I find it a bit too timid cause (so far) there does not seem to be the same amount of shenanigans regarding trashing a company (where 1830 and others allow to "steal" the trains and sell worthless privates).

I think that for diversion this certainly deserves a spot in my collection. It seems to play solo more easily than 1830 since the stock trading is more bundled (sell anything, then buy *any amount* in *a single* company). I also like the option of companies buying back their stock and the (necessary for this to work) incremental capitalization (which of course various 18xx games have too).

Very good game. Each game has my brain turning itself into knots trying to see the best way to forge ahead through the maze of interlocking mini-competitions that each round consists of. When to bail on a railroad, when to start a new company, how to position the railroad's stock in order to gain timing advantages, lots of other things, all must be kept in mind and (usually) reassessed multiple times.

The one thing I dislike is the very computationally intense net income exercise that each railroad must go through each business round. While the basic concept of (X for serviced cities - Y for capital equipment = Z your net income) is easy enough, it's far from trivial in the late game when a larger railroad might be connected to 13 cities, have a service capacity of 7 and need to decide how best to straddle the line between steady share price uptick and max profits. Thankfully there are a couple of assistant programs / spreadsheets out there that I think will be a big help, next time I play I'll want to run one of them and see how much time that shaves off the game. I suspect it will not be insignificant.

Overall a real gem of a game, provided you're willing to invest the time in something this heavy. Not for the faint of heart, this game comes by its Game Weight rating honestly!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game, though it has got samey after 8 plays.

Calculating runs to be sufficiently suboptimal to ensure share growth whilst still maximising dividends (planned over several rounds) is an un-fun, un-interesting nuisance. We house-ruled that once a company gets to 5+ cities, it can declare any dividend between min. and max. without the need to demonstrate the exact city combos, this shaved an hour off the game length.  

I dislike the incremental capitalisation mechanic because it encourages players to plough into their existing companies. There's not enough cross investment (players may own 100% of a company - 18xx usually limits it to 60%). 

Furthermore, there's not enough hazards/pain in the game (i.e. the forced train purchase from 18xx creates a lot of tension and drama, but this has been removed in B&O). 

The share trashing is also pretty mild: 1 box/sale, regardless of the number of shares sold.

Based on one play: This is a train game, kind of a variant on the 18XX games, but with much less focus on track placement (since you only lay cubes to indicate tracks) and much more focus on money management and stock manipulation. Timing is so important, for train purchasing, stock buying and selling and also income generation as you must make more then the turn before in order to keep your stock price climbing. Tough the first time, but would like to play again.

1st play was a fool around to learn the mechanisms. What a wonderful game. Big time screwage factor in this one. It seems to have been stripped down to the bare bones in terms of components but that in effect has made the entry price point very nice so happy days. I may well do some personal upgrading of my own if it hits the table regularly 25/1/15

Update: Up to a 9 from an 8.5. Many 18XXers poo poo this game because the cubes replace the track element within 18XX games. I quite like that as it allows for just the market mechanisms to be the focus. 26/9/15

Update: Still decent just not sure if the time to play it is too long for what it is.

I enjoy this one quite a bit, although it's a bit long for my taste (~4 h). It feels like a cross between 18xx & Wabash; certainly more of the former.  I prefer the cube-rails building mechanic this one has to the 18xx hexes.  It drags a bit at the end & is very, very fiddly once each line has many cities.  Sometimes a player can fall out of the running (quickly) & be forced suffer the rest of the game. 

If you like 18xx games, you will probably enjoy this!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I quite enjoyed this game and I thought the cube track mechanic was quite brilliant. There are two problems I have with this game. One is that it starts to drag a bit at the end and you probably could cut the game off at the 5 train mark depending on where players are sitting score wise. And two is that it tends to run 3/4 as long as an 18xx game. 

I'd rather play 18xx, but with the right group of people, I think you could whittle this game down to 2 hours. Need more plays of it to determine where this sits score wise. Also, stock trashing is pretty brutal in this game. Since you can buy up 100% of your company stock, it's not a huge problem, but someone can wreck havoc by buying a stock, selling it and forcing your company to buy it or you buy it.

[b]Update[/b]: Yeah, there are a few things about this game I REALLY dislike. For one, there is no presidents share and simply buying one stock of someone elses company can get it completely dumped on you. Coal feels too powerful, and this game actively discourages you from buying other peoples stock. Also, being able to buy 100% of a company in one swift move is annoying. Overall, I'd REALLY rather play 18xx instead since the changes are significant enough to where the game feels "broken". Also, stock manipulation is rather weird and fairly one dimensional. I do feel like this game starts to snowball the leader. Right now it sits at a 4, but I think it could drop to a 3 with another play.

Also, I couldn't even imagine this game without the app. It shaves off probably about an hour and with this running 3 1/2 hours as it is, it'd be far too long of downtime.

RATING: 8
Compared to 18xx games: I like the manageable playing time (about 4 hours) and less fuss with track building and still getting the feel of a stock driven economic game with no luck factor. I like also the aspect that it has less play balancing limits (no share limit, less buying limits). I would not like it in all stock driven train games but this particular game employs it well and is thus a worthy add to any economic train games fan collection.

One play and liked it a lot. But it's the kind of game you'll play only once or twice a year, because:

1) If you plan to play this game, it will be the only one you'll be playing, because of the very long playing time
2) The entire group needs to consist of people who are willing to calculate every move they make

But I most say that it doesn't become boring for the whole 4 hours I've played it and there are some very neat mechanics in this game.;

Second play was with 6 players and liked it more: the shares of 1 company were more divided over different players.

An excellent game which is a light version of 18xx and plays in about two thirds of the time of an typical 18xx game.

The track building is simplified to be like Chicago Express and with each railroad having different maximum sizes.  Otherwise the Stock rounds and Operating rounds are essentially like typical 18xx games, but with many good novel twists on the details of game play regarding the train cards (capital equipment).

Every minute spent playing the game is very enjoyable with loads of choices of what to do.  But allow 8 to 12 hours for your first game. (We played our first 3-player game over 3 evenings.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While not 18xx you can seem some lineage there, with companies running for a profit in operating rounds interspersed with stock rounds to buy and sell stock. 
The companies come out in two waves and are capitalized as shares are bought so there is a risk to be under capitalized at the beginning of the game. The number of cubes - builds roughly show the earning potential of the company. Larger companies such as the Peen or Central are going to earn more, so keep an eye out not to let a player get 100% of a valuable money maker. The players control the end game by pushing equipment upgrades, it may require allowing some lines to go into receivership if it occurs after you cashed out so be it. 
Stocks only increase if profits increase so there is a constant need to expand routes and upgrade equipment to keep companies value increasing. 

I love the way the train obsolescence works. They cost more to operate, thereby providing less profit until you are ready to scrap it.

It is a long game so it if tough to get to the table. 

A challenging game - a bit simpler than 18xx and perhaps a bit more forgiving.

70% of an 18xx in 100% of the playtime. 

It's not bad, it's just very awkward since the playtime is high and appeals to exactly the same crowd as 18xx.

Compared to 18xx, the game is a bit lighter (and also faster to play) but still sufficiently interesting. Should play more to be able to decide how well the game plays in practice, but the first impression was that the stock market is not lively enough.

B&O is a big number crunching exercise.  If you want to spend four hours with your buddies examining ideal ways to invest, divest, reinvest stocks while building rail roads and receiving dividends, play this game.  Rules-wise it's actually quite simple, the complexity comes in optimizing the calculations.

A game turn constists of three rounds.  In the first round players take turns buying and selling stock.  Stock loses value when it is sold.  The turn order for this round is poorest player to richest.  In next two rounds the train companies are operated (once per round).  In a round the train companies are operated by their owners in order from greatest stock value to least.  Train companies use their funds to improve train technology and build track.  Finally the companies produce income based on the number of trains they have, the number of cities to which they are connected and the current tech level.  If a company produces more money than it did last time and pays a dividend to stock owners the stock value increases.  If a company produces less money than it did last time the stock value decreases.  Otherwise there is no change.

The game ends at the end of a turn when the game has entered tech level 6.  By that time the complexity of train systems and stock ownership makes having a caculator imperative.  Lots o' number cruching.  Lots o' money being made by players.  Knowing the valuable locations on the board, when and what to buy, when and what to sell, when to pay dividends, when to improve train technology and how to control turn order are all constantly important.  So much is going on that four hours goes by pretty fast.  The economics of the game are grueling and a bit over to top for me, particularly the computation orgy that comprises the last couple of turns.  If you make a mistake early you'll spend the next three hours limping in last place.  If the game averaged a 2 to 3 hour play time it be much better.  Perhaps that's a reasonable play time for experienced players.

My favorite economic train game. Period.  Takes out all of the stuff I find fiddly with 18XX games (which I still really enjoy) and gets down to the brass tax of buying and selling shares, with a streamlined system for the companies running. Pure awesomeness in a box!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Simply put, 18AL does 18xx-light so much better than B&O. (Actually, go straight to 1830, it really takes about an hour longer than either 18AL or B&O).

B&O's simplification of the 18xx system removes much of its interactivity:

* There is no way to shuffle assets from one corporation to the next. So there's much less incentive to take over another person's profitable corporation by buying out its shares -- the only difference now between you and the former president is that you paid far more for your shares. You can't take advantage of the basic tactic of most 18xx games of shuffling money between corporations via train purchases.

* Substituting cubes for tiles as track removes the huge cooperative element found in 18xx games. Often, neighbouring corporations will build track together to reach profitable areas, then one corporation will stab the other in the back by blocking this route with a token. Here, it's simply expand and block. 18xx games have by far one of the most interesting and satisfying tile laying mechanics out there.

* I am a bit lukewarm on how B&O handles train obsolescence. Trains in one tech level progressively get cheaper (which sometimes acts as a little balancing mechanism, helping out companies with lower stock values). Interestingly, because trains do not simply disappear from the game when they become obsolete; they just start having higher maintenance costs. So you have a new decision to make: do you scrap your old trains because you need the extra money for doing so, or do you keep them, but pay the extra maintenance costs? Although B&O gives you this interesting decision, it doesn't offer the pressure that 18xx does in the system's race to get new trains.

Many have commented on that this is a game about timing. I interpreted this as a game of waiting for the right moment. Do you buy a train now, or wait until someone else buys it to get a cheaper one? Do you try to maximize your earnings, or do you hold back so that you could make more in the next round, which allows you to increase your stock value?

However, I prefer 18xx approach, in which you have to push the system as hard as you can and generate as much capital as fast as you can, not just because the goal of the game is to make the most money, but because having more money gives you more options.

To give B&O some credit, it's one of the more original offerings from Winsome Games that steers away from their dominant stock market mechanism of auctions. It's also commendable that B&O finds other variations on how to implement the base features of the 18xx system, and the attempt to simplify the system to reduce playing time.

Still, these innovations in the 18xx system yield a game that has far less flexibility than the 18xx system on how to spend your money and manipulate your assets, which to me reduces my interest in playing this again. If it weren't for the fact that I'm a huge fan of the 18xx system, I might have rated this game higher.

RATING: 8
The upside:
-A different train game, in the way that feels an hybrid between an 18xx and the other shorter train games like Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express.
-I like being possible to own 100% of a company.
-The (best) rhythm in which you have to make companies grow feels right, as opposed to make your companies grow as fast as they can, as one would normally assume.
-I think there's still room for your favorite stock market shenanigans, they're limited here, but they're definitely there.

The downside:
-You can improve the flow of it using a spreadsheet, but that's not a good thing for a boardgame.

Some people call this game '18xx meets Wabash Cannonball'. The network building is simple and straight forward, a la Wabash; no cornfield junctions here, just drop a cube in a hex and your company has built there. This is probably the single closest aspect related to Wabash Cannonball.

The majority shareholder is the president and determines how the company expands in the 'Business Rounds', whether train technologies are purchased and whether dividends get paid out to shareholders. The 'level' of trains that have been purchased determines game phases and is a major impact on the game in more ways than one.

There are a lot of differences to 18xx though. Comparable elements are more streamlined (2D stock market, no 60% restrictions, simple track building) but there are definitely many elements unique to Baltimore and Ohio. In B&O, the companies have a different number of cubes available for laying track; companies have different options for where and how far they can expand. 

The dance surrounding the train technologies mechanism is brilliant. The current Tech Level (whatever the latest purchased train's level is) and trains have ever-increasing maintenance costs. Why keep that old 2-train when it costs you more in maintenance than the money it's making servicing different cities? The descending cost of newer, same-level trains pushes the players to purchase newer trains, driving the game forward and causing you to question your turn order position.

In order to increase a company's value, it has to be more profitable than the previous round. This is a very interesting dynamic - you don't want to push your runs too fast because you may not be able to keep up in the future. Sometimes it's beneficial to run a less-than-optimal run one round in order to ensure your company will be more profitable in the next round. 

Playtime is in the 3-4 hour range but the game is engaging and riveting. Baltimore and Ohio is a work of art!

RATING: 7
If the calculations did not grow more tedious as the game progressed, this game would easily rate a 9 or 10.

The main culprit for the tedious calculation is not paying for shares, trains, or calculating dividends. Those are all straightforward. The problem is determining how a company should run its route to create a stock increase. In this game, a company's stock increases only when it pays out dividends AND increases its net income from the previous round. So there's incentive to NOT run a company at its most profitable from the get-go, and instead increase its profits slowly or by steps. This necessitates looking closely at the map and running routes to different assortment of cities each round.

Aside from that, this game is excellent.

As written I don't think this game really works.  To me this game is a huge bore-fest.  Might consider it again, if there was a forced Best Route rule.  Also change the Coal rule to "taking coal requires the expenditure of one of your track builds.  It costs the same as the cost of building track into the coal hex".

--Aug2011-- Lovely simplification of an 18xx title; probably sufficiently simplified that it's no longer worth the label. (To me, Poseidon seems very very similar, though it's probably just on the far side of that completely subjective "is it an 18xx" line.)  Quite delightful; perhaps a bit over-long to get easily to the table; but still good fun.  I've only played with all four expansions, for what little that's worth.

It's 18xx lite, but there's enough comparison there to be applicable.  But it's still a 3 hour endeavor in math calculations in your head.  Hmmm...10 + 10 + 20 + 30.....that's 140 in income.  So that's $14 per share.  How many shares do you have?  4?  So that's 4 times 14 for you.  What's that.....hmm.....4 times 14 is ....uh.....56.  So $56 for you.  How many for you?  You have 3?  OK, that's...um.....3 times 14, that's 42 for you.  Wait, I can optimize my route if I use Baltimore instead of Roanoake, that makes the route 150 instead of 140.  Gimme the money back, that's $15 per share.  So how much are you guys getting now?  

Now, extrapolate that out for 3 hours.  Are we having fun yet?

A clever 18xx variant.  I love that the first game in the series mirrors 1830.  There is usually an obvious play when it comes to starting companies, but the game does a ton right with keeping the game interesting.  I think the stock rounds did not turn out the way the designer intended with stock trashing introducing significant game time for little benefit.  My favorite game from 2009.

-----------------------------------------
This game has turned out to be quite fascinating.  I like that it has some similarities to the 18xx system.  I like the investing in companies as well as the possible manipulations.  I like that the values of cities change as the game progresses  However, I also like the differences.  I like that companies actually control their own track (like in real life).  I do like the way in which obsolescence is handled, probably more than the way it is handled in 18xx.  Overall, it is a very compelling game.  I hope that it makes its way onto additional maps.  The only problem is that the game length limits how often I get to play it.  [03/13/2011]

1 play, 4er.

Wow, this was really good! It's like an 18xx game, but with some of the annoying 18xx-ities, such as having to pick very specific tracks, having to decide specific non-overlapping routes for each train, having trains rust out, being taken out of the game! However, we played with Kevin's very handy computer helper program running -- it tracked each player's connections and generated every possible combination of deliveries instantly. Despite that, our 4er game took just over 5 hours (of course, one of the 4 was the infamous Brian -- he probably adds 1+ hours to the game!)! If we didn't have that program, I imagine we would be looking at a 6+ hour game. Hopefully that will come down significantly; it's the reason I rate this just an 8.

I REALLY want to try this again, but need to write an Excel sheet or wait for that program to become available. C'mon, Kevin! Get to work!!

--- Summary ---
- Stock Round. 6 companies (diff starting locations and # cubes available) available at start; 4 more become available when tech level 3 reached. Start companies, buy/sell shares. Continue till all players pass. Player turn order is from least to most cash.
- 2 Operating rounds. Companies go in share value order. Each company may build track (place cube in hex), buy train(s) (which advances you through increasing Tech levels; each tech level changes limits on number of allowable cubes/hex, tracks built/turn, train maintenance costs, etc.). Deliveries are simple -- each train can visit x cities; decide which cities in your network you're servicing and add up their values, then subtract train maintenance fees = income; split amongst all shares). Company share value increases only if you earn more than previous income, so you often make suboptimal deliveries to ensure you can grow share value over the rest of the game.

Based on a single run-through of the game. It could go up or down. There are things here I really like but I can see where some feel it sits between a winsome game and an 18xx game and you can choose either and don't need this in-between game. Sort of how you don't need Canal Mania, you either play Steam/Railways of the World or you play Ticket to Ride. (Not including AoS because that's just a different beast).

Liked this much more than 1830.  There's less issues with the stupid stock market, no "floating" stocks, plays better with fewer players, and gets rid of the ugly and restrictive track hexes, immediately making the game more elegant.  It's an 18xx game that clears away the needless complexities and focuses on strategy.

However, there's still the MATH issue and the huge amounts of cash being sorted into multiple piles.  It punishes new players and does little to balance the game. It's not a euro in the sense that if you are out of the game, you can never hope to come back.

I've never understood how board games can pretty much directly "steal" another designer's game and market a slightly different version.  This is an 18xx game; who knows why there are so many, but hopefully the variants are this good or better.

RATING: 5
An interesting game overall. We did not care for the effects of the rule that companies only advance on the valuation chart if they pay out more than last turn. It's a fine rule but the fact that you can choose which cities to run to means that late in the game too much time can be spent figuring out the optimal series of runs to get each company to increase in value each turn. We may institute a house rule that you can pay out any value you like up to your maximum.

A second game revealed a significant flaw, namely that there is basically nothing you can do to slow down a player with a significant cash lead early on unless you happen to already own shares of his or her companies (and even then all you can do is depress the stock values a bit). In 18xx, stock ownership limits mean that a cash-rich player will usually have to invest in other players' companies or let the cash sit idle. In B&O, this was not true until very late in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
What I like most about B&O is the elegance of moving from phase to phase (1 to 6, with the game ending the round any 6 train is purchased). Phases are a core idea in XX, and the game kind of revolves around new trains being bought and old trains obsoleting. B&O improves mightily on this in several ways:
 Trains don't obsolete, but instead have a maintenance cost of $10 x current phase. Train obsolescence is a core XX idea, and while it adds tension, it also slows down the pace greatly. Increasing maintenance costs serve a similar, and more thematic purpose - older trains just gradually become less economical, rather than simply disappearing in a puff of smoke.
 Each of a given train is cheaper than the last (so the first 1 train costs $100 and the last is something like $80). This helps solve the problem of no company wanting to buy the last 3 train because it will open up the first 4 train for the next company.
 Each new phase allows more companies into each city. This keeps the tension up throughout the game, as companies poise themselves to get into blocked profitable cities such as New York. Like this it allows a nifty trick - my company buys the first 4 train, then immediately takes the the 4th spot in New York.
 The maximum amount of track a company can build in a turn is 1 x phase number. Elegant, and accelerates the game nicely.

Another huge bonus is using cubes to denote track rather than actual track tiles. My absolute least favorite thing about train games is searching for some obscure complex track piece.

The biggest thing that B&O lacks compared to the XX family is the ability for one company to sell a train to another company. This is another core idea, where you control two companies, then suddenly tank one in favor of improving the other, if possible also leaving another playing holding the bag on the now near-bankrupt company. I've decided that a couple of simple house rules can allow this as a house rule (just allow it, and force each company to have a train, even if the president must buy it himself - as in other XX games).
EDIT: Increased to 9 after 4th fantastic play.
EDIT: Decreased to 7 after playing tons of XX games lately. Not that I don't like B&O - just that I think I prefer XX.

Provisional rating, one play (Eagle Games edition).  I had some enjoyment playing this, but shall avoid it in future, just as I do 18XX and for the same reason: the arithmetic. In many games one needs to internalise the rules before one can play quickly and with assurance, freeing the mind to concentrate on planning not just on execution.  My problem with B&O was not the rules, which were simple enough, but that the numbers would not get out of the way.

This is one of my favorite genres of games, and this game seems to have everything I need to enjoy it, but it honestly is just not memorable.

As a fan of the 18xx series of games, I really enjoy this one. It's almost an introductory game to the series, though it definitely contains some major differences.

I went into my first play blind.  Had not read a thing about it.  I *assumed* it was like Wabash et. al., but this game plays much more like an 18xx game, in length and breadth.  Having said that, my 18xx experiences have been a blood letting (mine) and this game, while I did not play great, I still was able to stay in the game the entire time and make some money so it was not nearly so dispiriting.  

My first game was a six player affair and I had no idea how long we had been playing until we finished and I realized how late it was.  That sort of engagement in a game, that I was not doing particularly well in is an indicator of very fine game.

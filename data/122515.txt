This is an extremely well designed game. It’s not particularly innovative in its approach – use buildings to turn resources into victory points - but the mechanics that are used in this approach are sufficiently different to other games of this type for it to provide a different challenge. There is also a level of competiveness / interaction in these mechanics that is higher than in many eurogames.

I've only played this a total of 2 times, but each time has been awesome.  So much variety in the game and so many mechanics in play.  Playing with all of the expansions is great!

RATING: 7
Another amazing mashup of mechanics that I like, especially the using resources for both bidding and action/worker payment (with diminishing returns). Only complaint is that at 5/6p, everyone has to be super disciplined otherwise the game drags way more than it's worth. 2p isn't bad, but I'm more likely to either draft the starting pool of seasonal tiles, and/or use the Merchant expansion. 

So far, the promos have all been logical enough that you can live without them, or just throw them all in and forget about it. The exception to this would be the Key Celeste which has the ghost meeple element to scare off bids. The game doesn't suffer from a diminishing decision importance (ala Terra Mystica) in that you'll find pivot points for strategy that turn up in future seasons due to the draft (especially at player counts under 4). That doesn't detract from an overall strategic form of the game, it merely requires some risk management.

Dodgy rulebook. That's all the negatives out of the way. 

I really don't get this one played enough, it's very mechanical but everything comes together wonderfully. Very satisfying. 

I am rather dubious about the higher player counts though, I will probably try it with 5 and see how it goes. I fear downtime will rear its ugly head with more to keep track of and more players to act before you.

edit: Played it with 6 and it was more than fine, although we had no APers. Still in love with this one.

Interesting mix of auction and worker placement, with meeple workers used as currency and to activate tile abilities.  Lots of game-to-game variability due to different combinations of tiles available.  Fun.

RATING: 9
A game of worker placement and bidding that lasts 4 rounds, scales from 2-6(!) players, is innovative despite using some familiar mechanics, and has high variability.

There are 4 seasons (rounds) in the game and each round a set number of tiles are laid out (this is where a large amount of the variability is introduced as there is a large number of different/unique tiles in the game), as well as a set number of boats carrying new workers and their skills into the new world.  A players turn is simple to execute but difficult to choose; you have the following options: 1) bid on a tile, 2) increase an existing bid on a tile, 3) utilize a tile, your own, another players or the ones currently up for bid, or 4) exchange workers.

The twist with the bidding and actions are that everything is colour specific; there are 4 colours in the game, and once a colour is used on a tile, only those workers of that colour can be used.  At the end of a round, winning bids collect their tiles and bring them into their own villages which involves a bit of tile-laying planning.  There are two main benefits of having your own tiles:1) any workers used on a tile are retained instead of lost at the end if around, and 2) the tiles are one of the main ways to score points (however they must be "flipped" in order to be worth points and this flipping also upgrades the tiles abilities.

The last game round is slightly different in that each player introduces their own tiles into the bidding pool and these tiles only function is for end game scoring.  

Gameplay is quick but thoughtful, there is a large amount of variety from game to game, it's works great at all player numbers, and the theme is decent.

The best Euro I've ever played. Very highly interactive gameplay which is very rare in a lot of Euros these days. The fact that your workers also act as your currency to bid on tiles is next-level design and so unique. Also the fact that you can move losing bids to do another action is also amazing as that you are never truely locked out of a game. Amazing game, I'm always looking forward to playing this one.

My only previous experience with the Key games is from playing Keythedral. Keyflower is considerably heavier than that title. The rules-explanation is long, and the central concepts here are not particularly familiar from other titles, hence it isn't always intuitive. But Keyflower works brilliantly. It is clever, strategic and interactive, with just a touch of the mean-ness of Keythedral. The artwork is sublime, and the components are great. There is a lot of variety provided too, with different tiles available in different game, and variable scoring conditions. This is an excellent new take on the worker-placement, and pick-up-and-deliver genres.

Keyflower is a game that sneaks up on you. It looks familiar with its hexes and meeples. It starts simple with just a small handful of familiar things to do. It has little familiar homes with little familiar chimneys and a nice familiar art style reminiscent of the coziest of childhood picture books. Then, when it gets your trust, it slaps you across the face.

Keyflower is Eddie Haskell. On the surface you're playing a little civilization game, building up an economy, putting your meeples to work, and upgrading your hexes into more beneficial properties. All the while you're whistling a tune and admiring the colorful and delightful artwork. But how did you get that property? You ruthlessly outbid somebody on it. Or you snuck in and snagged it at the last second with a color of meeple that was impossible to counter. Or maybe, just maybe, you drove up the bid on another property, only to back out and snag one that is of better use to you, just because you wanted your opponent to use up two more meeples than they needed to. You're doing it right, buddy. 

Not only that, but aren't you the one who is squatting on somebody else's land? You're the one using that one property that they purchased and that would help them this round, if only because you know that it will force them to use up more of their meeples. All the while, the lands are expanding, the hexes are becoming less easy to tame and the competition is heating up.

Don't let the aesthetic fool you. Keyflower may have a certain lighthearted charm to it, but beneath that veneer, there is a complex, escalating, and highly competitive soul.

RATING: 8
Perhaps the game is better with 3 or more players because of its bidding mechanism, and after understanding how each tiles interacting with each other, and also what each season will offer. Probably because there's too little stuff going on compared to Bora Bora. The pick-up-and-deliver mechanism is a miss in our 2-players game as the tile needed to transport more resources is not in play. Our game finished in 30 minutes. The gameplay is very easy, it's either you bid for tiles or use any tiles or pass, with the requirement to use same colour meeples, increasing number of meeples used & no more than 6 meeples on a tile. The trick is to choose tiles that can give u the most points & work well with your other tiles.

It's very Euro-ish, one of the best game at any player count, random setup which means high replaybility, main mechanism is bidding, also has worker placement, tile placement, resource management, pick-up & deliver, network building, all the great Euro mechanics in 1 game! Best of Key series!

LIKE: I love the town plus engine building. Elegant game design, tense auctions. Fun to figure out how to best use your army of meeples, either for bidding or as worker placement. The game ramps up in the last round, and can be a little cutthroat, in a fun way.

DISLIKE: Can be cutthroat at the end, players could block others just to slow them down if they have a good engine. This happens with the blacksmith, timber yard, and stone yard. Knowing tile combos gives slight advantage. 

OVERALL: Great game. On my first time through, getting to know the tiles and strategies was slow at first. In autumn and winter, the game became cutthroat as players started to block each other to prevent combo scoring. The second play was much more fun, because player see the value of the production tiles, and make sure to grab them.

RATING: 7
Very unique mechanics for the market, bidding and worker placement. Introduces fresh air into the genre. You are constantly thinking of trade-offs between this and that which is a sign of a good game. Personally I did not find the victory point generation mechanics that interesting. You are either upgrading tiles, moving resources onto certain tiles or collecting sets. Ok, this is basic stuff in board games but for some reason it felt a little bit detached in this context. Maybe it was the fact that acquiring tiles is not enough but you have to commit energy to make use of them. This slows the game down a little bit, especially on the first plays when you do not know what should you be aiming at. Moreover, it takes a lot of experience to see the value of each tile since you actually must be able to use them to unleash their potential.

I would call Keyflower a light gamer's game. There is no way could imagine teaching this to my non-gamer friends. The basic mechanics are so mind boggling at first that less experienced gamers will have hard time understanding the game. Yet they are rather simple once you have them figured out. It has to be mentioned though, that the rulebook plays its part in this initial complexity. The way the rules are written does a terrific job at explaining the rules but for some reason it is harder to understand how the game actually plays.

Keyflower definitely has potential for a higher rating than a seven. Time will tell.

RATING: 7
When I first played Keyflower I thought it had some fantastically unique mechanics and was a great game packed with tight decisions.  However, the more I play the more I think it's just a little too random for the 4 turn game that it is.  When you see scores of 70ish points and you can gain/lose 15 points based on pulling a red meeple instead of a blue or you can score 30 points if the right autumn tile comes out but 10 if not, it's a bit dissatisfying to think I did the best I could with what I had but just didn't get what I really needed which is a shame. Maybe it's better with more players when there's less variation in tiles but still, I'm not convinced.

If I had invented a game, I wish it were this one. The game mechanic is relatively simple to teach quickly yet has enough depth to avoid "solving." Randomization in setup eliminates carbon-copy repeats of games, but it doesn't cancel planning (unlike See: Pirate's Cove). You have to plan ahead somewhat, but the inherent randomization in setup means you can't plan too far ahead (cuts down on analysis-paralysis; see: Agricola). You can almost always do something (if you have the workers for it), even if it costs you more (little blocking out; see: Agricola).
Basically, everything that I *don't* like about Agricola is fixed by Keyflower. :-)

This is apparently the 7th installment by R&D games for games in a setting known as "Key Land" which I like to think of as a theme park for locksmiths. "Unfamiliar to me" setting aside, there are a lot of interesting things going on in this game. Familiar mechanics are played in unfamiliar and novel ways. For instance, you spend the course of four seasons bidding on flops of tiles which you use to assemble your personal village. You don't bid with money though, you bid with meeples. The different colors must be matched and the quantity exceeded when bidding for a tile, so one blue meeple must be outbid by 2 blue meeples and so on. As you build your village, you want to use it to do things BUT other players can use it too so things can get tricky. Say for example you build a good engine, and another player sees it, well instead of trying to stop you they just decide to use your engine! Now this isn't a complete block, but in order to use a tile after someone else does, you again have to place extra meeples of the same color on the tile. What color meeples people have are secret so you may or may not be blocked when people do this to you and it is a part of the strategy in the game as well. These are just a few examples of mechanics that you thought you had seen done before executed differently. I really like this game and may have to check out other games in this, "Key Land".

Quite a good Key game.  There's complexity, but you don't play with all the tiles at a time, so you can ease yourself into it.  There are very few rounds, but they last a long time as you agonize over your decisions...like a Wallace game.  Fun engine building!

Keyflower is a game that has really grown on me recently. Many of the elements in the game are borrowed from other games, but the mix is original. Auction bidding, bluffing, tile-placement and even recource-managment are all parts of this brilliant design. When you first look at the game you will probably think that is not much depth to it because of the Carcasonne -feel with meeples and cute little city-tiles.

The decisions in this game are though, despite how the game look, very hard to make. I have a feeling this is a game that will stick. The more I play it, the more I like it.

Played pre-release version. The familiar Breese traits of multiple options in this Key game are present, but in this game resource cubes are used to upgrade resource hextiles, rather than converted into different cubes. This change from other Key games makes Keyflower have a fresh feel. 

The games has 4 rounds each of which present a myriad of options, which means that games will be radically different. Player interaction is high as there is bidding for all hex tiles and you can use other player's tiles as well as your own. The number of choices you have is high and you need an initial game to get the hang of these. 

Early days yet but this might be the best Key game.

RATING: 5
A very good game but there's not enough here to interest me.  It's about building an engine, of sorts, in order to score more VP than your opponents.  But the engine is assembled in pieces and you don't know most of the major VP parts until Autumn (the third season).  Also, the person or persons who lose out on the boats get screwed on meeples and meeples = power so they're really kicked in the shins.  The disparity there really annoys me, as does the fact that the engine is obtuse until the game unfolds enough to inform you.  Not for me.

It's a beautiful design with lots of nifty parts. But it doesn't work for me. I think the problem is that it feels aimless. I don't feel like I can form a long term strategy, and the moment to moment scramble feels a bit random.

1st play: very impressive game. For a long time I've wanted to try this and I'm glad I did. Great spatial city building elements combined with the tile flipping I like in Brass and oodles of meeples. Bonus point for the purple waving meeple. Being able to use another player's building but at the cost of giving them future workers is excellently implemented.

2nd play: The game was still good, the workers grow very smoothly, and I approached the game from a different angle this time. I didn't focus on worker acquisition, and instead aimed to flip as many tiles as possible. I was able to pull off a victory with a couple of high point tiles. My complaint with this game is that some end game tiles are worth 30 points, and some are worth 6, and that can create some huge swings in points. But it doesn't prevent me from liking the game.

I liked this game a lot. I played a game from William Attia (Caylus) called Spyrium and it reminds me of Keyflower. But Keyflower is a more deep and clever game than Spyrium (that I liked, too).

Was expecting much more after reading comments. Turns out the meeples got from the bag have a strong effect to the auctions, if you don't get the right color you are out from some auctions, or if one player gets the final season (winter) tile you were looking at, you are done. Too bad because it could have been one of the best game for 6 players. A missed opportunity.

I've played this over 50 times online now, and I haven't grown the least bit tired of it yet. Can't wait to play my copy with expansions. I've played mostly two player, though also with three and four. I like the lower player counts the most. It has a strange feeling of being a very open game, while also being tense and cut-throat. Openness in that you can increase your bid for a tile, or even remove your bid and use the bidded workers somewhere else. You can even place your workers on a tile that is up for bid and use its action. You can use tiles in your own village for their action, or in another player's village. You can use a space that has already been used by a worker by simply using the same color of worker there, plus one (so if there is one yellow worker on the tile, you can take that action by putting two yellow workers on that tile, up to a maximum of three workers). Even the main final scoring tiles are up for auction and can be bid on by all players (each player gets a hand of three final scoring tiles at the start of the game, kept secret, and then must put at least one out for auction, or even all three). The game is cut-throat in that you can outbid a player for a tile they really need, or even block them from using their own tile in their village You maybe see that the worker batch your opponent took last round was almost entirely yellow and red workers, with one blue...you have several blue workers, so on your first move, you put two blue workers on that space, assuming he doesn't have three to use to activate it. Or, you can be very mean and just put three workers on a tile and completely block your opponent from using it. So while you are building your own village and taking actions that will let you upgrade your village tiles, maximize scoring opportunities, etc., you can also block your opponent from acquiring and/or using tiles.

A game that definitely rewards strategy and experience which is a big pro for me. On the other hand I believe that this will be difficult to bring other players in without having to 'go easy on them' for a few games.

A clear understanding of what tiles are available is absolutely necessary in order to score well and develop a strong strategy. Otherwise it's just shooting in the dark and a 'roll of the dice' whether you will score anything.

I love the light hearted art on top of a potentially ruthless game. I enjoy 'take that' and this is rife with it. Good use of risk/reward; do I spend my meeples to do this, or is it going to burn me because the other player has something up their sleeve?

We've only played a few times but I expect the more we play, the stronger the strategies and secondary strategies/tactics will become resulting in big surprises.

Not quite a 9 yet, but I could see it move up to it after a few more plays.

Play this at a private gathering we have every year with 5-6 players.  LOVE this one.

It is just not in my collection because I love it at 4-6 players most and it is pretty uncommon that I have 4 fairly hardcore gamers ready to play this one.  My 1-2 plays at our yearly gathering has to get me through. Thankfully there are so many amazing games these days that this works out very well for me.  I always look forward to playing this one again.

The expansion to add livestock to the game I found pretty neutral.  It was fine, but I would have been just as happy without it.  It does not hurt the game but also did not add much to me.  If I played this game more then the added variety would probably have been very welcome.

I like the aesthetics of Keyflower and the auctioning of tiles to expand your settlement area works nicely. I think it's a good, solid design (lots of familiar mechanics with a new flavor)--but something about it doesn't quite excite me as much as other similar games. The replay value seems good because you don't get to see all the tiles every game, but the combos you can build are just okay. I think that might be the piece missing for me--more interesting tile interactions.

A very nice game which blends auction, worker and tile placement all together in! There is enough luck in some tiles that may not come out and in the luck of the draw for the initial meeples and the stuff in the boats later on but I believe that's what makes this game interesting. It plays well with any player count but as there are more players there is more chaos and more downtime. With less players you feel you can handle the game more and follow a certain path to victory. A very pleasant surprise for me, I love Carcassonne by the way and it's my favourite light euro game so I'd say this is Carcassonne advanced for me!

RATING: 7
I really like the mechanisms and how you're balancing several things at once as you portion out your meeples. I really like that the game gives you a wide and not too scripted range of paths to build and end up with a competitive score. On that basis, I want to give the game an 8 (a "great" game) since it's quite impressive how well it achieves those two things. But I can't. I can only give it 7 (a merely "good" game).

It has quite a few flaws that bring it down.

Firstly, the game is too short. You get four rounds to build an engine and then it ends. That's problematic because the first round your engine doesn't do anything, the second round it still doesn't do anything, the third round you realize that you still don't have a working motor, you're already halfway done, you don't know what tiles are going to come out, and you're really only going to have one chance to crank the motor and see what happens. The capabilities of the times would allow you to make something cool and multifaceted, but you're going to be stopped short and forced to go with a one trick pony. And that's all assuming that where you are at the end of the second round provides the foundation of a few possible engines and that, in the third and fourth rounds, tiles that are synergetic with what you've got going will come out, and that your opponents don't screw you up in some major way. There's really no room for error. While that makes it tense, it's a bunch of tenseness in aim of getting one successful crank on a one trick pony motor (woo), that you really were forced into based on the limitations of what showed up that was synergetic, and it makes it feel like the end game is a bit random. Were the tiles that you had to go for in rounds three and four a good high scoring combo or simply all you could do given the time constraints? High familiarity with the game might allow you to figure out how to start the engine so it leaves more high scoring options in place for later in the game (similar to knowing the best opening chess moves), but then you're just doing the prescribed motions for a full half of the game.

It's really half as long as it should be to have proper early, mid, and late games. But to achieve that, without turning it into an AP fest with anything more than 2 players, it would probably mean redesigning and rebalancing all of the tiles so that a larger map was feasible without raising the combinatoric potential of all action sequences too large. (Maybe implement "summoning sickness", raise the upgrade costs, and bump the transport distances?) As is, I'd probably suggest playing the game two player only and performing each season (except winter) twice, for the best experience.

My second issue with the game is that the iconography isn't terribly good. There's a basic hieroglyph system that it starts with that seems relatively straightforward. But already by season 2, that goes right out the door by introducing ongoing effects without any clear marker that this is the case. End game bonuses are introduced as a box within a box - except when they aren't. One of the meeple boats gives up and switches to English to tell us what the end game bonus is. It's fairly evident that the symbologist that developed the tiles decided at some point to give up in creating a language and, instead, simply created a "memory aid".

This is problematic, since it means that the person teaching the game has to spend with a bit of advance work talking about the special rules to do with the turn order tiles, the special rules with the meeple boats, explain some of the winter tiles, etc. And then during the game, at the start of each season, go over the powers of the tiles that were just set down.

The special rules would have been better dispensed with, given how flexible the basic engine of the game is. Just give us a set number of meeples each round, or build them into the tiles we add to our farms, or make the economy retain meeples rather than throwing them back into the bag each round. Don't build in the preset endings, just give us a longer game so that we can build our own engine.

Overall, the game is three times longer to teach than it needs to be, and the extra stuff doesn't benefit the game because all of the same things could have been accomplished with the systems that are already there or simpler systems.

And lastly, the issue is just theme. This effectively ties back into my issue with how few rounds the game has, but where I said before that there are mechanical issues with the shortness of the game, there's also the problem that you just don't feel like you're building a town. In my first game, I quickly decided that I wanted to be the "wood shaper", based on my early acquisitions. I was hoping that I would be able to get an early start in wood collection, move that up into crafting, sell my goods to other people, upgrade my wood crafters, and eventually start creating boats.

That's not there. You can make wood or you can make lots of wood. There's no real further progression on that path. Even with a longer game, a larger town, and all the combinatorics in the world, I would never have been able to do anything beyond amassing one of the simple types of resources.

In a game like Glen Moore, that doesn't bother me since nothing ever starts out looking like anything but an abstract Euro. And you have the combo action starting straight from turn 2 and lasting all of the way to the end. It makes up for its lack of story building by staying a small, simple, abstract game.

Keyflower feels too involved, the art looks too good, the farm looks too much like a farm, the meeples feel too much like workers and money (two real world, thematic things), and so I personally feel like I should be able to "build a farm".

With worse art and the ability to build a better engine that I could run a few times, maybe I'd overlook it, just as I do with Glen Moore, but that's not the game we have today.

Overall, I don't know that the game is significantly better or worse than Glen Moore or Glass Road - probably the two closest comparisons to Keyflower - but it feels like it could have been a lot better than both of those with a few small changes, and that seems like a loss worth complaining about.

I love this game. Only thing holding it back from being a 10 is the cumbersome end-game scoring. Ugh.

RATING: 8
Impressed with the design after one play. The tension between setting a bid color / using tiles before they get expensive / deciding what to do with resources is all fantastic, and it really has a solid sense of progress and escalation into the final round that is tense as all get out. Soft passing really elevates it too, though there is usually so much you want to do that even a soft pass is risky. Excited to play more

Beautiful, smart, fun and challenging worker placement game. This pretty much does it all: drafting, bidding, adding tiles onto your town, and screwing over everyone around you.

RATING: 9
There really isn't another game quite like Keyflower.  This worker-placement/auction hybrid...thing is based around a clever little system of matching-colored meeples being used to purchase and use various tiles in a series of pilgrim villages.  It's got solid weight to it and the strategy space is huge, plus it looks great and plays well anywhere in its range - a rare thing for a game.

I am, however, really bad at it =[

My main issue is that the variance can be really nasty at lower player counts - we've had games where no iron generating tiles are revealed at all, and games where someone goes deep into wood and no VP tiles for wood are revealed at all.  I guess that's what that Summer boat is for...

Keyflower brings some new ideas to the well worn theme of assembling a village tile by tile, with each one producing something different when workers are placed on it.  I liked the possibility of producing using other people's tiles and those available for auction this turn.  That and the first meeple placed on a tile setting the colour that others may use, bring some interesting possibilities for screwage.  I also liked that players know what some end game bonus tiles will be and choose how many will come into play.  Knowing the tile mix is important, for instance that you will see all the tiles that produce resources in the first turn. 

So Keyflower offers plenty of options and lots to consider.  I have played it three times now and it has been edging upwards in my estimation.  An efficiency game for sure, but one that brings a great deal of interaction to the genre. 

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.  We found the rules rather wordy and vague on one or two points.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Keyflower is a great example of lots of mechanics going into a blender and managing to come out in perfect unity. You have worker placement, tile laying, dynamic auctions, set collection, hidden goals, variable turn order, pick up and deliver, resource conversion, and pretty boats. It's a remarkably fast-playing game for how much depth of interaction is present inside the box. The footprint is small, the upkeep is minimal, and the bluffing element of the (gorgeous) player screens heightens the tension as it encourages careful observation along with strategic and tactical play.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
Um, not to be a cop-out, but all of it. Seriously, so many familiar Eurogame trademarks are present in this game, but they gel together so well. For instance, in Spring, you're mostly just bidding on tiles, but then those tiles (and those from subsequent seasons) end up in your personal village and can be used without losing your meeples to the supply. Your engine begins to coalesce as you combo tiles together and begin to aim for end-game scoring. Other players use your village and give you their meeples, and vise versa. Action economy becomes paramount and color-blocking tiles becomes cutthroat and vicious. Winter tiles come out and it's a total knife fight, all with the humming of your personal scoring engine running full-tilt in the background.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Depending on what tiles come out each season, there are (I think) a few strategies that can be overpowered in terms of action economy. Getting all of the meeple buildings and having a very imbalanced number of actions in comparison to other players, getting green meeples early to snipe critical tiles that you know other players are relying upon (especially in Winter!), and grabbing all available transportation + that one summer boat to use with the Keyflower after Winter all have potential for landslide victories. This is all to say that each session requires careful attention paid to the meta in order to keep everyone in check. This is both a strength and weakness, I think.

Rating based on just the first couple of games, so is likely to move. But the mechanics are great, the decisions, timing, sequence of doing stuff, etc., give lots of things to think about. The randomness of tiles appearing will mean games will appear fairly fresh for ages. Looks likely to be a real winner.

Initially overwhelming it becomes a solid worker placement with resource exchange engines. The only minor issues I had were the classic euro symptom of the kingmaker player who is not eligible to win but can screw anyone gunning for a win. The other problem is the sheer mass of info from the tiles. Never play this with AP guys. I played with 6 but i think that 4 to 5 might be a better player count.

RATING: 8
This is a well designed and interesting game, a fun and amusing variation on the standard worker placement mechanic.

You place your workers (which come in four separate bidding colors) on your designated bidding position on a euro-engine tile in the "shopping area" that you want to add to your tableau/village at the end of the round.  The number of workers you place down represents your bid.  If other players also want that euro-engine tile, they must place a greater number of their meeples, of the bidding color that you established with your first bid.  Any higher bids free up your workers to go somewhere else in that round.  Highest bidder wins the tile at the end of the round, and adds the euro engine tile to their village with some spatial considerations to take into account.  

Winning bidder meeples are "spent" and losing bidder meeples return to the player's supply for later use. At the beginning of each round, players sequentially and strategically select new boats of "arriving meeples," carrying randomly assigned meeple colors (for example 3 red meeples, 1 yellow, and 1 blue) to add to their supplies. 

Alternatively, rather than use your meeples to bid for a tile, you can use your workers to activate tiles, which provide euro effects, like obtaining resources, converting things to other things, transporting resources within your village, or flipping tiles which then provide VP's.  This is where the engine building can take place. 

And you can activate euro effect tiles in your village, in which case, very helpfully, these meeples are NOT spent, but come back to you in the next round.  Or, you can activate tiles in other people's villages, but at the end of the round, they will get those meeples! Or, very curiously, you can activate tiles that have not yet been won at the auction, in which case, these meeples go the player who wins the tile at the end of the round.  Wow, the permutations!

Thus, this game, when played seriously, can present mind blowing worker placement analysis issues, at least when I played with four.  The worker placement predictions, and analysis, can get VERY deep by the third (Fall) and fourth (Winter) rounds.

Decent, but might be the most overrated board game (in terms of praise and cult following). 

Not as strategic and "player interactive" as people claim, and the weight is more like 2.7 in my opinion.

Smudges too many mechanics togheter and ends up being just decent at each of them. The pickup and deliver mechanic is just boring and fiddly, and should have been removed in the playtesting process to focus on the auction aspect. 

If i want to scratch a particular itch, my group would prefer other games depending on mechanic, example Modern Art (auction) or Waterdeep (elegant worker placement).

There are not a lot of auction/bidding games that we can get behind just because we loath those mechanics. But here is one we like. This one we tried out as a lark at a demo during the Dice Tower convention. But boy are we glad we did. The similarities between this game and Peleponnes is what drew us in though there are numerous differences. You bid on location tiles to add to your tableau just like Peleponnes but instead of just getting resources , you get to activate abilities on those tiles that benefit you. The art is stylish with iconography that is easy to understand. Not sure if any of the other Key-universe games are for us but this one certainly is.

March 2013: A quirky worker-placement auction game that seems to play very well with two.  The game both wants you to build an economy and barely gives you any time to run it.  The central mechanic is the bidding mechanism, which makes your collection of available workers perhaps your most important resource.

Keyflower has simple rules but the mechanics come together in a way that doesn't make intuitive sense right away. However, after a couple of seasons it comes together really well and people take to it if they've played some Euros before. I felt like it felt really fresh and had a great time with it. During the game I felt like I was ahead the first 3/4 of the game, but the secret winter tiles which give people variable end-game scoring were pivotal and sent me to the back of the pack. It felt like there were many different paths to victory and each of us in our game explored different strategies. Over time it could get stale, but the variable tiles help add a lot of replayability. During the game I always felt like I was one move short of really kicking ass, and I like that tension feeling in a game. The ability to use other players tiles helped bring a lot of interaction, and the auction phase made this one really stand out. I love engine building games and auction games, and Keyflower marries the genres beautifully.

Wrinkly exceptions in the rules, and I'd like to see how certain strategies play out longer-term (stashing meeples for the end round resulted in a total landslide in our first 5P game), but I think there's a heck of a lot worth revisiting here. More or less gamer's Caylus with a nicer production is how I'd describe it.

Auction games often involve money and bidding and are filled with audio only.  But this game is like a visual auction.  the placement of meeples as your 'bid' on the tiles that are up for grabs really has a nice game experience feel.  Once the auction for tiles is over, the game shifts to a tile-laying game with a bit of a solitaire flare.  While much of the game functions in very familiar ways, the overall experience has a very different feel.  And it's one that is quite rewarding.  The design is flexible enough to permit several expansions - both large and small - and all of them work well.  while not for casual gamers, this game works really well for gamers and soon to be gamers.  This is an excellent addition to any library and if there should see repeated plays over the years.  It will likely stand up over time.

Love the mechanics and the interactivity.  Love the hordes of wooden meeples.

I do, however, wish the goal of the game was a bit more focused (and less point salad-y).  In my first play (3p), no one went out of their way to interfere with each other's strategy (typical 3p issue), and everyone had ample ways to get points.  The game was extremely close (final scores of 58-58-61), but was somewhat devoid of tension. I'm hoping this was just due to our inexperience, and that a better understanding of the optimal scoring opportunities will increase competition (and thus fun!)

Also really wish those damn boats had better names.

Edit: Game improves with experience. Clearer tierlist --> sharper competition.  Mechanics still awesome.

Absolutely lovely elegant bidding mechanism, great tight play, and wonderful art style. Somewhat punishing for mistakes made in the early game (particularly overbidding, so you have far fewer keyples available in further turns), but I already know that The Merchants will balance out a lot of that. Surprised by how well it plays with 6, though table-space is very tight with that many.

An astonishingly well-designed game that packs auctions, worker-placement, and pick-up-and-delivery mechanics in a very refreshing and interesting way. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, has an immense amount of replayability, and an unusual amount of interaction for a euro. The end result is a wonderfully tense, elegant, and brain-burning game that keeps delivering. 

If I had to complain about anything... I don't like the player shields. They look/feel cheap.

It's a fairly abstract point churner. It's also not a particularly forgiving game for new players; if you don't know where you are building your town, you'll do very poorly. The tiles (particularly the winter "6-cost" tiles) can be miserly in power they give out points. You can't just have stone for the stone building to count them; you have transport to you tile itself. Likewise, if a meeple is counted towards one tile, it doesn't count towards the other.

Still, the system is clever, such as in how the "engine-building" tiles become point generating tiles in the end. It goes surprisingly quick at lower player counts.

Good game, deep with strong player interaction (crazy bidding wars).
However, the sheer amount of choices to consider makes it a big brain burner. Due to 'Analysis Paralysis' downtime increases and consequently is not as much fun as it could be.

Love the meeple placement mechanic but the game has never felt rewarding. No payoff and although I appreciate games that leave you wanting more actions this leaves me wanting a ton of more actions. 

Yes it has some mechanics I really like and I think objectively its better than "ok". However, for my taste, it otherwise falls perfectly into the description for a "6" game.

I love the concept behind this one. A game where you build something, and collect resources to buy further stuff and upgrade your existing stuff? Sign me in.

It's sad, then, that the game is soooo much AP prone. There's just too many things to do with your resources, and finding how to use them effectively is really tough. I usually hate games with a ton of options at the time, but this one gets a better score from me because of its underlying mechanisms of auctions, building and resource management.

Lots of decisions.  Intuitive game play based on Sebastian's novel bidding system.  Each game different due to varying tile mix.  All actions are positive.  Indirect player action through the game mechanism in common with other later 'Key' games makes for an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience.  Always happy to play.

RATING: 9
only played 2-player so far.

My first play felt a little strange.  It felt very much that the game just abruptly ended just as it was really getting interesting.  Also (and this is to be expected I think) the bidding was very tame.

The second game was completely delightful.  The feel (in terms of weight and play time) reminds me of something like Glen More or Welcome to Walnut Grove.  All these games feel like a refinement of some of the heavier modern Euros (like Agricola).  With a better grip on the flow of the game and the value of the tiles there was lots to think about and the bidding more cut-throat.

There's a lot of really interesting decisions in the game especially in the timing of certain plays.  

With 2-players the play time is brisk (but I suspect that 3+ will introduce more down-time due to analysis)

Looking forward to playing again.

Kíváncsi voltam az egyik legnagyobb 2012-es esseni favoritra. Nem rossz, de talán egy kicsit többet vártam tőle. Ez a 3. key, amit próbáltam, és kb. azonos játékélményt adott mindhárom játék. Na jó, a Keyflower talán egy árnyalatnyival jobb, minta másik kettő... A legjobban a licites rész tetszik... egy kicsit Amun-re-s, de annál összetettebb. A többféle licitszín nagyon eredeti ötlet!! A téli épületeket viszont annak ellenére lutrinak érzem, hogy egy részét ismerhetem végig... Ami nem tetszett, mert nehézkes volt, az a szállítás része, szinte teljesen használhatatlannak éreztem, ami azért gond, mert az épületek nagy része nyersanyaggal fejleszthető. Nem rossz játék ez, szívesen játszom máskor is, de nem átütő szerintem. Bár az is hozzátartozik a történethez, hogy az elején a szabállyal egy kicsit szenvedtünk, ez nyilván levont az élményből! Na majd legközelebb talán jobban tetszik.
---
Újabb próba: most jobban tetszett, de nem értem mit keres a top25 helyen. Nem annyira érzem letisztultnak továbbra sem, hogy a fenébe jön a képbe pl. a "nyári hajók" lapkatípus... Minek? Nem elég hogy van kezdőlapkánk, hajók, sorrendlapkák, meg a 4 évszak? Minek a nyáron belül még egy külön kategória? 
A zöld emberek jó kis taktikázást visznek bele, ez tetszik viszont.

A szabályt meghallgatva olyan semmilyennek tűnt...
Aztán a játék végére izzadt a tenyerem és éreztem, hogy kell a játék!

Egy év négy évszakján keresztül kell a kis településünket fejlesztgetni. Egy évszakban lapkákat szerzünk 3+1 fajta embereink kiküldése által, esetleg a saját, vagy az ellenfelek településein dolgoztatjuk őket a településünk felvirágoztatása érdekében.
Igen ötletes a licit rész (3+1 színű meeple által), Carcassonne-san jópofa a település a licit során megszerzett lapkák általi építése (út-úttal való csatlakozás). A nyersanyagszerzés elmaradhatatlan, továbbá a településünk "épületeinek" fejlesztése "logisztikai ismereteket" kíván.
Szóval az egész végtelenül egyszerű, de mégis komplex.

A játék címét megismerve kerestem a címben szereplő "virágot"...
Aztán rá kellett jönnöm, hogy talán azért "flower", mert a játék az idő előre haladtával úgy "nyílik ki" mint egy virág. 
A nyári és őszi évszakokban egyre több elérhető akció közül választhatunk (pl. Le Havre)

A játékidő abszolút elfogadható, a tartozékok minősége teljesen rendben van. Nekem tetszik a "KEY...." játékok stílusa. A tavalyi KeyMarket után ismét egy nagyszerű játék!
Szóval abszolút "Highly recommended"...!

Great game. Six plays at Richmond BGG with 4 players. It's definitely a keeper, offering lots of difficult decisions and interaction - though it can lead to some AP and become overly slow. Took well over 2 hours to complete first game. Also, some combos seem very powerful - second game I got the Keywood and Sawmill next to each other and amassed 42 points from the Sawmill alone! (Managed the same with the Mine and the Blacksmith to similar effect in third game (33 points). Managed 50 points with Skill tiles alone on fourth game!) However, with more plays, people become more aware of these possible combos and blocking them becomes much more likely.

RATING: 8.5
Quite original in the feeling.  Using your pawns, you can use tiles in your village and in other players village, use tiles from the table, or bid to get them to your village.  During three seasons you try to get the best tiles and more workers, and the final season you bid for scoring tiles.
Bidding and using tiles uses a color mechanism like the one in Asara.  If you use a tile with a blue pawn, the following players can only use it with two or threes blue pawns.  The incremental number has been used afterwards in Coal Barons.
All in all, quite intelligent and fun game.  Very nice design and production.

A good bidding/resource management euro with a spatial element. There is some innovation in the bidding mechanic. A light resource management game. I did not like the fact that the opponents can dictate which kind of workers are needed to activate your own actions, but there are ways to compensate. Not perfect, but good overall.

Ruthless mix of action selection and auctions. Keyflower looks like a peaceful village building game, but is in fact a war zone. Save for destroying your opponent's tiles, pretty much everything else is allowed. Careful planning is definitely rewarded, but always having a Plan B is almost mandatory.

Great strategy game that plays well with up to 6 players!
Innovative bidding mechanism with meeples as currency, and a worker placement phase going on parallel with the bidding phase. All played over four seasons, during which players build their own little colonies, and transport resources to upgrade tiles for victory points and enhanced abilities.

Possibly one of the best games of 2012!

Keyflower brings again to the table that distinctive "Key" feel through original mechanics and the usual great art from the Breese family, with an innovative game that's great even with 2 players.

The game lasts only four seasons, with each season bringing in the game a bunch of new village tiles. Players compete with bids to secure the preferred village tiles and add them to their village.
If this sounds not very innovative, one must consider that:
- there are meeples in three (plus one) different colors, but they're not associated with any player: they're simply different "nationalities" of immigrants, that "don't get along easily" with others
- on his turn, a player simply uses one or more of his meeples to place a bid on a tile (if won, it will be added to owner's village) OR activate a tile (own, of another player OR still up to bid!) for various benefits
- unlike many other worker placement games, once a tile is activated, it can be activated again by anyone simply by placing more workers OF THE SAME COLOR

The game is amazingly tight and full of meaningful decisions, even with just 2 players: for such a mid-weight and quite short game, that's amazing!

Initial tentative rating is an 8, but I can see it going up if it can stand repeated plays (and I don't really see why it wouldn't, given the potential for replayability due to the different mix of tiles dealt in each game...)!

I really enjoy the bidding mechanic where we use different colored meeples then you get to build the village from scratch. Each village is uniquely different from other players. I thought that was brilliant. Have to try the expansion with 6 players to see how things goes. So far, I really enjoyed it.

Initial Impression: Despite the presence of a horde of meeples, this euro game feels as if it breaks the "euro-mold". Sure, you place workers in order to activate tiles for their abilities. Yes, you collect resources to upgrade your tiles to increase efficiency and collect more VPs at the end of the game. However, placing multiple meeples in order to win tiles in an auction mechanism similar to Cyclades makes the game feel more interactive than many similar styled eurogames. The game moves at a brisk pace and has a staccato tempo as players quickly place meeples to outbid their opponents. Even the point salad ending doesn't feel laborious but rather helps to clearly define long term strategies for the players. I hope to play more of this game in the near future.

intregating game : only two actions and three and a half season, unbelievable how much you can do in this game. It looks like you will have not enough time to do everything you want.

Excellent auction game that might have one mechanism too many. The variety of tiles ensures each game plays differently. The tension of the auction and round-to-round decisions make for an exciting, engaging game that I will gladly play.

Update, Sept 2017:  The bidding with the various colored "Keyples" is great. The green color Keyple is great. The variation among the tiles is great. The ability to use your opponents' tiles is great. The movement puzzle, while adding to the game's variation (one of its strengths, no doubt) still feels, to me, a bit disjointed or superfluous. In essence, that feeling is rooted in the fact that so much of Keyflower is interactive, but the movement puzzle is not. It kind of breaks the cohesive feel to the game. Still, Keyflower is a great game if you want a contemplative, yet interactive, euro-style experience.

Keyflower has some randomness issues in terms of which tiles come out in later seasons.  I also highly dislike placing spent green meeples back into the draw bag for it sounds way too random.  For example, if you take an action in which you draw random meeples, you may luck out with 1 or more green dudes.  However, the randomn tiles should make the game replayable.  I do like the auctions, the tile placement decisions and the handing over of your meeples when playing on an opponent's tile.

A very intriguing game that starts harmless but quickly escalates into a very think-y and brain-burning game.
In the 3rd and 4th (of 4 rounds) you have a plethora of options but only a limited amount of actions and have to figure out how to maximise your score.

In the last round of the game there are only scoring goals on display and player bet (as they usually do in Keyflower) to get those scoring tiles that fit them best. A very neat concept because you have to diversify in different paths from the beginning of the game to keep your options open in this last round.

RATING: 9
This is an interesting mix of Agricola and Carcassonne.  Very good at 2 players, and seems like it would scale well all the way up.  First game or two are slow while you figure out all the symbols, but the rulebook is very good, and once you know what you're doing, you can fly through the four rounds.  A little more fiddly than feels necessary (the game would have worked just as well without the green meeple and with one less skill and resource, for example), but other than that, very tight and smooth when you know what you're doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The central auction / resource management ideas in this game is really interesting and fun.  Basically you start with 8 random meeples of different currencies and when you bid on a tile with one or more meeples of the same colour you set that as the currency for that tile.  Equally that tile can be played on as a resource as long as there is colour consistency.  It is an auction game matched with a tile placement game with a little pick up and deliver.  It does reward knowing the tiles so it is a fun game for the first time you play but can see this getting more interesting if you are playing this with the same group multiple times.  In future plays I will enjoy the different flavour that the different seasons have but in first game this just upped the strategy learning curve.  Its certainly fun to play.  I have the merchants expansion and like what it adds to the game.  It makes it more beginner friendly because there are more ways to get points including ways that other people cannot outbid you for.  Wouldnt want to play every game with the expansion stuff but adding the tiles to the mix will create the right blend for me.

:d10-3:
Great design. Poor development. Nothing is technically wrong with the development, but two choices stick out as particularly annoying to me.

One, the hidden information. Besides the obvious no-no of HBTI, the strategy, tactics, and brinkmanship are severely hampered by playing blindly. I fixed that by always playing without the player shields. MUCH improved.

Two, the whole geographical portion of the game - tile placement, transportation of resources, and some victory point tiles. It doesn't really add anything to the game, as you can't plan for this feature during the main portion of the game, yet you have to devote a portion of your brain to figuring out optimal placement and movement of resources at various parts of your turn. The game would be shortened by ~25% and be focused on the really good parts of the game if this whole geographical portion had been excised. There's no house rule fix for this, but I wish buildings and resources had been dealt with like Le Havre.

As long as you're playing with open information, the wonderful use of keyples as resources is worth dealing with the bad parts of the game. 

12/8/2012: Feels a little like Glen More's big brother, with the tile placement and resource production. The keyples, through the bidding and the action placement, are easily the best part of the game. I can't wait to try this with 3 or 4 players.

Very clever mechanisms combine to make this a deep and strategic affair where you need to keep an eye out for what your opponants are up to. Plenty of opportunity for screwage and engine building. Multiple route to victory. This is my sort of game.

I love the mix of auctions and worker placement. Workers can be played either as bids to purchase tiles or on tiles to activate an effect. The simple rule that you have to follow the color of meeple already played makes each decision brilliantly tense. The game is highly interactive and tactical. An overall strategy is a good guiding force, but it must adapt to the actions of other players and also which tiles are randomly available.

It feels like there is a pretty good amount of game here, but it also feels like it's over as you are getting revved up.  It did play fast, but I expected more strategy from the different opportunities that seemed to be available.  It ain't bad, but not great either.  I think it could be better with 4 people... And now I know that it is because I played with 4 and liked it more.

Now, I've received this game as a gift so I'll get more chances to see how it works.  I played it with 4 again and it's really good; it also really dragged a bit, but I can see that with more plays that would change.  I hope I get those more plays.  I could see this moving to an 8 rating for me.

I really wanted to love this worker placement/auction hybrid but was lukewarm on it instead, and I can't quite pinpoint why.

I wouldn't mind playing it some more to see if either I enjoy it more or at least figure out why it doesn't work as well for me as I originally thought it would.

My very first "key" game and I really rather enjoyed it. One of those games with quite simple rules but a lot going on and plenty of opportunity for screwage and overbidding. Good stuff.

3 plays in and I still haven't worked out how to get a high score. Frustrating but still fun.

Boring beyond measure, Keyflower is one of those dry European games that pass themselves off as sophisticated and intellectual just because they proudly bear not even a grain of theme or fancy whereas actually they can be easily exploited simply by playing them thoughtlessly and recklessly: as a matter of fact everything in the game - from the tiles selection to the workers placement up to the «strategies» you choose to carry out - is just random, which means you only have to hamper your opponents in order to make the best out of each turn. 

...and, above all, even to add something interesting to do to a game that otherwise would be terribly plain and tiresome.

I really like Keylower, it clicked with me in every way possible. I have some people around who didn't find it that good as some other eurogames, and they complain a lot about luck factor of meeple draws from the bag. I didn't find it decisive in any game I played. Keyflower is awesome, unique, beautiful, and really really smart.

Draw bag (tool tiles)
Draw bag (meeples)

// I've only played this as a 2-player game, and I liked it 
quite a bit. On the other hand, I think it would play
quite differently with 4 or even 6 people. I liked it quite
a bit as a 2-player and I'm hoping to try it with 4 at
some point. Overall, I like the aspect of developing my
own little village, and my opponent can use my locations, 
or I can use theirs if need be, but that means I lose a
worker. Bidding for location tiles works well too - the
game is generous enough with giving you enough workers to
go around, but not so many that you don't have tough
choices to make.

Most of the ideas of this design are very clever and unique and it could very well have been one of my favourite games. What killed it for my wife and me was the fact that you never get a sense of accomplishmnent in this game. You can easily end the game with just three or four tiles in your village and moving around all those resources felt just unnecessary brain-burning and much too fiddly to us.

RATING: 6
Pretty good game.  Falls into my "simple but elegant" game list because the rules feel easy/intuitive enough to play weeks/months apart without much of a rules refresher, yet there are lots of options on your turns (especially after the first of four rounds/seasons).  I like the tough choices of how high to start the bidding and which color meeple (money) to bid with since it sets the auction color.

UPDATE 2016: you can get some really weird tile distributions, especially with 3p... we had a game with no buildings for moving goods besides the home-base tiles, and it was a very weird game.  There's just too much uncertainty in the game for me, particularly with picking tiles for the last round where you can guess really well or guess poorly and get creamed by someone who saved the right stuff for a tile you thought was safe to include in the final round.

Interesting game, but so many choices with so little time. I never quite felt like I had enough turns to make an engine. At the end whether or not you manage a certain thing on your turn or not can make a crazy point difference. It's also really hard to strategize. I also don't like the it is almost necessary to play mean, blocking your opponent from opportunities. I also don't like that you get no benefit last round from people using your tableu, though my friend said you get VP from the tiles, but for some reason I don't view that as a real exchange for maybe being locked out of my own tiles.

Update: well now I love it. Shows how wrong I can be.

Fully expecting to hate this after the rules explanation (and that wasn't the fault of the explainer!) - sounded like a typical euro worker placement game.

I was wrong - it's a pleasantly vicious worker placement/auction game, where you use your workers as currency to bid on the tiles, and once you have the tiles you can use them yourself for 'free' or use other players at the cost of losing the worker(s) to them.

Like it ...

Juego de losetas y colocación de trabajadores. En cada turno, los jugadores pujan por obtener ciertas losetas. La moneda para las pujas son los propios trabajadores. Una vez que se resuelven las pujas, las losetas te permiten construir tu ciudad, donde se generan recursos que cada uno tiene que desplazar a los sitios donde hagan falta para convertirlos en otros recursos, mejorar la loseta, etc.
La enjundia del juego está en los combos que se pueden obtener combinando las losetas. Está muy bien. Escala estupendamente. Es interesante y jugable de 2 a 5 jugadores.

I tried this game out and I really had a great time playing! I loved building up my city and connecting the roads and upgrading the tiles. I was not very good at it, I am too risky in bidding so after the first round my village was pretty sparse but I really had a great time playing. I ended up buying it anyway, even though I am not great at playing, and I'd like to also get the Farmers expansion because animals are awesome. I'm going to hold off on the Merchants expansion until I actually get more plays in and feel like things need to be shaken up.

RATING: 7
Definitely a good game, but I'm glad I didn't blind-buy this like I was planning. It features mechanics of a lot of games I love, but it didn't feel like anything new was really brought to the table. Everything from the art to the components to the game play feels like something you've seen dozens of times over, and in this case the whole didn't magically feel more than the sum of its parts. Still though, it was a good game and I would play again.

RATING: 9
Outstanding rules set with intuitive gameplay in the four seasons (rounds). Just the right amount of options for worker placement to make this an appealing game for most gamers. I like the size of the tiles which allows for easy access to information. The game allows for flexibility with workers that have become useless so players can find alternate uses for them. Bidding for the first player tile forces a choice between going first for the boat of worker/skills, or playing first in the next round, to make even that decision sometimes a tough one. This is an excellent design of balanced gameplay, and one that should have a great deal of replayability since you won't see all the village tiles in the same game. Top notch game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
For a game that looks like a dry, boring euro, this one has impressed me. This is partly due to it's interaction, which is so delicious, and a great selling point for this one. Bidding games and worker placement games tend to work well with me, so in a way it's no surprise that I like it, but this really is something of a unique beast. It feels quite different than other medium euros, and yet it's simple enough for you to grasp after a round of play, making it feel very rewarding after only ten minutes or so. One strike against it is the theme. The mechanisms are actually fairly thematic for a euro, but the theme that's there is also quite dull so it definitely does feel dry. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my first play a great deal and look forward to giving it another try.

This is the R&D version of the game.

On 2/19/2013 I finally brought this game to the table after owning it for 6 months. I need to teach it at a convention this weekend so I had to get atleast one play in before then. 

Going into the first play and the initial reading of the rules I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I primarily bought the game for the collectibility not the game play. To say I was plesently suprised by the game play would be a bit of an understatment. What I initailly thought was just a pretty box full of fantastic components turned into an intrigueing Auction/Worker Placement/Tile Laying game that really works pretty nicely. It's going to need a few more play throughs to see if there is really enough strategy and replayability for this game to raise above a 7 but I still enjoyed it.

Update - 2/26/2013

Played this at a local convention this weekend with a full group. The strategy is definatly there. The second playthrough saw me actually working towards a planned end goal. Ultimatly though I came in second to a guy scoring a ton of points off of skills.

Really an amazing design. Since each game uses a different set of tiles and has a different set of victory conditions, every game you play requires you to build an entirely new resource/worker/VP engine. I love that you can use your opponents' buildings if you need them (and can really screw up their plans by doing so). The bidding is also really tense, made even more stressful by the addition of the green workers—a brilliant touch. Definitely one of the best worker-placement games I've played, with one of the best auction systems to boot. Plays great with two.

First play was good, 3p, not too hard to teach and other players grasped it well enough that I was a distant third. 

Can see the comments about winter tiles being important but I do not think it necessarily detracts from the game because you are indeed building towards the climax (winter). Would love to get a few more plays in to decide.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, medium-heavy-weight auction-bidding/tile-laying/worker placement strategy-heavy game with a lot of path to victory, where you are building your worker placement tableau over the course of the game (not the same fix worker placement board to use for the whole game), and where you bid with your worker (they are thus also kind of a currency).
++ Great sense of escalation from the first season where you can only bid on a few tiles, to the last season where you are bidding and activating so much tiles to fulfill your strategy.
++ I like that you have the possibility to play your workers on the opponent's tableau (but thus giving them your workers) and that you also have the possibility to play your workers on the center tiles available for bid (that are still to no one yet).
++ I love that you can upgrade your tiles, by paying ressources needed, and then by just flipping it (and that your tableau slowing change season, from spring/summer green tree to autumn colored leave).
++ I like the idea of having to move resources from where they are made to where they are needed.
++ I find really interesting that we can pass during the auction phase, and then continue playing if somebody haven't pass. Great bluffing ability.
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).
++ I like that The Farmers expansion, especially when playing the official Farmer variant (with all Farmer tiles), really change de game strategies without changing the gameplay. It's refreshing and my wife particularly love this expansion.

:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- This game is really prone to Analysis Paralysis (AP), as there is so many choices, especially as the game progress, so turn can sometimes be long (especially the first turn of a new season, where you have to make a strategy for the season: what you are targeting for, what you could upgrade, how to do all this, what's your plan B, etc.).
-- This is probably the limit of brain-burning my wife is confortable to accept, so she must be in the mood for it (thus this game is harder to get to the table).
-- This game has a bit too much players interaction for my wife.
-- Harder and longer to teach to new people.
-- When using The Farmers expansion, the game is more fiddly to play because there are so much meeple/animeeple on player's tiles, so upgrading them, or just reading them at a distance is harder.

RATING: N/A
Enjoyed, but couldn't help feeling that there isn't a ton of there there. Very tactical, somewhat constrained, not a ton of options. Nicely variable, which should keep things mixing up, but like most Breese games I think this probably has about 5 plays in it before getting pretty samey. It also feels less imaginative than the other Key games - it's riffing on pretty standard euro themes.

Still, I enjoyed it, and looking forward to playing it some more. Didn't blow me away, but good for a few games I'm sure.

Terrific graphics and presentation though. Most euros could learn a lot looking at this game.

I just started playing this very highly regarded game and can firmly say that it deserves all the praise that it gets.  I've just scratched the surface of this easy to learn game that has amazing depth as far as paths to victory, strategy and tactics.  Bidding, bluffing, jockeying, engine building, semi secret goals.  I've only had the chance to play it with 2 so far and it works great but I can see how the best player count as voted by the BGG community of 4 would just sing.  Love It!

RATING: 8
Hits a sweet spot for me, as I really enjoy engine-building games, and this one has it in spades combined with a nice combo of auction (which I'm generally not a fan of, but is implemented very well here) and worker placement.

In Keyflower, workers are your currency, and they come in three different colors.  You are trying to build up a village full of useful abilities, using your men to both bid on new tiles (to get more abilities and points) while also using your men to activate the special abilities of the tiles.

The really interesting thing here is that once one color of men is used to activate or bid on a tile, only that color of men may be used to do further bidding on or activating of that tile.  So, if someone puts a blue worker on a tile to activate it, and you were hoping to bid on that tile but have no blue workers, your out of luck, and they just blocked you.  This means there is a ton of player interaction, but at the same time it doesn't feel overly confrontational.

In the last round of the game, all of the tiles are tiles that score players bonus points rather than having more abilities.  Each player knows a handful of these tiles that might come out, so during the first 3/4 of the game, you work toward these goals since they are a lot of the points that will be scored.  So, you'll be trying to focus on a set of tiles with abilities that allow you to exploit these last round tiles.

Overall, just a great mash-up of engine building, auction (but not your standard auction!), and worker placement, with many strategies and avenues to explore.

Great bidding system with very unique and cool mechanics overall. unfortuantely games i've played recently have taken longer than they should due to AP and I know a few of the winter tiles are a little overpowering if you know how to take advantage of them against unexperienced players. Still i think any strong strategy can be blocked or challenged by experienced players so i rate this highly.

[floatleft][ImageID=1402873][/floatleft][size=11][b][thing=122515][/thing][/size][/b] is on the lighter side of the [family=48][/family] titles I've encountered.  That's not to say it's shallow, however.  In fact, I believe [thing=122515][/thing] has quite a bit of potential, the extent of which is not yet apparant after just one play (a two-player affair at that). 

The core of the game is a four-round auction for building tiles that, when won, are added to a player's individual village.  The tiles generally either produce generic resources or permit you to translate those resources into victory points.  With the addition of restrictions on tranporting goods between tiles, the construction of buildings in a players' village is a logistical puzzle reminscent of [thing=12681][/thing].  The key (no pun intended) is that players can simultaneously participate in the auction (paid for in workers) while employing their workers to activate any of the buildings on the table.  The resultant play provides an interesting sequencing puzzle intertwined with a highly clever mechanism for re-allocating the game's fundamental currency.[floatright][imageID=1402899][/floatright]

Notwithstanding its positives, aspects of [thing=122515][/thing] fell flat in my first game.  First is that the game is highly random.  Workers and other beneficial tiles are blindly drawn, as are the tiles eavailable each game. Additionally, by the fourth season (of four), I began to feel overly distracted the production and scoring opportunities.  It felt like our game tipped by the end from something clever to yet-another generic efficiency puzzle.  If you are a fan of those aspects of [thing=66362][/thing] and [thing=70149][/thing], [thing=122515][/thing] is certainly worth a look as a novel twist on similar ideas (in a beautiful package, as should go without saying).

Lovely worker placement style game but the workers go to your opponents if you use their tiles. You also lose guys to bid on new tiles each round. The Keyflower brings you new people and tools each turn but you have to use people to bid on first choice of these incoming boats as well. 2 Plays.

It feels like there are never enough meeples to accomplish everything you need to accomplish. It is difficult and unforgiving, and it is wonderful. It has the right puzzle/problem-solving elements mixed with a perfect amount of "how little can I commit to do this and still get away with it?". The scoring is clever and intriguing. Only good things to say about Keyflower. 

It is a master class of game design. Incredibly complex systems come out as intuitive and smooth gameplay. Yet, it is so incredibly unique. There is so much to love in using the meeples as different currencies, manipulating your village versus bringing in new tiles and materials, and knowing when to push the bidding. But what makes you really love it, are the adorable little cottages with adorable little meeples living in them!

I enjoy the building up of property that everyone can use, it's an interaction that I appreciate. It also creates a tension of short term versus long term gains in a game that only lasts four rounds.

I'm not the biggest fan of the hidden winter buildings, I think I'd prefer the game if they were visible from the beginning and we all knew what we were fighting over.

A meaty, strategically satisfying Euro with HIGH player interaction and little downtime? Yessssss.

This is kind of a rough game to learn. It's easy enough to understand (but not master) the systems in place here, but there's a reliance on familiarity with the content of the game that makes it tricky. Whenever we introduce this to people they're always confused about how to score until the very end of the game... which is when you find out how to score.

Thankfully the game moves at a nice brisk pace and has really compelling mechanics so people are generally happy enough to put up with the initial confusion.

There's a lot to consider with each turn, but not so much that it feels overwhelming. There's some minor aspects of bluffing and deduction as well, which I really enjoy. Nothing feels better than laying low, waiting for someone to pass, then swooping in and stealing a tile from them. Yesssssss, delicious pain.

It is really a brutal game. Not just in that it's competitive, but every choice is really, really tough. It's hard to scrape together enough workers to bid with, so every placement feels exceedingly important.

The only qualm I have is some of the tiles could be clearer - there are a couple aspects of the game feel unintuitive, but I really believe it's mostly an issue of how certain information is presented (i.e., that moving goods onto the winter tiles works differently etc.)

That said, esoteric iconography is my largest recurring complaint in games and though the tiles aren't pretty, we were able to figure out what almost all of them meant at first glance, so it's really a minor issue.

It also feels like it runs a round too short (sometimes you can pay through the nose for something only to never get to use it) - it always ends JUST when my engine gets going. But at least the upside is it always leaves you hungry for more!

This is how I like my heavier euro-type games. It starts small, with just a few buildings, and ramps up as the game goes on, allowing you to slowly process everything and focus on the gameplay without ever feeling overwhelmed. 

The game ends just before it becomes a chore to track everything. Nice. Plus there is a ton of satisfying interaction in the bidding, and the placement of your dudes is very tense throughout. Add in lots of variability in the building mix game to game and I think you have a keeper. 

If all resource conversion games were like this, I might even be a fan of the genre.

RATING: 7.5
Keyflower features a mix of auction, worker placement and spatial element – lovely! It’s a very good game, but after 3 plays I decreased my rating by 0.5. Why? Because the game ends too soon! It feels like you don’t have time to build up your engine, and in autumn and winter you’re rushing to activate a lot of your tiles in order to get VPs. It almost seems as if the game would have been better if it lasted for 6 seasons instead of 4… And there are certainly not many games which would get better by an extended playing time, that’s for sure! I and the rest of the players don’t feel you had time to do much if anything – and this isn’t meant in the good way as in Agricola, where you can never do anything you want. Here, there isn’t that much interesting stuff to do I think, and the seasons end too rapidly so you don’t really get to do much during the game. 

Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that I’ve only played it with 2 and 3 players, but I cannot imagine 5-6 players would increase my enjoyment and fix my issues with the game; on the contrary, I think it would bog down with many players, and only the auction part of the game would perhaps be slightly more interesting. Not that the auction doesn’t work with fewer players, it actually works very well which I was surprised by.

I normally like games in which I place my tiles in certain patterns to benefit the most from them, and while this game features this mechanic, I didn’t think it was that exciting or well-deployed. Partly because you don’t get that many tiles and partly because you always know how many roads the tiles have in each season. 

What I did like about the tiles is that only part of them come out each turn, so each game might be vastly different from the previous one, so the replayability is great (though I do need to say that many of the tiles are almost the same, but just concern the different kinds of resources etc). I also loved the fact that you get some secret winter goal tiles before the game, of which you choose at least one which is then auctioned off in the winter, so you can make a strategy about these tiles; just be sure you actually win them… Oh, and this is probably one of my favorite things about the game, and what makes the game feel new and refreshing: how you bid for tiles. You don’t have a specific player color, but instead you make a bid on a tile with one of four colored meeples, and then everybody else has to use that same color if they want to outbid you! You can also use the same color to activate a tile which is on auction, but the winner of the tile is going to get that meeple for the next round! The same applies with tiles in your opponent’s villages; you can use them, but if you do so, they will keep the meeples for the next round, so it’s always a hard decision what to do!

Keyflower is definitely a game I would be willing to play quite a bit, but is it really one I need to own when I own 200 games? I don’t think so, and neither does my wife, whose main critique equals mine; the game ends way too fast before you feel you have done anything.

I'm sick of learning new engine games at this point, so this didn't have much chance with me, especially given that it's an engine with a bunch of stuff to obfuscate running it, including the clutter of the admittedly nice-looking artwork. I should probably give this another go just because I played it so poorly on my first play (it's a worker placement game, so I probably should have built an engine for generating more workers, duh), but I've had enough strikeouts with Richard Breese games at this point that I probably won't bother.

I just love everything about this game! I love that it can play with 2-6 players well and not feel like there is too much downtime. The game just flows and is engaging for all players. My favorite part is the decision making between either bidding for a tile, or action selection with a tile. It just adds another dimension. Lots of replay with interchangeable tiles and expansions. Great game!

One thing about the game that might bother people: the game can be won or lost in the last round based on who gets (or gets denied) which bonus tiles.  But it does make the last round a nailbiter.

More fun than Ora et Labora: it's a bit less dense and you can more easily see what other player's tiles can do for you.

Good iconography.

There is an interesting meeple management aspect going on in this game. You need to keep your stock replenished so that you can do actions and bid on new action tiles, but you lose them when you do actions or bid on new tiles, unless the tiles belong to you. You replenish you guys by having others use your tiles, bidding on tiles that contain meeples, and a certain income of meeples per turn. The cool thing is they come in three colors and once you start a bid/action of that color, the other colors are locked out from that space.  Another strength of the game is it plays quite quickly with only 4 rounds. It feels very polished and the decisions are interesting. I wasn't a big fan of the carcassone style of tile laying; it just seemed superfluous to what the game was doing

Rated after 1 play so far.  Very interesting game with lots of decisions.  Quite complex to explain and probably complex to learn first game, but there are a lot of decisions with not enough time.

Keyflower is an interesting hybrid of worker placement and auction/bidding. You place meeples to bid on various tiles that are added to your tableau, or you also place meeples on tiles to activate them... your own, or the common tiles, or even other players.

I liked the game, but there's a few things that bug me. At four rounds, you don't really get to use some of those tiles that you invested in. Also, when other players play on your tiles, it's very disruptive to your plans. This makes the starting player position very important... maybe too important.

Heck it was one play, and I'd be willing to see if my opinion improved with another.

Update: a second play, and I'll bump this up to a 7. Not a game I need to own, but a game I'm certainly willing to play.

Easy enough rules with either bidding or placing workers and I love the idea of variable victory conditions with the winter tiles. However, the route/network building to transport goods and being able to place workers on your opponents tiles definitely adds to the brain burn of what you can do each turn and seems to add complexity to the game where I'm not sure I like it or feel it's necessary to have an enjoyable game.  

After not having played it in a year or so I traded for it again and enjoyed it more and have upped my rating. There is a lot to think about, but it's a lot of fun. I may consider an expansion for this, but definitely don't think it is needed.

Simple bidding and home town development game.  Get the  feeling with mixing between Carcassonne and Lehavre.  Just like it!

Keyflower…人有人緣棋有棋緣, 若單從用機制去判定Keyflower 好壞實在不易, 在Euro game 而言說機制Keyflower著實有太多缺點 , 例如 太隨機性的抽取人種 (Meeples 的顏色); 一場遊戲中你若有不濟的人種組合只有問蒼天的份兒, 抽取tile 也是隨機的; 若有不符合你預期長遠目標的tile 或給對手用你沒有的人種搶之而後快, 你一定哭訴無門。

無疑遊戲令玩家把planning 的strategy 也變成機動的tactics。本應不大討好的Euro game元素 混在一起, 理應不堪入目, 但設計師竟可運用這些元素發揮神奇的果效, 遊戲中演變成有機動策略的刺激, 把bidding 機制展现得精采, 正面的衝突也被清新的畫風淡化。 這keyflower 的作者也許刻意步處玩家要從不確定性中找取機動策略, 從而得到滿足。你若問我Keyflower好玩嗎? 我會毫不猶豫的說好, 但我會補充一句問你是否接受它的隨機元素, 若你接受, 它便與你有緣。看今天從Keyflower在BGG的排名27來看, 此棋著實有棋緣。

This game folds all of the interesting, interactive bits of euro engine building games into one very curious package that's like nothing before it.  In other words, it's asking familiar questions but in very different ways.  I can imagine this game getting really, really interesting at high levels of play and it's likely a denser, deeper title than Terra Mystica.  

Still, I've got my worries.  I don't know if I am yet playing it correctly.  I don't know if the hidden information element will turn the game into a crap shoot or if such things can be puzzled.  I don't know if, at high player counts, the game will simply become too unstable for any level of strategic planning.

As is though it is remarkable and an enjoyable two player game.  This one starts at 8 and could go as high as 9.

Update.  After about 10 plays I put this one the auction block. It's a fine game but largely a missed opportunity. Certain elements felt undercooked and missed their chance at something bigger.  Still, I loved the action/auction system and multiple currencies.  But, especially with repeated plays, there's just too much to track and too many micro exchanges.

A really fun game that combines more mechanics ( worker placement, bidding, pick up & deliver, tile laying ) than you would think possible in a reasonable length game.

teaching the game is a bit challenging by virtue of how many mechanics there are but generally after one play, people really understand how to play. this does mean that first time players generally get crushed but the advantage of experience goes away significantly once everyone has played it at least once.

also, one of the best organized rule books i can remember reading / referencing.

This game is ok however it fell flat for me because:

- interaction is limited
- the concept of building your town/home is not well executed (because you really only get to place a few tiles at most). 
- the theme is quite boring
- with 5 players there is a lot of downtime

Would play again, but preferably with less players

RATING: 7
Initial rating. Played first game with 6--probably too many, but was still fun. But you really need to be able to see what's going on in front of every player. Knowing the tiles ahead of time definitely helps, which gives the game a bit of a learning curve. But the core mechanic of interleaving bidding for tiles with using the tiles works pretty well. But I'm glad I didn't pay the early prices of > $100 for an import. It's not [i]that[/i] amazing. Oh, and perhaps the worst player screens ever.

RATING: 5
Typical 'hasty' or 'frantic' growth engine and mild resource conversion game where you have tons of options and too little time to make a meaningful choice. Keyflower therefore joins the ranks of Homesteaders and Factory Manager, and in some more remote way Lancaster and World Without End. The game is crafted thusly that every round a careful selection of buildings, fitting the general game state at that moment, enters the proceedings: resources first, then transportation and special abilities, then the first singular VP tiles, and finishing off with a crescendo finale where Big VP are to be had. The only snag is that you have no idea whether tiles you select or bid on in the beginning have any redeeming feature for the future seasons, rendering the affair rather more tactical than need me, methinks. It is therefore a smash hit with the poor sods who confuse depth and meaningful gameplay with having tons of options. As for myself: this sort of game is only worth my time if I were to play it on dozens of occasions so I would get a feel for the possible combinations, and frankly the prospect bores me. 

Are there any redeeming features to Keyflower? Yes, I think so. There is a shadow of a memory of goods transportation in this game which serves as a bit of an artificial bottleneck, but still. And the use of coloured meeples is clever, especially considering the presence of a 4th colour with which players can be really screwed over. That is an unexpected touch of interaction in an otherwise dry and dull game. I'm generous with my rate as a consequence.

I love the theme, mechanics, and art in this game.  I really enjoy how not all the components come out in each season, so there's no telling what you're going to get.  I also love the progression of each season with new settlers coming to America and "storing" up for winter.  It really is a great game that requires thinking/planning ahead.

An odd, confusing game.  The initial plays are simple, but even by summer, the sheer number of oddball tiles being thrown at you is overwhelming, and trying to find a coherent strategy seems rough.  I'm sure this is a much better game about 2-3 games in.  Some neat ideas, though, especially how bidding on hex sides works.

Amazing original game.  I was blown away after my first play of Keyflower.  The game is simple yet woven with layers of complexity.  The bidding angle keeps the game constantly interesting.  Is there enough for one more big move?  Can I outbid and steal the tile back from the center?  Should I use my worker one someone else's tile (they get the worker the following turn)?  The replayability of Keyflower is tremendous. My experiences have been with either 4 or 6 players around the table.  And the expansions "The Merchants" and "The Farmers" are fantastic additions to the base game and I highly recommend integrating both expansions for a truly great game!

This is a hard one to rate for me. It is not really a bad game, I just don't enjoy it a ton. I still play it once in a while online on BGA. The problems I find with this game are the follows:

1. This game has a HUGE learning curve if you want to be good at it. Because of this, new players will almost always get totally wiped out if played with someone who has played this regularly. Part of my problem is I have played this mostly online, and there are people that adore this game and have played many, many times to my 12 (at the time of writing this).

2. The other thing about this game that would prevent me from ever buying it is I think it is very difficult to teach! I may be wrong about this, but I had the hardest time understanding it my first game, and even after that I found it hard to come up with a strategy at all my first few games. These are some reasons for the above mentioned learning curve. 

All in all, not a bad game if you are into it. I just don't like it enough to buy it.

Best game I have ever played.  Brilliant mix of mechanics including worker placement, auction bidding, pick up and deliver, resource management, set collecting, and tile placement. The theme is also very cute and colorful.  You're trying to build the best little village.  Gameplay is SO elegant, all you will ever do on a turn is work a tile or bid.  Every game plays different because of the variable set up for each round.  On top of that each player is given hidden scoring goals to lay out at the last round.   There are a lot of strategies to pursue.  You can try to max out a scoring goal tile, you can go crazy on upgrading your entire village, or just try to get a mix of bonuses.  This game is no multiplayer solitaire game, it's very interactive and you'll constantly be engaged with your opponents trying to outbid them or work a tile so you can shut them out.  You may even send your workers to their village to get a benefit from a tile they own (although they will get your workers).  This game is also amazing with all player counts.  It's just as good as it with 2 players as it is with 6 players.  That's insane!  How many games scale that well.  Really I can't say enough great things about Keyflower.

Some fun here. The worker dynamics are refreshing (single-color auctions + actions, getting workers only from owned tiles and boat selection, etc), but the rest of the game hooked up to that felt like fairly generic resource-pushing. (T'zolkin syndrome.)

RATING: 9.5
Can't say I have run into anything quite like this. A fun, if mildly brainy game.  It doesn't touch the heaviness of our heavy euros (Agricola, Terra Mystica, etc), but it still leaves you thinking due to the strong interaction between players.

The bid/activation colour locking mechanism is where your strategy comes into play.  You have random colours, so do your opponents.  You have to assume you know where you have the edge and play from there, expect surprises unless you want to devote time to diligently counting meeples (from an unknown start point, and potentially changing perspective).  

The most interesting mechanic is the trade between activating tiles outside your village, as you are giving (directly) or potentially giving other players meeple for next round.  This means you really need to have those tiles, but when the bids start to fly you won't get everything you want.  Makes for some very interesting play.

This one doesn't look all that interesting and then you play the first round and it's seems OK.  And then you play the second round and the game absolutely comes alive.  I'm usually not a fan of a bidding mechanic in a game but the way Keyflower weaves bidding into it is a treat.  You get to build your own little village more or less but are constantly away of others' and can use them (a la La Havre).  There's a lot of outguessing going on in this one and the fact that the currencies are hidden makes this one very good.

One reviewer strongly suggests the house rule: "Open Information Stays Open and Closed Information Stays Closed."

Another adds: we've started going one further than this house rule: at the beginning of the game, we lay out all of the Summer and Autumn tiles that will arrive. Again, it might sound like this could make the game super-prone to AP, but it didn't at all for us (3p). The main thing it provides is a quick sense of the relative values of gold, iron, wood, and stone for the game, rather than randomly finding those out as the game unfolds (which we found unsatisfying).

An amazing game.   This is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Looks like a cute innocent little game about building a farm and turns out to be a vicious game of auctions, pickup&deliver, route building, worker placement,  and resource management.   The game mechanisms just mesh together perfectly.

Five games now done (only one win). Very impressed. Wildly varying scores ... as high as 80 (huge win by Scott) down to the low 20s. Seems like the 50s is where the winning mostly happens. I like it very much, and was a bit taken aback at how much fun I had playing this game. I have to think about the strategy of the game a bit more, but there is something about playing the game that is just pure fun for me. I finish one game and literally want to jump into another one, and that is a rare thing.

Keyflower has really grown on me. It's delightful and quick-ish to play, the game is easy to explain and to pick up, it's a challenge to play well, and also offers immense replayability. [b]I find this game joyful to play[/b]. Watch out for first-time player AP. Probably best to play with no more than 4 when teaching the game.

This one's brilliantly fun and clearly needed a "9" rating from me.

[b]I own the following expansion(s) for the game:[/b]

Keyflower: The Farmers
Keyflower: The Merchants (thank you Secret Santa 2014)

Both are rare examples of expansions that wonderfully expands one of my favourite games. Elegant, fun, great addition, and most importantly simple to add without adding chrome or extra time to the gameplay. Expansions I rate as highly as the original base game. Both are highly recommended if you love Keyflower.

I like the diversely colored worker-placement dynamic. A friend lodged this (constructive criticism) -- will have to see how true this is: "As far as Keyflower, I cannot say yet. The game has a lot of chrome, but I am not sure is any different from many Euros where the script is already sculptured in the sequence of the tile rounds - i.e. you can only make tactical decisions based on the tiles turned out for the round."

This is a very heavy meeple management and bidding game.  Keyflower is a very challenging game in that you cannot do everything with the limited resources you have.  You must try to untilize what you are able to get and use it to your best efficiency.  The game can be very cut-throat as you can use other players resources, thereby blocking their play.  I like this game.  The only negative for me, is the length of play time, which is a little long - especially with AP prone players.  I like the strategies that come into play.  I also like the mind-games involved as you try to out-wait, out-wit, your opponents' bids. Good game.

RATING: 8.5
The design of this game is absolutely inspired. For my money, the simplicity-to-strategic-depth ratio of this game is second to none. What you can do on your turn is fairly straightforward. What you should do (and when you should do it, and using which meeples, and in what quantity) is anything but. The unique combination of two typically separate and rarely equal mechanisms--worker placement and tile auction--make both exponentially better. I just can't say enough good about how this game plays.

My only complaints are that it's thematically very dry, a bit ugly, and the rulebook really sucks. And, at lower player counts, it can be frustrating how many tiles are removed from the game, as some players will randomly find their villages in a much better position than others in the late stages of the game.

This game has intrigued me since I saw it for a first time. Back then, I didn't like such type of euro-economic games as they seemed dry, lifeless and without any player interaction. Yet something made Keyflower stick in my mind - something unique was there. Nowdays I have become more open to various genres of games, including not only ameritrash/area control, but euro as well - and Keyflower has been released in Polish so nothing could stop me from buying. 

Oh boi, this is so magnificent. An unusual blend of different mechanics - bidding, worker placement, resource production and developing a village. Technically, you're doing only two actions the whole game: either you bid or you produce. The thing is that you do both using meeples(which come in four colours)and it resolves all around that. Here comes probably the most important rule: once a meeple(or meeples) has been assigned to a tile you and other players must follow that color. So if my opponent starts with blue, if I want to outbid him, I have to use blue as well. Man, so simple rule, yet it creates so many possibilites and tactical play, not to mention a memory and guessing element - "hmm, how many of these could he have remaining?". If you manage to solve that puzzle you'll be able to add tiles won during the bidding to your village. It gives you access to various producing actions, which usually give you more meeples, resources or skill tokens. Every tile can be upgraded in order to become more powerful and - finally - give victory points. I haven't mentioned the fact that you can use tiles in other players' villages - as long as you follow the proper colour, of course. You can also block them this way, because village tiles have a certain limit of meeples that may be put on them - and trust me, sometimes it encourages to do very nasty things... but it doesn't come without a payoff, it's a double edged sword - you give precious meeples(again, the most important resource in this game to be honest)to your enemy for the next round. Keeping a balance between bidding for tiles that might be useful, using them, going to your opponent's villages, sometimes blocking important spots and keeping track of how many meeples you give away... it creates a really big field for player interaction and opportunities to perform surprising plays. And I haven't even mentioned about managing your village logistically - creating a proper net of roads is extremely important and if you make too many mistakes here it will definitely affect you negatively during the next rounds - all because in order to upgrade not only you must have proper resources, but they have to be delivered directly to a tile you want to upgrade. And without upgrading it's impossible to think about the victory.

An excellent, unusual, innovative game, twisting and blending various mechanisms that work together perfectly. A brilliantly designed product.

I think I have finally found the euro that best fits my tastes. Keyflower is a very tasty mixture of auctions, building and logistics. The game is very interactive in nature and there is constant tension present in every turn as you don't know exactly how many and what color keyples the opponents have left. Keyflower is an excellent 60-120 minute medium-heavy euro, which I recommend trying even if you don't generally enjoy euro games - this is definitely no multiplayer solitaire!

Keyflower is well designed.  It caused me a little panic until I realized how short the game really is.  Once I focused on what I wanted to do & let go of the rest it became a lot of fun. 
I like how it is different from other games in that respect.  It is not about being screwed because you don't cover some areas that other people are strong in.  It's about making your thing unique & doing the best you can with what you have.
Highly recommended.  Just keep this review in mind and don't sweat the stuff you are not doing.

This game hits all of my sweet spots: beautiful tiles, resource management and worker placement, competitive bidding, lots of variability...  Lots going on but not really that complicated once you understand a few basic ideas. Definitely more tactical than strategic in nature, which suits me fine.

Sits comfortably in the very top tier of games that I've played.

I liked this at first,  but something about the graphic design made it difficult to grasp each time it came out--I felt I kept having to relearn the game.

RATING: 8.2
Each player builds up a village by bidding on tiles with workers. These tiles can be used to perform certain actions (produce resources, transport resources and upgrade your village tiles, attract new workers, obtain human capital). One cannot only use one's own tiles, but also the tiles in other villages and even the tiles which are for sale. This does imply that your worker will join the work force of your adversary for the next round (season) or the work force of the player who buys the new tile. So, in each of the four seasons you have to make hard choices of what to do with your workers, bid on new tiles or use tiles. And there are only four seasons... At the start of the game each player also receives a number of tiles (2 or 3) which they can put up for sale in the winter. These tiles describe conditions to be met in order to score points. The player can use these tiles to guide his own strategy, but it is uncertain if he will be able to obtain the tiles. Points can be scored in many different ways. A very nice worker placement game.

Would probably get a higher rating if I played this one the amount of time and attention it deserves. I'll start with an 8 rating right now.

I like how each game can vary greatly in terms of how to acquire VPs.

This one I'd play again. It's a brain burner with some sort of reverse worker placement (?) and each player's "workers" are hidden from opponents. But again, like in Suburbia and The Capitals, the spatial element just plays too much of a role for me to rate it higher.

Keyflower is an extremely unique game which blends auction mechanics with worker placement and a splash of tile placement while never really feeling like any of them.  It rewards both strategy and tactics and is one of the most interactive euros I can think of.  It also works almost flawlessly at all player counts from 2-6 which is basically unheard of - Keyflower might not be my absolute favourite game, but it may be the best designed game I've ever played.

Thoroughly enjoyed playing Keyflower. I can't wait to play it again.

UPDATE: Every session of this has been just great. Bumping it up (again), to a 9.5.

There's some really great innovation here. The game is essentially about worker placement (of a very creative sort), resource conversion, tile placement and auctions... but the interplay is definitely unique and superbly implemented.

The "currency" you use in the auctions is workers and since there are three (or four) different colors of workers, that effectively means there are three (or four) different currencies. Once someone bids in red workers, no other color of workers can be bid for that item.

Using production tiles is similar. Once someone has used a blue worker on a tile, if you want to use that tile you have to use blue as well (and you have to place more workers than the previous player). Likewise, if you want to use a tile that has received bids--or vice versa--you must match the color of workers/bids already at that tile.

A lot of sneaky tile placement things occur, too... like the fact that when you use someone else's building you are giving them workers (currency) for next round, since workers in each village are returned to the village's owner at the end of every season. The bids for claiming start player and re-supply ships have some clever twists as well.

Simply put, this is just a very well-designed game. It will take many plays to get a handle on how to play it well... and my rating could easily increase. (Note: HAS increased... started at 8.0, now 9.5.)

I think a plus, for the duration - thanks to that gives the sense of replay-ability.

However - the rules are written in a terribly long way where as the game concept is simple really.

The hexagon actions are too complicated though, and symbols are not really self-explanatory sometimes.

Overally - it's good to give it a go, it has interesting mechanics, but it will struggle to remain on the shelf.

Although it's good food for brain , i will give that.

Keyflower is a well designed mix of different mechanics that present you with difficult decisions to make.  But I'm not sure how fun it is.  When you give a game a lot of rules, time and thought, it should return that investment with fun, and this one just wasn't returning the favor.  I think it's a good strategic game, but I will probably not play again.

A worker placement game that marries really clever mechanics with a huge number of meeples -- the bidding with your workers is fantastic, the color restrictions really create interesting problems, and the ability to use opponent spots in exchange for leaving your workers adds difficult decisions.

Very encouraging first play although the last round (winter) does feel a little bit wild with scope for huge swings in VP's depending on an odd meeple advantage here or there or whether you happen to be competing for a particular prize or have a clear run at it.

That notwithstanding looking forward to future plays - very clever bidding/worker-placement mechanics and huge variety in things to do based on the number of tiles.

Last game bought in Essen 2012.

Solid game with lots of decisions and just long enough play time. With five new players it took less than two hours. 

I really liked the coloured bidding mechanism. While you of course try to remember which colour meeples your opponents have you can't keep track of them all leading to some interesting bidding fights. The green meeples are an fun addition as well, quite hard to get but powerful if you do get them.

All in all I'm impressed how much they managed to cram into this game and still manage to keep it this simple rules wise.

Players are developing land in the New Keyworld, trying to amass the most victory points.

Intriguing resource management game.  Players on their turn deploy meeples from behind their house to either bid on a tile, or activate any tile for production.  Meeples come in four colours, and once a tile has been used, it's locked into that colour for the remainder of the turn.  Tiles that are won are bolted into the player's own play area at the end of the turn.  Tiles produce goods, more meeples, craft tokens, and of course, victory points.

The game is played over four seasons, bubbles along nicely, and has some very interesting design features.  You want good, attractive, tiles so the other players will come and give you meeples, but you want them for yourself too.  

Really enjoyed this one - by far the best game in the Key series.

A very interesting twist on worker placement/bidding game as you need to figure out when it's best to activate a tile (whether your own or not) and when to bid for one. The random selection of tiles in each season makes for great replay value.

The blend of auction and worker placement around the center tiles is the primary attraction here.

Keyflower is one of those games I'm kind of ambivalent about.  There's nothing inherently wrong with it (although a few things bug me, as we'll get to below), but I'm never going to be excited to play it.  It has a lot of interesting points, as you try to build up your little network of tiles, produce goods, and transport them from place to place.

However, I feel like you really just need to grab as many meeples as you can, to win auctions and activate tiles.  Being able to activate other players' tiles is a good addition, but not something to do unless you're desperate, since you have to give them the workers.  Start player for the next round is pretty important, since you can get the biggest boat (unless you really need one of the others).  I also think it's weird that there's one special color.  Having a lead in green the whole game means you can just take whatever tile you want, defeating the whole purpose of the auction part of the game.
That's the disconnect for me.  You've got to manage your own empire, but then fight with everyone else over the parts to add to it.  If people decide to contest you, you can waste a lot of time and resources attempting to secure these tiles.  
You get 2 end-game scoring tiles at the start which you can build towards.  But then, you're under no obligation to put them out for auction.  And even if you do put them out, there's no guarantee you'll win them.  So you've not only got to set up the victory conditions on your tiles, but get a big enough staff of meeples that you can defend them in the final auction.  It also really seems to me (and the other people I've played with) that some of these endgame tiles have way higher scoring potential than others, and some are much easier to complete than others.  Getting stuck with the keythedral (an unexciting flat 12 points) and a tile that rewards you for collecting meeples (which everyone is going to be competing for anyway) in your opening hand means that you're going to be in a much worse position than someone who's trying to collect a bunch of skill tokens.  If you put your tiles out, you'll have to try and stop other players from poaching them (since they're as good for others as they are for you), but if you don't, you'll have to fight an uphill battle to steal someone else's tile, which probably won't score as well.
There are also some publicly available tiles, where you want to make road connections, or get boats or something, but these are difficult to build towards and give a piddly amount of points even if you're able to do it and get your hands on the right tile.

Anyway, If the game were more about the network and engine building, and less about oddball auctions and the buildup towards these wonky endgame bonuses, I'd like it more.

3 plays in and boy am I taken by it.  Great Euro with bidding, worker placement, tile laying, engine building, and is immensely re-playable.  The first play we wrapped our heads around the process and immediately played again knowing how the game worked.  Brilliant focus on simple yet tough decisions.

Accessible for even younger players to get into and (this is a HUGE bonus) the game plays just as well with 2 players as it does with 6. Our 2 player game was just as fun as the 6 player game.... incredible achievement.  Right up there with Agricola for me and over time could surpass it.

This is becoming one of my favorite game to play. When I first played it, it was a 6 players game, and I said, man how good this game was even with 6. I liked it instantly. At that point, it wasn't widely available yet, so the game isn't in my buylist. Only when another friend brought it again for a 3 player session, I immediately said I need to get this game, because it also handles 3 players pretty well.

Wonderful game in the Key series. It is pretty fine worker placement and auction game placed in the time of Mayflower and pilgrims. The game flows through 4 seasons, each different than the other and players keep expanding their villages, acquiring more meeples, auctioning for better tiles and ships and placing aforementioned meeples to produce resources and stuff. There are many ways to score your path to victory and it's so colorful and bright. And it supports up to 6 people but donwtime gets too huge. 4 is the sweet spot.

Not a bad game, but I definitely need to be in the mood for it.

Generally speaking, I love games that allow me to mess with other players, but something about Keyflower sucks the fun out of it.  I'm not entirely sure what it is.  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the game, but something felt like it was missing and the weird thing was that it was a long game that felt too short.  I don't know how on earth they managed to do that, but they did.  You're like, "What? It's over?" but it's been a couple of hours or more.

It's a shame they never reprint these games because I enjoy other games in the Key- series more than this one.  Still, if it makes its way to the table, I can be convinced to siddown and play.

You have an interesting decision to make every turn.  

This is a great four currency money management game in which the goal of the game is to get the most points, not the most money (although you can get points for certain types of coin collections if you put in the winning bid on certain winter tiles).  This land uses meeple shaped coins for its four distinct, inconvertible* currencies.  Keeping track of multiple inconvertible currencies is challenging as most players of this game can probably attest, and perhaps that is why the residents responsible for each tile refuse to have to deal with more than one of the currencies per season as long as they can get away with it (note: Boats 4a and 4b come with government-enforced privileges).

Each time around the table you can pass or you can allocate some of your money (to buy price-capped progressively more expensive goods, to pay for price-capped progressively more expensive services or to bid on businesses, privileges or other investment opportunities up for auction, most of which you can teleport to your part of town, including the surrounding land, roads and water if you put in the winning bid).  You have so many options to consider on your turn, you can even bid on getting to pick which available income (including a tool or two) you will receive at the end of the season.  This totally feels like bribing a government official (a kickback).  The different incomes the players can receive are displayed in boats right from the start of the season, not to encourage the players to pour more money into developing their villages, but on the contrary one can only assume it is done by someone in the government in charge of allocating government funds to the players, and it is done to encourage the players to instead use some of their money to bribe that government official into letting them choose which income they will receive.  The government official who displayed the different income options on the boats divided the incomes unevenly, and it seems self evident that this was done in order to maximize the bribes he/she will receive from the players for getting to choose which income they will receive.  At the end of the season, the places no one decided to bid on presumably get burnt down and any money inside them is repossessed by the government.

Winning the game isn't necessarily about having the best village.  Developing a nice village filled with nice, renovated places capable of providing lots of goods and useful services certainly helps a lot, because the government definitely finds out about those things, but there are also government officials who start accepting bribes at the start of winter and the player who makes the best offer to one of those government officials gets to transport that government official (including the building they typically reside in) back to their village for the official to check out the village for the one specific kind of thing (or set of things) they care about (One of them just cares about the building he/she typically resides in, the keythedral.).  Each player meets and gets to know a few government officials at the start of the game (winter tiles) so they know exactly what those particular government officials value.  At the start of winter, each player must summon one and can summon more than one of those government officials they met at the start of the game to be available to perform an inspection of a village at the end of the game.  All players have a chance to chat with those selected government officials to get to know exactly what they value right before winter starts.

So yeah... this game is pretty thematic. :)

Most things seem pretty clear, but one thing I'm wondering about is... when I pay to use the alehouse, tavern or the inn, am I paying for a drink or a room for the night and then selling my sexy body to a client who pays in whatever currency they happen to have on them?  Is that why I get paid and why I get paid more when I use the nicer, upgraded versions of these places due to the clientele I can attract in them? It should be noted that these clients appear to be spending money they've obtained from the government.  Are they bandits or are they perhaps government officials spending the government's money for their own pleasure? Also, the payments made by the players for getting to pick which income they will receive end up in the government's coffer. I suspect there is some sort of money laundering scheme going on which involves the official who displays the incomes on the boats, but I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet.

A really advanced worker placement (& worker auction?) with numerous paths to victory, although it is quite challenging for new players to understand the game flow. Tiles are used to activate abilities and generate resources. Players spend meeples to use these tiles when they are in the current pool, or they bid on those tiles to bring them into their own towns for the next season where they can be used without losing meeples. All owned tiles can be used by other players and the owner keeps the spent meeples. Each game randomly generates different resource shortages and the 'most valuable' tiles seem to change from game to game. A bit complicated for beginners, but I believe there's a great deal of replay value, especially between skilled opponents. This is my least played 10 but it deserves it!

90-120m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

Keyflower is a game of auctions, resource acquisition, end game scoring bonuses and a small spatial element with the tiles you acquire.  There are 4 rounds, with each round being associated with a season.  During each season tiles will be up for auction.  They do have a pattern:

Spring: Resource acquisition tiles
Summer: Boats which provide permanent special abilities and tiles which allow you to spend resources to gain more/more valuable resources.
Fall: Scoring opportunity tiles by spending or moving resources.
Winter: End of game scoring bonuses for resources you save until the end of the game.

The resources come in two main types: Meeples and Non-Meeples (which there are multiple types). The way meeples are used to both activate tiles and bid on tiles is the most interesting part of the game.  The auction and use of tiles are all happening simultaneously in a round.  To elaborate, when you bid or activate a tile you use a meeple/meeples of the same color which locks the tile into that color for counterbids and activations.  Not only can you activate other people's tiles (essentially giving them your meeples) but you can activate tiles that are being bid on (meaning people bid not only on the tile, but the meeples that activated the tiles).  

Winter Tiles are also more unique than the other seasons.  At the beginning of the game players are dealt winter tiles.  At the beginning of the 4th round player's secretively and simultaneously choose how many and which tiles they want to add to Winter's auction.  After choosing the tiles, they are shuffled and displayed so people aren't 100% sure who added what tiles to the auction.  The first problem I have is: either you are either forced to specialize in the winter tiles you've been dealt or risk them not being in the game.  This is a minor complaint as the same argument could be leveled at Troyes.  The more troubling issue for me is that in the 2 games I've played, it was almost more important to bid on winter tiles that seem likely to give the player a win than what would benefit you the most.  I would finally caution that you have to be very careful which axis you're flipping your tiles as their orientation matters.

This is a very interesting game that's going to appeal to many people but I didn't quite work for me for the two reasons I mentioned relating to the winter tiles.  Despite not using every tile in every game (increasing the games replay value), I think after repeated plays the game would start to feel samey for me.

In theory, this is a fantastic game. In practice, it takes a number of plays to start appreciating it... or not.

The tile randomization in the beginning needs some time to learn what each tile does and how it fits in your strategy. The rule book is NOT well written. The game is fiddly and with no thematic tie in to alleviate its complexity. It also has a really mean vibe to it that I did not enjoy.

I played 2/3-player only so far, and though I believe everyone that says it scales well, I can't imagine the downtime in more player counts. Bottom line is, I don't think this is a game for me.

SOLD IT!

The Key series games have a distinct feel, just not one I am overly in love with. The bid/place mechanic that drives this one is what makes it unique by using the tile facing to indicate bidder works, but is a visual nightmare to digest. The "variety" of tiles is fairly dry, since they mainly all do the same thing.

The game works, just isn't that elegant in execution.

Interesting worker placement game in which the color of the workers really matters.  Asymetrical initial worker allotments increase the effect of this mechanic.  Rules fairly simple and easy to remember once mastered.  Pleasing art, though why designer decided to obscure most of it with game graphics is a mystery.  Random selection of tiles from a pool, some of which are not used, adds to replayability.

Keyflower is certainly a multifaceted game; both in decisions and rules. Players are given several options each turn, each of which can have several downstream effects. Being able to see the big picture of Keystone, and understanding the strategic ramifications of an action, is not an easy task. This barrier to entry is Keystone's downfall. Their is an interesting meta-game wrapped within Keystone's anfractuous, but the task of unearthing is not for everyone.

Fine, I admit it.  I am mildly... [i]okay[/i], moderately, obsessed with this game.  Are you happy now Mr. Breese?

The paradox of the elegant yet chaotic, unmercifully tactical yet deceptively strategic, pleasure synergized with pain that is Keyflower, particularly at two players, is the locus of my obsession.

And I’m only very average at it.  Like, very.  

There is a definitive skill ladder here where every rung I reach for seems to be greased or broken causing me to question my intuition, my logic, my reasoning.  Hell, at times this game causes me to question my ability to make even the most basic reads of a game state.  Maddening.  

But you know what?  If I am being honest with myself, this is [i]exactly[/i] my kind of game… I absolutely love it.

[1 play] This was my first venture into the Key series, and it was pretty agreeable.

Oh, this is right up my alley.  I love how meeples are used for bidding and worker placement.  It's got a really great degree of interaction, even though you're building your own village.  If you're playing with the right group, you can play this in right around 60 minutes.  Can be quite cutthroat, and you really need to pay attention to what everyone else is doing.  Potentially a top ten game for me.

I won this game all 3 times I played. Did not know how. Did not care. The rules were overly convoluted and obscure. We played the rules as written but the game played so strangely that I had to double and triple check we were playing correctly. I finally established that we were indeed playing correctly all along. HUGELY disappointed. It feels like it drags on, but then just when you finally have enough to set up an engine and get it going and begin to do something interesting, the game is over. It felt weird. Both short and loooong.

This is the only game on BGG that I sat down and read every single comment.  I'm wondering what people see in this game and why it's so high up on the list. Turns out it's because people think it's better than it actually is, or they played it once, or there are multiple high scores from one person. Lots of high scores (7 and above) but also lots of Previously Owned and For Trade in those scores along with comments like 'Its clever but I don't really get it'. I would never sell or trade any of my games rated 8 and over. If it's so amazing and you want to play it all the time, why wouldn't you want to own it? I had really high expectations for this one and it is my biggest disappointment to date. The 2 is for the art which is lovely.

Keyflower is one of those games that can be easily unappreciated based on a player's expectations of the game. The first two games I played were terrible and I spent more time face deep in the rulebook than playing the game. Wife checked out in the first 15 minutes. We gave it another chance and realized how much amazing potential this game has. The first thing you have to realize going into this game is how passive aggressive the bidding system is which also builds necessary tension. Being able to pass and then continue playing allows for an interesting way to steal tiles last minute from your opponent, which is an absolutely necessary part of the game. Also, you have to realize how tight this game is. Every turn is bidding and producing (they are not separate phases) so you have to use your workers in such a way to build resources and also expand your village. However, workers are scarce and you end up having to spend more workers each time an action is used more than once. The thing to remember is that it can be cutthroat and also there will not be much time to do everything you want to do because there are only 4 rounds and workers are used for everything. Very tight, stressful game with a lot of tension. Easily one of the best games on the shelf.

A great game with all player counts but can get very slow on the higher end. One of the few bidding games where the bidding is tense and interesting even with two.

Love all the variety the random tile distribution brings even if it can be a bit rough on the players and effectively make players grind or play a very boring and uninteresting strategy.

Also one of the games where you don't have an idea what you should do - or what you are doing - during the first or the first few games...

My choice for best new game of 2012, but each one of my plays has reduced my interest in this one, and I think that’s more a comment on my tastes than the game.  This one is a pure auction euro through and through, and I find the innovations on the bidding and the worker placement on your and other people’s tiles absolutely clever. It also plays in a crisp 90+ minutes with 5P. There’s a lot to like for fans of novel auction games. 

But with every play north of 5, I’ve been less and less inspired by it. I’m tiring of auction games, and I’m not excited about all the surprise blocking that happens in the game.

The game is highly interactive, and has many roads to victory.  A long-term strategy is important, but you have multiple to choose from, so the game is not just playing you.

With my limited experience, I crave to play more.  It has been a while since I've played a game I would actively seek to play again.  If given two games to play, I would rarely pick anything else instead of this.

This game is pretty innovative. You bid on tiles by placing workers on the side, and you can use the same tiles by placing workers on top. Then there is the puzzle aspect after you win them with your bids. Auctions, worker placement, and puzzle aspects all combined make this an interesting game. I have mixed feelings about the winter tiles, since some of them are very powerful. On one hand if you get one of the powerful tiles you can position yourself to make good use of them, but if you don't prepare you will not be able to make much use of them and probably won't bid for them at the end. (10 points for each set of skill tiles, I'm looking at you.) If anything, the game is too short; I never finish what I want to do by the end of the game.

Really love this game, especially the auction mechanics. This has grown on me over the years. Regret that I sold it. However, if some players really go for the worker strategy, a round might be really tedious - the other players constantly passing while one or two players keep putting out workers. The iconography is hard to catch the first two games, but after that it works fine.
What I really like about this game is the interaction. Players can put workers in others' villages, paying that worker to the player who owns the village. Also a lot of interaction going on when trying to acquire the best tiles. There is sufficient amount of luck in this game.

The bidding/worker placement mechanic creates a lot of tension as players compete to build up their towns, and build routes to allocate resources to for points as efficiently as possible. Each season adds a boatload of extra actions, tiles, and workers to fight over, which helps to create a satisfying final round of play during winter.

I feel like the mechanics in this game needed to be reined in somehow. Like many Breese creations, understanding the mercurial flow of resources is difficult: crops in Key Harvest, polyps in Reef Encounter, and now the meeples in this game. Most often meeples are burned up in bidding and any that end up coming back to you is almost a side effect. You mostly just make the best go of it given the meeples you end up with each round.

Then the skill tiles are thrown in as another resource to juggle. Then you've got village building and having to move resources around your village. And some tiles seem pretty pointless (trade a meeple for a random meeple?). THEN you select final-round bonus tiles to go out for bidding but you still have to fight/bid to get the tile(s) you may have been shooting for. Oy!

So, it's a lot to digest and always seems like an uphill struggle where you never really get into any groove since THE GAME IS ONLY FOUR ROUNDS! It all feels rather clunky and mostly like managed chaos.

I can't fathom adding any expansions to increase the shit to manage. There's already too much crammed into this game that ONLY LASTS FOUR ROUNDS!

RATING: 7
Ye ghods but that's an over-written rules set. But once you get past the rules, the game play is very simple and clever. The new thing here is that when a meeple is placed as a worker or a bidder to a tile, all other meeples to that tile must be the same colour. That's a killer rule!

Players start with red/yellow/blue meeples, but can get green ones. So if you're the only player with one green meeple, if you use it as a first bid, nobody can outbid you. Or if you use it for production, no-one else can produce from that tile or if it's up for auction, bid on it.

The rest of the game play is standard worker placement, developmental, optimal scoring. Get stuff, use it to get VPs. But there's enough variety and especially inter-play between villages to make it a really engaging game.

But very long, 1 hour to read the rules, 3 hours playing. Fun, we really enjoyed it, lots to consider, but long for what it is.

I understand why many others like Keyflower, but it felt... dry. It’s an interesting system of mechanisms, though (admittedly after only one play) one suspects meeple multiplication is the winningest strategy, simply because being able to outbid and outlast your opponents (especially) at the end must necessarily be powerful. Mostly, though, I came to it expecting ANY theme and found NONE. Now, I love abstracts and I love euros, but no theme at all? Perhaps I just wasn’t in the mood. I’m going to have to think through what gives a game flavor, because it seems it’s subtler than I thought.

Very solid game with some unique bidding mechanics.
Even though I was once afraid of games wich are based on bidding, I'm happy I decided to get this.

Game plays quickly in 4 rounds, and each of those has it's own feeling.

My group was amazed by how much the pace of the game accelerates. At first, it seemed like everyone was very friendly, trying not to get in each other's way; Yet, 2 rounds later we were all fighting for every tile and point.

The game left my group with a great after-taste. And we all agred we should play this often.

Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good medium~heavy euro game with an economics feeling

Having only play this 2p and 4p, I'll say that it offers tight decisions with limited variability, and is more interesting with more than 2p.

How did this just go from a 4 to a 10?

Then how did this go from a 10 to a 6.

This game has a lot going for it, but then some things I find. Thematically it well-executed, with different jobs resulting in different yields available each season. And you only have four seasons to get things done, which results in a tight game that really fits the idea of one year.

There is variability in available tiles from game to game, but not as much as I had hoped for. There is the unique meeple auction, but it's not as fun at 2p as I was hoping. The resources are a good thematic fit and provide interesting decisions when couples with the transporting mechanic, but the tool chits feel much more mechanical and less interesting, especially when players are encouraged to hoard them.

Excellent resource game.  The 4th (last round) can really turn the game around.  Choices can be excruciating.  Failing to get skill tiles can really be a problem.  

There is a lot of clever strategy in this game involving play on another's tiles where not only do you reap benefits but also sabotage your opponent--but in doing so will forfeit a worker and possibly lose end game bonus points. Complicated possibilities in especially the last round. I also found unique Green workers to be extremely strategic with play and counter-play very interesting.

Good adaptation for different number of players.

Overall, I find this boring.  It is a mechanical, generic euro about bidding for certain buildings, activating them a few times to get some resources, and setting yourself up for scoring at the end of 4 rounds.  The theme is practically non-existant.

There is a hidden economy in there, but you don't really know how to value things other than bidding the max if you absolutely need it.  In addition, you have to look around at other players tableaus across the table quite often to remember what buildings they have, especially after they've upgraded them.

The interesting decisions: what color meeple do i use, and do i activate a building or bid for one, big whoop.

From a strategy perspective, the first time I played I didn't know what I was doing and so had a sprawling city but couldn't move things at all.  In my second game I focused only on one resource type as well as scoring tiles that only used that resource.  I wound up winning over a couple of players that had a more sprawling city and multiple resources.

Wow! A bidding game that doesn't feel like a bidding game!

I really enjoyed this after a single play and am looking forward to another play. The master meeples are hugely important though, and VERY careful selection of when to flip your tiles, so others don;t benefit seems important!

RATING: 9
A very unique amazing auction / worker placement game that exceeded my high expectations.  Each game can play out completely differently depending on which tiles come out, and it scales very well from 2-6 players.  Essentially, each tile is bid on using one of up to 4 different kinds of currency (4 colors of meeples), and once a bid starts with one type of currency, no other type can be used for that auction.  The is one of maybe 10 games I've ever played that made me go "wow" the first time I played it.

Takes up to six players, plays quickly and yet presents challenges one wouldn't have expected of such a chaos-prone mix. It's as much auction as worker placement, where workers are the currency.

No-one enjoyed our solitary play of this game.  Too much localised checking of icons and symbols and these really aren't easily visible from across the table.  I can think of 200+ games I'd rather play in preference.

Don't understand the hype on this game at all.

Having played some games of the Key series in the past - I don'T even remember which ones which I guess it proof that they did not impress me that much - I really liked this one.
It works well with 2 (it took only 45 min), but is definetly more fun with more buildings in play. We played also with 6 which was great and took only 2,5 hours, which  - for a 6 player game - I would consider as suprisingly short.

I'd probably give this a 9 just for the art alone! Thankfully, the game beneath that art is also amazing.
It's got bidding/auctions which I love. Tile placement always gets me in games. Also worker placement where you can put your meeples in your village as well as your opponent's.
Scales pretty well from just 2 player to 2+

Külcsín:
A doboz engem elsőre nagyon meglepett. Ennyire jelentéktelen, csúnya dobozt, nem tudom láttam-e már. Nem értem, hogy jutott eszükbe ennyire színtelenre csinálni.
Kibontva már kellemesebb látvány fogadja az embert, és kicsit értelmet nyer a doboz is. Rengeteg lapka, mindegyiken különböző rajz. Valahogy kicsit gyermeki, ám mégis profi. Hihetetlenül sok meeple és nem kevés nyersanyag, amik hatszög alapú hasábok. Külön említést érdemel, hogy minden paraván egy-egy teljesen egyedi házikót mintáz, aminek még beltere is részletesen meg van rajzolva, és mindben egészen más a berendezés. Van tégla-, fa-, kőház, de még vályog is nádtetővel (a kedvencem )

A lapkák designjával kapcsoltban van egy -két praktikus kifogásom:
1. Túl halványan látszik csak a rajz. Ami miatt nem jön le, hogy mennyire különböző minden épület, illetve nehezen követhető az utak illesztése
2. A különböző típusú lapkák designja túl egyforma, így kínkeserves őket szétválogatni.

A szabály:
A szabály angolul és németül is bekerült a dobozba. Annak ellenére, hogy a játék logikája kicsit csavaros, jól érthető. Azért számítsatok rá, hogy megfelelő rutinnal is kétszer legalább el kell olvasni, hogy elkezdjen összeállni a játék.

A játék menete:
A játék négy évszakból áll. Minden évszakban licitálásra bocsátunk 7-9 darab lapkát. Ezek a lapkák, gyakorlatilag munkáslelyezésre alkalmas akciómezők. A licit érdekessége, hogy 3+1 féle színű lehet részt venni benne. Ha egy lapkára mondjuk pirossal már licitált valaki, akkor azt csak pirossal (logikusan abból is többel, mint az előző licit) lehet felüllicitálni. A +1 szín a zöld, ami csak annyiban más, mint a többi, hogy nehezebb hozzájutni, így logikusan értékesebb, és könnyebb vele licitet nyerni. A licitálásra bocsátott lapkák köre minden játékban más, így elég nagynak érzem az újrajátszhatóságot.
A játékos a körében vagy licitál, vagy lapkát aktivál. Mindkettő akció ugyanolyan munkásokkal történik. Aktiválhatjuk az egyik saját lapunkat, vagy akár másét is. A kör végén minden aktiválásra elhasznált munkás a lapka tulajdonosánál köt ki, így nem akkora baj, ha más használja a féltve őrzött kis szénbányánkat. Érdekes mechanizmus, hogy lehetséges az éppen licitre bocsátott, senki földje lapkákat is aktiválni. Innen majd az az ember kapja meg a munkásokat, akié a lapka lesz a licit végén. Szintén érdekes, hogy egy mezőt akár többször (többen) is aktiválhatnak. Az első aktiválás után (a licithez hasonlóan) a következő aktiválóknak ugyanolyan színt kell használniuk, mint ami már van a lapkán, és szintén a licithez hasonlóan, legalább eggyel több embert kell tenni. Tehát ha valaki, mondjuk elvitt 2 fát, egy piros emberrel, akkor a következőnek már 2 piros embert kell ezért "fizetnie".
A játék végét a tél jelenti. Az itt szerezhető lapkák, mind pontot adnak különféle célokért. Itt is egy érdekes mechanizmus jön be: nem véletlenszerűen felcsapott lapokra folyik a licit, hanem mindenki kap a játék elején 2-3 darabot amit titokba tart. Így mindenkinek van egy kis szelet infója arról, mikért járHAT majd pont a játék végén. A téli kör elején titkosan beadjuk azokat a lapkákat, amiket úgy ítélünk, hogy számunkra előnyösek. A beadott lapkákra, ugyanúgy licitálás folyik, mint a többi évszakban. Tehát attól még, hogy én adtam be a "minden zöld emberért két pont jár" lapkát, még nem biztos, hogy meg is fogom tudni szerezni.
Ha ezzel a licit és aktiváláskörrel is végeztünk, akkor összeszámoljuk a pontokat és a játéknak vége.

Összegzés:
- A játék nekem nagyon tetszett. Nagyon sok opcióból választhatunk, amikor sorra kerülünk (emiatt erre hajlamosak beakadhatnak, és nagyon elnyúlhat a játék). Szóval van mélysége a játéknak.
- Nagy az újrajátszhatósági faktor, mivel mindig más lapkakombinációkból gazdálkodunk.
- Hangulatos grafika, jó minőségűek az alkatrészek
- Aránylag nagyfokú interakció (és kitolási faktor), a licitálás és az egymás lapjának használata miatt
- Jópár érdekes, fineszes mechanizmus
- A rengeteg opció ellenére nagyfokú kiegyensúlyozottság (az első játék végén kb. 20%-on belül voltak a pontok)

A játékidő valamivel több, mint 2 óra volt. Gyakorlatilag mindenki kezdő volt, és 4-en játszottunk. Ahhoz képest, hogy eléggé gondolkodós darab, valamiért engem nem annyira fárasztott le, mint a hasonlók. És ez nagy szó, mert általában az agyzsibbasztási faktor miatt, szoktak lekerülni a fajsúlyosabb darabok az asztalról.

u.i.:
Még egy érdekesség jutott eszembe a működésből:
A lapkákat tovább lehet fejleszteni. Ehhez bizonyos mennyiségű nyersanyagra van szükség. Igen ám, de ezeknek a nyersanyagoknak ott is kell lennie lapkán, viszont a termelő lapkák saját magukra termelik a nyersanyagokat. Itt jön be a képbe a város okos építgetésének, illetve az utak a fontossága. A nyersanyagokat bizony szállítás akciókkal el kell juttatni a felhasználási helyükre, ami elég sok plusz fejvakarást visz a játékba.

Keyflower clearly is part of the Key series. Unfortunately, that also means my general complaints about the other games in the series (that I have played) apply here as well.

Once again, there are some interesting mechanisms at work with a few innovative twists (although some aren't quite as new as some seem to think, e.g. Asara has already done the worker placement in specified colours thing before) but the end result feels like a pile of nice ideas that would have benefitted from some refinement. In particular, the game provides a host of opportunities for micromanagement (and, in fact, very much requires it) but lacks almost any sense of progression or achievement. Additionally, a large part of those management efforts can easily be rendered moot by the miniscule ripples caused by random draws. It's almost like you are pushing cubes for the sake of pushing cubes at times. The result can feel rather swingy and arbitrary because of this.

Also as usual, the graphic design is not up to par with the illustrations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Relatively simple rules, but a whole lot of depth. Replayability is high since your strategy changes each game. You plan based on your winter tiles, but you ultimately don't know what you'll end up with by the end of the game.

The auction/action mechanic with the meeples is very clever. Trying to decide what to do with your own pool of meeples is a challenge, but you're also trying to maximize the size/color distribution of your own pool while minimizing your opponents'. Do I bid on that tile Player B wants in the hopes that she'll waste more meeples on it? Or do I bid on the tile I want with green meeples before somebody else can bid on it with yellows?

This is my favorite type of brainburner: Your next action is never straightforward, but not because you're overwhelmed with possibilities. Even tiles that grow the size of your meeple pool, which would seem to always be a good move, will give your opponents the advantage of time if played early. Yet if you don't grow your pool early, you may not have the meeples necessary to compete later.

Easily my favorite game and easily worth a 10. I don't see either of those changing any time soon.

Wirkt zunächst und im Aufbau abstrakt und offenbart dann im Spiel seine Seele. Das Spiel ist voller schöner Ideen und Wege. Vor allem die grünen Pöppel.

Using workers for bidding and activation is a really fun mechanic. The bidding mechanic and hidden information adds more player interaction which is usually lacking in worker placement games (e.g. "what!?! you still have yellow workers??"). The fact that not all tiles are used in every game adds a lot of replay value. I find the gameplay and iconography very intuitive. The overall game is pleasing to the eye; the artwork really hits the spot. I feel that not having all the information available (e.g. future season tiles, opponents' workers) cuts down on AP as well.

it's a pretty fun Euro that is not easy to categorize mechanically. The auction mechanic in multiple separate but equal money plus one 4th color that is hard to acquire is somewhat innovative. We are all somehow building settlements in a very limited time frame and it feels like there isn't enough time to get everything properly done.

Keyflower's flavor of worker-placement was a revelation for me. I came to this game somewhat early in my WP explorations and never thought to use workers as both action selection tools and as auction currency. The icing on the Keyflower cake is the ability to use other players' action tiles for your own benefit and/or blocking moves.

There is quite a bit of cool prediction and counterplay as players attempt to appraise the value of tiles based upon the victory point tiles they know and the ones they've predicted from other players. It is especially cool that players can still interact with tiles after players have taken them.
The game feels like such a sprint, though.

Breese and co. does it again with their latest addition to the Key family of games. Keyflower is a bidding / city building game. It doesn't really do anything new, but manages to make old mechanics feel fresh with a spunky bidding system and beautiful tile set. This is your standard, "buy resources and trade those resources for better resources and cash them in for VPs to win" sort of game, but it doesn't come off nearly as plodding as Village does, for example. It actually feels like an Agricola/Le Havre hybrid, which are two of my favourite games and so it's no wonder I like this one. Less complex than those two, so this one definitely has its place. I am most appreciative of the random tile draw and how they are organized by 'seasons'.  There are certainly a few things about it that make it a bit rough around the edges - little extra rules and exceptions to make the game work mechanically but feel a little gamey.  Overall though, I'm impressed with the quality of this game!

Keyflower is a game where your currency works as a mean of purchasing tiles and also for activating actions. Keeping the balance on what to use it on at a precise moment is key.

Nice, very innovative game (though Asara done one-color worker placement earlier). And very fiddly.

The whole game is fun. But - after the game you don't feel like you've acomplished "something". Pushed some cubes here and there, turned around some tiles. No turning points, no really heavy tension. I don't know.
Nevertheless - check it out. Some innovative stuff is there, but (I think) it all lacks final development by the external publisher.

Keyflower is a very pleasant and engaging Eurogame with an original mix of mechanics and an incredible amount of variability. The designation "worker placement" for Keyflower is quite misleading: a more accurate description would be instead that of an economic, bidding game where you use your workers as a currency, giving them away for activating tiles or for acquiring tiles and adding them to your own village. It also incorporates resource management, tile laying, pick up and delivery, set collection, open and secret objectives. It is also a very stylish "point salad" game, but not feeling in any way disjointed (like instead the majority of Stefan Feld's games do feel).

The experience is deep and satisfying. That said, Keyflower is not particularly suitable for occasional players. The core mechanic is quite easy to explain. It isn't a rules-heavy game, as much as an exceptions-heavy one! Also, getting people to get accustomed with the strategic nuances of the game could prove very complicated, if not frustrating, and the first game will always be a learning one for newcomers. Those who don't have the patience to learn, will not feel compelled to invest their time in this game. 

Luck is present in Keyflower, both in the form of randomly dealt workers and of what tiles come out each game. Nevertheless, it never feels luck driven, because players have a great deal of options to choose from to adapt their strategy to the layout they are confronted with.

The game is structured in a way that it can easily accommodate 2 to 6 players. Scalability is almost perfect, although with 5-6 players game time increases a lot and usually exceeds the 2 hours mark.

I recommend Keyflower to every serious Eurogamer, as a fresh and long-lasting experience.

This game is good! The mechanics are so tightly connected to each other. Initially it seems like you are just bidding on things randomly, but come fall/late summer you have a solid plan going to get the most points. The player interaction is great, and you constantly need to adjust your tactics so you cannot plan everything ahead of time.

Very tight intermeshing mechanisms, at heart worker placement build-your-engine type game, but the auction mechanic means no path is obvious.

Very enjoyable.  Kind of a hodge podge of mechanics that are familiar from other euros.  Love how much information is hidden, which can make bidden tense when there are multiple things you want, so you have to choose one and hope your opponent(s) bid on the others with colors you have.  Scales amazingly well taking very little longer to play 4 player than 2.  You also feel like you just began when you realize it is the last season.  Only complaint is depending on the tiles that are out it can be almost too tight.  Requires a good amount of thought but doesn't give me a headache at the end.  Ended up selling it off since it never got played.

Three games so far, so it is actually quite a bit early to write a serious review. First game was a five players one. We liked the game but felt it hard to control since there were several tiles on the table and was tough for us to pay attention to every player village and use his tiles to place our workers. The second game was a two players one and we really liked it better. This does not mean that the game is bad with five, since we have the impression that will get better when we get acquainted with the different tiles and their effects. The third game was a blast, with four players and knowing the tiles teh game is really neat. I think that Keyflower must work really well two, three and four players. The mechanics are innotvative and the game is fast and easy to explain. It lacks theme completly, but I couldn´t care less about it.

Really easy game to learn, and the depth is immediately apparent.  My wife crushed me in our first game, but it was tons of fun.  Can't wait to play again!

UPDATE: I'm in love with this game. So many mechanics all mixed together but they all work flawlessly.

The game with unique mechanics and excellent game play. Every resource, every action you make, have it's own use. Everything is usefull in this game to achieve main goal - get most points. Theme also makes sense - you bid for houses, you use your workers to generate resources, knowledge, transporting and improvements. You expand your village and get some ships maybe. Brilliant.

Components: good components

Length: 1 hour, 1 hour and 1/2
Opinion: fall in love with it. The mechanic of bidding activating the same tile in the center of the table is awesome, the idea of activating the tile of another player is awesome, the idea of keeping all meeples in any tile under your control is awesome, the idea of using just one color for tiles and being it selected by the first player using it is awesome.
Therefor, a terrific game, fast paced and not hard to understand once you get how the color selection works, and the activation at the same time you are bidding on tiles

Great bidding mechanic, clever worker-placement. Relatively simple rules, but a lot of depth. Each game is different due to a varying tile mix and your strategy changes each game.

This game masquerades as a Eurogame full of strategic choices, but it hides a veiled "meaness" to it.  The auction mechanic can single-handedly leave you out of many many points.  I nearly flipped the table in this game, and if you like flipping tables this might be for you.

RATING: 6
In Keyflower, players bid on tiles to add their abilities to each player's settlements. What makes Keyflower unique is each player's settlement/engine can be used by anyone at the table. Filled with simple and interesting bidding and placement mechanics, Keyflower feels like a classic tableau builder efficiency game, but is more forgiving than modern titles. Allowing anyone to set a "trump" color and use any location opens up actions in a liberating way. There are several ways to be able to do the action you need. Some at the detriment of others and some purely beneficial to yourself. "Locking out" others from locations feels tactical, not malicious. Newer games do many similar things, but Keyflower has the pleasant strategy of an early-generation hobby game--one that is from farther back than 2012. The game also appears to scale well at different player counts.

RATING: 6.5
A game that leaves you on your appetite.

You begin to have fun when the game is over. This game should have four more rounds to it (another year). It's too short and like I said, it leaves you on your appetite. I begin to find my game interesting when the last round arrives, which sucks.

Don't buy this unless you are certain to play this game for a long time... it has a limited lifespan when you think about it. Unlike Agricola which has good replayability.

RATING: 7
One of those deep games that actually is really easy to explain. I appreciate Keyflower particularly because, artistically, the design is just beautifully clever. Meeples are currency and workers AND potentially resources. On top of that, there are also just regular resources to gather and potentially upgrade. And of course the tableau-building. It is a fantastic game through and through, my only issue is that it can be quite merciless if you make an early mistake and over-spend workers one round, but that isn't a problem with the game so much as it is like beginners taking "Day Laborer" too much in Agricoloa. It's just something that will improve with time.

A fascinating take on worker-placement, where an auction is interleaved throughout. That said, it's devilishly hard to keep everyone else's villages' powers in mind, so there's some unavoidable obfuscation. That, and worker-placement is a very crowded and competitive field.

It's a nice game that uses the meeples in a great way (as different currencies). Another good thing is, that unlike most similar games, this one is pretty interactive. You have to watch the others and be sure that they will piss you off in some way. :)

The building part of the game however is the same old "get resources and convert to points" stuff which isn't bad in this case, but it just didn't click.

Good game, but nothing I need to own.

Euro amb moltíssima interacció i amb mecàniques molt originals. Tema totalment irrelevant. Ideal per 3-4 jugadors, a 2 perd interés i a 6 és massa caòtic.

El millor euro pur que he provat mai (el TtA no l'incloc dins d'aquest categoria), per a mi és un joc de 10. Jugat amb gent del teu mateix nivell és una de les millors experiencies lúdiques que hi han i es pot jugar en una hora. Porto prop de 30 partides i no tinc en absolut la sensació que hagi cremat el joc, rejugabilitat infinita, especialment amb les losetes promocionals extra.

L'únic però que li puc treure el joc son les expansions, em semblen completament innecesaries i crec que empitjoren el joc...

My #1 ranked game. Beautiful art and wonderful components are complemented by game design and mechanics that are seamless. This one is full of brain busting decisions, forward planning / strategy and tactical short-term decisions based on what your opponents are doing. 

This is the best example I know of a eurogame that manages to make player interaction a truly integral part of gameplay, while still maintaining great engine building / resource management / worker placement mechanics.

Simply a must have for any avid eurogamer. I also highly recommend the two expansions.

Looks like the great Richard Breese is an even better game developper or co-designer; after the fantastic Key Market, this game does not disappoint.  This is design by simplicity at its best: there is absolutely nothing superfluous in that box, yet each decision is an hard one.
Despite a painless rulebook, this is definitely not a gateway or family game - don't let the wondrous, full of light, artwork fool you: this is a gamers game at its best, where the complexity does'nt arise from needlessly convoluted rules, but from the depth of play.
I have one regret though - the graphic design; the icons are too obtrusive and prevent me to enjoy the charming artwork fully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Keyflower is a game that is more than the sum of its parts - this is largely due to the fact that even though the game combines bidding, escalating worker placement, resource management and logistics, tile placement, as well as multiple currencies, the game somehow makes the parts flow into one another in a relatively seamless way. Meeples are almost magic in this game: they are currency, they are workers, and sometimes they are the currency to work on other's tiles. When they are also limited by a requirement to "follow the suit played" (regardless of the type of action they are used for), meeples become functionally multi-purpose in the same way cards are in San Juan, Glory to Rome, or Race for the Galaxy, or in the same way dice are multi-purpose in Quantum.

Other things this game has going for it is its refusal of outright economic snowballing and, accordingly, gives players reasons to continue to fight over tiles, resources, and privileges -- this game encourages some specialization, but paths are not so divergent and non-confrontational that you can coast to victory on a dominant strategy. Rather, there are many instances of self-benefiting moves which also hamper opponents plans. However, they are also likely putting you in a difficult bind.

It doesn't hurt that, like other Key-series games, the art is by Juliet Breese and, accordingly, the game looks great and is full of rich, pleasing details while remaining greatly functional. 

If I have a critique, and it is a small one, it is that the iconography is not always obvious at first.

It could have some decent depth, and I like the auction very much. I'm not particularly good at finding and abusing combos though, and this game sort of requires that. The iconography is relatively clear here, as it follows a format that makes it pretty easy to figure out after the initial explanation.

RATING: 9
Keyflower is a Euro game which allows for the perfect amount of interaction between players! It caters to players who prefer to strategize/maximize and to brutal savages who love to straight up prevent all things that make their fellow player happy. You are forced to walk a fine line between barely scrapping together a functioning village and giving your opponents resources for their equally enticing village. The very workers (meeples) you use for performing actions also act as the driving economy behind Keyflower; this mechanic is so simple yet so ingenious. It really makes your decisions have weight, as your opponents can gain just as much as you have based on your actions. Keyflower is one of the most tightly designed games I've had the honor of owning/playing, and I consider it one of the best Euro games to date.

Bidding with the colored meeples adds a bit of interesting twist into the game. You are using these to make bids or you are using them to activate one of yours or even the enemy's buildings action. There is interaction all over the place which makes the gameplay kinda dinamic and fast paced that i love. The tiles color are beautiful but not bright enough for my taste. The game encourages clever play but you cannot be sure as the barricades hiding the leftover enemy meeples. I don't recommend it as a two player game or playing it online because it is really boring in that case.

RATING: 8.75
Keyflower maintains and heightens the focused, time-limited worker placement game behind Key Market, making it both a more accessible worker placement game and simultaneously more pressured, with only four rounds to create an run point collection efficiently.

I had some concerns regarding artwork, with the printed tile information, but that was entirely forgiveable; the hex information is mostly quite clear, and the play seems straightforward, for the complicated cross-endeavor that it is.

Based on a 1st learning game I will suggest this game may well be the best of the Key games so far, and it is one I immediately want to get on the table.

I have no hesitation in starting this at an 8, putting it above Agricola and immediately in my top 25 rated games.  It was terrific.

Raised this to an 8.25 - in my top 10 games.

Raised this again to 8.5 after 5 games - this game excels at every count.

Raised to 8.75 after 10 plays- this is simply excellent.

Keyflower has one of the best blends of mechanisms, and somehow for once, the Euro settlement theme actually kind of feels right. The bidding, the worker placement, the resource collection (and conversion), the secret/public information, the winter tile choice(s), and the interaction are all absolutely brilliant. This isn't another straightforward resource conversion game. This game is also surprisingly tactical. Strategy matters, but the best players will be able to throw it out the window at the right time. I only see "luck" in the traditional sense mattering much for groups who don't look around and discuss game conditions often (ie, a player running away with an obvious strategy that had the right tiles come into play). Seeing combos come together (or missing a great combo by a small margin) is great. The game is tight with a lot of options available that diminish quickly. The interaction is both in your face and subtle, and it is absolutely critical. Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in your own tableau (or it's hard to be bothered to squint across the table). The replayability, especially with the expansion, is very high. I don't think I'll turn down a game of Keyflower for some time.

Very enjoyable. The first game can be a bit of a learning experience, but well worth the effort. Smart - allows subtle decisions. Scales well, fun with 3-5 as with 2. I do like the artwork.

Our 2 player games are very quick - about 45 mins - once you know the rules!

There are a couple of clunky rules (i.e. transportation and upgrade, some summer boat tiles, scoring tiles) that makes it a bit unintuitive for newbie teaching and introduction.

Using meeples to bid on tiles to add to your village or activate tiles in your or other peoples' villages. There is a bit of stuff to wrap your head around--not winning an auction isn't bad, as you can just use the tile in someone else's village (which might actually hamper their ability to use the tile). The game is very cute and it has a puzzely thing going for where to place your new tiles (paths must connect).

I get that the game *could* play six, but oh my gosh, that just seems like an awful idea.

You could argue that this is just Carcassonne with bidding, but there are clever elements here: the ability to set the 'colour' of bids/actions for a tile and moving goods to obtain upgraded tiles and endgame bonuses. In spite of the heaviness there's still a substantial random factor, when bidding for early tiles you don't know which late tiles will come out so there's no sense of relative value, you're just bidding and hoping. It's also completely themeless. Overall a typical Richard Breese design, all intellect, no soul.

RATING: 7
There's a lot going on here, but somehow, the game doesn't seem overly heavy.  The game consists mostly of a unique auction mechanism that reminds me of--something, but I'm not sure what.  Basically, you have workers you can use EITHER to bid OR to perform actions, but these are not two different phases. Instead, you have all these options available to you at once.  This is already pretty interesting, but when you add in the shortness of the game (only four rounds) and the possibility of retrieving some meeples, not to mention the endgame scoring... it's pretty interesting.  I'd have to play again, but I think this one is a winner. (1 play)

I think there are a lot of interesting decisions when playing this game. Bid for a tile or play on a tile, which color and how many to use, play on your own tiles or play on someone else's tiles, when/if to bid for first boat pick/first player, etc.  This is even better with the merchants expansion.

The mechanics behind this game are very complex and therefore make for a great game, but playing this for the first time was really not enjoyable as i had little idea of how to be successful. I expect it would improve a lot on second play. Some elements of the game such as houses used to hide tokens are very flimsy and poorly produced. It is also very thematically dry (i.e. a bit boring).

Mi primer juego de la serie Key. 

Consiste en un juego de colocación de trabajadores, subastas y cierto componente espacial de puzzle con mecánica "pick and deliver".

Durante 4 turnos, salen a subasta unas losetas. La moneda para comprarlas son los meeples (colonos que llegan al nuevo mundo a bordo de barcos) Los jugadores pujan por quedárselas teniendo presente que:

- Hay Meeples en tres (+1 extra) colores pero no se asocian con ningún jugador. Son colonos de "nacionalidades" distintas que no se llevan bien entre sí.

- Durante su turno, un jugador usa uno o más de sus meeples para pujar por una loseta (si gana, la añade a su poblado), o bien los usa para activar la loseta y hacer su habilidad (sea propia, ajena o ¡incluso en proceso de subasta!)

- Una vez que alguien coloca un meeple en una loseta (como puja o para activarla), el resto de meeples que se colocan en ella en ese turno, deben ser del mismo color.

Con esta mecánica, entre todos los jugadores van construyendo un "mecanismo" de obtención de PV´s y recursos. Lo que el jugador debe determinar es qué partes de ese mecanismo quiere controlar (para ello lo de pujar por las losetas) y qué partes debería explotar (situando sobre las losetas de los demás sus trabajadores, al estilo de Le Havre y sus edificios)

PROS: La mecánica de "subastas con colores" que cierra las opciones a los demás por no tener de tu color. Eso le hace ser uno de los mejores en mi colección. Funciona de 2-6 jugadores (teóricamente). Muchas opciones abiertas al poder usar las losetas de los demás.

CONS: Las losetas del último turno tienen algunas que parecen muy descompensadoras. La parte espacial y de pick and deliver parece añadir poco a la mecánica principal, tan sólo "duración".

Superb medium-heavy thinky Euro.  The game has a lot going on, but it all comes together elegantly in a smooth composition.  There are only 4 rounds of play, corresponding to seasons in the year.  Players must choose from a tasty buffet of decisions with the goal of maximization of the final score.  The two primary mechanics in Keyflower are placing workers on tiles to perform work, which generates resources or placing workers in tense bidding activity to compete for the privilege of taking ownership of offered tiles that can be added to his village.

RATING: 7
This is the sort of game that you need to play a half dozen times to know what is worth collecting and strategies to employ (until then, you get your ass kicked).  Advantage lays entirely with the experienced player.  Plays in 4 turns (fast) with random tiles coming out, so you have to focus on a strategy from the very beginning (so if you don't know what you're doing, or have to change your mind because someone else took your tile, you're screwed).

Comments:
This may be true of all games, but here goes. In my opinion, Keyflower is, above all, a test to see how well you can assess game states. It tosses a wall of information at you and asks you to make good decisions based off that information.

Superficially, there is all sorts of other systems at play. You have an auction mechanic that is based around effective valuation of different tiles. You have a worker placement game that is slightly modified from that of an Agricola or a Le Havre by making sharing a possibility. In the end though, all the decisions you make in those subsystems are driven by how well you can parse the current game state.

Having played it a few times now. I feel like I've had my "click" moment where I start to realize how to play it reasonably well. Still, I'd like to sink some more time into it. Not least because I have two unplayed expansions, but also because I want to see if my assessment of its focus on assessment holds up.

No sleeves needed.

Really good mechanics here, the only downside of the game is the learning curve, I mean this game could be so catchy, but then at the first 4-5 games it isn't yet, because everybody should understood every concept and trick of the game to have a lot of fun, and this because the main mechanic is bidding so if you don'the know what are you bidding for Exactly it becomes meaningless and casual. In fact my first few games were too random, even the fact that you have your winter tiles at the beginning is quite confusing until your 4th/5th game. But then if your playing group arrives there you're done, the game is itself amazingly entertaining and balanced when you really know how to play properly!

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

This game was my first true love when getting into the hobby and remains on top even now because of it`s quick play time, the intensity of the bidding system and the puzzle of resource management. It is very tight, the hidden goals give you something different to aim for each game and you have to pay close attention to your partner`s actions to make sure they do not get a resource engine in place to outscore you at the end of the game. Have played it with 4/5 players and it works really well with all play counts, though the time increases obviously. 

[b]Both Expansions Review:[/b] 

I was greatly disappointed with [i]"The Farmers"[/i] expansion as a stand-alone expansion. The new animals mechanic is interesting, but having one animal per field is not worth the effort unless you have the Sheep Shelter which always results in a dozen sheep being piled on top of one another. Also adding the animal tiles to the mix greatly reduces the tightness of the game as it makes it very difficult to set up any kind of resource engine. If there were tiles to trade animals for resources I think the expansion would be a lot better. As is, you are often left with many buildings not upgraded because of the lack of resources, even with 2 gold for taking first place now. On top of all that, many tiles are often useless in Autumn because you do not have the resources to use the likes of the Forge, Blacksmith, Sawmill, Timber yard, etc. 
However, with all that said, once the [i]"The Farmers"[/i] is mixed with [i]"The Merchants"[/i] the game miraculously becomes fantastic once more! 
With the additions of the contracts, there is now always a valid use for all base game resources, even if the Autumn tile you're hoping for doesn't show up. And if you're left with a vastly useless autumn season, the extensions allow you to score some extra points from just upgrading tiles already in your town. I really enjoy the mechanic of locking colors allowed on a tile with the use of extensions as well. 
Overall, my hat goes off the Richard Breeze for turning a expansion I despised into something immensely enjoyable. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Set in the delightful world of [i]"Key"[/i]
- A nice variety of choices available on every turn
- Not knowing what colors your partner has always makes bidding tense.
- A lot of fun comes from balancing the use of your workers between bidding and activation of tiles. 
- Plays in around 40 minutes for 2 players.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- [i]"The Farmers"[/i] expansion
- You have to be very conscious of your partner`s actions as some of the resource engines can result in runaway scores.

I like the determinism of worker placement games. They are simple and deep without having to resort to shallow theatrics and dramatic mechanisms, but instead favor subtle interactive tensions created by evolving strategic landscapes due to opponents' tactics.

Brilliant hybrid of action selection and auction. Workers = currency and actions. Bid on tiles with workers to build your town, then use workers to activate your buildings to generate points. BUT you can activate your opponent's tiles which prevents them from generating points at the cost of your workers. 

Great art, fast pace, deceptively conniving.

RATING: 7.5
I found this to be a very good WP/auction euro, that should scale very well, has many ways to score, and turns generally move along at a good pace with a good game time to match. 

Some things I liked less than the above would be the usual meaningless theme, the colour WP restriction could be a little harsh at times (but usually you have other things you can do, just might not be what you wanted at times) and there was just a little bit of luck but it could sting a little at an inopportune time. It also had the Le Havre effect, where you need to look around the table to see if you wanted to use other people's buildings, only here it was much easier to see what they had. Oh, and I also don't like games with no tie-breaker unless there really isn't a good way to do it, not sure here but it seemed most tiles or workers could have sufficed. 

I should note that I played with the Farmers expansion which I rate an 8, it added to the game in a couple of nice (but small) ways including one other way to score and it also added a boatload more tiles. It also made going for the boats a little more interesting.

RATING: 10
Reigning all-time favorite.  Loads of replayability.  Scales better from 2-6 players than any other game.

Pretty interesting auction game.  Most of the game is bidding on tiles and then using them (yours and others') to gain points.  But you bid with meeples of one color rather than with money or points.  Meeples are the currency and once the auction has started for a particular tile, you MUST bid in that color.  If you don't have that color, too bad.  You can also bid for turn order.  

This is one of the hardest games I've ever played, and good meeple management is critical.  Lots and lots of brainburning fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favourite games. Its essentially an auction and worker placement game. But with this game there is an added twist, the workers you use for "worker placement" are also the currency you use to bid for the tiles. Players have to balance between using too many workers to bid vs using the tile's abilities. Another interesting aspect is the "gifting of workers" to other players just to use their tile's 
ability. Sometimes you're forced to do that in order to produce certain goods.

Only downside I can think of in this game is the fiddly setup at the beginning of the game since less players means some tiles had to be removed before the start of the game.

It seems like color management and tracking is very important in this game, which makes the fact that meeples are hidden even after they've been revealed pretty frustrating. This also seemed to make the tiles that let you trade out colors really powerful. And that to me was the least interesting part of the game. And the fact that the tiles that come out are completely random is a bit odd. Variability from game to game is definitely nice but the fact that you might just not have any access at all to certain resources is bizarre.

But I do like how the tiles are upgradeable and the special powers from the boats were cool, as was the spatial aspect of placing the tiles you bought.

Excellent game, on top of the usual worker placement resource game, there is also a lot more emphasis on figuring out what other players are doing. 

For example, you need to figure out what bid to put in on tiles that you think will last, and you also need a backup plan if you get outbid. It is possible to get lulled into a false sense of security if all other players are passing, only for one of said players to snipe your bid after you have played all your pieces (in this game the round doesn't end until all players pass consecutively, until then a player who has passed can still take a turn when play next comes round to that player).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Keyflower is interesting.  You are getting a handful of figures of different colors that are kept secret behind your screen.  You then in essence bid for the use of different tiles, with each bid beyond the first needing to be with figures of the same color.  You may get to add these tiles to your own set (I forget the mechanism).  You can still use tiles that have been claimed by other players but then they get to use the figures so owning a tile is a significant benefit.  Each tile does something different, so you can set up a machine where a tile creates raw materials that can then get processed into better materials and thence into points or figures for the next round.  So this is a low-key bidding game plus worker placement plus machine building.  It's got some interesting strategies to it.  I'm less enthusiastic about it than I might have been I think since it's mechanics are rather abstract and thus a bit disconnected from theme and I really like theme.  There's no story here.  I also didn't come away with the desire to play again to work out strategies as it is very tactical.  But otherwise I'd be okay with playing it, just not my first choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Keyflower has some very interesting mechanisms. For instance: I enjoy the way tiles can be used or bid on to acquire, the way each meeple color is like a different currency that changes what can be used to use or bid on a tile, and the hidden knowledge of tiles that can be used in the final round.

My problem is that the whole affair is a bit too chaotic. It can be difficult obtain the meeples you want without sacrificing other point scoring opportunities. Where players sit in relation to the start player can cause imbalances, especially in larger games. While the game does have sort of a reward for others using your tiles, it can be disheartening to have others use what you invested in before you can.

Keyflower reminds me of Ra, another game with auctions in which it is hard to control the bidding currency. I don't usually care for games like that, and while there is much I admire about Keyflower, it's not a game that grabs me with its strategic possibilities as much as it makes me dread being unfortunate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's honestly the most "natural" feeling game I've ever played. It's like comparing football/soccer to baseball. Yes they both make sense once you've been exposed to them long enough, but the base mechanics of football/soccer just feel more seamless than baseball (not that this makes one game better than the other) . I find it crazy how poorly the Keyflower rulebook explains the rules given how intuitive the gameplay actually is.

It's amazing how versatile the game can is when there only 12 possible tiles that can flip during each of the 4 seasons, and they are all basically cycles (variations of the same thing for different resource types).

Last thing I love about it is that once you are playing with somewhat experienced players (5-10+ plays) you are basically forced to diversify or risk getting blocked entirely and scoring next to nothing. Some strategies when unencumbered will always score more than others, but that's mitigated by what tiles actually flip and how heavily you are forced to fight for the tiles you want.

The closest thing there is to a "winning strategy" is when the other players simply let you play solitaire which, again, will almost never happen with more experienced players.

I've played the game without any expansions easily over 50 times, probably closer to 100 and I don't see myself getting bored of it any time soon.

Kind of reminds me of [gameid=66362] except you replace auto activating via placement of tiles with activating via worker placement... plus of course the auctions.  Liked my 1st play and even with 4 of us being 1st time players (1 had read the rules and played a 1 player game test run before) played in what seemed a relatively fast 2 hours.

Glad there was a 2nd printing of this game but sadly the reprint has an exclusive distributor so very few etailers carrying it and none appear to be discounting.

Update: 2nd play played out completely different from the 1st!  Other than the bidding for new tiles and turn order everyone seemed to activate their own buildings.  Turned into a blow out run a way leader who had acquired the most tiles the first season and using them and kept growing the number of workers.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2013)

Brilliant game, I love it. Keyflower has the potential to go even higher in my personal ratings. This is a great game, with simple rules but with very hard decisions (where to play/bid, which color should I play, should I play in another´s player village?)  At the beginning, the game is relatively easy and you have few options but as the game develops you begin to have a wider array of options. It can paralyze some gamers, so I want to play this with fast players only, also I prefer to play it with 4 players, more than that and the downtime can be an issue. It has some luck, but I feel I can react to it so it doesn’t really bothers me. 

The game components are high quality, and the art is very good too, most tiles` art clearly shows its function. 

The game runs for four seasons, still you feel that is way too short and you wish the game length was a little longer :D.

Great game, I want to buy it and I’m now official a fan of Mr. Breese (I also love Reef Encounter). I hope to play this soon again. It has a lot of depth but it is very simple rules wise.

After more plays, I continue to love Keyflower. I bought it along with the expansion, but as I feel the game has still a lot of unexplored terrain, I won’t play with the expansion yet.

I love that, although I understand the rules, I don’t know how to do well on a regular basis. I’m never sure who is winning until the very end. Tense game filled with hard decisions. After we finish a play we always talk about what we did wrong. The luck factor sometimes decides who wins, but I still feel the better player will win most times regardless of luck.

I won’t say no to a game of Keyflower.

I have played lots of Keyflower now, but my desire play it has decreased a bit over time, due to this I’m decreasing its rating.  . I think I need to play with the expansions now to add life to the game. I still consider it a good game and I won’t ever sell it.

Now I can judge better who is winning :D.

Some of the promo tiles for the game are  VERY expensive, I have them all nonetheless, but that is very negative. Why not make them widely available?

Love this game!  It took us a few plays and a few times through the rule book to get it all right.  What a fun combination of auction/bidding, worker placement, hidden information, engine (village) building, and massive amounts of meeples!

Anything Keyflower is an automatic purchase for me.  Bring it on!

So, I realize this game is all the rage, but you can have things go very badly against you in the first round and not be able to do anything about it.  In a game with a high number of people playing, you can lose auctions to a number of different people and end up with nothing.  You can't see what meeples others have and so you can't even mitigate that danger.  And then you still have three more rounds to play.

RATING: 3
Worker placement, irrelevant build-your-own-medieval-village theme, auctions to buy tiles with special powers, resource gathering/juggling, ... haven't I seen this sort of thing somewhere before? Maybe a couple of hundred times??

The ability to use others' tiles is neat, but I tired of playing this stuff a number years ago.

I still enjoy 45-60 minute Euros, but this weighed in at two hours including a lot of downtime, which meant for me it really dragged (and I wasn't the only one at the table thinking that).

This is a neat game...fairly nasty but I feel that this can be mitigated to an extent.  Given the price point of this game I'd strongly recommend trying it before you buy it...certainly not for all groups but it's my favorite of the Key series I've played. 

After more plays I'm still really enjoying this title.  It's also become a quicker game for our group to play.  With three experienced players we're knocking out a game in about an hour and a half if not a little better.

This game is just brilliant! The way the bidding and worker placement is mixed together makes for some difficult and fun decisions. The interaction is also quite excellent in both the bidding and the worker placement mechanisms (especially since any tile on the table can be used by anyone -- even those tiles that are currently up for auction).

2 players - good, but not the best.
6 players - good, but can run a bit long.

Keeps getting better the more I play it. I only discovered this pearl at Essen 2013, a year after release. Thought it looked pretty standard and boring, but boy was I wrong. Has more teeth than most eurogames, great tension, and auction system that isnt annoying and lots of ways to mitigate when someone screws with your plans. Also love that it is not a point salad game, you have to work for what you get. Havent even considered playing with the expansion yet, and for me, that says a lot. Slowly creeping up my 'favorite euros' rank

RATING: 8
Keyflower is a medium-weight auction-based city-building game divided into four auction rounds (or "seasons"). Meeples are used for currency, which makes it stand out from any other game I own. Meeples come in 4 colors and when a tile is bid upon or used, only that color can used on that tile for the rest of the season. Most of the interest involves how to use the colors to your advantage to block or over-bid other players in the chosen colors. Turn order is very important to ensure you get first choice on the colors used on the tiles you need to use or win. Tiles you won in a previous turn are added to your village and meeples used to activate them are returned to you at the end of the season. You can also use tiles in other players' villages, but they'll get the meeples you put there. Actions used on tiles not-yet-won get removed.

Since most points come from point-scoring tiles in the final phase of the game, it is difficult to be sure if what you are doing will pay off as much as you hope. It is a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to position yourself in that uncertainty. The uncertainty brings high-replayability, but could also leave more strategic gamers feeling a bit empty. There are enough manipulation points to keep the game interesting for me and I'd be happy to play this anytime.

Like a euro cover song (auctions, logistics, worker placement, engine building, resource conversion, tile placement etc) but with a unique arrangement via its worker currency that helps it stand out. At its core is a four-round auction where workers act as tile activators, currency, and in some cases VPs. The resulting play provides an interesting sequencing puzzle intertwined with worker (currency) re-allocation. 

I acquierd this mainly with my wife in mind who longed for euros like Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Reef Encounter, and Cavum. This seemed similar enough whilst providing a unique experience in its own right. A little lighter and friendlier than I had imagined but she was pleased.

I found the first game a little tough with so many different options, but it became clearer by the end. Everyone started with two possible victory tiles. This seemed problematic since these could drive your strategy, but these were not necessarily balanced between players. Plus everyone could bid on these at the end potentially ruining your strategy. The bidding mechanic was interesting of having different colored meeples that would lock in the color of a tile. The problem was you might really want a tile, but the colors you got were random so you might not even have a chance to bid. Building your own city in which you could then get back your meeples or those of other players was interesting. Overall the game seemed chaotic with lots of options requiring you to constantly adjust to what was available. This was also one of the least thematic Euros that I have played. The art and pieces were not that interesting. I would like to play it some more, but I am a little surprised it is rated so high on the Geek. I am guessing some of its appeal may be because it is so much less predictable than many Euros.

After 5 plays one thing does concern me about Keyflower. The Winter tiles. It seems that to win you must successfully abuse one of the Winter tiles you are dealt. This often requires certain other tiles to appear in the game. This is bad for several reasons. First you might get dealt initial Winter tiles which are just bad, they do not all have the same scoring potential. Secondly you may be screwed because the other tiles you need to make a scoring tile work don't show up. 

The only solution to this problem that I can think of is to have all the Winter tiles face up at the start but this changes the game significantly. Perhaps more plays will show me this isn't a problem, but for now I'm very uneasy about this.

--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

This is an excellent game! It mixes worker placement and auction into one. You can place workers to activate your own or someone elses tiles. You can even activate the tiles that are up for auction that round. The same keyples (a.k.a. meeples/workers) that you use to activate tiles also allow you to bid for tiles and if you win not only do you get to add the tile to your village you also collect any keyples that were used to activate the tile that round. Likewise, if someone uses your village tiles you collect their keyples to use next round. The keyples spent on winning bids are lost to the bag...

Bag you say? Yes, there are essentially 3 colours of keyples red, blue and yellow. You draw a random set of 8 at the start of the game and you get more between rounds when you win auctions for boats (new settlers arriving in the keydom). If you use a tile or bid on a tile you are choosing which colour of keyple will be associated with that tile for the duration of the round. If someone else wants to activate or bid on the tile they have to use the same colour of keyple. 

These mechanics are very cool, they present very novel and interesting decisions to think over. The game also has a lot of variety since only some tiles are used each game.

On third play I didn't get screwed by the boat as we played it differently and probably correct for the first time, that the principal bidding colour remains the original colour unless all workers of the initial colour are removed. Otherwise, it would have happened the third time. Upgraded to 7/10 with this "new" rule.
----
Second play was a disappointment as well. One player targeted me in the last round repeatedly although she could have targetted anybody else as well. It cost me more than a fourth of my total points relegating me to a distant fifth place. As in the first play, the central culprit causing my dissatisfaction was the boat which allows a player to overbid in a different colour which knocked off my preparations against being overbid. It opens up random screwing (too) much. A pity since I started to enjoy the bidding and planning up to this point.
----
Keyflower works perfectly fine, has strategic depth and well thought-out new elements like using workers as currency for auctions as well as for activating buildings. It's interesting that workers can change loyalty when they are placed in opponents' buildings thereby increasing opponents' future action potential.
Still, my first play left me lukewarm. It might be the subtle but directed player interactions that can decide the game against you or the amateurish functional elements that nullify an otherwise exceptional artwork. Barring Reef Encounter, Breese's games always cause this reaction with me for some reasons. Although Keyflower got closest to convincing me and might rise to a 7 with more plays. Contrary to Key Market, it at least has an ease of play and an acceptable playtime once players got the rules down that makes further play more viable.

Interesting auction game. Generally, my impression was that there was too much hidden information (e.g. what workers others had) that made the auction mechanic fairly random. Also, it is hard to see all of your opponents pieces across the table, which is critical to the game. It's not a bad game, just not a great one.

I enjoy the auction aspect of the game as well as the challenge of moving cubes around your individual setup. I appreciate the variety of the tiles, but we have had games that have been ruined by the random tile draw - ones where no carts came out, making some strategies completely pointless and the game quite dull.

The player screens are kind of dumb, though. Frustrating and way too fragile. I also do not agree with Game Salute's business model and would not support or purchase the game if it was the only option of purchase.

RATING: 6
Perhaps most reminiscent of Le Havre with a somewhat shoehorned spatial element, more randomness and lots of hidden-but-trackable information. There are ten resources divided into three types, which are of course employed and exchanged in various ways to produce victory points in the end. The key distinguishing elements are how you concurrently bid for and activate production and conversion abilities, and how this locks the currency usable for a tile on a turn. In the end you must realize much of your scoring potential by securing point generators in the auction, and slight differences in intent, bidding power and guesswork can lead to big point swings. The game is seemingly sensitive to mistakes, mischief and misfortune when it comes to competing for the same payoffs. Player screens are tricky to assemble and fit back in the box, but the rest of the stuff is nice.

A sort of worker placement and your workers are also the currency bidding game, with a little tableau/city building built in. Very unique and hard to describe other than being a fun euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another game with a lot of interesting decision making. I love the worker placement aspect of the game. Anyone can use any building so long as they pay the proper amount of workers. The player who owns the workers get to keep them so it's beneficial to fight and try to win a useful tile since other players will most probably pay you to use it.
I also love how the colors of the meeples come into play. The color of the meeple determine the color of all subsequent meeple placement on that tile/bid. So a player can control/block a tile from usage/bid if he/she uses a meeple color which he/she is strong at.

Unfortunately, the end game mechanics using the winter tiles is not working out too well. A player may invest heavily on a type of play and yet might not be able to benefit from it if he/she fail to win the tile at the end of the game. This game is also fairly prone to analysis paralysis. Game duration might take longer than usual especially in a game where players have many meeples. 

I also don't really like how weak the spring tiles are in comparison to the summer and autumn tiles. It often seems that the game finally starts to run properly when gameplay reaches autumn but by then there's only autumn and winter left to play for. 

Despite all that, I still very much enjoy the game. Keyflower is one of my go-to game if I want to have something mildly heavy which keeps me fully occupied for at least 2 hours.

2017-07-16 - 6.5 - A fine euro game, which I will gladly play, but rather not suggest. It's very dry, which means for me that the theme is very artificial. The whole game is a bunch of mechanism put together, which don't make much sense apart from "well, that's in the rules". Although they work pretty well.

2017-09-18 - 6.5->5 - Too high rating. I didn't like it too much. I could play it, don't miss it at all. Too dry.

Very smart design. Every single detail matter when playing. Several options to think without a lot of AP because of the color restriction. Some of the tiles are unbalanced, but this is generates an active auction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of my favourite games because of the unique mix of worker placement and auction. You bid with your available workers so you are using up your potential actions in order to acquire tiles into your tableau. The auctions also are dependent on the colour of the worker which adds to the dilemma of how many workers to bid when you might not have many workers of that particular colour. The auctions are cutthroat and lead to some very tough decisions on how many workers to sacrifice just to acquire a tile you really need. Mix those tense auctions with a unique tableau builder and worker placement game and this is a top 10 game for me.

Great worker placement game with a bidding element that is very engaging, the available options change every game and really keep the game fresh and tactical to a degree. I love the idea of using tiles in other player villages and all the strategic avenues the game provides.

Keyflower is a game about managing resources (meeples) and bidding. The game is a little different each time due to a limited number of tiles being available for bid.  Not much interaction amongst players other than bidding, but you can use other player's tiles.  Very fun and challenging, with a great balance of strategy vs time to play.

Excellent game, its simple enough for anyone to play, but extremely deep in terms of the choices you can make. Lots of tension and tough decisions on how far you will go in the bid for control over the various tiles you want to add to your city.

Very innovative and I like the fact it doesn't use cards, just heavy cardboard tiles (which means you won't have to spend money to buy sleeves).

Just a very unique, elegant and clever game.

Only got the chance to play it once, and it was with some very experienced players. Reminded me very much like a hybrid of Catan and Imperial Settlers. The rules aren't too difficult, but there are some nuances you need to be aware of and constantly have to be thinking ahead.

RATING: 7
Okay game.  It's different with respect to the rules for using and placing meeples.  I need to play it more; more plays could cause my rating to go up.  This is a short game at only four rounds (or seasons) although AP players can slow it down.  It seemed okay with five players so is decent at that player count.

I hate player screens and especially these because they are not very concealing and easily fall over.

I'm starting to feel more kind toward this game.  My rating may go up.

1 partida en Juégame Store.

Como muchos de estos juegos de esta "complejidad", supongo que una partida no es suficiente para poder dar una opinión objetiva; ya que al principio vas perdido, en el sentido de que vas haciendo cosas sin saber muy bien si te van a servir de mucho o si son mejores opciones que el resto que tienes disponibles.

Soy muy crítico con esta clases de juegos, porque no es que me cueste entender los juegos, es que opino que la complejidad debería ir de la mano de la experiencia de juego... de modo que un juego que sea difícil te aporte tanto que no te importe.

Pues bien, en este juego tengo la sensación de que es innecesariamente complejo. No me ha gustado.

Played with 2 and 3 players. Love the winter tile goals. Love that they need to bid on at the end. The bidding and worker placement is a lot of fun. Using a random subset of tiles makes tons of different combinations. So many complex interactions with a a limited number of actions.

I wanted to like this game, but something about was always off to me, I am not sure wither it is because of how complicated it is or because of the main theme, but the strategy in it can sometimes because very luck based, the concept of winter tiles is very strange, the fact that your resources can simple mean nothing at the end of the game is kind of disturbing, over the course of the game it doesn't feel like you have a lot going on around the table despite all the details this game has.

Well, on the one hand you have some really clever workerplacement/tile activating/auction mechanism, on the other hand you have euro boredom of the worst kind with tile placement and ressource managment while things are pretty unschedulable because of the randomness of the drawn tiles in each season (btw, if you like that second part, there are so much better games out there doing excactly this). This one would really be a gem for ages, if the tiles and their actions would have been as creative as the first mentioned mechanism...

Reasonably heavy game, the movement rules are a bit difficult to explain.  There are also many small rules that are easy to miss that have a profound effect on the game.

Overall, I enjoy it!  Most bids are meaningful, even if only for the colour of said bid.  One of those games that I can lose badly and still enjoy, which is a good sign.

The game is slightly more enjoyable with the "many meeple" strategy, though luckily that is probably not the best strategy.

Wonderful combination of village building, worker placement and auction. Even with 2 players was a tense game of too many great options to choose from. Great player screens. Love that the seasons feel different and information was not perfect. This seems to prevent any real AP from setting in (though with 2p you could  memory-game it). 6p took a while to go around the table and lots of options so I imagine 2-4 is a sweet spot (although still enjoyable)

Updated 05-28-2013 - Recently picked this one up and have played 2 more times.  It's really pretty good!  Bumped it to an 8.  There are some real decisions to be made in this game and you always need to keep an eye on the other players, but at the same time it's not really heavy.  It's on the lighter side of the complexity I really want to see in my games nowadays.

Mechanics-wise there's a lot going on, from bidding for buildings to add to your village (Homesteaders anyone?), the spatial element, worker placement, and resources requiring logistics (a bit of Neuland here perhaps). Despite all this the game doesn't feel needlessly complex or bloated, and the elements fuse together nicely creating a relatively quick game, considering the amount of things available to do.

The bidding is done using the different colors of workers as currencies. That and using others' buildings with your workers (but losing them to the buildings' owners after that) adds some needed interaction, without which the game would probably end up being a quite dry optimization exercise.

RATING: 8
A very nice game with interesting mechanism. Based on its first play the game seems to be well rounded with a number of strategies interwoven into the mix. It is worke placement with workers either being used for money to bid for tiles to increase territory, or they are used as workers to gain resources etc. The former are lost whilst the latter you retain. I look forward to the next game. 
The mechanisms are easily learnt, there are some 50+ tiles each with a unique ability that need to be understood but which also give it its depth. Our first play as a learning game with three players took 3 hours. So slightly on the heavier side of light.

Nice ideas with many new ideas. BUT the biggest issue here is, that this is (again) one of those games, where you can do a lot of this and that and get points this and that way which makes it impossible too see who is really doing well so you could block him/her. A bit more streamlined and Keyflower would be excellent. So, Keythedral is still the best there is. UPDATED 3/2017: Hah, 'Key to the City London' is here so I've got my Keyflower expwrience. No need to play this anymore!

RATING: N/A
Almost like a resource/bidding/engine building Carcazzonne. Lots of strategy... 

Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a "home" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.

The latest Key... game has some of the key features of the series (producing and movement on different landscape tiles, novel ways of worker placement etc.) and is a very up-to-date mix of trendy Euro games that try to re-invent worker placement. Actually, the core mechanism mixes two of my favorite lighter-middleweight family games from the past few years, Asara (worker placement with colored workers - the first one placed at a location tells you the suit that must be followed) and Lancaster (majority meets wp; defeated workers can be used again) with the also trendy "building your own display but having the possibility to use the other players' buildings" idea. And it's not even a very long game! It might be more complex and a bit fiddlier than what I really like but I rather enjoyed this title.

However, I do feel that it has several mechanisms I typically enjoy, and I would like to try at least once again.

RATING: 9
Enjoyed the mixing of currency (meeples) as also the activator for tiles so one has to balance acquisition and production of tiles.  Resources are used to upgrade tiles and score points at the end of the game.  Some concern over some tiles potentially being overpowered.  Clever mechanism in that meeples used to activate tiles in your village are yours to use next season.  Sometimes you can get a nice production engine going on your own village tiles where you just keep paying yourself which is nice!  

After people start to know the tiles, I think the game will become more interesting.  There are certain winter tiles that people need to watch what others are taking in earlier seasons to potentially get in the way and obstruct - which can be done easily by placing three workers on the tile to perform the action right away to prevent any more use of the tile.  If you see someone collecting skills, you better block them because that 10 points for every set of three unique skills is pretty dangerous (IE, I've scored 60 points off that tile already).

RATING: 9
I liked the little laughs and groans when outbid: this is nice, for a euro. This is a form of constant "combat" which is rarely present in most euros.

Also, I appreciated the mix of mechanisms (meaningful bidding, activation, currency (meeple) management, resources and their transport and use in upgrades, map creation,… The different powers are varied enough, and they are interlocking, so that even a small set of tiles lead to an exponential tree of moves (sequence of moves? color of workers? response of the opponent? bidding or activation?…).

My opponent found the game a little "diluted". I guess that thinking during my turns would have helped (instead of reminding me so often that it was my turn: looking at the tiles could have prompted new ideas, given new hints).

Probably not as tense as Caylus, for me (IIRC, I played Caylus once, and played Caylus Magna Carta many times).

The components are very good: nicely cut and painted meeples (the yellow paint could be thicker, on some meeples), thick enough cardboard, thick wood, nicely cut, nice drawings on the tiles,…

Easily forgotten rules:
- Outbid workers can be used for bidding, production/action, or bag exchange (Tavern, Fair, Peddler, Store,…, in which case extraneous workers are just lost to the bag).
- Tavern: the original worker is put in the bag *after drawing from it* (it is not a payment).
- The tiles on which we bid can be activated.

After playing Keyflower in the middle of other games:

I am not a huge fan of games where one gets points little by little, from many areas in parallel, if an optimization of many local options. I prefer games where my strategy is more focused at each moment in time, even if the strategy can shift (Clockwork Wars, but also Race for the Galaxy, and Puzzle Strike), as this gives them more flavor, by creating more of a story, or at list something that can be explained in relatively simple term: this creates clarity—where Keyflower leaves me wondering why in the world I lost precisely.

Still a very good Euro, I think, that has the rare virtue of having bidding that works with 2.

RATING: 7
Mechanically this game is a masterpiece. Like Concordia it throws a smattering of mechanics together, but manages to make them do so seamlessly. All of the difficult decisions of a Euro but with tons of interaction via sniping of actions or bids. Like Power Grid, the interaction level is very high for a Euro, but you can still basically generally do almost anything if you are willing to pay through the nose for it. There are many things to consider; which tiles to bid on, which tiles to take actions, which tiles to upgrade, incentivizing your opponents to leach off your tiles so you can take their meeples, timing of everything, spatial aspect of your tiles and orientation, and turn order, with valuations changing throughout the course of the season as people make things more expensive. You also have to decide with what color and with how much you are willing to pay for everything to disincentivize your opponents. At the same time though the basic core concepts are very simple: place workers to bid for tiles or take actions, and so while there is a very high level of strategy, it is also not information overload the way that e.g. Eclipse or Terra Mystica are. 

The downsides of this game are that it is fairly abstract, and I'm really not a fan of the washed out colors and lack of shading in the artwork. It's not even that functional as the lack of distinction in the tiles makes them kind of blend together unless you're focusing on them. Also, while for the first half of each season gameplay flows pretty smoothly, the latter half when it is just one person taking their actions and everyone else having to verbally reaffirm they are passing can be quite annoying, especially if someone actually can take an action and is just waiting for the right time to do so (because then they still spend time assessing while for the most part not doing anything). Finally, while I am sure the way different people play really affects the game, I wish you didn't use 2/3 of the tiles each game for a 4 player game, and fear replayability.

This is an excellent worker placement game. There are a lot of fun mechanics to this game that work well together (bidding, tile placement, worker placement).  All of it fits nicely together in a game that never feels too long and is always satisfying.

Also, beautiful artwork and components.

Would love to get this to the table more. Curious to try this as a 2 player.

Even though this game is not 100% Breese it's still the best Breese game since Reef Encounter. 

I love the combination of elements that seem to be derived from other games, but still they're used here in a unique way. It certainly doesn't feel like anything else in my collection. I also enjoyed the wide variety of avenues to gain vp's, the way you could manipulate your position, and the ways you could manipulate your ability to, well, manipulate :)

Oh, and it's a 90 minute game that's only going to get faster in time. That's an amazingly short period of time for a game with so much going on.

You use your workers to bid for tiles that give you special abilities during the game to build out your town.  The meeples are effectively a kind of currency.  The game progresses and you get more tiles out.  

I played this game some time ago and found it OK.  It is quite popular but I have been underwhelmed by this game and Keythedral.  Both are forgettable games although I could be persuaded to play this one again.

[i]Keyflower[/i] takes the standard "bidding for a tile" auction mechanic and adds an additional twist of having to match the opening bid's currency (which are meeples of four different types).  Alternatively, one can use your turn to take an action on a tile, spending increasingly more meeples to do it.  All in all, it makes for some interesting decisions.

My first heavier euro and I still love it. Surprisingly thematic, it makes the gameplay easier to learn, but the possible strategies and engine-building are deep enough to keep you coming back for more so you can do just a little bit better. I like that the bidding and being able to send workers to other peoples' villages make it more interactive than most euros. At higher player counts it can have more downtime and run a little longer than I prefer.

RATING: 9
A really good bidding game with huge replayabillity. Only three games so far but it gains from each play. Biddingsystem and usage of meeples resembles some of how you use the Knights in Lancaster, but this game offers far more oportunities and is far more open ended with several paths for scoring victory points. 

It is a superb mix of longterm strategy and tactics and you also need to keep your strategy flexible since you do not what resourse and scoring tiles that will enter each season. 

It is also loaded with player interaction and rather low downtime since each turn only involve one decision. 
The game has a really high fun factor

First impression after one 3p game.  This is one of the games that as soon as I started playing it I had a smile on my face, a smile inside, and knew I liked it.  What a phenomenal and unique game.  It defies categorizations due to its uniqueness.  If I only had to have one auction worker placement game, this would probably be the one.  Great components, which add to the joy of playing the game.  Clear iconography.  The game has that "airy" feeling I like, which is when the decision space feels open and with many ways to play and set/accomplish one's objectives.  Highly interactive, with each decision mattering, and very little downtime because one is engaged at all times.  Definitely not MPS.  Bravo Mr. Breese, if repeated plays hold the initial first impression, also at higher player counts, this one is would be one of my "games I would save from the house fire" type of games.

I nearly gagged before I even finished reading the desription on this one -- giving it a pass on several occasions. I finally read a glowing review and decided to Give Keyflower a try. Boy, am I glad I did! This game has a unique strategic and cutthroat auction mechanic. The 'worker' rules allow greater choice than any other WP we own and make the game a complete joy. We typically play a game 2-3 times to get a handle on the rules, then put it away for a short time to break out again later. In less than a week, we have played Keyflower multiple times in an evening (unprecedented!) and it has replaced Caylus as my favorite game of all time.

Very good worker placement/tile lying. Original bidding mechanism. I got pleasantly surprised by this game. It's fun and very interactive. 

The mechanism where you can activate tiles of your opponent makes me think of [thing=103092][/thing]. But here you bid for a tile (building), in a very original way (haven't seen this anywhere before) while in [thing=103092][/thing] you just pay. 

Only bad thing about this game is it's theme. It's what? It's theme! What theme? Exactly !

RATING: 7
This is, apparently, the perfect mirror image of the many, many games cluttering up the market with their beautiful graphics and copycat mechanics: Keyflower boasts an innovative twist on worker placement, garnishes it with good narrative arc and nice tension between tactical and strategical considerations, and then manages to camouflage this potentially great game with horrible graphic decisions.

This is not to disparage the – as usually – wonderful and lovingly detailed artwork by J.Breese, but rather to condemn the blocky, harsh and uninformative designs that were plastered over them. Apart from uglifying the game, they also obfuscate some crucial things, like which scoring tiles need their resources in place and which don’t.

Enough about the single drawback, however, since the good things appeared to be outstandingly good at first sight. The bidding and using of actions with your workers does not only make for delightful puzzles regarding the tiles that are freshly auctioned off, it also offers a lot of possibilities with attracting workers to your own village by upgrading tiles that are useful to everybody. Tying the four game rounds to the seasons of the year is something I love in Rune Wars and – duh – Seasons, and it seems to work just as well here.

While I can tell that Keyflower’s is, at least for the first game, definitely hamstrung by it’s appearance, I find it hard to say whether the shoddy cover hides a very good or a great game without further plays. One way or the other, I’ll probably hold off from buying it for now, hoping for a 2nd edition with cleaner layout.

Pros:
Very straightforward to learn/play

Clever auction mechanic which requires you to manage your meeples well
Love that you can use other people's tiles, but they gain the worker in the next round.

Cons:
After the first round, you can have a decent idea which color meeples your opponents have behind their screen.  However, I am awful at tracking hidden info so that will be a slight disadvantage against opponents that can track the colors well.

I find this more enjoyable each time I play it.  I love trying to see how the different tiles interact with each other.  Very tense game! One of the few auction games I like.

This is such a neat game. We bought a used copy as a shot in the dark and man are we glad we did. Interesting use and combination of mechanics combined with a wide variety of increasingly difficult decisions... yeah, this is a keeper. I generally don't feel you need a lot of worker-placement games, but this one is so different it deserves to be in the collection.

After further play I am impressed by the balance of this game. It's never possible to tell if you are in the lead or not -- nothing becomes clear until the final count, which is then exciting because you don't know what's going to happen. In addition, this game is smooth. You play for two hours and it feels like thirty minutes. It never drags, every decision feels important, and every play feels different -- sometimes your tiles are so different that it changes the way you think so much that it feels like you are playing an entirely different game, not just session. A great game.

RATING: 9
This is a really interesting one. Even though the rules aren't complex, they're not intuitive, so it takes a play just to figure out how everything works toward endgame scoring. 

Once you realize how it all works, there's a beautiful mix of engine/worker placement/tiles/auctions that has so much to engage you in various ways, that's a pleasure to play.

But then the end-game comes around, and the auctions can (should) turn vicious for the various scoring tiles, in a way that makes me anxious, but completely turned off my wife in her first two plays. 

So I'll probably end up trading it, even though she likes everything else about the game. Just don't see a way to change it that doesn't break the game.

And traded it away 2015-08 for Roll Through The Galaxy in Canada-Wide Math Trade (with some local luck)

Rating based on 6 players.

An interesting game packed with loads of mechanisms. It's a little on the fiddly side for me, as there are loads of tiles, each doing different things, put out at different times, etc., and there are quite a lot of rules... but I liked the worker-placement-as-bids, and how workers used on opponents' spaces are gained by them. The problem of having secret goals is mitigated by how you need to buy those goal tiles to actually make use of them. I think I would prefer the game with fewer players, as that would cut down the number of options, making it less of a sandbox and more competitive. With 6, keeping track of other people's villages became an issue (even physically, as they were difficult to see).

With Keyflower, all AP problems drift away - I am so engaged, so engrossed, by my myriad options, the longer other people take the better. What is at first an unfamiliar and clunky feeling game, settles after a few rounds into a wonderfully elegant game. So many paths to victory, so much opportunity to bluff, out-manoeuvre, second-guess etc. And yet, a great game as well if you choose to sit back and work on your own puzzle.

Pros: 

+Quick for its weight 
+Mechanics are tight and fluid

Cons:

-The components are a bit uninspiring, despite the aforementioned player screens
-It doesn't do a whole lot to differentiate itself. Sure you pay with workers, but you are essentially just paying the cost of taking actions. 
-I think (speculation, of course) this would be a nightmare to play with more than 4 due to everyone having their own play area. 
-It wouldn't be on my short list to introduce to friends
-NO THEME!!!

Overall: A well-designed game that's quick to play, but lacks any real originality. It reminded me of Glen More, which I enjoy more.

This has a lot of things I like in a game and wraps it up in a nice Euro package. The rules are easy and after the first round I wondered if it wasn't a bit too simple. But the game escalates quickly into the 'heavy game' category as the villages are getting bigger. I can almost imagine taking a fifth turn would double the playtime. Many decisions are agonizing as well, because an ill-timed action from one of your opponents might ruin your plans.

I suspect my rating for this game will only rise with more familiarity.

What I like:
- Having to decide between using your meeples for auctions vs using them on buildings
- Being able to use other opponents buildings, although that could have a side effect of locking them out, which I didn't like as much
- Varied buildings adds variety to each game

What I didn't like:
- Sometimes the combinations of tiles that come out throughout the game and the winter tiles you draw synergize really well, or really poorly.
- Being locked out of using your own building can be pretty devasting to a strategy that you've spent all game trying to execute.
- To score a lot of points, you need to go deep into specific strategies, so it's hard to adapt to a new strategy if your current strategy fails.

Acquired in trade for Cry Havoc 12/11/16 with upgraded resources, Farmers expansion, Emporium & Monument, and Key Celeste.

Great game that has a lot of tense decision points.  The multiple use of meeples for production and bidding, with differing meeple colors is interesting and makes competition for boats fierce.  Even at 2p, this isn't nearly as mean as some people make it out to be.  I really enjoy how the tiles in each season differ, with Spring (production), Summer (powers), and Autumn (points) all having distinct focuses.

It's also fun to watch your city grow.  I can see some definite AP problems, especially as player count increases, since you can use anyone's tiles.

+ Interesting bidding/production use of meeples
+ Quick, simple rules with deep gameplay
+ Nice tile art
o Rules are a bit overwhelming at first read, but gameplay becomes intuitive after the first two seasons
- Huge potential for AP as player count increases

A really tightly designed game, which belies its cute and friendly looking graphic design.  A limited number of moves, so the cost of overbidding for particular tiles can be huge as it really limits what other options are available.  Works very well with three players, but I can see how more than 4 would become unmanagable.

Some decent interaction available via blocking to inflate the cost of others taking those actions, bidding over the top to force opponents to move their meeples.  Fun and intense to play, but for gamers only though.  Don’t need to own a copy.

An amazing twist on the worker placement. You use your workers as currency, bidding and using them to pay for placement on another players tiles. Scales wonderfully for all player counts. Final round can be tense, and rewards people for knowing what tiles are possible and what others have been doing.

We were completely overwhelmed in our first play. Spring and summer zipped by with us mostly just buying tiles and not achieving anything close to a strategy. During Fall we finally started placing some meeples in each others town, trying to optimize the mess we created for final scoring. I'm very intrigued by it, but Anna is undecided. I suspect she will come around liking it eventually.

Upped to 8.5 after the second play. Anna liked it better and I was excited by the feeling of sucking just a little bit less at it as the first time.

07/30/13 Played a five player game. 
I found the Keyflower almost totally random (tiles available each turn, colors of meeples one may gain). Knowledge of what tiles are yet to appear is of great value. As a new player I did not have that. It felt like it took forever (it was 2.2 hours). Dry, tedious, boring, and down time can be an issue with five. A great many choices; too many in fact. It was irritating to have to consider them all. Nothing really new, as I've played many worker placement and auction games before. Its not a terrible game, but I can easily do without seeing it again.

Amazing at all levels. It is amazing how much a simple mechanics can make a rich heavy strategy. Love the fact that you can bid only with meeples of the same colour, only activate tiles with the colour of the ones previously bid... Also a little pick and deliver aspect with a puzzlish aspect of building your town. It has it all, outstanding game. One big negative though, adding points at the end of the game is a pain.

RATING: 5
Update: Trending down, just a bit too much that detracts from what I find the 'core' game - aka the bidding of meeples - also, it lost something with perfectly open info in a two player environment (which was to be expected on reflection), anyway - just down one point until it gets more play (and then proves itself or trends further down for me)

The balancing act of bidding and using your workers to generate resources (and even then - in your own village, or over there in you opponent's?) is the heart of the game. The rest is just trying to optimise for your chosen strategy - be it skill tiles, green workers or whatever - while trying to stay somewhat flexible in case you get screwed on your bids come autumn and winter. And last, some minor effort into how you want to build your village, a logistical puzzle that doesn't feel all that relevant to the game - just somewhat tacked on. It is these two latter things that I find less interesting, and keep the game from a higher rating, but the mean battle of worker placement / bidding for tiles is so much fun. I'd want more interesting and opaque effects on the tiles, or even more streamlined simpler to parse effects instead of this middle ground.

It really works along the full range of suggested players (2-6), not a common feature in games and for me a great plus. Also, it's easy to grasp, but doesn't get stale that fast due to the nature of auctions - valuations will shift as players learn the "ingredients" for certain strategies, which tiles are to be prioritised when going for so and so. And how to calculate the net effect of screwing someone from either getting a tile, or getting to use a tile they were counting on is an ever changing thing. I certainly don't see the point of expansions yet, though if it changes - well there are two, so that won't be a problem.

I'd like to play without hidden meeples, I think that'd make the best part of the game even more tense and interesting. 

A good game!

Scales very well from 2p to 4p. 5p/6p is really a mess and it becomes too long.

Well, I suppose there is some new stuff in there, but it felt a bit 'old hat', to tell the truth.  I liked the bidding mechanism and being able to use tiles from anywhere.  Quite a few ways to score, and the hidden scoring tiles (which you still need to win by bidding on) were a nice idea.  Also plays pretty quickly over only four turns.  But there is nothing to 'wow' me, and I'm not so upset to have left a copy behind at the stand.

After a second play, I downgraded the score a bit.  I just don't find much of anything compelling besides the bidding, which is interesting.  Our game also took a very long time to play for not much really happening.

Traded for a copy, so I can give it another chance.  We'll see what comes of that.

Highly interactive and competitive for a Euro style game.  Elegant blend of game mechanics.  Blocking opponents can be aggressive but always compensates them with new resources.

Fascinating design where players use meeples of different colors as currency for bidding on tiles. The tiles are placed in your village and remaining meeples are used for worker placement amongst those tiles. 

Since you can activate tiles outside of your own village there are a ton of choices to make. When you activate a tile outside your village the owner gets to keep the meeples. Tiles can be reactivated but at the cost of paying more meeples. In bidding or tile-activation the color of the first meeple placed locks that color for the round.

Victory points are mostly achieved through cube conversions and there's an interesting pick up and deliver mechanism in order to move cubes to the right tiles. A lot going on but it all comes together nicely. You need to juggle a VP-producing village while keeping meeples of various suits.

From what I have seen, I do not like the auctions due to the weird color-fixing rule. (First meeple being placed, also for ability, forces everyone to only use that color.) I'm not saying that it's a bad design, but I do not think that I would like to play it. I do not like the idea to have auctions combined with essentially giving people stuff for free because they have a rare color. Rarity increasing value is ok, but I do not like if it rules out any other "payment".

I need more plays to judge this properly. Bidding in like colors, moving losing bids, allocating colors strategically but tactically responding to others' bids, and then arranging all your wins in a sensible village that works, not to mention balancing bidding with action taking...there are a lot of ways to go wrong. Definitely one I want to try again.

More plays has raised this quite a bit. First play was at 3p which might be weak (need to try 3p again to know for sure). Plays at 4p have been excellent. Higher is still good, though longer and more chaotic.

Bidding is not much fun - other games are way better - even, shock horror, Archipelago

Keyflower is a worker placement game, though it is also so much more than that. There is a bidding system, with bluffing naturally built into it. All sorts of things can happen in this game.

It scales super well from 2 to 6 people. I haven't played it with 6 people, but I can imagine it would be a wild experience.

Highly recommended if you're into Euros/worker placement.

Keyflower has such a great combination of mechanisms. In particular, the way workers are used for bidding and to take actions is just awesome. The game is loaded with wonderfully difficult decisions and some truly cutthroat player interaction (don't let the whimsical art fool you, this game can be downright mean). I like how the game ramps up the intensity from easy-going at the start to pure brain burn in the final rounds. Also, the game scales excellently, providing different experiences at each player count. I just wish I could get it to the table more regularly.

The expansions provide some nice variety and open up some interesting new strategic paths, but I need to explore them more. I particularly enjoy The Merchants expansion and would almost say that I wouldn't want to play without it now.

Had this game been shorter or more interactive, it might have had a shot with me. There are some interesting mechanisms at work here, and the game components are attractive and high quality. All the signature Breese touches (draw random stuff and hide it behind your screen, glossary full of various tile effects, spatial element that's not central but can be quite significant, etc.) come together in a game that felt like a tightly designed Rosenberg game.

Unfortunately, I'm just not as interested in these games as the average BGG user is. Keyflower will undoubtedly continue to skyrocket up the rankings, and if you like stuff like Le Havre etc., then you'll probably appreciate this title. If on the other hand you run screaming from "spreadsheet" games in which you're converting resources and building up your little island/tableau, then you should stay far away. Me, I'd play it again--more than can be said of any Feld game--but I don't see myself requesting it.

UPDATE: ...And I did play it again. My opinion remains unchanged.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Really the auction mechanic it's amazing and the player interaction is superbly implemented...

BUT...

I like the game, but I think that playing with the expansion makes it a bit too random... the game already is a bit random on the tiles that come out but adding a bunch of new tiles that are very specific makes this "problem" escalate, specially with 3 Players... with more players there are more tiles coming out, so I think this is a game that probably plays best with 5 players...

Another thing that "bugs" me a bit about the game and that I haven't manage to adapt myself to it is that the game is too fast... to me there's no sense of escalation and it's over in a blink of an eye... I've always had this impression of it but these last two plays in a short period of time made this more clear in my mind...

I know this is a design choice but it's not one that I'm looking for in this type of game... I know it makes the game fast, but to me it's a little to fast.

And another thing, I look at the tiles and I disperse myself a bit to much... I should just decide in 1 or 2 in each round and then work around that and use the meeples in my own tiles as much as possible so I can have a lot of meeples from round to round... but I don't know why I always manage to not do that!!

The master of simple yet complex. 

The "stackable" worker placement used for production and bidding offer many varied options while keeping the game simple. Play consists of placing workers on tiles to do something (such as producing a good) or next to tiles to bid on them. With a successful bid you take the tile into your village, providing passive benefit and/or allowing you to produce on it and get your workers back. 

So many elements come together so cleanly it's crazy. The game is partially luck based, but very managable due to the bidding system. There are times when the appearance or lack of tiles can change the game, but almost all of the time there remain reasonable paths to victory. 

The game always seems to go very fast. Almost everyone I've played this with has said something along the lines of, "Oh, it's ending already?" I sometimes wish it went longer, but the reasonably short length (at least with 2-4 players, can't speak for 5 or 6) is often great.

The theme is quite minimalist but works well for me. The art is great and more theme would seem out of place in a game like this. Theme is sometimes necessary to make a game more understandable and smooth, but Keyflower manages that through its mechanisms.

A great, light-feeling but still very strategic Euro.

I'm not a big fan of Keyflower.  There are so few turns that it is critical that you do well in the auctions; unfortunately, it is an auction where the players don't have the control they need!  If you open bidding with a color I don't have, I can't bid at all and what colors I have are the result of a random draw from a bag!  Additionally, I can spend the whole game building up for my "Winter" tile only to have someone else steal it from me in the last minute.  This a weird game for me: a very random game which feels like it shouldn't be.

I put off giving this game/purchasing it for a long while, which is strange as it looked like my cup of tea... 
That was a big mistake, after just one play i have to give it an instant 9 rating, that i can see may well rise..
This game is clever, and gives you so many decisions and roads to take.. I like a game when you have lots of options with most of them being good, that way everybody playing gets to do cool stuff..
There is a strong element of engine building to this, which is cool.. I can see a fair few similarities to another game i like a lot, spyrium.. But there are enough differences for me to enjoy and keep both of them..
I was a little off put by the artwork at first, maybe why i hesitated to buy, its very cutesy style, but i have grown to enjoy it..

Brilliant, creative, and playing it feels differently than any other game I own. Using meeples as both workers and "currency" works incredibly well and results in some really interesting decisions throughout the game. I really like how the private winter tiles provide some long-term goals for you to chase... but only if you win the auction for those tiles at the end!

This is an extremely smooth game which is totally engrossing. It has a simple rule set but the strategic depth of play far exceeds other games with complex rules. To me this is the best of the "Key" range and when you are familiar with the game then it should play in under 90 minutes.

An odd duck of a medium weight euro style game. Players have four rounds to establish property, secure resources, and deliver them to develop said properties into point-bearing upgraded versions all while auctioning to earn and use the benefits of these properties and even turn order with the same, non-renewing (but ever shifting) pool of workers that vary in compatibility based on color.

What I like: The interaction! The decision whether to bid (and how much) or to activate a tile can be brutal, in a very good way. This is really a great multiplayer experience.

What I don't like: The scoring. You never know in advance which tiles come out in autumn or winter, which makes the game extremely tactical. Which I normally enjoy, but here it sometimes just feels anti-climactic.

A very good work placement where you use different color workers to bid for tiles or produce goods. During the game you try to design a production chain to convert in Vps. I like the original idea of player don't have their own color. But I tend to found biding games a little dull and repetitive nowadays. Never less is one of the best key series. But my favorite still is key market.

Keyflower has been praised by many players and this is well deserved. This is a game where the different Euro mechanisms blend well together. Bid for tiles, produce from tiles, transport between tiles and upgrade tiles - all using the characteristic "keyples" of the game.

I'm usually not fond of games with many different tiles but in Keyflower, the functions of the tiles are easily understood and they are all known and available for bidding to all players.

But what I like most is the interesting interaction mechanism: you can use an opponent's tiles by giving up a keyple but also make it more expensive for the opponent to use the tile. This leads to a game where you're never out of actions (or opportunities to screw your opponents).

Point de règle à surveiller:
*Les keyples doivent être de la même couleur autour et dessus la tuile
*pas de max pour acheter la tuile, mais max 6 pour utiliser son pouvoir 
* Quand on produit des ressources dans son village elles restent sur la tuile de production, en revanche si les ressources proviennent d'un autre village ou du centre de la table, alors elles vont dans notre patrie 
* Seules les ressources placées sur les tuiles: la grange, forgeron, dépôt de bois comptent, donc il faut les transporter sur ces tuiles si on veut qu'elles comptent.... 
* les travailleurs qui sont dans notre village retournent derrière notre écran ET même pour le dernier décompte (hiver) 
* le jeton premier joueur est un joker à la fin, on peut l'utilisé comme une ressource, un travailleur d'une autre couleur, une compétence...

It has a semi-innovative and easy system as far as a bidding game goes. It's mostly about having to keep track and manage the timing and uses of your colored meeples. 

An interesting, kind of brainburning game that doesn't seem to drag forever. While rule is easy, game play is difficult, largely because you have to factor other players' buildings, which make the game better with 3 or 4 people.

The game is indeed kind of random. Because of the low amount of currencies (each players only get a few meeples and they have to bid with specific colors), most bids end up at 1, 2 or at most 3 meeples, positioning becomes huge. You also have to keep track of all the buildings and possible combination each player can utilize. There's far too much calculation out of your control.

This game is pretty neat as far as strategies go, but the sheer amount of randomness and huge amount of information needed to process for a simple bidding game may perhaps be too much for some people. I like it because it is thinky, but sometimes the luck factor can be too much.

RATING: 9
What a peculiar game. A first rules run through is not going to capture the beauty of this game.  On it's surface it appears to be a hodgepodge of mechanics.  There is bidding in an auction, there is worker placement / action selection, there is upgrading and resource conversion and engine building, there is spatial arrangement of tiles, there is movement of resources across tiles...  Hearing the rules, and you'll be like, "Oh dear, I guess I'll humor the owner with a single play."  A few minutes in, though, and man does this game sing.  Would never want to play with 2, but with 3 or 4, this might just be my favorite Euro of all time... need a few more plays.

The auction is brilliant.  The scope is limited, which I like, and the notion of establishing "trump" with color placement is extremely cool.  I also love how if a player is outbid, they can move they're bid to another tile.  But of course "bids" can also be workers that activate a tile's effects, and that also serves to establish "trump" for the tile.  So, you can also take that failed bid and plonk it down on a tile in order to activate it.  Brilliant.  And this is only one aspect of the game, because you are engaged in all of this activity in order to accrue resources for your own "village" (composed of tiles you've won), that you will need to carefully move around on your tiles, in order to upgrade them for VPs.  

Really, I can't do the game justice in a description.  This is one of those "the game is much better than the sum of its rules."  The iconography is very clear (for the most part), and the game duration is exactly right: about 1.5 hours, depending.  

My only beef, really, is the final scoring round.  The game is played across 4 "seasons." And different seasons have unique tiles that get put out for auction.  The winter tiles are ALL about victory points, and it produces a very swingy, mad scramble at the end of the game.  Reminds me a bit of Dominant Species where the end game feels quite a bit different from the strategic grind of the rest of the game.  All of your deliberations and care could come down to a somewhat lucky combo obtained by another player in the last round.  Personally, I find some "swingy-ness" kind of funny, but it does feel quite different from the rest of the game.

Edit:
Review that captures my feelings about the game.  Be sure to the read the discussion, as it is quite informative!

Over the four seasons in a year, players bid on tiles, or they may use tiles up for auction. The tiles are hexagonal, and players represent their bid with meeples placed along an edge of the tile. All tiles can be upgraded to earn more VPs, and tiles either give resources or allow you to transport goods or upgrade tiles. Boat tiles also give special abilities as well. Each season, one can also bid on turn order for next season, and you also bid for boats with meeples and skills. 

The trick with the bidding is once the color is set, further bids can only be of that color. As well, a fourth, rarer color meeple can also be gained as well, adding a layer of tactics to the game. 

There is a lot going on in this game, especially when you have to look around and see who has what tile, since you can use that tile by donating a meeple(s) to that person.

It's a decent game, with many things to think about.

Interesting new take on worker placement and auctions. I really like the tension between using workers to bid or activate tiles. Seems to be prone to snowballing with early advantages leading to large worker disparities. Particularly painful as this allows one player to take turn after turn as all others pass and wait.

RATING: 9.4
Wow, great game. Looks beautiful. Nice feeling of constructing a village which we love. Clever use of meeples as workers as well as currency. Quick, simple. 

Although some people claim it could be a gateway, it's really little too complex I've found. It's fairly rules light - but there's a lot to take in every time a new set of tiles get put out, and new players can get hosed in that final round very easily which might leave a sour taste in their mouths.

We have houseruled the last round so that at least 2 of 3 the winter tiles players are holding come out. That way if someone loses their first choice they can have an okay second one. Otherwise that last round get VERY cutthroat and mean, if everyone just puts down one winter tile for example - quite out of character with the rest of the game.

Too many game aspects: worker placement, bidding, tile placement and match the colours. There are much better worker placement games, much better bidding games etc that I would rather play. I have never had any desire to combine several games and play them all at once. 

PROS:
-Using meeples for bidding and worker placement is a seemingly innovative and interesting aspect (but doesn't integrate that well). 

CONS:
-Winter tiles are hidden and victory point potential varies dramatically depending on how game setup proceeds. Some players have an extreme advantage right from the start (but its hidden). Others have little to work with. You could guess what others are doing and try to do the same or try to block them, but only one will win the relevant winter tile at the end. However, most likely both would lose the game.  
-If everything was open information, runaway leaders could be identified and dealt with better (thus more player interaction). 
-The ability to knowingly block someone in a worker placement game is a critical aspect and it is missing here. 
-If there was no bidding, it would be a solitaire game. Little to no player interaction outside the bidding. 
-Putting your meeple on another players tile is not promoted, game promotes solitaire activity. 
-Boat 4A lets someone break the rules of bidding, bringing in a differing coloured meeple to a specific colour bid (killing strategy).
-Multi use meeples seems counter intuitive; spend the meeples for bidding and now there are not enough to place out to gain resources. Balancing this is the strategy but is boring. Would like the game to be a bit more dynamic, include in game money etc.
-Worker placement where we need to bid on the tiles where we will put our meeples?
-Theme: using meeples for bidding represents slavery? Are we cashing in on a bounty?

Note: Farmers expansion adds yet another game aspect; Carcassonne with animal meeples.

RATING: 8
There are a lot of nice things in this game: workers of different colors, but once one starts to bid / use a tile with a color, everyone must continue using that color;  player can choose to bid or use a tile in their move; one can even use tiles which are still being bid for or belonging to other players, even if losing the workers in the process, etc. 

The game offers really a lot of interesting choices.

Replayability is huge: each game offers different challenges, possibly one of the most variable games I have ever played.

Small disadvantages for my tastes are that it may be a bit difficult to apply a consistent strategy (tactic counts!) and that there is a bit less control, also due to some luck: for example the way the winter tiles (i.e. the goals each player "knows" alone at the beginning of the game) and the other tiles that actually come into play may form combinations that are more advantageous for some players than others. Because of these disadvantages, I think the game is suitable also for the casual gamer.

But these are minor quibbles. I like this game a lot, and as many new games I have played recently, I have the feeling that we are at a new stage of boardgame design, new games are getting better and better... and as many of this new generation games, Keyflower manages to compress in quite a short time a lot of gaming experience.

UPDATE 1 Jan 2012
Lowered the rating from 9 to 8. The lack of control due to some luck and even more to the hidden information seems to be more than I expected and like. Also somehow the game is a bit less tense than other new "second generation" games I am playing in this period. The game is still very good and I still like to play it. Also its huge replayability is confirmed: every game seems a new one.

Maybe the high rating is a bit premature but if anything 'Keyflower' could potentially even move up to a 10; that's how much I like it. Simply awesome how it integrates worker placement with bidding, resource engine and special building abilities. While the rules are not overly complicated for a game of this complexity the many choices you have during a turn and the various strategies you can employ give rise to a very challenging gameplay. It never bogs down, though, as turns are over quickly. Plus, it is high in interaction when players bid for the same tile or want to use the same one for production. Overall, I see myself enjoying this one for a long time!

RATING: 7
somehow I remembered this game as being more fussy than it is. While it isn't simple, Keyflower renders its complexity almost completely via its worker color-based auction mechanic, which takes up 75% of the game time-wise. Like the best auction games, the point of bidding is to benefit yourself but also to make the cost of others' strategies more prohibitive. What invariably happens is that the dynamics of area majority get applied in the auction; to wit, players gang up on the perceived-strongest/most aggressive players, and in the end, the perceived-weakest player often emerges as the surprise winner. So far not seeing what's Top 30 about Keyflower, but it's a good enough game.

Unsure about this game. It seems like one could get a lot better at it with more plays (just knowing which tiles are better in certain situations than others, because it's hard to evaluate as a new player). The issue is that I'm not sure I want to play this again. The mechanics are certainly unique but the game is a fusion of so many different things that it doesn't feel fun to me, to be honest. Maybe I'd change my opinion if I played it more, but I just don't really have the motivation to try and figure this one out.

A mecânica do leilão normalmente me espanta um pouco dos jogos: acho interessante, mas vou ficando agoniado com a perspectiva de não ter recursos para tudo. No Keyflower, no entanto, isso me atraiu. Você basicamente leiloa tudo: prédios novos, barcos com novos colonos, ordem de jogo. E o objetivo é fazer a melhor vila ao longo das quatro estações. Jogo de nível intermediário, e que em geral acaba com placares apertados.

A pure delight. The charming artwork belies a ruthless auction and worker placement game with great tension and an enormous breadth of strategic possibilities. I am deeply impressed with the sheer variety of different winning boards that I have seen, as victory points can be had from the collection of tile upgrades, workers, skill tiles, or resources - but the viability of any given path is conditional on the appearance of certain endgame scoring tiles, with each player having partial foreknowledge of a different set of those tiles. The interlocking of the mechanisms in this design is stunning.

four rounds of auctioning hexes, that provide resources with the help of workers makes a fast playing euro. the currency of auction this time is workers. that makes it interesting.
after a five player game dragged for two and a half hours I would probably not want to play this game with more than four at the table. Avoid AP players, this game needs to be fast.

[size=8]The game has a clever use of the hexagonal tile faces during the auction phase, and path making during the village expansion phase. The hidden player assets and special green meeples keep the game tense, while players try to outmaneuver each other with bids and tile actions.

Keyflower combines several game mechanics within a cohesive theme. The auction phase is open for the entire duration of the round, where players can bid on tiles or alternatively activate the special ability of a tile in auction or a tile on [i]any[/i] village. Also in the auction phase, players are bidding on turn order, which includes order of selection for the incoming ships and free resources. After all players pass, the auction tiles are distributed and players expand their village. Any meeples used to activate an auction tile you won or activate a tile in your village, become your property. The addition of special green workers that must be purchased, creates an uncommon resource that can be used surgically against other players.

As the game progresses, the player villages become more and more important for resource management, and end game victory points.

[color=#3388cc][b]Pimp it?[/b][/color]

I suggest an opaque bag to store and pull the skill tiles. I believe the Merchants expansion comes with such a bag.

RATING: 7.8
Medium worker placement euro that features several original mechanisms.

The graphic design is beautiful, following the tradition of the Key series. The components are nice, with plenty of meeples and thick cardboard tiles.

El theme is there, but many times the mechanics are more important.

The good:
-> Lots of interaction, in all moments.
-> Many paths to victory. Many scoring possibilities.
-> Each action is a decission between plenty of possibilities.
-> The bidding, action and worker placement and recovery mechanics are just brilliant.

The bad: 
-> Rules are not as easy as they seem. In the first games, you'll find cases during the game where you'll want to check the manual. 

After reading the rules and the good reviews, I already expected something good, but it really surprised me how well the game works. You can try very different things and as long as you do well, you'll have chances to win.

I have only played once and the game dragged a bit because of the rules (I should have read the manual with more attention). I'm pretty sure I will increase my rating considerably with further plays.

Plays rather quickly, and there are surprisingly few actions per player during the entire game. So you really have to plan when to activate the tiles you need to use, especially since the clever color-locking worker placement scheme restricts the options and often raises the cost in keyples.

Excellent game with some tense bidding moments.  This is one of my favourite games of 2012.

My only wish for this game is that it played a little bit longer.  Not necessarily in duration, but rather that the cool transporting mechanic never really seems to play out as much as it should.  It's almost as if they made some developments to shorten the game and that mechanic suffered the most.

Non-gamers should take a pass due to complexity. But if you're a gamer this game is a can't miss.

RATING: 7.9
Bellissimo gioco strategico. Cattivo per via di un'interazione fortissima che ogni turno andrà a rinnovarsi. Ogni giocatore dovrà espandere il proprio territorio e cercare di farlo fruttare al meglio. La partita dura quattro fasi suddivise in stagioni e ognuna fornirà nuove tessere che offrono all'inizio risorse e più avanti punti vittoria. Un gioco di programmazione, piazzamento lavoratori, gestione risorse, aste e maggioranze. Il gioco ha anche il grande pregio di scalare molto bene da 2 a 6 giocatori. Una delle migliori sorprese del 2012, gioco per lo meno da provare!

RATING: 10
An initial 9-rating, as I'm very impressed at first. All the fiddliness of the Key games is still - regrettably - present, but the interchange of the workers is a joy and the spacial aspects are for once totally warranted. The range of victory routes is bafflingly brilliant, and my only real concern is that bidding battles would be out of control with too many players: I suspect this would be one of those delightful 'best with 3' games. The artwork as ever is beyond reproach, and look how many Meeples you get!

Un euro de formato multimecánicas (estilo Kramer o Friedemann) que me sorprendió gratamente por la profundidad que ofrece. Puede parecer apabullante en principio por la enorme cantidad de opciones, pero la mecánica general es bastante simple. Hay muchas cosas sucediendo al mismo tiempo y las interacciones tienen consecuencias complejas. El paso será tan fluido como la capacidad de procesar información de los jugadores. Es de los pocos juegos que me provocó análisis-parálisis, la acción en ronda paso a paso le otorga un factor táctico a la resolución que no podés dejar de tener en cuenta. Es interesante que las opciones no se basen puramente en el cálculo (estilo Power Grid), sino que se sientan como decisiones. En ese sentido, hay que jugarlo varias veces para lograr la necesaria coherencia en las estrategias y control sobre los resultados. Hay procesos que habrá que encadenar y un importante elemento de momento (timing) en la toma de decisiones ya que los demás jugadores pueden interferir en la cadena de tu proceso. Esa combinación de estrategia a largo plazo y ejecución táctica logra un juego desafiante, tenso e interesante a cada momento.

Si hay algo que me hace ruido es el encadenamiento de tiles estilo Carcassonne. No veo que le sume personalidad al diseño y agrega un scoring final un tanto arbitrario. Es como un micro-game solitario que no aporta mucho a la dinámica grupal de la partida. Sin embargo, el tomar-y-llevar que genera es una mecánica de peso en la engine. Suma complejidad sin ser complicado, pero es complejidad por la complejidad misma, y en ese punto, no se si más complejidad en el esquema de decisión era algo que el diseño necesitaba. De hecho, se juega mejor con 4 porque de a 6 la complejidad atenta contra la fluidez de la partida.

De cualquier modo, muy recomendable.

I haven't been too impressed with any of the Key-themed games - nothing that hit me as better than average. But I'm glad to say this is the first one that's struck me as really good. In essence it's a VP hunt using cube acquisition and VP conversion, but the manner in which it is performed is innovative enough to warrant interest and exploration. The tiles that are being bid for in the middle, each with a special power (usually to generate cubes, move cubes around, get more meeples, etc), can also be used even while they're being bid for. Tick. Tiles that are won are placed into your village at the end of the round, where you'll be able to use them for free ... but other players can also use them, which increase the cost to you to use it, but with the benefit of them donating meeples to you for your use next turn. And if someone has used a tile, you can also use it, if you pay a bit more. So although it's likely you'll use your own tiles, there's enough interactive nervousness about to get on your own tiles quickly if they're important for you. So there's another tick for the right amount of race tension - get on quick, but if you don't, there's other things you can do or you can still do it if you want to pay a bit more. There's a lot of options to consider, which has the ability to slow things down if you're playing with AP prone players, or those who are so focused on winning that they want to track the meeple counts of each player in and out (bleh). But played reasonably, the game ticks along fine and comes in at the right length for its weight. Interesting.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Extremely clever mechanisms; innovative
- By far the most attractive Key game
- Pretty simple rules
- High replayability in terms of what tiles are in the game

What I don't like:
- Auctions are pretty cutthroat
- The ability to use others' village tiles can be nasty
- Luck of the draw can be cruel (worse than Thebes)
- Complex interactions result in real brain-burn
- Our 2p learning game took 110 minutes. Presumably it would speed up a fair bit.

This game was more or less what I expected. There are so many options, and you constantly have to prioritize both from a "which resources to use" standpoint and more importantly, "when?". 

I didn't realize how important resource generation was, in my first game. Grab those tiles in spring, because you'll never have another chance. Some of the ships seem powerful, too.

If you have a great memory, you'll have a big advantage in the game. It might be better (or at least fair) with open information.

The BGG-voted 3.3 weight is more based on depth; the rules themselves aren't that complex.

It has taken me a while to totally warm up to Keyflower, but after a couple of recent 3 player games, I am much happier with it.   I don't like it as a 2 player game because too many tiles don't come out, and even in 3 player, I find that there are options closed off to you simply because the tiles aren't available.  But the mechanic and the pace of the game have won me over.

I started playing this for EuropeMasters 2012 and usually you get fed up with those games after EuropeMasters, but this is one of few I still enjoy playing. 

First play with six players and a random mix of everything: Base game, Farmers, Merchants and all promos made an interesting game. Since we randomly drew all the tiles there was a huge shortage of wood, that made gold more valuable. There were no way to produce sheep so some other tiles became worthless. Everyone played different strategies and used only a part of all expansions. Some didn't care for contracts, others skipped the animals etc. It was still balanced though.

Interesting WP where you bid for tiles, then build your own village or WP, where other people can come too. I like the blend of mechanics. 

Only thing off putting for me (albeit 2 games in) is the roads on tiles orientation. Some of the times really do not appear on first cuff to have a road in some places, but look really hard and there it is.

A fairly fast playing game with a lot of thought. You bid on tiles that you can later use, but you can also use the tiles that others have bought at the cost of giving them a meeple to play later. If you fall behind it may be tough to come back, so think it through as they game ends earlier then you would think.

One of my favourite games that I’ve played this year (2014). It plays quickly (usually around an hour) but has a depth of strategy and great player interaction’ I love waiting for someone to upgrade one of their tiles only for another player to jump straight on it and use the juicy new power, either costing the owning player more meeples to activate it or stopping them from using it all round because they don’t have a meeple of a match colour.

The colour matching of meeples is such a simple mechanic that really makes for an interesting and fun game. That coupled with the fact that you can use other peoples tiles make this a great game if you like interactive worker placement/resource management games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The bidding system that uses the color of the meeples which also can be used to activate tiles is deliciously tense and often brutal.  The game combines the best of many games and still feels like it contributes something fresh to the genre.  The only thing keeping it from being rated higher is that the goods and skill tokens are a little too interchangeable and generic.  Solid game overall.

Medium weight game with a American settler theme.  Uses worker placement, tile laying and deception mechanics.

RATING: 7
Keyflower combines the concepts of worker placement and bidding in a very interesting way.  Players use their pawns to both bid on tiles (by placing them next to the tile) or use them (by placing them on the tile), and whoever owns the tile gets to keep all of the pawns that used it for later turns.  Subsequent bids and uses of a given tile in a round require one more pawn than the last bid or use (respectively)--and all pawns on a tile must "follow suit" with the color of the first pawn played there.  There were also some tile-placement and pick-up-and-deliver elements once you owned a few tiles, but really the interesting part was the auction/tile use system.  I thought the game worked well together, and I was happy to see a mechanic that I hadn't seem in boardgaming before.

What a great combination of bidding, worker placement and logistical upgrades for tiles and tile placement. The three (four) colored meeple bidding/action system is genius. It's great with all player counts, plays in a solid amount of time and has plenty to think about and do each turn. My only concern is how much depth the game actually has. Yes, it's point optimization, but each game isn't drastically different from one another. Maybe the expansions will help alleviate my concern?

I'm expecting this game to become more and more enjoyable as time goes on. It has a lot of interlocking mechanisms that work really well (auction, WP, tile laying, pick up and deliver), but it's also very open in that way, the choice between bidding on or activating a tile is sometimes an excruciating one. Actually seen it induce high levels of AP in people who are generally very quick in taking turns. It's a bit hard to get your head around how to get points, how to use resources etc. until you see how the mechanisms work together, which takes a few plays. Also learning which types of tiles come out for spring, summer, fall and winter is helpful. Play with a group who likes a fair bit of "take that", it can get nasty when bidding or blocking someone from an action in their own village. When played with the right group, this game really shines.

Keyflower starts a little like Isle of Skye but your bidding meeples!...that other people can keep!  There is also unique worker placement as you can play on other peoples' tiles...but then they keep your meeples!  The game's complexity is ratcheted up a bit.  It seems it could be streamlined a little but I don't know how and I don't know if it is totally needed.  The game finds its simplicity in its approaching minimalistic symbols.  Scoring is not very simple but game is fun.

Torn about this one. I really liked the first three rounds - building my village, improving my buildings, etc. I even liked the auction, as even if you get outbid, you can either get your dudes back, or you can just move them to get something else that not as good maybe, but still useful.

This changes in the last round, as then you have to bid on these 'goal' tiles that you've only partially known from the beginning. I guess the idea is that you build up towards the ones (or some of the ones) you have, but that doesn't sound like fun to me, and for my first play I just didn't bother. I didn't like the bidding for that part, as some of the tiles are clearly rubbish for you, but maybe the other players shouldn't get them, so it becomes all about the auction, and how much to invest (if at all) in denial, how much to bid on this thing you really want because otherwise you'll lose, etc. 

If the game was all like the first three rounds, it'd easily be an 8 - but with that last round added, I'm not sure I want to play again -  maybe I'd try if it wasn't with 3 (it had that 'you fix that, because I won't, and he'll win if he gets it' thing come up in the final round. Don't like it in conflict games, don't like it here either).

I get to play this game at my local board game meetup. I am lucky that I have watched Rahdo's video before so I had a sense what it was about. This is a pretty heavy game for me so the rating won't go up higher until I've played enough medium weighted games to get there.

I like the auctions, they are very cut throat. There will be plenty of paths to victory since you can specialize and combo up your tiles. The balance between auction and activating tiles will dictate the game.

I can see this game with good replayability since not all tiles will be included in the game.

--- Update ---
After almost 2 years I got to play this game again at my local meetup with the expansion. I have now dabbled enough in medium weight Euro to feel comfortable with this game. The rating has gone up accordingly to an 8/10.

My favorite game, and one of a few 10s in my book.

The balance of auction/worker placement is out of this world.

Love the balance of getting meeples played on your tiles or lost in a bid. Love that you have to adapt to what tiles become available.

One very unique game that hits the peak time, strategy, and interaction levels I would want in a game.

The ultimate village building event.  You can buy a tile, but anyone can use it.  Maybe it is better if they use it, because you get their workers!  But maybe it is seriously annoying, because you really want the ability!  Tradeoff upon tradeoff upon agonizing decision, I have never deliberated so much about such simple actions.  Because maybe next turn someone else put their two red workers on it and I can't take it anymore!  Well, I could put three red workers on it, but I was going to use those elsewhere...  Worker placement without the absolute exclusion, but also bidding and village expansion.  Oh, and maybe I'll just take the action while you guys are bidding on it!  The flexibility and possibilities of this game are endless.  Always fun.

From a mechanics side the game is extremely solid and, despite a little randomness with the drawing of things, mostly strategic. The theme doesn't come through to me all that well; I know that's typical of euros but I've played several euros where I still feel the theme in the air, even if lightly, up until the end. In this, the theme is gone by the time you're in Autumn/Winter and it feels it's just a hard crunch to score points (not a bad thing but knocks it down a little for me). Also late game gets very AP.
Overall though, it's a great game and I do enjoy it.

un excelente juego que convina muchos tipos de mecanicas: subastas, transporte, colocacion de rutas.

Act#2:

Excelente juego, aquí no hay colores para cada jugador, cada jugador (2-6) tiene que usar sus meeples para subastar losetas hexagonales, cada lado es para que cada jugador coloque su meeple.

En este juego hay que saber optimizar movimientos, ya que son limitados ( a menos que coloques meeples en los hogares de otros jugadores).

100% recomendado, a dos lo recomiendo totalmente.

RATING: 8
Very interesting and fun auction / worker placement game, with unfortunately a somewhat unsatisfying end game. Keyflower offers a lot of game in relatively simple rules and short playing time.

Keyflower has an ingenious system where the workers you place (on tiles, to gain resources) are also used to bid for tiles. Winning tiles is good, because the workers you place on tiles you own you get back for the following turn, so the only cost to doing that is an opportunity cost: you're not placing them somewhere else, such as in a bid for more tiles. While workers you place on other people's tiles you lose (and that person gains them), so there's a very real cost in doing that.

Another nice aspect is that only about 2/3rds of the tiles are used each game, which makes for a very different experience each game. One game there might not be many opportunities to gain wood, the next skill tokens will be scarce, and in a third there will be very little transportation. So you need to adapt and you can't place a fixed value on each resource.

What I also like is that you can't do everything; but you don't have to. You won't have a lot of tiles AND workers AND resources AND green keyples AND tokens AND transportation, but you can get away with almost anything. If halfway through the game you have only won one tile but you have 10 resources, you can still win, and if you have no resources at all but you do have a handful of green keyples you can also still win, &c. You just have to figure out when to use your opponents' tiles, what to bid on and so on.

This diversity comes with a downside though: the ending feels lacking. Keyflower is ostensibly about bidding for tiles, placing on tiles to gain resources, and using those resources to upgrade your tiles for victory points. And throughout most of the game that's what everybody's doing. But victory points for upgraded tiles will only account for about 1/3rd of your total vp. The rest comes from scoring tiles, and no two players will have the same tile. So player A might have a tile that gives her 2 points for each of her 9 green keyples, player B owns a tile that gives him 20 points for owning two of each skill token, and player C gets 21 points for moving 7 iron on a tile that gives 3 points for each iron there. Does this mean that player C played better than player B, who did better than A? It's hard to compare.

In rounds 3 and 4 players are mostly doing their own thing. Keyples, tokens or resources, they're all worth nothing at the end of the game, unless you have the correct scoring tile, in which case it's in your best interest to gain as many of that item as possible. So instead of competing for the same thing, every player is specializing.

I feel a game is better when player have multiple ways to reach the same goal, but in Keyflower players use the same method to reach very different goals.

If you're looking for a game you can play a lot, where you can try out different strategies, switch things up, play nice or very competitive, reactive or proactive, Keyflower delivers. If instead you're looking for a game that lets you hone your skills, develop a winning strategy, become more efficient and improve your scoring, Keyflower might not be the game for you.

Fantastic game that scales well no matter how many players you have. I love the tension of taking actions, bidding for tiles and trying to manage the flow of getting new workers all with the same pool of meeples. The mechanic where each tile can only be used by workers of a single color at a time is really interesting and innovative. I also get excited by the carcassonne-esque way tiles from the center get added to your personal town, whereupon other players can use them and you get the benefit of keeping the guys they spend. Really clever! All in all it's a mix of worker placement, bidding, tile placement and resource management.

Certain winter tiles can create point combos of unbeatable power. Players need to know about those tiles ahead of time and prevent players from exploiting them.

This is the type of Euro I've lost patience with. The way it mashes up auctions, actions and worker placement is certainly clever in a beard-stroking sort of way. But there's way too much resource conversion and cube-churning for my taste and the individual-board path-optimisation feels tacked on. All this gets in the way of what could be a nicely interactive little system. If I did play again, I would certainly favour doing away with the hidden-but-trackable information so that my opponents [i]know[/i] when I'm screwing them.

A game where players have tons of options and control on any given turn, but nothing ever feels certain. The combined worker placement/auction core is a joy. The potential for players to viciously and unambiguously topple each others' houses of cards (at cosyt) adds a bite rare in pastoral-themed euros and provides an organic incentive to diversify. 

The real thing which makes the game sing, though, is the almost entirely player-defined scoring criteria and the tremendous variety in setups.

One of my favorites from 2012.  Love using the meeples as currency and workers.  Very flexible game play that makes sense—players can place workers in other player’s villages and goods need to be transported to their respective tiles for points to be scored.  I enjoy building my village and discovering synergies as new tiles come up for bid.  Cute theme, great artwork!

Titkos Télapó 2014! 
A játék helyezése megkérdőjelezhetetlen, sőt talán még lehetne feljebb is a BGG listáján. Izgalmas és egyedi a mechanizmus, maga a játékfolyamban nincs sok újdonság, termelés, fejlesztés, szállítás, győzelmi pontszerzés, de ez a licit és az akciók - akár együttes - használata kellemes feszültséget visz a játékba, főleg, hogy bárki lapkáját is lehet használni, így a sajátomban sem lehetek biztos. Ez nagyon eltalált. De, hogy 6 főnél észbe lehet-e tartani a játék illetve más játékos lehetőségeit?! Nem vagyok benne biztos, kellő rutinnal az ábrák egyértelműek, távolról is felismerhetőek. A grafika eltalált és kellemes ránézni. Szóval remek darab. Kieg. beszerzését is előirányoztam, bár ki tudja van-e rá szükség. Majd meglátjuk. :)
Update:Előirányzás kipipálva. Hát ez nagyon jó játék. Úgy éreztem viszont, hogy a célok egy kicsit egysíkúak, így a farmerst beszerzem hozzá. A játék mechanika végtelenül egyszerű(így már többet játszva):) , de ez a licit, lapkahasználat izgalmán nem tudok fogást találni. Talán egy kis szerencsefaktort lehet felróni neki, de csak az első körben. Sajnos többször leütöttek mint a büdös....-t, akárcsak Erdei.:D Ennek ellenére kiváló a játéknak tartom. Külön köszönöm a Titkos Télapónak, aki talán nem is annyira titkos!:D
No még több játék után egy kicsit vesztett a varázsából, de nem a játékmechanizmus, hanem a teljesítendő célok lettek kicsit üresek. Bár nem annyira, csak feltűnt.:) Ez a játék kiállt a kiegért!!!!:D

Played Once
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
* I've only played this once so far, but I can see how no two games would be the same. The secret is in having so many almost-game-breaking combos that so greatly impact your strategy, and in knowing ahead of time which of your secret almost-game-breaking scoring opportunities you're going to have to fight for in the end.
* Plays perfectly for 2 players.
* The auction mechanic is amazing and the tiles actually have measurable and relative value even on your first play through. The best part is the almost-game-breaking tiles are often only almost-game-breaking for one person or the other. When you combine this with you immediately getting your keyples back from a losing bid, it leads to fun spiteful moves where you force the price of something up knowing full well the other person will pay for it and you'll get your resources back. We had one situation where my opponent had a single blue meeple on about three tiles he really wanted. I put down two on his most desired tile, which forced him to go to three which let me move those two to his next most desired tile and we cascaded down the tiles until he'd spent most of his blues. He then had to use his meeple generator tiles to try to get more blues (turns out two of the tiles we were fighting for were the winter boat tiles which shouldn't have been up for bid, but the point is that there's room for a ton of really fun player interaction in this game).
* Great player interaction. See above spite-auction example.
* I love how your winter scoring tiles were kept a secret from the other players but you still have to bid for them in the end! We only had a single tile come up that allowed a player to get green meeples. It was so important to me to get my winter scoring tile that I had to use up three of my meeples on my first winter move to keep my opponent from generating greens.
* Just the right amount of randomness. Every turn created a new puzzle to solve but you never felt trapped by a bad draw. I lucked out and got an anvil on my last skill tile draw for 3 more Scholar points, but if it had been a saw instead I might have upgraded my Timber Yard or fought harder for the Scribes tile and if it had been a pick axe I might have spent it in my opponent's Brewer.
* From reading a few session reports and other comments, it sounds like winning scores are often in the 50 point range. With scoring tiles, point tiles, gold, etc maybe giving you on average of 5 points, it feels like every scoring opportunity matters but missing out on something won't knock you out of the game.

Cons:
* Nothing really stood out as a con. There were some things that might cause me not to play the game as often (length, complexity), but I can't blame a two hour, heavier game for taking two hours and being heavier. That said ...
* It's a longer game than I usually get a chance to play, especially with open information (which can greatly increase AP).
* Heavier and mathier than we normally play too.
* It's not a con for me because I have them, but there are some possibly hard to track down promo tiles for this game. Key Celeste, in particular, has a very unique mechanism that's worth trying. If you can't track down the tile, maybe use Boat 4b and a grey meeple from, for example, Carcassonne as a stand-in.

Neutral:
* I usually dislike games with player screens, but I'm putting this in the neutral section because playing with all trackable information and initial meeples out in the open doesn't break the game. Drawn skill tiles and winter tiles can be kept face down so no need for screens.
* Normally I dislike games that are AP inducing, and this one certainly counts, but it's AP inducing the way Battleline is; because of the huge impact a player's move can have on you, there's a quite a bit of tension for everyone involved while waiting for the other player to make a move. In a two player game, the impact of the other player isn't so great that you can't do some planning on your own turn.
* When it comes to handling points, I generally dislike games with dozens of tiny scoring events in a score-track-lapping point-soup meander around the board. My favorites are usually race games where the first person to achieve a victory condition wins. Keyflower sits in the middle. There's nothing to track during the game, but you have to add up a bunch of things at the end to see who won.
* No cards. Neither a pro nor a con, but as an obsessive sleever, I'm glad not to have to sleeve anything this time.

I was (finally) able to play this game again, this time with my lovely and intelligent wife. She gave the game two chances and has declared it is not for her ("felt like work"). I enjoyed the game immensely, but I will admit it breaks down somewhat if people aren't willing to aggressively bid for tiles. This is not a game for nice people.

= 2014-03-02 - R:8

Wonderful game. THIS is how you mix game mechanisms without turning things into a jumbled mess!

I've only played it once, but my instant love for this game is making me wonder what characteristics elevate it from being just another vapid point-soup / spreadsheet optimization game into a brawling slug fest where every action matters. Or maybe that's it. The level of interaction is high - not just in the "you have to pay attention to what your opponent is doing" kind of way that the Euro apologists are always espousing, but actual I-can-not-believe-you-just-did-that-to-me interaction.

The game "only" lasts four rounds and when you complete the first round in under 10 minutes you'll wonder if you did something wrong. When your last three moves take a nail biting half an hour of back-and-forth aggressive maneuvering, you'll realize the only thing you did wrong was wait so long to play this game!

I admit the reason I picked this game off the shelf last night was to prove I disliked it so I could put it up for trade/auction while my expansions were still NiS. While the game didn't directly succeed in helping me reduce the size of my collection, this was one of the first times I've ever played a game and felt, at the end of it, that the replayability was high enough that I won't need another game to fill this niche for a long time.

Nov 2016: Upgrade from 5 to 6

* Seems very playable from 2-6 players
* Much better than Key to the City - London.
* The skill tokens nor the road network mechanisms don't feel as vestigial as I thought. They are more intuitive and more fun than KtoC-L's connectors.
* Still, my comments below apply.

Oct. 2016: Lighter than I expected considering the number of mechanics packed into this game.

In my only play, I pursued the strategy that seems to work in a lot of Euros: Focus on strategies no one else is doing. Seemed to work very well in this title, which to me is a fault.

The game felt oddly scripted even for only one play. In each of the four phases, it seemed that players should focus on doing one thing. First phase is getting tiles, and second-to-last phase involves spending your remaining resources. I suppose, though, that any engine-building Euro goes through similar phases, but it felt too structured here.

The game offers a challenging puzzle to figure out how to get all the interlocking mechanisms work on your behalf, but then that means there's no time to get in the way of your opponents' plans; like many Euro's, getting in the way of an opponent is usually a side effect of pursuing your own goals.

I do agree with some comments that some of the mechanisms feel vestigial, such as the road network mechanism or the skills tokens. They feel more like distractions; I don't really care to take them into consideration when making more significant or important decisions, such as which tile I want from the common pool.

So, Keyflower succeeds as a Euro by posing challenging puzzles for players, albeit not very elegantly. Still, I'm not a big fan of Euros, and this title still felt too similar to others in the same genre. However, I'm looking forward to the sequel, Key to the City - London as I hope that game can serve as a stepping stone from lightweight games to heavier ones for "non-gamer gamers."

With every game it becomes my favorite euro worker placement game. With expansions it gets even better.

It integrates biding, worker placement and tile laying and some more minor mechanics without making the game too complicated and it can be played under an hour. It works well even with two players.


Might need 2 or 3 games to grasp the main strategies and mechanics.

Great, great euro design!

RATING: 8
Summary: Interest auction format with tile laying. The game progresses into a strategic cutthroat bidding game towards the very end. 

Pros:
1. Auction: The auction mechanic is great in this game. It's not a simple question of how much? It's also a question of which color to bid in. You can take a tile on the cheap if you can remember which colors other players are running low on.
2. Quick: For a solid euro game, it's a fast game. A 5 player game only takes 1.5 hours.
3. Tactical: This game is more about doing the most with what is directly in front of you. It's about burning your brain to optimize your moves.

Cons:
1. Strategy: This game lacks a long term strategy. You don't know what the majority of the scoring tiles are available until the end of the game. This makes it difficult to gear towards any specific long term goal.
2. Other Players: You have very little control of the board. You can get screwed out of the majority of the tiles just because all the other players have yellow meeples and you only have red. This can cause you to get almost totally locked out of a round. At lower player counts, it's less of an issue. At higher player counts, it can become horribly frustrating.
3. Family Feud: This game has a family feud effect. The first 3 rounds score you minimum points and the entire game revolves around the last round. You're really just accumulating as much as you can in the first 3 rounds and hoping for good scoring tiles in the last round. 

Summary:
This is a solid game. The auction/action system of different colored meeples makes the game worth it to potentially own. However, this game ends up feeling more strategic than it really is. I tend to not like auction games, but this game has a very forgiving auction system. I enjoyed the game overall. I'm likely to play it again, but I don't know if I'll run out and buy it.

Have played twice, will try once or twice more ... maybe.

It's boring.  The endless reevaluation of bids and available spaces means that you cannot plan for your turn during the long downtime between turns.  Worse, you cannot joke with your table mates because it will distract the acting player.

The malfunction is inherent in the central mechanic of meeple management.  The value of meeples is unknown and inflation can rise quickly.  Since the same money pool is used in two different markets, it becomes quickly impossible to estimate their value to your opponents.  So you are just guessing, and probably guessing poorly.  This is compounded by the hidden scoring tiles.

This game is the cardboard equivalent of watching a coocoo clock with no birdie at the hour.  It is clearly a fine work of craftsmanship but fails to deliver the triumphant experiences I have come to expect in boardgames.

Keyflower is a good game, but hasn't hit the GREAT level I expected of it yet.  That may be because it requires a bit more plays to really get into, but either way it's a decent Euro that plays in some pretty unique ways for the genre.  Here you use your meeples as both your workers to get goods as well as your currency to bid on the very city tiles that they will work for you.  Very interesting ideas that I like, though it didn't seem quite as high on the "fun" factor as I envisioned.

2017-06-22: Initial imressions after two games (6-player & 2-player)
I don't know... I really would like to love this game, but I don't know.... The mechanic where you use meeples both for bidding & activating the different tiles is novel, and the availability of meeples is tight enough to ensure interaction throughout the four rounds. It is clear that you should build up an engine based on your winter tiles (which every player has some, but nobody can be sure, that they can aquire them at the end of the game), but somehow I miss the tension in the game. 
The idea that some random tiles are not in the game also could increase replayability, on the other hand it could screw you, if those were crutial for your goals/engine. 
I would like to play 4-5 more games before final judgement, but I have some concerns if this has a place in my collection. 
Oh, and the rulebook sucks, I don't know, why it is hard to put examples in every rulebook!!!! If you would like to learn the game I highly recommend the Watch it Played! video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=via0ElmJ7S4&t=1178s

2017-06-28: Yesterday I played a 4-player game and actually it was a blast! At least for this game I felt, that I' getting closer to understand the games' nuances. I stayed focused all along, got usually what I wanted, grabbed 40 points at the end from one of the winter tiles, then won. I loved the unsecurity of not knowing what is enough to win a tile or not. Should I bid high early to get a tile? Should I wait and see, if anybody else would try to bid for the tile? It was fantastic. 
Increased my rating from 6 to 7, but it could increase further.

solid set of choices. needs a play or two to really get the progression of the seasonal tiles and what each season's mechanical position will offer (read: a new player has a huge disadvantage from a player with even a single game's experience) but they make sense and are pretty neat.

I needed two plays to see where this game is going, to actually enjoy it. The integration of using workers both to activate tiles and to bid for tiles is unique and very interesting.

Just one 3P game so far.  Now that I have learned how to play the game I can learn how to play the game.  It looks like a friendly village building game from a distance but this game is deep, open ended, and loaded with wicked player interaction opportunities.  While nothing like Reef Encounter it reminds me a lot of Reef Encounter.  This may be a game to avoid for the AP prone. I expect my rating to increase with subsequent plays as I wrap my head around the strategy.

Keyflower has an incredible mix of many mechanics that cretes a rich and deeply satifing game play. The game begins with a mix of worker placement and bidding but what is truly unique it that they are done simultaneously.  On top of that there us an area control battle for every tile used and added to the game as only one color of meeple can used on each tile (for worker placement or bidding). Once tiles are one they are added to you village which create puzzle as you try to fit them together so they can work in synergy with each other.  The rounds are broken into 4 seasons the first three are similar however, winter tiles are determined by tiles received by players at the beginning thus determining a game strategy.   This game is so satisfying as you build a village from nothing.  The mix of game mechanics is so unique and works so well. one would think the game would be complicated with so many mechanics but the rules are easy and intuitive conversely, game play is deep and vast. It even scales well down to two players which is unusual for a game with bidding.  Two or three player games feel very similar and are equally enjoyable.  The best of a very good series or Key-games.

RATING: 8
Restored my faith in the modern heavy euro. Unlike baroque conversion engines like Terra Mystica, the interlocking systems of Keyflower fit together tightly and put pressure on every choice you make. 

Keyflower isn't about making a sequence of opaque value conversions. The choices in keyflower are stark and remorseless. Bid on a building to add to your village, or use the building power. Use the power, and you lose your meeple to the owner. Bids have to follow suit (colour). Concentrate on two meeple colors and lose the flexibility of bidding in all three colors. Stockpile goods or use them to upgrade buildings. Don't neglect your transport capacity. And unlike say, Le Havre, the decision to use an opponent's building is a tough one. 

Keyflower features some really nice touches around the periphery. The rare green meeple. The choice of special winter tiles. The turn order dilemma - first choice of boats and resources, or first placement next turn.

Nothing seems extraneous. And you're not playing away undisturbed on your own tableau. It takes sharp elbows, bold bids, and ruthless timing to come out ahead. Tremendous fun.

I enjoyed this at my first game. Keyflower is quite simple, it is played over four rounds with each round consisting of an interesting worker placement in which workers can work on tiles in the market or in your village, or other villages, or bid for tiles in the market, or for ship loads of workers coming in. The auction mechanic and the placement are relaxed (you get to re-place your outbid workers and can take a space a second time if you pay more workers).
All sorts of different things score points and you need to work out which ones are best to concentrate on. There is plenty to think about here and a lot of elements that I have seen in other worker placement games but executed with a bit more elegance. There is nothing original here but its nice to see a worker placement game that tries to add elegance rather than complexity. I would certainly play again and expect there is enough depth to be worth a lengthy exploration.

RATING: 8
I've not played any of the other "key" games, and have little interest in them to be honest - but I heard good things about this one, and am glad I asked for a copy. It is a wonderful game - both bidding and worker placement are standard, hackneyed mechanics (and I don't particularly like auction games, as a general rule), but the way this manages to combine the two into one integrated mechanism is really something special. By the last round of the game, everyone is typically doing long chains of actions to get the things they want, while also trying to ensure they win the point-scoring tiles which they need. While there isn't any one mechanic here which is new, overall this feels very fresh and different from every other Euro I've played. And the randomness of the tile draw ensures great replayability. In fact, I can't think of anything bad to say about this game - I did wonder if downtime might be a problem at the larger player counts, but I've played once with 5 and once with 6 and didn't notice a problem, even though most of the others were new to the game.

I don't play this game very often, and it's fallen off my list of absolute favourites - but I'm still always delighted to play it.

Será que estou ficando chato? Estava tão empolgado com o Keyflower, tinha achado que essa inovação na mecânica de você usar trabalhadores tanto para dar lance em tiles quanto para executar as ações deles (inclusive enquanto estão sendo leiloados!) era tão, mas tão sensacional, que nada podia fazer o jogo ser ruim.

A mecânica é bacana mesmo, mas ela passa razoavelmente despercebida durante o jogo. O foco da sua atenção está mais nas ações dos tiles do que em qualquer coisa. E as ações são conversões abstratas: cubinho cinza vira amarelo, pecinha marrom vira 3 cubinhos pretos, meeple azul vira 2 meeples verdes, tudo tão seco que no final do jogo você não sabe nem o nome da infinidade de tiles (serralheria, igreja, estábulo? não importa) e nem o que cada cubinho representa.

Ou seja, a mecânica inovadora fica meio escanteada, o importante mesmo é otimização e conversão. Desconfio que vai fazer sucesso com quem gosta de Le Havre e Ora et Labora, que não é meu caso.

Sobre esses dois jogos, acho que o Keyflower tem a vantagem de ser mais curto. Nossa Learning Session com 5 pessoas ficou abaixo das 3h, com muita consulta de manual, o que me parece razoável.

Ele talvez tenha uma desvantagem de dar mais poder pra quem está na frente. Mas difícil dizer isso depois de uma partida só, pode ser que simplesmente o vencedor tenha jogado muito bem.

Jogaria outras pra ver se a impressão é desfeita e pra quem não veio hoje ter a oportunidade. Mas a primeira impressão é de passar adiante.

(+) Nice artwork, colorful game
(+) Easily explained
(+) Fierce bidding game. Bidding with multiple currencies takes this gaming mechanic to the next level.
(+) The game builds up to an exciting finale with an ever increasing number of options up until the final round

(-) Very prone to analysis paralysis. The game doesn't keep each player involved equally. There is quite some downtime while waiting for your next turn.
(-) The game feels very chaotic after a while. It will force you to gamble and if you loose it will break your chances. This because you often need multiple tiles at once to follow through with a viable strategy. Moreover, not all tiles are used during play, resulting in a different game each time you play, but also resulting in unwanted randomness for such a game.

Keyflower was a significant let-down for me. It's an OK game but suffers from the same issue as for example Le Havre: too many options for its own sake, with the better being shut down by other players constantly, turning it into a game of constant assessment that is not particularly fun. It is also so short that this exercise in denial is incredibly more frustrating than it s in Le Havre... I simply don't understand its BGG rating...

If there would've been a better way to keep track of bids around the tiles, I would've given it a 10, but I just don't like using a side of a hex for bids in this case where there are 8+ tiles to keep track of.

Lots of tiles in the box, but only a subset are used in any one game.  This should allow for diverse games as the situations aren't always the same.  Meeples used multiple ways - currency for bidding on tiles or worker placement to trigger tile effects.  This adds a bit of meeple management to the game as workers spent on tiles don't come home at the end of the season.  While the boats do bring more, one's mix of meeples can be in somewhat of a flux and must be managed.  Lots of options for each player so one isn't necessarily cut out of the game.  The heart of the game is an auction system that keeps players engaged with the benefit that the powers of the tile can be used while the tile is still being bid for.  (No buy first, use later here.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
fast and tight and strategic.  There are several solid mechanics closely intertwined to make for touch choices -- managing the number of your workers, the activation of powers, and the collection of tiles that others will use later.

It's sort of like a more strategic Asara.

update:  I don't think it is worth playing with 5 players -- that's just more chaos and more downtime and less ability to react to other players' strategies.  Probably best at 3 and fine with 4.  I shudder at the thought of playing it with 6.

I don´t usually enjoy "Eurogames", but without doubt, this is one of the best and original "Eurogames" I´ve in my collection, not in terms of appearance, of course, but in terms of mechanics. The Graphic Design of this game is sober, just fair, to say something positive... Materials are good quality, except the player screens, which are nice but flimsy. Anyway, above these little details, where this game really shines is how well mixture of its mechanics works: it´s brilliant in this point! Everything works smoothly and gracefully. Options for strategies are very wide and open. And it's an addictive game! Everyone says that it plays well at 2 players, at 4 or at 6 players. I can imagine this is true. We, for now, have only played it with 2 players, and we love it.

I rate this game very high because its easy to teach to newer player and gives a new twist to the worker placement that it provides in the game.

Very interesting, unique auctioning game.  Works well for two players, which was great for us.  However, there was too much direct conflict for our tastes. The game revolves around taking the tiles that your opponent really needs or blocking the tiles that they already have in their city, which is very frustrating.  After five plays, we just couldn't get behind it.  Traded it away for Clash of Cultures.

--Jan2013-- Very nice dynamics; interesting choices; lots of potential paths through the system.  I like it.  Better still, both of my younger children (F13,M10) found it something that they engaged with happily.  Looks like it might get some more play!  (And might easily go up in rating with further plays, too.)

Great experience playing this.  Of course, we were taught by Richard Breese himself.  Note:  It's nerve wracking to watch him make faces as you contemplate your first auctions.  thankfully I got a nod of approval from him.

Pretty great game, in that there are a ton of things to do and not enough time to do them, so you have to look at your strategy realistically while still planning for your future or making moves to block your opponents.  Im a fan of most of the Key-games, and this is up there with Keythedral for me.

I am a huge fan of worker placement games that somehow break the mold or innovate the mechanic. This hybrid WP and auction game is exactly that. Great game. We out played this one a little bit. It was great while it lasted, but ultimately there are other WP games we prefer over it now.

Something about this just didn't click with me. It almost felt too open. There are quite a few choices available as you can both play and bid on tiles in the center and play on all the tiles in everyone else's area. Since no options were permanently closed and there are often alternate options to get you where you want to go that are almost as equally efficient, it was difficult for me to set clear priorities, which stole any tension out of the game for me. I need to play again.

It's ok, but as with all the Key games, nothing particularly special.  Not as fiddly as some of them though.  Major downside is the time you spend sitting around if you have lots less men than your opponents.

First time playing this game. Played a 6 player game. Pretty long, about two and a half hour and we all took our turn pretty quick. The game has some very interesting mechanic. I thoroughly enjoy it after the one season. But things getting more complicated after that. I have to spend a lot of time to keep track of other people's village since we can activate their tiles. We played in a long table and I sat at one corner of the table. It makes it a bit challenging to see the tiles of other villages. On top of that, the resources and meeples tend to cover the icons on the tile. It makes it difficult to plan. However, those things are minor and can easily be addressed. knowing what tiles are available to bid will definitely help planning. Scored 7 for my first game and i look forward to play another game, perhaps with smaller player count. I can see 3-4 may be better for the game.

Own merchants expansion as well. I've played the game twice and I remember being impresses after my first game. But not so much after the second. It just feels like the game is too fast to get any type of decent engine going. I did like the bidding and the player interaction, but it's ome of those games that I didn't fully grasp. That hindered my experience, so in no way does that mean that it is not a good game, just my experience. Luckily I have a brand new copy with the expansion, so it's definitely one that I want to dive deeper into.

03/04/15: Played it again with 2 after a long time, rules freshly absorbed and clear head. Amazing game! More to come.


03/10/16: It took me 6 plays but I finally see the greatness. A masterpiece of Euro gaming with so many things going on and, everything connects to make an experience like no other.  What else can I even say that hasn't already been said by a zillion other gamers? Its an awesome game.

Quite a unique game: a medium to medium-heavy euro with no negative interaction, that plays best with six and still lasts under two hours. A unique bidding mechanic, quite well integrated tile-laying and resource production & consumption makes for a quite interesting game which nevertheless leaves an impression of deficiency - the game is just too short to achieve much. During 4 game rounds, you'll buy and place a couple of tiles, produce some resources and move them around your village and that's it. What's more, it doesn't scale down that well, as with fewer players not all tiles will enter play, and the ability to get the tile scoring for resources you produce makes a big difference in points. If you're not sure if a tile that suits your strategy will be drawn in the future, you can't plan much and the game is too short to alter your strategy or fix mistakes.

Just keeps getting better and better with more play. Started off as an eight, then nudged up to a nine and now it's just a pleasure to bring out and get my teeth stuck into. This and Le Havre really nail it and hence a ten in my book. (Agricola would be up there too if it wasn't for the dull scoring objectives.) Nothing does it better than these two in this category.

Easily my favourite Key game. Loads of interesting choices to make all within the framework of a simple ruleset and a thought provoking bidding and building usage mechanic. I really enjoy the cat and mouse game played as players wait untilt he right moment to pounce on a bid or building. Sometimes it's straight away to use your colour advantage (maybe the building is just too tempting), while sometimes you delay to the last possible action your upgrade and subsequent activation of a tile.

While there's plenty to think about it's not energy wasted on too many rules. That said, a cheat sheet for players with the tile descriptions would be handy for players to grab hold of. Rules are clear, but a bit of an effort to read through the first time.

The artwork is superb. It's art I like that I get to play with.Nothing could be better than that.

Altogether a wonderful package. The time doesn't drag, but it doesn't feel like my brain is melting either. Points seem to be close. 12 tiles provided for each season always means plenty remain unused from game to game. This along with meeple and tile draw should ensure that each game will be quite different from the last. Terrific stuff.

The game consist of four rounds of multiple auctions to get tiles to form a city, like in Glen More, in order to produce goods and score points in different ways. Meeples of multiple colors are used as currency. There is a lot of player interaction, since it is possible to benefit from the tiles from others, as well as your own.

Keyflower is a demanding game, every mistake is paid cash. That said, it is very rewarding, too. There are tension, interaction, risks and management at every corner.

RATING: 10
[u][b]Why is it awesome?[/b][/u]

Keyflower is my absolute favorite game of all time.  Like many of the best euros out there, the rules are not overbearing but the strategies are deep and varied.  Because the tiles that come out in every season are varied, you can be assured that no two games will ever play out the same way.  

Its gorgeously illustrated with colorful water-color-ish drawings, and the graphic design elements and symbols are very clear and easy to understand. But don't let the sunny disposition fool you - this is a MEAN game.  You can lock someone out of their own tile by putting the right amount (or color) of meeples on their tile to take it's action just because [i]you know[/i] they needed to use that tile to do something cool.  Or you can screw someone out of that scoring tile they put out in winter just to deny them some points.  Other people might see this as a negative, but those people are frail, wispy little creatures that can't handle a little in-your-face interaction.  

Bottom line is I'm sitting there every single game grinning like a maniac because the game is simply brilliant.  There is plenty of player interaction, but no player elimination.  I always feel like I'm in the game, even when I'm losing horribly - maybe not in the running for winning, but always able to do something interesting.  Every game is like a little puzzle I'm trying to solve based on the available tiles.

I could go on all day about this game.  Love it.  LOVE IT.  Possibly too much...

Complex but simple. 

different from normal worker placement, in that position is how different players are identified and color is a resource, rather than an identifier. It's a little bit different than the standard language of board games.

This is a shining example of how gameplay and mechanics are the most important thing in a game.  This is a theme that does not thrill me, and the components are bland.  However, the bidding mechanism based on one of 4 different worker colors is truly unique.  Also, the fact you can activate your opponent's tiles, but they get to keep the workers at the end of the round is fascinating.  Very interesting game that I just wish had a bit more polish to make it stand out a bit more.

RATING: 9
Wow, I think I'm in love. Keyflower is very fresh to me. You only have two action choices on a typical turn: bid on a tile, or use a tile. (Oh, well, a third option: pass.) But then the impact of those two choices are great. You can win tiles and build a little resource-generation engine. You can use other players' tiles, but then they get to keep the worker for the next round/season. You can work to get end-game bonuses, or just work to upgrade your own village. So many paths to choose.

It's really wonderful. Easily a 9.

RATING: 8
Keyflower is an amazing game that combines worker placement and bidding seamlessly. The mechanics are brilliant, the tile distribution offers a great deal of variety, and the game scales well between player counts all the way from 2 to 6. The only issue with the scaling is that higher player count games can become unbearable if multiple players suffer from significant AP. The main problem with the base game is that it has a too much emphasis on the winter tiles.

The Farmers expansion adds variety, but overall isn't a very good expansion. It's functional, but doesn't make the game better.

The Merchants is a great expansion that reduces the emphasis on the winter tiles by giving you other ways to generate a lot of points.

One of the best board games ever designed, and my favourite eurogame. This is a game that gives you a lot to think about and has way more player interaction than most other euros. This is not multiplayer solitaire. Players can mess with you quite easily, and often without knowing it. This forces you to think on your feet and adapt your strategy to meet changing circumstances. Highly recommended.

provisional rating, 1 play.  I don't like memorization games and optimal play of this game requires trying to memorize how many of each colored meeple other players have (or at least a directional sense that players have a lot of yellow meeples and not very many blue ones).  The game play itself is quite good.

A very nice worker placement/bidding game with modular tiles to build your village with. 

You get meeples of various colors, bid on turn order and tiles to build your village, then collect the tiles and various boats with new meeples based on your turn order. You then build your village, use resources from the tiles to gain VP by upgrading your tiles, and after 4 turns, the most VP wins.

Very simple to learn, and extremely fun with 4 people.

RATING: 8
Played twice with 3P and once with 4P. I am a sucker for multi-layered, Homesteaders-style auctions and the ability to use your opponent's buildings to gain benefits, so Keyflower is a no-brainer for me. Players build up engines by bidding on building tiles, and each season offers something different for the engine. If you don't have the necessary resources, you can always activate your opponents' buildings at a cost to get what you need. 

The auction for the tiles are unique as there are 4 different types of currency available. Once a bid for a tile is started, all following bids must use the same type of currency. Incidentally, the bidding currency also happen to be the workers whom players use to activate buildings, so players have to strike a balance in how they spend their workers.

One of the best things about Keyflower is that it delivers a lot of depth for the amount of time to play it (60-90 mins for a 3-4 player game). It does not, however, feature the simplest of rules to get into, so despite its intuitive gameplay it still takes at least one game to get used to it.

2017: Coming in at an 8 after two games, will probably rise as time goes on.  It's a bit of a beast to learn at first, the manual is a little hard to read, but the mechanics bring about such brutal, tough decisions tied with such wonderful interactivity, not just with the bidding for tiles but with being able to play your own workers in other people's towns.  As you play this game, there is no shortage of friendly curses and staring at players across the table, trying to somehow infer from their expression how many blue meeples they have behind their screen.

Right now our group is focussed heavily on building our own engines and doesn't have it together enough quite just yet to see how we can muck with other people's plans until the final round, but suspect that will change (for the better!) the more we play the game.

A brutal, cutthroat euro. This is a game where you can never rest easy, and you have to look closely at what your opponents are doing. 50% of the game is building your engine, the other 50% is shutting down your opponents. And the game gives you all the tools you need to mess with your opponent - from the unique bidding mechanism to the way tiles come out in the game. I think 2p is the most confrontational, with 4p being more sedate.

The Merchants expansion really adds a lot to the base game. It gives a few more ways to score points during the game so you don't feel too bad as you get repeatedly stabbed by your opponents :)

Nos, ha valaki sokallja a Le Havre, Ora et Labora lehetőségeit, akkor az ne kezdjen a Keyflowerrel, ugyanis ebben a játékban hihetetlen mennyiségű lehetőség van, ami szerintem már átláthatatlan. Én úgy gondolom optimálisan lehetetlen játszani benne, maximum egy általános stratégiára lehet törekedni. A játékosok négy évszakon át licitálnak Catan szerű lapkákra, amiből a városukat építik. Minden lapkának van egy tulajdonsága, sőt fejlesztés után még ezen tulajdonság jobb formája is rendelkezésre áll. Ezen felül minden lapka a használható is, akárkinél és akárhol is van. Különböző színű embereinkkel licitálunk vagy használunk lapokat. A 4 körös játék már második köre is szinte átláthatatlan lehetőségmennyiséggel operál. Nagyon sok ilyen lap kerül elő és nehezen optimalizálható figuráink jó helyre rakása. Persze minden ér valamit, de szerintem annak ellenére, hogy az első játékunkban nagyon szoros végeredmény született simán elképzelhető nagy vereség is. Szaharaszáraz a játék, semmilyen téma nem jön át, ez full optimalizálás. Megmondom őszintén csak azért nem lep meg e tavalyi esseni játék sikere, mert tudom a fő geekek ilyen játékokra vágynak. Nekem, aki már tényleg elég komoly játékokon is túl van már sok volt. Nem katasztrófa játék a Keyflower, a licitmechanizmus és embergazdálkodás kifejezetten tetszik a játékban, de a sok lehetőség megöli az élményt. Nálam ez gyenge 6-os csak.

2 évvel későbbi második játszma alapján pontosan ugyanaz a véleményem, mint korábban, sőt bejött a jóslatom is, ugyanis most jóval kevésbé kiegyenlített végeredmény következett be, a játék végi pontot hozó lapok következtében. A holtidő is nagy lehet. Nem javult egy cseppet sem a játékról a véleményem. Túlértékelt a jelenlegi 25. helyezése.

A wonderful hybrid of worker placement, auction, and tableau building.  It rings the same bell as Agricola: you have to look at a splay of tiles and connect the dots to get to the most points (Agricola does this with cards) where the value of points are modulated by the players.  For whatever reason, I find this game bewilders most people.  They get lost in the woods and don't end up producing efficient points.

Nice auction game.  It clips along at a great pace, so much so that you frequently are wishing that the game were a little longer as you are never going to do everything you need to before it comes to completion.  Simple easy design, but there seems to be some real depth here.  The varying tiles will keep returning players on their toes.  Still, this is the kind of game that rewards player knowing all potential tiles available. 

Something that is a little niggly, is that it requires that players pay attention and remember who has which buildings, especially when tiles start getting covered by wood.  You can easily miss good opportunities, by not expending the energy to track everything.

The only reason why I can't in good conscience rate this higher is that you can't be sure that you can ever upgrade or even use some of the tiles that you work to get.  

All in all, lots of fun.  I think this is his best game since Reef Encounter.

It is elegantly simple and involves enough opportunities to mess over your opponents that it works for my aggressive gaming buddies as well.

This game always seems to be just starting to get my strategies working when the game comes to an abrupt halt.  It seems that the Spring and Summer are all about building your strategy, the Fall is about beginning to make it work and then Winter is about last chances for additional victory points.  Seems I always  spend too much time working on getting the right tiles I want and not enough in production of upgrading before the Fall and Winter come knocking on my door but I am working on that ... 

I love that I never seem to tire of this fabulous game  ...

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  Despite having the most boring artwork and being thematically uninteresting, this game has a lot of depth and variation in gameplay.  I liked being able to build an engine to min max.  Despite not typically caring about other players' engines in similar games, I found ample ways in this game to throw wrenches at the other players, which was immensely satisfying.

Unique bidding system and lots of iconography make this Eurogame fairly complex. The bidding will frustrate many players I imagine, especially those who like lots of control and fairness in their games.  Game is not pretty due to its bland, obscured artwork. Still, there are lots of interesting decisions to be made and lots of ways to score, which are key factors for many Eurogamers.

I really enjoy this game quite a lot.  It is fun and fresh.  I love the combination of mechanics: auction, worker placement, engine building, resource management, and even a spatial component.  The auction is especially fun, as you must BID WITH YOUR WORKERS!  Meaning they aren't then available to work for you :)  

This game scales extremely well for all player counts, I can't think of another game that scales as well.  I love that each game feels completely different from one another.

Really interesting decisions to be made along the way.  I hope to get to play this one lots!

Clever but cumbersome mash up of auctions and worker placement. I'll grant that Keyflower is unique. And it's interactive enough, especially for a worker placement game. But there's an awfully high barrier to entry with too much tedious cube pushing for my taste. Keyflower reminds me of Troyes, but with a level of complexity closer to Terra Mystica. As in Troyes, half of the difficulty is deciphering the euroglyphics on the tiles. Even if you think you know what a tile does, refer to the rulebook anyway because it's full of exceptions and inconsistencies. That's fine if there's a thematic rationale. Here there's none. As in Terra Mystica, there are a few too many subsystems that seem to have been added in because they could be, not because they were necessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This one took me by surprise. An excellent game. Interesting decisions abound, with interesting mechanisms tying it all together. The bidding for tiles has a similar feel to a trick-taking game, in that the player who leads the bidding on a tile determines the "suit" for subsequent bids on that tile.

1 play, 4er

Key Flower is an interesting worker-placement type game, sort of: it uses workers in a pretty unique way -- they come in different colors, which limit where they may be used, and there's a nice economy of getting new workers and using them most efficiently. Bidding is simple and works well. And every game should be different: you use a random subset each season. I'm not sure I liked it as much as Key Market, nor as much as Myrmes (which has a worker mechanic that feels a bit similar) ... but this is certainly worth additional plays!

--- Setup ---
There's a bag full of meeples (red, yellow, or blue), as well as a pile of green meeples on the table; players each start with a random mix of 8 (for 4er game, at least), hidden behind their screens. Piles of resources (wood, iron, stone, gold) are placed in Supply, as well as a pile of face down Skill tiles. A number (n) of boats are placed nearby and stocked with Skills and meeples (from bag) as pictured on the tile. Players get a random set of 3 winter tiles; worth VP at end-game scoring if you satisfy varying conditions. Each player also has a home tile, with the ability to upgrade 1 tile and move 1 resource 1 space. There are 4 seasons in the game, each following the same pattern (except winter). 

Each Season
At the start of each round (season), place a number of tiles (according to player count) on display, matching the current season (Spring, Summer, Fall). For Winter, players choose 1-3 of their tiles from Setup and place those on Display instead. There are also turn order tiles that are always on display.

Your Turn
On your turn, you may pass, OR place worker(s) on any one tile, to use the tile's power, or on the edge of a tile on Display to bid on it. Once any color meeple has been placed at/on a tile, all other meeples must be the same color. If activating a tile, must place at least 1 more meeple there than are already present and may never exceed 6 meeple/tile limit. Abilities include things like earning skills tiles or resources (if activating another player's tile, place resources on your home tile; if your own tile, resources go on that tile; skills always go behind your screen). gaining new meeples or converting them to green, moving resources, upgrading tiles, earning end-game VP, etc. If one of your previous bids was raised, you may move all those meeples as a group to another location (adding meeples from behind your screen if needed). When upgrading a tile, must have the necessary resources on that tile; flip it over to the other side (only upgraded side is worth VP; also, better powers on that side). If everyone passes consecutively, the round ends.

End of Round
First, all overbid meeples are returned to their owners (according to the edge where you placed your bid). All meeples on tiles in your Display also go behind your screen. All tiles won from Display are taken, along with any meeples ON them (from people using tile power): meeples go behind your screen, and tiles added to your personal display such that all edges match (fields, water, or roads). Then, resolve turn order tiles (there are n-1 of them): in order, choose one of the boat tiles and take all meeples/skill tiles on it. The player winning #1 goes first next round. Some boats will be flipped over (according to icon on tile; should match next season).

At end of Winter, players add the turn order tiles to their displays, as well as the boat tiles -- they give additional VP.

--- End of Game ---
After winter, players get one final move step where they may move resources (except to some tiles from Fall which give VP for having resources on them). Then, simply tally your VP from all your tiles; most VP wins!

I don't often rate after one play, but I think this one warrants it:

This game is OVERWHELMING to learn, but isn't very complicated. That's a red flag for me... I don't much like games that utterly bury you with *stuff* right from the get go, with a huge spiderweb of options and strategies, to the point that there's quite literally no discernible course of action.

Sure, there's a game here, sure, it's probably fantastic, but it requires such extensive input from the players to get there I just don't see it as a casual or even semi-casual game. Everyone needs to know it -- and know it WELL -- for the play experience to be satisfying.

Not worth the time investment at this point of my life, but I enjoyed it well enough... would I play again? Meh, maybe. Probably not with my current game group, as I don't think it will grip enough people who will want to play it enough that I would be satisfied with the group's understanding of the game.

One of only two Breese "Key" games I've played.  This is a very good and very deep game.  There are a lot of moving parts, which I love, and some pretty original elements.

The game is a pseudo-worker placement game with a pretty prevalent bidding mechanic and home area city building.  Like I said, there are a lot of moving parts.

Each game round is a season and each season tiles are placed out for players to use and bid for.  The first of the unique mechanics in this game is each player bids with meeples and the meeples are in 4 different colors.  Bidding on a tile has to be done in the same color, so if I bid 2 blue meeples, you have to bid 3 blue meeples in order to outbid me.  Also, only 3 of the colors are easily available.  The fourth color, green, is in shorter supply and only granted when using certain tiles and therefore gives a player more bidding power.

The use of these tiles is also pretty original.  Instead of bidding for a tile or after the tile is placed in a player's home area you can place meeples directly on it to use its effect.  Using a tile also has to be done with the same color meeples as used to bid on the tile or use it previously.  And the owner of that tile (or winner of the bid) gets to keep any meeples on it for use in later rounds.

I was thoroughly impressed by how deep and original this game was and at the convention in which I played this I was ready to jump up and buy a copy halfway through.  The end game scoring scared me off though.  There was already almost too much complexity for me to think I could introduce it to my more casual game group but I enjoyed it so much I was hoping I could make it work.  But the end game scoring brought a lot more complexity to the table that just pushed it over the edge.  I will still play this game whenever given the chance but it just wouldn't ever get played on my shelf.

RATING: 6
因為米寶多、圖版漂亮而喜歡上這款遊戲。機制確實很棒，很耐玩，支援的人數也很有彈性，同時（我相信）也不會有人數差異大而遊戲體驗差很多的情況（目前僅開過兩人場）。然而設置太久，桌面需求太大，上手門檻又偏高一些，卻是難以忽略的缺點。

第一次自己試跑的時候就有發現，雖然是競標版塊是遊戲很重要的一部分，但總共只會獲得4次，而且每季結束會一次拿到不只一片版塊，對於新手玩家而言不但不直覺，還會增加拼放的難度。同時拿到的版塊有很大的機會會在下回合才開始大量放置工人在上面，玩家一開始也會不習慣把工人擺去別人家（第一次遊戲經驗證實有沒有這個選項差別很大），算挺不直覺的。反過來說，如果可以逐漸掌握這些抉擇，《大五月花號》可以玩的選擇就多很多，策略也可以深一些。

但真正讓我評到6分的原因，恐怕是設置超級久，桌子也要超級大......建議想入手的朋友多買一個抽取袋給工具指示物用，以及為資源準備個透明盒。

應該會再找策略咖多試幾場，再來補心得吧！

I'm a fan of Mr Breese's "Key" series. To be honest I like Keythedral very much and Key Market so and so. The others (Keydom I don't know at all) are not welcome in my gaming table. But I still love the concept of a non-confrontational but hugely interactive resource planning kind of game.
Keyflower is one of the kind. Players bid for tiles in order to get the best. These tiles should be added to each player's city. Apart from bidding for a tile it is also possible for players to use the tiles, activating them.
The main secret for the huge success of Keyflower is the complexity of each decision allied with the rule's simplicity. Everything is so simple to understand. The main focus is on the decision itself, like every game should be.
I have only played the game once so far but it seems to be the best of the series until now. And of course, one of the best Essen 12 releases. Highly recommended.

2 fantastic mechanical twists on the WP genre make the game numero uno on my Essen 2012 wish list 1) is the worker recycling; you don't own them but they become a resource that travels back and forth between players 2) is the integration of action and auction - makes for extremely interesting decisions as to whether prioritise the auction or the actions - and this shifts over the four seasons of the game. Interactive, multi dimensional wonderful 'post' Euro design

-------------------

3 plays in and loving it. Fantastic with three players. Huge variability with tile draw - all games have felt very different because of resource priorities/scarcity and scoring options. I would advise against playing with five or six in your first game as it is a bit difficult to take in at first.

Interesting little mishmash auction game. Tiles to place in your village are acquired by auction, the novelties being that subsequent bids must be the same colour and that losing bids can be moved, a la Amun-Re, to another tile. But the real trick is that tiles can be used even while they are being auctioned, with all subsequent uses of a tile taking more workers than the one before it -- and the player who wins the tile takes the workers on it too.

The result is a sort of combination worker placement auction, with tradeoffs around tile ownership value (positional implications of tiles, future worker earnings potential etc.), and action value/timing. 

It works very well, with hidden goals -- that, once public, are auctioned off! -- to guide overall strategy and many options for tactical variation. The different colours/currencies are a great touch, especially the rarer green workers.

The level of randomness in the tile and worker draws is perhaps a little too much for me, but there's definitely a lot to like. It reminds me strongly of Ora et Labora, but with a far more interactive method of building acquisition and activation. 

As a bonus, it's utterly gorgeous: possibly Juliet Breese's best work. The unique player screens are especially nice.

Played it only once and it was very smooth. Misjudged a few things, it's shorter than one would think which means you don't really get to produce a lot so it's a bit harder than I thought beforehand.

Watching your village grow is very satisfying and the way the seasons work (tiles becoming stronger, scoring tiles showing up during autumn, less paths on later tiles etc) is very nice.

For now I enjoyed it but I'll have to replay it a few times to get a better grasp.

After another play decided this isn't the game for me, up for trade! Played twice, smokefree home.

Wow.  A worker placememnt game with a huge amount of interaction.  You can use other peoples village tiles, which can really mess up their plans (but they get your meeples for future turns).  Tiles are won by bidding but you bid with meeples so that will be less actions as you lose the meeples you won the bid with (losing bids come back to you or you can relocate).  There are four colours of meeples that will not work together.  plays in approx 1/2 hr player.

RATING: 5
Overall a good rulebook, but there is a pretty steep learning curve here due to multi-layered depth and a large variety of tiles. I haven't been too impressed with prior (earlier) Key games, but this is better (even if only slightly).

The game's graphics are excellent, with lots of bits too.

Nice touch having the history of the series/Designer Notes wrap around the game box. I also appreciate the fact that they detail every tile.

I just wished it lasted one more turn as the game ends just when it seems things are building. We initially got all excited, and then the game just dropped off the cliff.

The inevitable conclusion is that the Key series is not for me.

I don't usually give heavier games a rating after only one play, but I enjoyed this so much, saw so many options for future plays and am so eager to play again that I felt I had to.

edit: after a few more plays I'm even more convinced about the greatness of the game. the only problem is that people tend to look at it and pick the game with the dragon on the front of the box instead. *sigh*

edit 2: played it with the farmers expansion, which I'd put off for a year after getting it from secret santa because I thought, does this game really need more stuff going on? and the answer is no, probably not, but it sure is fun!

Fun Euro game that has some interesting choices in how bidding works with 3 different currencies. The theme is a bit pasted on, but it still works in a sense.

My only complains are that the game is too short and the green meeple are extremely overpowered. 

I wish it was 4 rounds and then a final scoring round instead of 3 and then scoring. Doesn't feel long enough to build up a good engine.

Also, the rule about green meeples being used for bidding going into the meeple draw bag is extremely weird. It can lead to random swings of luck if someone manages to pull one considering how powerful they are. I wonder if the game would have been better without the green meeples at all... or some way to make them easier to get or just have them act as a wild color.

Overall, it is a fun game with some interesting strategic and tactical choices. Not really a fan of the connecting locals and scoring points based off of that (another needless mechanism). Should play fairly differently after each game though considering the number of tiles available. Finally, there is a bit of randomness and luck in what tile combinations come out. It makes the game interesting, but can wildly favor one player over another.

If I were making a smaller collection of games, I would have games which mash together multiple mechanisms. Keyflower, Lewis and Clark(has a deck buildish aspect), and La Granja would be a few. Eminent Domain is a nice mashing of deck building and variable phase order. Some favorite more pure deck builders would be Trains(RisingSun), Legendary Encounters: Aliens, and Clank.

Avoids the worst of the worker placement issues and combines it with an auction. Suspect we've been playing it wrong or, perhaps my memory is playing up.

Yes it's got a tendency towards points salad but just about avoids it by you seeing the tiles at the beginning.

Solid game! Great player interaction in a game that mixes a variety of mechanics into fluid gameplay. Every time we play it, it feels too short, but I guess that adds to the pressure to make important decisions on bidding or using your meeples. The modular board and different types offer a large amount of replayability.

havent had the time and mood to study the rules and give it a go, I bought it coz i read its a great 2012 games ranked 1 from rahdo, and also great worker placement and auction game... I kinda want that game mechanic in my collection, will update again later.

EDIT: just played a game last night, it was ok, a bit too short in overall gameplay and too long at the bidding phase, should give it more try.

Cute little game about trading slaves.
Seriously, you have slaves of three colours that can come over in the boats. You can get a fourth colour, green, which probably represents the Irish that are more valuable for working and trading than the others. Or at least I'd like to think so, but if you upgrade the hexes that allow you to convert slaves for Irishmen you can go from trading one slave for one Irishman to one slave for two Irishmen. As I'm partially Irish myself I'm not sure how I feel about that.

The bidding mechanism is interesting and works well, but so much of the game seems to hinge on winning the winter tiles that you've built for and missing out on these ruin your end score. I'm sure the game is playable other ways but it seems to be a really disappointing ending to an otherwise promising game.

The artwork is very pretty, but covered by, and ruined by, some hideous if  perfectly functional iconography.

Worker placement meets auction meets tile placement in a point salad where you can feasibly score for anything. This should have been a recipe for a snoozer of a dry Euro. Oddly, the game comes together quite nicely. More interactive than it first appears, thanks to an ingenious auction system (that works well at 2p!), and the ability to use actions in opponents' villages. 

It's amazing that this game works, frankly.

You don`t have your own workers. When someone bid in a color, everyone who will bid on that tile, must bid in that color. Everyone has workers in all colors. 

The tiles that you won comes in your village. When you use your own tile the worker comes back to you. When you use someones tile the worker comes to that player. When you use a neutral tile the worker comes to the player who win the bid for that tile.

One play - basic game (no wandering livestock). 

It's possible there's a great game here. Alas I didn't find it. I didn't really care too either. And I'm in no rush to try again. Twee, muddled, tiring & dull. There are other games out there that probably do this sort of game-play better too. 

Main complaint: way too much downtime and it really stalls further if you have any AP players. Luckily I had a Mancala Game-App on my smartphone.

Main result: personally, this has confirmed for me once-and-for-all that I really DISLIKE worker-placement resource-harvesting games of minimal detail & substance. 

Thanks Keyflower :-]

I really like that unlike a lot of other euros, Keyflower has a lot of direct player interaction (that is, interaction beyond "I got to this resource before you did"), which enables aggressive play. Yet being "attacked" never feels as overtly offensive as in other high-interaction games; though that might be because I wasn't the one whose critical engine tiles got flooded with yellow meeples that one time.

Keyflower is also one of the few games where I still come away from it feeling like I've learned something interesting, tactically speaking.

I have to lower the score after a few more plays since I feel the scoring is a bit random and chaotic due to some scoring tiles inbalance. I have not that much sense of building an engine that will pay in the end as of picking the best bonus tile in the last season, for which having it is a big advantage.

I enjoy Keyflower tremendously, but don't get to play it often enough. At it's most basic, it's about collecting resources for victory points. This alone is nothing spectacular. However, to collect resources, players are bidding for tiles to add to their individual villages. Players bid by using Meeples in one of three main colors. Once a bid has been placed on a particular tile, other players may only increase the bid by using Meeples of the same color. On top of this, there are multiple tiles up for bid at the same time. Thus, there are multiple bidding wars going on simultaneously. In some ways, the bidding mechanic reminds me of [thing=96913]Lancaster[/thing] in that, once you are outbid, you can either increase your bid or move your losing Meeples to another location. There is a lot of back and forth, vying for valuable tiles, which can be very engaging.

I also appreciate how everyone can make use of all the tiles, even tiles in other players' villages. Thus, there is quite a bit of interaction in what could have otherwise been just another multi-player solitaire game. If anything, though, the plethora of options can be overwhelming to keep track of. While it wasn't an issue in our game, I wonder if an AP-prone player wouldn't bog this game down tremendously. As is, with a full six players, the game is already quite long -- probably too long if you're playing with new players.

With four player who know the rules, there is much less downtime, or even room for downtime. It's a much shorter game. Much more enjoyable! The auction continues to be cutthroat and exciting. Two is even quicker, but you lose some of the tension that comes from more complex auctions and greater interaction.

Overall, it's a wonderful game -- and I haven't even mentioned the theme and artwork, all of which I find absolutely charming. The attention to detail, down to individual houses that serve as player screens are lovely. While I wish those same player screen stayed together better, that's about the only complaint I can even think to make about the game's components. Top notch.

I'm not always a big fan of bidding in games, but the bidding in this is so intensely fun. I love it. Every game is rich with interesting decisions, and prioritizing actions is not only intriguing and difficult, but such a fun puzzle to try and figure out. The level of interactivity is extremely high, which is a great addition to a euro. Keyflower plays well with any player count, and even long games are engaging the entire time. 

This game is so incredibly good, happy to play it anytime, anywhere.

Keyflower is a good, well designed game. The auction mechanic is done very interestingly, and there is a lot of puzzle to figure out to best make your civilization work most efficiently. I didn't enjoy it as much with only two though, which is ultimately why it had to leave my collection.

I found Keyflower interesting, but just didn't love it to the point of wanting to add this to my collection. There's lots to like in the mechanics, and the skill required to manage your resources and worker placements/bids is challenging and fun. Don't think I like the rare blue workers, as these make screwing someone who doesn't specialize in them (and certainly not everyone can) all too easy. It's also easy to work the whole game toward a goal and then have someone poach the big bonus tile from you at the end, which can be more than frustrating. Also a small quibble I have to note ... the trend of games with action spots you can use in OTHER PLAYERS' AREAS is not a great one. It's hard to see, fiddly and slows the game. OK - rant over. I'll certainly play Keyflower again, but for me it's not a keeper.

This is the Usual Suspects of board games.  Its on everyone's list of top games.  It took me a while to pull the trigger, but I'm glad I finally did.  

High expectations can sometimes be a bad thing, but in the case of Keyflower, it did not disappoint.  Played 3 two player games so far.  I love the replayability, especially in a two player game where you only use 6 tiles per season.  I love how some strategies might not work due to what tiles are out.  I enjoy the balance between winning bids and activating tiles.  The game tempts you to bid on tiles you don't really want just because there's some free workers on there.

Plays quick with two, excited to try this with a higher player count.

Excellent game.

Now that I have multiple plays, this game absolutely deserves a 10 from me.

I love how the game forces you to adjust your strategy as new tiles appear/don't appear. Then it throws in the decisions of when to bid on tiles you want, when to color-lock tiles your opponents want, when to start using tiles in your area / vs your opponents. There are so many decisions, it can seem overwhelming, but because the core game is so simple, it works together perfectly.

Add in a lack of a single dominant strategy, and a beautiful auction/worker placement mechanic, and you get a perfect score for me.

11/30/12 - First play went well, except that I scored a third less than the winner! I got demolished. Hopefully I'll do better next time. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around a few crucial strategies. And the ones I went for were heavily contested by others. I was just never able to realize any of my plans. It might be an issue resolved by playing with less than 6 (which is the max number of players). I'm excited to try it out with fewer players. I like it though. It gave me a good brain burn, in a short amount of time, and with considerably few rules.

I'm giving it an 8.5 for an initial rating. It has potential to climb with more plays.

Very interesting if somewhat soulless euro game.  The bidding system has a really nice tweak where you can lock the bidding into a certain color worker.

The spatial element and having to transport goods around your village are a nice touch.

Even the hidden scoring mechanism is implemented well, where you can control which bonus scoring options will be available but you might get blocked from getting the one you had been planning on getting.

I need to play this a bit more in a larger group.

The fact that it can play up to 6 is a very nice bonus too.

There's a lot going on in Keyflower. The graphic design and iconography is well done and the tactile nature of shuffling around meeples is neat. The game also presents a unique puzzle in which you weight committing meeples to execute an action but afterward giving those meeples to an opponent for their later use.

I welcome future plays but my first take was that the thinky nature of the game (and, particularly in Fall and Winter, sheer number of options) can lead to a lot of AP, brain burn, and long stretches of silently staring at the table. I expected a more lively, interactive game.

Sheena loves this game.  I do like the meeple mechanism - i.e. using the same pool of meeples to either bid or use a tile.  I could see this score increasing after more plays.  I've played 2, 3 and 4 player games and its just a lot of fun at all counts.

I think that it is just too heavy for me. When I tried it, there were too many possible places to set my meaples and all too often I was missing a great move just because it was on the board of a person on the other side of the table. Since I was so overwhelmed by the breadth of the decision tree, I was not even close to coming up with a good, viable strategy.

RATING: 10
Some of my favorite mechanics in games are worker placement, tile placement and bidding...Keyflower hits them all and does so in a way that doesn't just feel like bits thrown together. It's a cohesive system that works. Not to mention the bidding and worker placement aspects happen simultaneously which is just brilliant. After a couple games with 2 players I can attest that this is one of the very very few auction/bidding games that works well with 2 players.

This is the best game in the Key-series of games. Great and innovative mechanic of worker placement for both bidding and taking actions. Finally some fresh air on the subject. Tantalizing decisions of where to deploy your workers. The rules are actually simple, although the game itself is a brain twister! You will spend 3 great hours of game play with 3 of your friends for a 4-player game. The rulebook is well outlined and does not leave any gaps for questions (you don't hear this very often in our days). The art is top notch and what you should expect from the Key-series of games. Go and get your copy now if you like games like Keythedral and Caylus. This is a gamer's dream come true!

A unique worker placement/auction game where workers are both bid fodder and workers.  Bidding requires matching the right color worker.  Game is very quick with four seasons.

RATING: 8
[thing=122515][/thing] is a medium-heavy game (for me) in which players are bidding for tiles, activating tiles (even the ones players are bidding on), all in order to make resources (wood, coal, gold, meeples, and so on), develop buildings and acquiring victory points.

The game allows for many strategies, and the use of meeples (and their colors) to activate tiles (even the ones the player are bidding on) and also bid on them, is something I never seen before, and is necessary to think really well in what to do, in which order, because, for instance, you can activate a tile, then use the resources gained by this to win the bid of this same tile, taking the tile and the meeples you used to activate it! It is just great.

The point that makes this game stand out is: once a color of meeple is used (for bidding or activation), everyone else, even the initial player, [b]must[/b] use the same color. This simple thing is awesome. This adds a whole level of attention, interaction, blocking, gathering and strategy to [thing=122515][/thing]. I loved it! Every time during play, we were all grumbling, cursing and hoping that the others would chose a good color for you, and it was a joy, when someone activated a building and you go there, with an handful of meeples to basically take it for you. "How many red meeples you could possibly have, right?"... "Oh, dear."

There is an important spatial element in [thing=122515][/thing]: the place in which you put the tiles matter, since you will have to take the goods from the tile that produced them to others, in order to upgrade the building (and, with this, making it better to do things and also most will be worth VPs). Also, in the beginning of the game you receive 2 tiles that, in the last season (winter), you will have to put (at least one) for auction, and these tiles usually be some strong VP earners, if you prepare for them - this gives some north to your overall strategy, but you are free to just ignore them and try other things, vying for other tiles (but, then, you won't be able to know if they will actually be put for auction in the winter).

In five players - with some AP (I'm to be blamed for part of this) - the game took a little over two hours. It doesn't hurt that [thing=122515][/thing] is a beautiful game - it is sorrowful that the icons take so much space of that pretty tiles.

Enjoy the bidding mechanic in the game. There is always a need to balance the "workers" for bidding and action taking as well as whether to place the worker on opponent's buildings to activate the benefits. This will mean giving the opponent more workers in the next season. 

Transportation of resources to upgrade building is also play a key aspect in the game. I always find myself not having sufficient time to upgrade my buildings by the time winter arrives. An interesting game with replayability and player's interaction!

The meeple bid and action selection mechanic is appealing, as is the availability of everyone's tableau. But the economy is hidden and there's not a clear feedback loop. Tension fails from wasteful thinking, design red herrings, and lack of focus. The road system, for example, felt vestigal as one really couldn't choose tiles for that content and the specifics of that network felt unnecessary. Irritating and phoney. Rather than adding a pleasing sub-system I felt it as drift.

The resources are functionally indistinguishable, so it's sort of a kinetic set collection game, and routing these things to their right tile to assemble in VP earning clusters feels clumsy. I do like the idea of the lightness of a commonly built logistic network creating value for the fine auction, but it misses from lack of commitment and abstraction.

A tactical drift through jetsom and flotsam that is too much a burden to pull together. Another game that separates the players with VP splatter, however disguised.

I wonder if this would have been designed as building a common village, with resources & roads interlocked and clear, if the interesting auction idea could have a better environment and the thematic latching become coherent.

RATING: 9
A very well-designed game that deserves all the accolades and hype heaped upon by gamers after its debut. This is a gamer's game with many subtle nuances to game play and multiple routes to victory. Like many other heavier strategy games, Keyflower requires players to have a few initial games under their belts to appreciate all the potential synergy and combinations available from the tiles, especially the winter scoring tiles. Things I liked about the game include the novel use of meeples for both bidding and activation. I particularly like how usage of meeples becomes more restricted as you play them on the tiles. The dilemma of playing all the meeples at once to win the bid or and to deter competition, or to slowly increase each bid is particularly agonizing. I also loved how the winter scoring tiles are introduced by individual players selecting specific tiles up for bid in the last round. Even if you desperately want a particular scoring tile in the final round and put it up for bid, it doesn't mean you will win the bid. It is absolutely heart-breaking to lose a tile which you have been working on scoring for the full game during the bidding phase. Some will see this as a weakness of the game but the final round bidding has to be carefully planned and executed to perfection in order for things to go your way. Several aspects of the game I dislike: the rulebook could be better organized and written. Yes, it is not the worst rulebook, but the organization is confusing and the choice of words can be murky. There are dozens of rules threads in the forum seeking clarification of the bidding process. It really needs to be cleaned up. We were also quite lost with the purpose of the green meeples since it was never brought up or discussed in any part of the rulebook. At the very least, a passing mention on how the green meeples could also be used for bidding and activation would be helpful. Finally, I am also not a huge fan of the dozens or so scenario to resolve turn-order bidding if some of the turn order tiles remain uncontested. It is confusing and fiddly at the very least. Nit picky details for a well-designed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite an ingenuous game which uses meeples as both currency as a way to activate action tiles.

This game can be quite innocuous until someone gets beaten in an auction for using up all their meeples. I wonder if it's possible to win by not having any production tiles whatsoever. Something to investigate!

Still need to play the Merchants expansion and definitely need to play this one more.

Has several aspects I dislike but manages to be pretty enjoyable in spite of this.

The rules are generally inelegant, with lots of niggling little exceptions that are easy to forget or confuse.  I'd much rather see a game be tweaked to remove excessive complexity rather than just making up more rules to fix balance issues.

Road placement will easily wreck you semi-randomly on your first few plays because you won't know what to expect in later rounds - for example, simply having 2 adjacent roads going towards an empty space will make the vast majority of fall and winter tiles unplayable there.

The single-color bidding mechanic and 1-2-3 workers required for an action feels very nice and is probably the best aspect of the game.

Engine Building games typically fall flat with me, but there are a lot of interesting decisions in this game.  The fact that you constantly have to decide how to balance your actions between bidding, upgrading, shuffling resources, and simply trying to bog down your opponent.  They all use the same resource,  so you really have to weigh every option. 

I think what makes this game especially great for me is that there is nonstop player interaction which is atypical for a Euro.  You are constantly playing off opponents, blocking the, exporting their tiles, faking out bids, trying to make them pay more while setting yourself up for big payouts.

Tons of choices and constant decisions to be made.  Not too AP inducing aside from the final winter round.  I love that you're playing your opponents, and not just the game.

Keyflower has steadily been climbing up my ratings with each play.  It's a fantastic mix of strategy, interaction, easy of setup and quick play.

Keyflower. This is the first board game to leave me depressed and completely unhappy after playing it. 

The only good thing I can say about the game is that the mechanics make sense and are not complex- its actually an easy game to understand and play.

That gameplay, though, is mind-numbingly dull. Not a single turn of this game was enjoyable to me.

The theme of Keyflower is NON-EXISTENT. There is no buy-in to this game for me whatsoever.

This is also the first and only game that I will absolutely refuse to play when my gaming group brings it out as an option.

Great game even though I'm not a fan of auctions in general.

[+] art & components are good, rules are fairly simple, game play is smooth, awsome replayability, some tense choices and bluffs available, very little time to accomplish much
[-] a bit long with 5p, what's the theme again?, hate the rule about being allowed to come back in the auctions after having passed but whatever

Edit: after more plays, I regret the game stays a "long game"; the knowledge of the rules and tiles does not speed it enough, there's just too many good options + need to block others combos.

Keyflower is a bidding/tile laying game. On your turn, you place meeples either on a tile to use it, or beside a tile as a bid in an attempt to win it, and place it in your personal village area at the end of a round. The trick is, there are four different colours of meeples, functionally three different kinds of currency, as other players must "follow suit" in order to bid on or use the same tile you did. A starting bid of 3 yellow means you must beat it with 4+ yellow, and so forth.

Meeple management is key (heh). A meeple placed on a tile to use it gets kept by the owner of that tile. So, if you place it on your own tile to get a benefit, you get to keep the meeples for next round to bid or use again. If you place it on your opponent's tiles, you get the short term benefit, but they now have extra meeples to outbid you next round. You can even place them on a tile that's currently up for bidding, but the winner of the tile gets to keep those meeples as well. Meeples used to win a tile are lost, which can really leave you short next round.

The tile laying aspects of the game are quite fun as well. You must match features when building, roads to roads, blank to blank and so forth. This is important, as tiles generate their resources on their own tile. So you often need to transport resources from one tile to another along your road system. Early tiles have lots of roads, but this diminishes as the game goes along, so getting goods to late tiles can be tough. Resources can be used to upgrade tiles, which flips them over for points or better abilities, such as a mill produces 3 wood instead of 1 wood.

There's a ton of "think" in this game, lots of agonizing decisions about where to put your guys and what moves to do, and it does so in a very short time. Games just fly by, as there's only 4 rounds. Highly recommended.

(12/12 after 3 plays) I enjoy this one.  I like the replayability and having to adjust our "strategy" based on the tiles that come out each season, especially at lower player counts when fewer tiles appear.  The color restrictions when bidding/activating on that season's tiles (as well as activating your own tiles) feels unique with meeples being "currency".

Game play has sped up a little and just a little afraid of what a 6p game would take time wise.   I think you need to commit to a few plays of this one before you judge it.

One play so far. I can understand why this is in the top-25 at the moment, but I understand well why this is not my favorite. Players build a scoring engine and who gets most of the points, wins the game. To be good at this, you need to know (at least approximately) what kind of tiles there are coming later in the game - so if you play once every now and then, you won't be good at this.

The components are good, I mean they are clear and they show the information nicely, but they aren't actually pretty.

If I would be playing more than at the moment, I'd probably played this more and then this would feel better, but as I have limited time, I won't. Most likely there's always something more interesting than this quite abstract engine building game to play, so I most likely will skip this. Not a bad game, but not just my game.

UPDATE: Tried the game again with the view that the short playtime is a feature, not a bug. We were less vicious about the bidding and this improved the game a lot. With two newbie players, it provides an Agricola-like experience in under an hour. Nice quirky replayable game with beautiful graphics. Impossible to dislike, even by someone who normally hates resource optimisation games. Rating increased to eight.

After two plays, it's 'meh'. It finishes too quickly before you can get an engine going or do much at all, the geographical portion is basically worthless, etc. It feels like half a game... No desire to play again. If I want resource optimisation, I own Agricola. If I want auctions with two, I own Metropolys.

After one play with two, I've no idea what to rate this game. I've graded it 7.5 since it's a good game and I enjoyed playing - happy I own it and will suggest it again. The grading may rise or fall depending on how much depth it has with repeat plays.

It's dry and, if you want a game dripping with theme, it's not that game. I didn't think *wow, this is the best game ever*. 

It's an interesting game with moderately simple rules, an overly complex rulebook, and a bunch of tension caused by the auction mechanic. There are lots of options, e.g. focusing on upgrading your village and hope to scupper your opponent's winter tiles, focus on scoring massive on your winter tiles, etc.

It's competent and it *looks* to be replayable, but since the resources are broadly interchangeable, it's not clear how much long-term variety there is. The Keyflower: Farmers expansion looks interesting.

It doesn't feel like any game I own except, possibly, Glen More.

The intertwined auction/action mechanism is conceptually intriguing and creates nice decision angst. With each of the four seasons having its own character due to the different tiles that become available, the game has a nice narrative arc and does not overstay its welcome despite the monotony of worker placement. I also really enjoy that the game plays differently based on what subset of tiles become available in a given session.

RATING: 8.5
Brain burner that scales well with 2-6. Can be a bit much at first and is a little fiddly. Took two complete plays before I fully grasped it. The theme is non existent. The art is "meh". But it makes up for all of that with incredible game play. Also a very "mean" Euro, which may not be for everyone.

RATING: 6
If there's another game with these kinds of mechanisms, then I don't know it.  The idea of the auction and worker placement happening at the same time is novel, and the limitations of the colors when doing all of it together make for the tough choices in this game.  There seems to be a lot of variability among all of the tiles, which is good, since there's not a ton of randomness in the game.  I'm looking forward to playing more of it, though.

This is a very clever tile laying/resource engine game. The use of workers as a currency in the auction round is a stroke of genius. It takes a run or two through the game to see how it all fits together, but once you settle into it you'll find one of the most unique economic games out there. Between this and The Manhattan Project, the worker placement genre is really starting to evolve into some interesting new design spaces. Love it!

Keyflower is a heavier game but it plays six which is nice, one more than Agricola. It can get pretty cutthroat in the bidding phases and players will need to have plans and backup plans for the coming turns. First games might be a little tough but with perseverance there's a lot of fun to be had in the crunch. As it's slightly more mechanical than games like Agricola that may seem more logical, those who favour strategy will enjoy it the most.

One of the strongest things in Keyflower's favour is its high level of crunch offered in a significantly shorter play time in comparison to other strategy games.

At first, I wasn't sure if I liked Keyflower. However, this is one of those games where multiple plays open up the possibilities of the game because it is in the strategy of picking winter tiles at the beginning and the tactical nature of each preceding season where the heart of the game lies. How do the tiles before me allow for me to build up my engine to prosper later on? That is the key question which the game asks, and one in which it flourishes.

My first 5-players game of Keyflower, unfortunately, has been an unbearably slow and boring experience of mechanical transformation of wooden pieces and moving of tiles, deprived of any faint appearance of fun.
I can't understand how such a game can reach the present ranking to the expence and detriment of many other wonderful games.
The theme is pasted on, non-existent and unhelpful; your strategy can be easily messed up nonsensically by other players just by using a meeple of the wrong colour. The length of the game is more than 2 hours in 5 players and it is really really too much, considering that the first of 4 turns ends quite quickly. The fact that each player needs to pass to end a turn makes room for unbearably long final turns.
The one and only good thing about Keyflower is the originality of the auction mechanic that at the beginning made me think this could be quite a good game. Alas, not so. It just ruined my weekly gaming night.

I normally hate auctions, but the way the auctions are handled here, makes this a very interesting game.

Keyflower is a game I've bought and sold twice so far and I'm on my third copy (this is a nasty habit of mine). I very much like the game play and how this genteel looking game can be so cutthroat as you screw over other people by using their buildings or bidding on a tile with a color you know they don't have. It's one of the meaner eurogames out there. 

However, it's not a game that gets requested due to how it looks. Worse, it commits the crime of feeling like you should have played it in less time than it actually took.

I enjoy this one, but I suspect I'll be getting rid of it yet again.

This is a worker placement game where you expand the placement options by building new tiles in your village.  The twist is that workers can be placed on anyone's village, which is where they will stay (the owner of the village gets those workers for next turn).  There's something very satisfying about building a village with the aim of it being useful to both yourself and to the other players.

Good game. A great deal going on. The bidding mechanism is a great feature. Being able to play off the tiles for the season and playing off other player's tiles is another great feature.

I was pleasantly surprised by Keyflower.  I like the way the bidding works and how you go about acquiring your workers/currency each round.  I like the spatial aspect of how your village builds up.  And I like that it's short enough (an hour or so) that I didn't get tired of it.  It's got a lot of nice interactions, but if it was twice as long, I think it would get tedious.  The physical design of the game is also excellent.  Unlike, say, Ora et Labora, I can look over the whole table at the couple dozen unique power tiles in play on the table and know what every one of them does without picking them up and in my first play of the game--no tiny text on tiny cards.

Solid auction and production game with the interesting twist that you can make use of the items being auctioned before they've been purchased, but doing so gives extra resources to the eventual auction winner. Slightly fiddly rules and you really need to see the whole arc of the game to understand what to do in the early rounds. We've found the game takes a lot longer than the 90 minutes claimed on BGG, especially with 6 players.

Willing to give this one another go. The first learning play at an FLGS were fraught with issues - loud restaurant, etc.

(First solo play for learning) - wow the possibilities are quite large in this game.  First initial play w/wife months before this writing perhaps was...largely unfair to judge the game.  The rulebook is a bit weak and there is a chasm to look through and find strategies within. That being said, once you find a path, it is enjoyable to follow and frees up opportunity to slow down/halt others via the bidding and placement

Hopefully can coerce the mrs. into playing this one, if not at a game night w/more friends.  I think I really will like it on further replays.

* After first play w/wife - she really enjoyed it and it proved even more enjoyable for me.  Yeah this game is indeed excellent.

**Update** - After numerous 2p, 4p and a 6p run - this rating is well justified.  It scales beautifully.  The interactions w/6p: one would think that it would slog and drag but with people running their villages as well as bidding, the seasonal portion didn't really take that long.  2h game w/4newbs and 2 vets.  Granted this could change with fully experienced players dynamically passing/jumping back in next turn/etc.

A worker placement game and an auction/bidding game had a baby, and they named it Keyflower.

RATING: 9.8
This is my favorite game and it primarily revolves around an excellently designed auction/bidding mechanic with tile laying and resource management that only help to sharpen and enhance the overall design!  The game lasts four seasons, each with their own unique sets of tiles that come out in new variations from game to game.  This adds a tremendous amount of variability and the feel of every game playing very different outside of the core mechanics. 

The major aspect of the game, the auction/bidding mechanic, is amazingly done and adds a tension that is unmatched by any other game.  You are trying to obtain hex tiles to add to your village.  These tiles allow you to continue routes in your village and open up worker placement spots that are specific to your village only.  Every season you will want to purchase tiles that you want because they will give you valuable action spots that you can benefit from, and also entice other players to send their workers to your village.  The catch to obtaining these tiles in the auction is that once a tile has been bid on with a colored meeple (blue, red, yellow, and the rarest being green) that sets the color to be bid on for that tile.  So, once a player has placed a bid using blue meeples, the only other choice to outbid that opponent is by using a greater number of blue meeples.  This means that the game has four unique currencies being used and manipulated by players during the auction and when placing workers.  During the auction, you can also play on a tile within the auction by putting your meeple onto a tile that hasn't been played on or by playing the same "set" color onto an already used or bid for tile.  

Another brilliant aspect to the design is that while the auction is taking place, you can use your turn not only to bid for a tile to add to your village at the end of the round or play on one of the tiles in the auction, but you can also play onto tiles in your village and your opponents village that have been obtained in previous rounds.  Sometimes getting a new tile to add to your village comes secondary to being able to use the tile action spots in your or your opponent's village.  Many of these provide valuable resources  and abilities such as skill tiles, meeples, goods, or the chance to transport goods to locations and possibly upgrade the tiles within your village.  You may want to transport goods onto other tiles so that you can upgrade the tile for a more powerful action spot and/or to get endgame points. However, when you transport your goods you must follow the layout of the roads on the tiles and can only move them as far as the action points allow you to send them.  

Another strong aspect of the game is the balance between strategy and tactics.  At the beginning of the game you are given a number of winter tiles that give you a set of strategic end game goals to pursue.  Sometimes you will focus on one and sometimes you will focus on several.  When winter comes, you will be forced to play at least one tile from your hand but can play all of them.  Other players are doing the same thing.  The more you play the game, the more you see during the game the possible strategies your opponents are pursuing and can effect the strategy they are going for.  It is never a good idea to let any player get particularly strong in any specific resource because you know they are likely going for an end game strategy that stems from that resource.  After winter tiles have been placed, players will bid in this season as usual.  Winter is very cutthroat and it is important to try to obtain start player going into winter and have a strong meeple advantage so that you can obtain the tile(s) you want.  

All in all, this is the best game ever designed.  The balance of strategy and tactics and the high level of control in the game lead to a satisfying experience where you feel like you have built a grand village and have exploited other neighboring villages to victory.  I haven't gotten into all of the aspects of the game (summer boats, start player acquisition, end of round boats, and more) but I can definitively state that all of the additional aspects that I haven't talked about only help to reinforce and enrich the incredible design that is Keyflower.

The bidding for tiles, laying of tiles and their activation are the key mechanics and highlights of this board game. The random starting home tiles and tiles of each season, particularly spring, could lead to some imbalanced starting positions, e.g. a particular resource becoming extremely scarce. 

The game feels reasonably scalable. Downtime does not feel excessive, and may only be a slight issue with many players.

The icons do get in the way of the fine artwork of the game, which is a pity. The screens, whilst nicely drawn, are a little flimsy.

Muy vistoso, de los pocos juegos en los que me gusta la interacción, siempre que lo juego se me hace cortísimo.

worker placement, bidding, resource management, tile laying and a variety of actions and abilities make this a damn near perfect game for my tastes... it gets a -0.5 for a bit of fiddly-ness...

Keyflower is a great eurogame about building the best settlements in a new land. It feels very different. I love the bidding system that uses workers, and building your village is also interesting, this is a winner for sure. I look forward to more plays.

My only point of criticism, early in my exploration of the game, is the random nature of the the seasonal tiles, and how they match up to the secret Winter tiles. It's rather difficult to stop someone from scoring a ton of bonus points during the Winter, while also trying to score points yourself. I'll have to see how that shakes out over more plays. Strangely enough, I think that the Farmers, and Merchants expansion, and the even larger variance which they provide, ease my fears. The game feels complete with those two expansions included.

Keyflower does Euro stuff and it does it well.  The way meeples are used as unique currencies and activation pieces is really neat and drives a lot of the blocking and decision making in the game... but building your own little village and planning your moves to upgrade your tiles for points and better abilities is a lot of fun too.  

That being said I was surprised how thinky the game was and I would hate to play with a lot of AP prone players... and I found scoring to be more of a chore than I expected it would be (maybe its just hard with everyone around the table counting out loud at the same time! :laugh: ).  I might have to download the score sheet...  Regardless I'm looking forward to exploring this some more and could see my rating rising as the choices start feeling a little more second nature.

Key Harvest managed to become January’s GotM. We wrote that it was the best game in the ‘Key’-series we played until then. Well, that was no lie, but it was also just the 2nd game we played in the series. But with the love for Keythedral and the even better experience with Key Harvest, we became very curious to Keyflower. Especially after receiving an email about the fact that this is a great game. After receiving that mail, we started looking for a nice deal on the game. Just a couple of weeks later, we found an second-handed copy of the game, that was only played once, for half the price it is new. We knew the seller, and we trust him blind. Made the deal and one day later, we are reading the rules of the game. I remember that the rule-set of the other two games in this series were very difficult to read. I believed that was because of the poor translation to Dutch. Now we had the original English version of the game. And indeed, the rules weren’t too hard to understand. This one seemed really like fun. Started playing the game, and the game just flows very naturally, and turned out to be very simple to play. But there are some hard decisions to make during playing. The unique auction system is working even with two, what is great, because most of the times, auctions just don’t work with two players. Minor thing. When playing with just two players, a lot in the game can be calculated. But still, this is a great game, and the best game we’ve played in the ‘Key’-series to date.

Interesting mechanics. Thought we were playing wrong at first. First two rounds went by so fast. Got really tight at scoring. Liked it a lot.

Amongst the best of Breese's games.  Very solid worker placement game.  There is a lot going on in this game - probably will take several plays to really appreciate all the possibly ways to score.

Mixed feelings about this one. Great game but it tends to play up and down for me. Sometimes there's interesting bidding and tough calls to make; other times it can seem like you're just working away in your own village. I don't mind multiplayer solitaire but this game shines when it does more.

Such interesting and unusual mechanisms that underly the very accessible interface:  "Bid" some keyples here to use this action; "bid" some keyples there to try to acquire the action space, which can allow you to collect the other players'… keyples!  The influx of keyples slows to a trickle by the winter, the fourth and final season, so luring other players' keyples to your town is crucial to keeping your supply of actions high for next season!  Wads of replay value in this, due to some reversible tiles, and not using all tiles (except in a 6p game — yes, 6p).

Enjoyed this game a lot! The complexity is really just in the different tiles and what they do. Otherwise the gameplay is pretty straightforward.

Excellent base game. Careful about the 'lost in translation' rules for the Key Celeste promo tile. AVOID the Merchants expansion. Haven't played the Farmers Expansion yet.

This game blends quite a bit of different mechanics from many other games into one really great mix. This game works great at all player numbers (2-6), and is always changing on what you can do. It's also as interactive or passive as you want it to be, in terms of fighting other players. The game goes by quickly too, which can be considered a good thing, but the length doesn't effect the strategic depth at all. I really love this game, it's awesome!

Good game, rating was after just one play. Easy to play and the way you use your meeples to obtain actions and bid for tiles is a great mechanic. My only downside was the duration, and the fact it is a bit like many other games, in the way you build up resources and churn through their conversion to something else.

Fantastic, high-interaction, hybrid euro with delicious decisions and complexity. Excellent for 2 players. 
Not too long to play either. Beautiful.

The bidding concept and implementation is just average; what really shines in the connecting creation of towns and the transport of resources for upgrades & scoring. Without the latter, this game would be nothing. With it, it's a really enjoyable, strategic experience.

This game is really great.  I particularly enjoy the way the color-oriented bidding and worker placement work.

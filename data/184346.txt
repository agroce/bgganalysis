In a two player game we usually find ourselves caught between choosing a lower scoring card or purposely picking the same card as the other player, negating points for everybody. Too much direct player conflict for too little reward.

I've backed the game, and have made the premium PnP version.  This game is a great filler, with plenty of strategy.  What also makes it great is that my kids, who have no real grasp of strategy, can enjoy collecting the donuts, and inadvertently foil the plans of us regular gamers.  Even my wife will play, which pretty much earns this game a 9 for that fact alone.  :)

Definitely get the feeling of Sushi Go in playing this one even if the drafting is a bit different. Instead of pass drafting you are simultaneously choosing a card in a column. If you are the only one to play that column number you get the card otherwise it is discarded. As a kids game that I can play with my 6 year old and my 3 year old who does fairly well at picking the highest number it's great and better for them than Sushi Go (theme and slightly easier rules). I do wish we could vary the cards at lower player counts, but otherwise it works for us as a family game although with gamers I would always play Sushi Go instead just for the variability and tougher decisions.

PnP, feels like Sushi Go but more frantic, if such a thing exists. I'm not sure about the negative point donuts, but we'll see. Just after writing the previous, I saw the review saying that this should not be mistaken as Sushi Go with a different theme. Granted, there's so many more card types. I appreciate this.

Rating reserved until I play it with more than 2P, where it becomes an exercise in predictability.

Sort of like Sushi Go! but with simultaneous selection rather than drafting.  If multiple people pick the same donut, they get nothing.  That's somewhat more annoying than drafting.   Not sure there is much strategy here that you can depend on, but the game is quick and works okay in a family setting as long as people aren't too easily frustrated.

[b]Rating based on - 3 plays (3 rounds each), 2 player[/b]
A kind of drafting game in which you try to get the most points by collecting donuts. Some donuts give you benefits while others give you straight up points. The game has adorable art and quick playtime (5 mins per game as there are only 35 cards for 2 players) but to be honest, there is not a lot there really and it's kinda 'meh' with just 2 – I didn't feel any particular kind of tension or excitement playing, probably better with more players.  

Also, my pet peeve is games that have separate components for different player counts and this has separate cards for the 3, 4, 5 player count etc. It sucks that some of the cooler cards with the better art (Bear Claw, Old Fashioned, Cinnamon Twist and Red Velvet (mmmm) etc.) will never get used unless we play with almost the full complement of players and I get stuck with the weird looking Mucho Matcha card :gulp: No doubt it's there to balance the game and play length but it still irks me and the games I've experienced that do this seem to have that 'meh' feeling at 2 ([thing=31260][/thing], [thing=142326][/thing]). The fact that the Mucho Matcha card is at the same ratio in a 2 player game as in a 6 player game concerns me. Nobody wanted to take it and give up their cards so these 2 cards are clogging up the donut display and we both just kept picking the other number for the rest of the game. That seemed a bit silly. From our second game I modified the game slightly to see if it would work better for us since our first tries didn't go that great. We placed 4 donuts out in a row and used 4 selection cards instead of 3. I thought it made the game more tense and less obvious because you were really not sure which donuts the other person was going for and you wanted to time it to get the most points. My gaming company still finds it boring though so unfortunately it has to go.

My rating reflects a player count of 2 or 3. The game starts to get iffy at 4 players since the kids went several rounds without getting donuts.  Still they didn't seem to mind and said they loved the game. Haven't played with 5 or 6 players.  

Overall, the game is very fun and my favorite light card game at the moment.

Very very similar to Sushi Go yet I think this game is an improvement on it. The way the cards are acquired is definitely better than Sushi Go's card drafting. This game was "ok" as a two player but I think it would shine with more than two players. The artwork is very cute and fun and the layout is clear and easy to understand. One thing I would change is the special ability cards should have more differentiation (not just little stars) to set them apart when they are on the table. I look forward to playing this one with a larger group.

Worth playing in a fun situation. There will be a lot of grabbing the same donut, and if you're easily frustrated by not getting 40% of what you want, you'll be frustrated. But if you're just playing to have a fun time, then you can have some fun with it. And, obviously, then you get to look at the adorable donut art! Great job on that!

Cute filler. Secretly pick which card you want from a number laid on the table. If you're the only one who picks that card, you get it. If multiple people pick the same card, it's discarded. Some cards are worth points straight up,. Some are worth different points depending on how many of them you have. Also, some of the cards do things when you claim them, either instead or in addition to points. Most points after you've gone through the deck wins.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Cute art but this is straight up family fare. There is some nasty take that in this sweet looking game which is a bit jarring. Some comparisons to Sushi Go, but this one is more swingy with different action cards creating havoc and chaos. I don't have much desire to play again.

[b]Go Nuts for Donuts[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to play Go Nuts for Donuts, but I had missed out on the Kickstarter. Once I heard Gamewright picked up publishing rights I decided to wait till it came out in stores to pick it up. Fortunately I got to play this a buddy's house and came to realize that it isn't nearly as much fun as I thought it'd be. 

Comparisons will be made to Sushi Go/Sushi Go Party and while they are warranted there are some big differences between the two games. The similarities are the cute theme/art work [i](I actually prefer the art in Sushi Go)[/i], both are very light gateway games and in each game you are collecting sets of cards that will score points in a variety of ways. 

On to the differences; while Sushi Go Party is a standard draft format in GNfD each person has a set of bidding cards. The bidding cards correspond to the numbered tiles set up on the table. Each round every numbered tile gets a donut card placed under it. Each player then selects a numbered selection card from their hand, then those cards are revealed simultaneously in the row. If you are the only person to play that number you take the donut card associated with that number; if multiple people play the same number you discard the donut card and folks that played that card get nothing! 

During our 5p game there were a lot of cards discarded; one person ended the game with 6 cards to her name [i](the highest total was 14)[/i]. There is potentially some strategy to choosing your bidding card, except the donut card abilities are sometimes useless so no one wants to select them which therefore narrows the pool of cards you can choose from. The different card powers are where this game falls apart for me, they just aren't anywhere near as interesting as Sushi Go Party.

I'd also argue that Go Nuts for Donuts is probably the more difficult game to teach as well, which for me is the final nail in the coffin. When considering how light both Go Nuts for Donuts and Sushi Go are, Sushi Go manages to have much more variety in card abilities and more depth to the decisions. I also much prefer the card draft in Sushi Go. I do think a lot of folks will be attracted to game because of the theme and artwork, so Gamewright probably has another hit on their hands. And while I would play again it's no longer a game I am interested in adding to to our collection.[/i]

Cute art work. The idea of collecting sets of donuts are fine. The mechanic of simultaneous selection of the group of donuts with matching selections to be discordant. Yes you can block strategically, but more often it is just a bad guess. For what is a light family game it has some vicious undercurrents where you force negative points to opponents. Not a bad game but not one I want to pull out. Other games do set collections much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The artwork is cute and the idea of collecting donuts is fun. Too bad that the gameplay is pretty meh. This is another game where I'm somewhat convinced that a dummy player randomly selecting a card each round would probably win more often than it really should. The strategy and tactics in this game mostly come from trying to outguess your opponents and the winner wil be whomever gets the most lucky in this regard. Given this is mostly a speedy silly game that's not all bad, and you can somewhat predict what people will want for a donut, it's not a game I'd want to play very often.

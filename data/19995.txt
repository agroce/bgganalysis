Well I'm naturally going to like this because it's similarities with Age of Steam are obvious although it reminded me more of Voldampf than Wallace's later effort. Very engrossing and by far and away the best production of a Ragnar game to date - it would have helped if they'd found some way to indicate on the board which canals were currently available though

Did not care for this one.  I hated only being able to make connections that i had contracts for, despite needing to make long deliveries for VPs.  randomness of the contracts coming out was annoying.  I think with a few house rules, it wouldn't be too bad, but I wasn't crazy about it anyway.

Canal Mania is wonderful. I did quite terribly during my first play through but loved it the whole way through. The mechanics are indeed reminiscent of Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam, but I don't feel that the game is derivative at all. It's one (like AoS) where new things become apparent each time I play. I'm really glad I went ahead and ordered this one. UPDATE: still holding strong... it helps that I'm winning now too! This might end up being a nine. UPDATE: It's a nine!

First impressions: this is an impressive design with high production values - up to 2006 german standards rather than Ragnar clothmap trademark. The game turns are quick and so the play flows well, with plenty of options and (pleasingly) after one game you can see what you did right and wrong. The game feels (and looks) like a cross between Railway Rivals, Lancashire Rails and Stephenson's Rocket, but has its own personality. 

Multiple games later, the game play is smooth and clear: there are short term goals, butpossibly fewer long term goals and how your opponents cooperate or not with you has some bearing on your final points score. Very enjoyable game.

An eminently playable game with a familiar build routes and transport goods theme.  As everyone says, it has the feel of a lighter, more forgiving Age of Steam.  The reason I'm not jumping to play Canal Mania again is the contracts, which make each game develop along similar lines and add an element of randomness that precludes strategic planning.  The lack of interaction is also a negative for me.

Rating based on a teaching game where owner of the game insisted that play order never changed throughout the game.  Although I know that this is not the case, I still would prefer to never play it again but I could be convinced to give it a second chance.  Playing last in every round put me at a distinct disadvantage and made my first and only game 2hrs of drudgery.  Had I not found that the owner had made this glaring mistake it could have rated as a 1 for me.  If I ever play it again I, of course, will revisit this rating and adjust it accordingly.  Becuase I like Age of Steam, I found more to dislike about Canal Mania than to like.  In this case, immitation is not flattery.  It's unlikely that my rating would ever crawl much above a 4 to 4.5

One play (5 players). Despite not absorbing all the rules due to sleep deprivation, I got to a point where I realized what everyone else had an hour before. This is a good, gamey game...though a bit Age Of Steam-ish.
It's well-balanced and  catching up with an early leader is definitely do-able.
End game was a total surprise for this first time.
We'll hope to be a bit more prepared next time it hits the table.
Cards could be more clearly designed ("Who's got the tunnel dude?")

Well, I wouldn't REFUSE to play it again....

More interesting than Ticket to Ride; much less interesting than Age of Steam.

Once you put goods markers onto cities/towns, very hard to locate contract positions. Little to no long-term strategy. Way too much luck; I specifically trolled the cards once to find a blue goods card.

Overall, had wanted to try and was QUITE disappointed, even though I won fairly handily.

The problem with this game is that I wish that it were Age of Steam.  I'm irritated by the randomness in the cards (both route and canal building).  This doesn't mean that this isn't a good game, in fact I think it is very good, but I find it a little too light.

Having played the second edition, I prefer the first, as every game of the second edition that I have seen ends with only half of the canals built.  Adding 10-20 points to the game end conditions should fix this.

This game gets compared to Age of Steam frequently, but that comparison is not really ideal. While the games apparently share many elements, the games feel very different.  In Age of Steam, you must determine your routes and which cities you are connecting.  In this, you complete pre-defined routes based on the available contracts.  The path you take is up to you (within a limit), but the end points aren't.  This seemingly small difference actually makes a big impact on the game play as it is harder to plan several turns ahead.  The remainder of the game also shares elements with Age of Steam, but always with a twist.  Cubes (i.e. resources) are moved along paths to score points, but here you count the points and not the connections.  Even the 'unique'  engineer cards play a role similar to the actions in age of steam.  The end result is that the game feels and plays lighter.

I *want* to like the game,  but after a few plays,  I reluctantly conclude that it is too long for the level of enjoyment.  Our last game (which I won) had a severe paucity of goods, so it really came down to building,  and there just isn't enough happening to warrant the near-2h investment.  That said,  there are several neat mechanisms,  and I could easily be persuaded to have a game in future.

Start player is red - what a brilliant was to save introducing a start player marker!  Worcester to Birmingham appeared very strong, although the owner, once the runaway leader, was pegged back into second.  Next time I will suggest we remove this route card.  The engineers reminded me of the postal officials in Thurn and Taxis.  The game felt like Stephenson's Rocket but played like Railroad Tycoon.  Like RT you are punished if you strike out alone and miss out on the jointly owned routes.  I don't feel the need to own both this and RT and RT came out first.  A welcome improvement on the Ragnar's normal production standards.

A kind of combination of "ticket to ride" and "age of steam". At the beginning I referred too much to age of steam and the differences between them, but after a while I discovered a new game. The only thing that has to be shown at the beginning of ( or during) the game is the map with all the contracts. Likely the designers could have shown these contracts with a small line on the playing board. But for the rest a good game.

Rating based on two 3-player games. It will probably rise with more games and perhaps more players. Replay guaranteed at the moment as I have yet to win!

I was looking for something with a deeper theme than TtR (which I love) and an additional mechanic. Marklin is too similar, AoS too heavy and RRT too big! Canal Mania is just right: yes it can take two hours but it never drags as there is so much going on.

RATING: 8.5
When someone who has played many many games barges through the door, clutching a box, with a smile as big as when they got sight of their first Scalectrix from Santa, it has to be something special. The appearance of a Ragnar [i]biggie[/i] certainly fits that bill.

p: The rules, and there are pleasantly few, seem to pitch it somewhere between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam, using (the good) elements of both. Promising.

So yes, it's a transport network construction game set in that familiar English landscape with hexagonal cities. It has route contracts, needs skilful hand management to max out the results of a limited amount of construction-cards, offers some goods that need to be ferried between towns for bonus points, has terrain types, and all this has to be crossed by using only 4 types of route-tiles. That can mean only one thing: it's about aqueducts and canals. Ah.

I feel there ought to be bonus points for players who manage to avoid using the words [i]track[/i] and [i]station[/i] for the duration of the game, but kudos to the Ragnar Brothers for picking a theme that actually fits the mechanisms really well, especially the relatively short route contracts.

Turns are split in three phases, and in each phase you can pick one of a handful of options. Roughly the choice is between construction and stocking up on building bricks for the next turn. Each player also has an engineer which offers a unique special ability, but these are frequently swapped between players right before constructing and are easily retrieved.

I am amazed that a game that offers very few new elements appealed to me as much as it did. It seemingly did more by making them all a bit simpler. A hallmark of superb design. Everything seems to be well balanced and play tested. From the hand-size capped at seven between turns, to the route-lengths, the tile-pool size, the requirement to alternate tile types, the scoring values, the spread of cities and terrain on the board, even to the arrival frequency of new goods to the map. It is so well balanced that you really need to squeeze every point out of your options to win the game, as it will be tightly fought all the way.

We did underestimate the importance of the end-game and in hindsight that only offers yet another palette of appetising strategic choices as placement and availability of goods for the final shipments across your track (whoops, I did it again) is crucial. And it is usually a sound decision to make small detours to cities 'en-route' as they will greatly increase your income during the goods-movement phase over the length of the game, something that becomes immediately apparent in your virgin-game, usually just after it's too late. And for the illiterate under us (ie. me), if you go from a to c via b, you head for b first. Yes, I'm that dippy. 

The whole thing wrapped up around the 2 hour mark, and this should speed up with replays. At no point did it drag and it kept everyone engaged. I strongly feel that good games use few elements to maximum effect and the best will distill games that offer a wide variety of strategies and options into one that is clear and remarkably easy to play with little downtime. The best indicator of class is if the game appeals to players with different expectations and demands [i]at the same time[/i]. A test it passed with flying colours.

Presentation wise, the only irritant I ran into was my inability to locate the cities on the board. Granted, I am as likely to put my finger on the location of English city on the map as I can be expected to find my way around Tokyo's public transport network, armed with a map in Arabic. But since most names are covered by goods or boats during the game it can be a real pain,  

The only mechanism I that sat uneasy with me was the ease with which engineers can be swapped right before the building phase. This timing means that anyone can obtain the engineer that suits their hand, losing mainly the ability to pick up from a new set of cards, but since you cannot pick up from this set and build in the same turn, that's hardly a handicap. It also means that the person lucky enough to pick up a joker track-card can more or less automatically make that a double joker card. And from what I have seen so far, it seemed that people building with this combo were cutting through the hills faster than planes can fly over them. Felt a bit heavy handed when most points had to be squeezed out of a drip-feeder.

On the whole though, a genuine gem. I really liked their [i]Viking Fury[/i] but felt it wasn't for everyone. This one is. And professionally produced too.

UPDATE: it is keeping its appeal afer a few replays, but as a 5-player game it is a bit too downtime-heavy for me. Then again, there aren't many games without a bidding or trading element, that I prefer with 5 over 4 for that very reason.

First impressions are that this is a great game. The two hours flew by. Plenty of interesting decisions about which routes to commit to - whether to go for lots of small routes or fewer long ones - whether to ship a cube now for a small payback or wait and hope you can connect a longer route first (and that another player won't steal it). The tight hand limit of 7 cards keeps the cards flowing - no hoarding a la Ticket to Ride thank goodness. Nothing completely original but definitely more than the sum of its parts.

1 play.  Interesting game reminiscent of Age of Steam (including the game length of around 2.5 hours), but it feels less harsh (no mountain of debt from turn #1).  My biggest beef with the game is that the canal connections are all predetermined (and historically accurate, I suspect) so you really need to study the map in the rulebook that tells you which canals are dead ends (single routes between 2 cities).  The game presents tough and interesting decisions regarding which type of canal segment to build and when to take on new contracts (versus keeping an open slot for the next deal of contracts).  I'm not ready to rush out and buy Canal Mania, but I'd definitely play it again.

RATING: 6
After playing it for the first time I felt a little dissatisfied.  I know it had a small print run but I feel there are elements of the game that could make it very good but were overlooked - the Engineers cards being awapped seemed ungainly, the Surveyors 'wild cards' were unbalancing, the generic colour-coded good placement and delivery seemed underdeveloped.  Of course I lost, even though I built the most canals.  I was so eager to place canals anywhere (and non-contiguously) that the benefit of moving goods was lost on me until too late.

Did not appreciate the board design.  I know it shouldn't be a beauty contest but it was dull and seemed to me to be underdeveloped.  Hated the score track too which wanders around the perimeter of the board but not in any recognisable way and it's too small for the scoring boats.

RATING: 8
First Edition :Shine has come off this one, I dislike the random contracts, this mechanic means you can't really make any long-term plans, just react to whats available right now. That's okay for some games but in a transportation network game like this I'd rather have the ability to plan my routes from the start and then the challenge is implementing them. With Canal Mania if the right contract pops up at the right time you're looking good, if it doesn't you can fall behind and there isn't so much you can do. Obvious strategy is build in the middle of the map ... anywhere else is a lottery. 

Second Edition: (Actually I have the upgrade kit): Improvements to the game, really like the flexibility of the junction contracts & they way they work in a 2 player game, contract scoring makes more sense and the map has been improved game play wise (although I miss the graphics from the 1st). Overall, can't see me playing the 1st edition version again. Scores: 8 for 2nd, 5 for 1st. Bit too much downtime for 5 players as there's nothing much to do between turns, but 2-4 it's great.

As others have noted, mix of Ticket to Ride, Age of Steam/Railroad Tycoon, and Maharaja.  Nothing shockingly innovative, but nice enough.  Would like to play again soon to test out some thoughts from the first game -- always a good sign.   Update after at least a couple more games:  I enjoy it less each time I play.  There are some rather silly and counterintuitive rules (like not being able to re-use one segment of canal for two different tickets), and the downtime (especially with 4 or 5 players) is KILLER given that each player's turn takes an average of about a minute (and sometimes much longer) and there's nothing to do between your turns!

The contract mechanism is too random and too limiting.  You can't link your canals together if the appropriate contracts do not turn up - and you need to do that in order to get a decent score from goods movement.  It was probably OK in its day, but ten years later it just feels clunky.

RATING: 6
Ah, so close. I rather like the gameplay in the main for Canal Mania - it's sort of a favorable cross between Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride, getting good elements from both while *not* borrowing many of the problems. Acquire contracts to build specific routes, draft the cards to construct them, and deliver goods ... not only is it a nice mix, it feels more thematic than either of the games from which it borrows.

So why only a 6? The endgame sucks. You need to deliver goods, Age of Steam style. The problem is, unlike Age of Steam, you're going to end up reliably having to use other players' canals to make deliveries due to the chaotic way in which contracts are acquired, and becuase you can't build routes other than the ones for which you have contracts. So you have to choose who to give money to. This leads to two problems: a) the obvious one of potential kingmaking, and b) the less obvious one of getting bogged down in torturous forward-looking calculations to figure out who you can afford to give a few quid to and who you can't.

The endgame situation, combined with the fact that the game is just a bit on the long side, and the fact that the game is rather pricey in the US, is really unfortunate. I enjoyed the game, and will play again, but the difficulties in the endgame mean Canal Mania is never going to get "over the hump" to be played more than a few times around here, and won't justify its cost. It's a shame, because there is a lot of good stuff in there and it's a very nice design in general. And "fixing" the endgame might involve giving up stuff that makes the game work in the first place. But all this doesn't make the problem go away.

Folks have complained about the downtime, but I didn't find it that bad with 4, and with 3 it's not an issue. It's only incrementally worse than Ticket to Ride, with the caveat that it can definitely tempt some players into over-analysis. It's definitely not a minimal-downtime Knizia game, but as these things go, it's not too bad.

Last orthogonal comment: it's amusing to me that the names of the towns in this game seem so foreign. Your average Anglophone American, even one of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic extraction, will probably have better luck with Spanish, Italian, or French pronunciation than they will with many of the English names in this game. I'm an American, but a half-English one who lived smack in the middle of the Canal Mania game board for a time, and I am not sure on how to pronounce some of these names.

I definitely agree that this is an excellent TtR/Aos hybrid.  I enjoy the route building and goods shipping aspects of the game.  Routes are formed through managing your hand, and playing sets in order to connect cities up.

The special characters also add a neat element to the game, as all of them are very useful in different situations, and having the right one at the right time can be key.

Main downside is that there is quite a bit of downtime as you add more players.

Updated 7/18/10.

Having never played it with more than two players, Canal Mania peaks at a 7.  I've altered the rules so that my wife and I both start with two contracts that each share a terminal city with a contract of the other player.  That change has opened my wife up considerably to the idea of siphoning goods and competing for cities.  As a result, the game is pleasant, but not exactly spectacular.  It just feels like it's missing a little depth, a little calculation, and a little tension.  It's probably a low 7 on this rating scale as a two-player game, but it's definitely no longer a 6. 

Here's what I wrote previously:  

My first play of Canal Mania (2-player) was so unpleasant that I'm actually really taken aback that my second play (also 2-player) demonstrated so much potential.  

I’m a sucker for unusual games from small publishers, and this title had come very highly recommended from numerous users whose opinions I greatly respect. Usually billed a cross between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam, Canal Mania possessed neither the ease of the former nor the strategic potential of the latter.  While the bases for such lofty comparisons were evident in the game’s mechanics, the resulting mix was, at least initially, something less than the sum of its parts.  

My primary complaint with the game is in the implementation of the Government Contracts.  As in Ticket to Ride, players in Canal Mania are encouraged to complete particular routes for points by way of Government Contracts.   However, the Government Contracts are so essential the game, and the restrictions they impose so very nearly suffocating, that, ironically, the game feels a little too much like the hard labor that it simulates.  Players are limited to just two active contracts, which must be chosen from a randomly populated set of five that does not get refreshed until exhausted.   The contracts then dictate where players may build (tiles my only extend a route from one of the two termini on a player’s active contract), and how fast they may build (each contract mandates that the route be no more than one tile longer than absolutely necessarily).  This means that, while players have some choice in choosing contracts and in precisely how the routes get built, they have little control where it matters—reacting to the actions of other players, and making decisions that feed into or off of the gameplay choices available to others. 

Because the game employs a Steam-like pick-up-and-deliver system, in which players benefit both when using long routes of their own and also when opponents use their routes, making the range of available termini depend on a random draw from a very small subset of potential routes seems like a very poor design choice.  For at least the first half of our first game, we floundered with disjointed routes and arbitrary seeming builds.  Eventually, when contracts began to appear that shared a terminus with a pre-existing route, the choice to take it felt very nearly automated.  Only toward the end, when canals had spread across the board, did the joys of a route-building game—-notably, symbiotic and parasitic relationships, and true competition for goods—-emerge.  By that point, the game had languished for what felt like several hours (and what, in fact, turned out to be 2.5). 

I'm not sure whether the second play was just the product of a more fortuitous draw, or whether our better awareness of the game's systems allowed us to make more out of what was available, but this problem was much less pronounced.  While still far from perfect, the choices of  when to take contracts and which contracts to take actually seemed to be meaningful, especially in conjunction with the limited supply of each type of canal tile (toward the end of the game, several of the contracts were unfulfillable by the player in the lead, who had used all his difficult terrain tiles).  We also burned through the game in about 75 minutes.      

Canal Mania is a bit of an odd duck.  It has some real good ideas, and is actually well crafted for a small publisher game.  But it has some real awkwardness in some of the mechanics (I hesitate to call them flaws because two player is clearly not the game's best player count).  In the first game, this produced an uncomfortable, restrictive mess that was at once both fragile (a careless player must undo illegal builds) and obstinate.  And yet, in the second game, it was pleasantly laborious--tense, but light, and, at times, even charming.  In light of the small publisher designation, Canal Mania could easily be embraced as a quirky fun if the gameplay produces the type of experiences that the second game seemed to promise.  But I don't know if that's really possible or simply a mirage.  Only more plays (preferably with a higher player count) will tell.

RATING: 4
[7/11/2007] While the game does contain a number of interesting ideas, the entire experience is marred by the overly restrictive nature of the building contracts. This may not have been that problematic were the players able to compete directly for a desirable contract. But no, it's entirely down to turn order. As a result you feel straightjacketed and possibly quite frustrated.

Every turn is also pretty much the same as the preceding one. Not much of a real story arc here. Quite frankly, I see no reason to play this one with Age of Steam, Ticket to Ride etc. being on the market.

Only played once but it seems like a good mid-level pickup and delivery game (it's no Age of Steam though). A lot better than Thurn and Taxis or any of the Ticket to Rides from what I hear but I've always liked Hell Rail for my mid-level pickup-delivery fix. I need to play it again before I can decide which one I still prefer.

A fine example of a type of game I'd rather avoid.  At core this comes down to arranging one's play so that you are marginally more likely to benefit from luck than the other players.  The victor is then the one who accrued more random marginal advantages over the course of the game than the other players.  I'm sure that some people like that sort of thing, but I'm not one of them.  There's certainly quite a lot to like in the game, there's just not much to like very much and certainly very little to get excited about.

1st Edition

Canal Mania is a game that has a lot of good ideas, and some bad ones, and the end result is a rather unimpressive package.

First, the good. I like the card play system and the way that it generates goods growth. This is a well thought out concept. The card play is somewhat similar to UP, but slightly more important because getting certain cards can be more difficult. The special power cards are something like Maharaja (which I am not at all a fan of) because they move around the table constantly (Send me Smeaton! I require some expertise!) but much better in this game because the movement of them is not a huge, game breaking thing and they actually allow you to decrease the amount that the "track" deck can screw you at any given time by letting you build things cheaper or to rebuild your hand faster.

Now, the bad. The biggest problem I have is the way that the canal building of players is restricted by the contract cards. I know this is a huge historical flavour aspect of the game, and that is what the designers are going for, but I really disliked it, and it is the main reason why this game is losing big points for me. Because of the way the game is put together, getting the right contract cards is absolutely critical. They dictate where you can lay canals, and because of the goods growth mechanism, where cities get goods first, let me tell you now that getting connections to the major city in each colour is a huge thing. The problem is that because fo the contract system, you cannot simply choose to build to the major cities, instead you have to hope that a card that links in there is available and that no one else is taking it in front of you. On top of that, you need to hope that it actually links into your system. The problem here is that a big, interconnected system, like in all (faux) rail games, is extremely important here, but being able to build one is not really up to the players. They can position themselves to hopefully build a solid set of connections, but they can still end up being hosed due to player order or the way the cards come out. What this means is that the player who has the right contracts flip at the right time is going to be in very good shape simply because of that, and will be able to make 4, 5, or even 6 link deliveries solo, consistently, and is probably going to gaudily cremate the other players.

Other, more minor issues: the board is too big, and probably should be cut in half. There simply wasn't enough route competition between the players in most spots on the board. Also, the graphical design. I know that it would kill the flavour, but for those of us who aren't British, having the cities be simply labelled with letters of the alphabet would make the game play MUCH more smoothly. Having to find all of the cities shown on the contracts when they flip up is a time sink, and it means that goods have to be kept off the cities slightly so you can read them, and generally just adds up to being a pain in the butt. One other, final thing: the game still is about 1.5 hours to play. I would rather just take the extra 30 minutes to play Age of Steam, which this game reminds me of.

Basically: if you redesign the board by cutting it in half and remove the contract cards (or at least make them bonus points ala Ticket to Ride instead of canal building dictators) you would be left with a decent and fairly cut throat rail game style filler that I wouldn't mind playing once in a while. What exists currently is a game that has a lot of neat ideas, but chokes to death on the elements that restrict player choice in favour of increased historical flavour and which I don't particularly care for.

As many have said, Canal mania is a train game in disguise and it most closely resembles Volldampf (which is another cracking good game). 

Players are charged with building the canal system in industrial era England. This is done by selecting up to two Contract Cards that dictate routes from on City or Town to another. Players draw Build Cards at the beginning of each turn that are used to lay track sections. There are four types of track sections, that the player must alternate between when building a canal. This system of alternating tiles is a perfect mechanism to match that of the way canals are actually built. Once a canal is completed, the owning player scores based on which types of canal tiles were used and any player can then score by moving Goods using the canal (as long as the final section traveled is owned by the player moving the goods). There are also Engineer Cards, that are similar to those used in Railroad Tycoon or Volldampf, although they can change hands on any turn.

There are plenty of interesting decisions to make in this game and I think it will hold up very well to repeated plays. The production is different from that of the normal Ragnar Brothers games and is more in line with what people have come to expect (although I find the tea towel maps to have a certain charm, personally). Stacking tracks is somewhat clunky and the green scoring track could have been toned down a bit, but the graphic design is good, for the most part. There are a couple minor rules ambiguities, but no real dealbreakers and for new players, I think it is easier to learn than Age of Steam.

Rating may go up as we got an important rule wrong (we were only putting 1 new goods cube on the board instead of 2 each time).  It does seem like someone can get a synegistic set of contracts and the other players can do little about it.  Definitely want to try again, as it was fun, and there were some subtle, clever little touches that weren't apparent at first.

Players represent canal constructors during industrial revolution England.  Players claim contracts from Parliament and lay canal tiles between towns via drafting/playing of building cards.  Canal tiles come in four types, and no type can be identical to an adjacent type (very clever).  Once towns are connected, Age of Steam like goods cubes can be run over the canal network.  Points are earned for canal infrastructure, goods shipment, and completed contracts, most wins the game.  This game feels very similar to many other train games, and different at the same time.  Turns are quick via the phase one, two, three action system, game play and balance are excellent, components are functional (cards are very thin).  This one is going to be a hit.  Second edition - minor changes (dropped the contract bonus, included junction contracts, etc, still excellent).

Has all of the elements of Age Of Steam minus the economy.   It has the cube delivery, colored cities (which work a little differently), the network building, special roles, but instead of auctions/economy, the game is driven by "track" cards that are a little like TTR or Union Pacific.   I think I like it better than Age Of Steam since it doesn't have quite the instability that AoS has.  The AP elements are still there, and this game plays in roughly the same timeframe.

I can't remember the last time I was so excited when a new game came in the mail!  I loved History of the World and Viking Fury and have been looking forward to this one for quite some time.  Everything looks beautiful and professionally done.

 The game is challenging, well-balanced, and, as long as everyone does some planning in their downtime, will move at a brisk pace.  Quite enjoyable!  I would say it is in the same vein as Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride, and fits somewhere in between those two in weight, though much closer to AoS.

 My only gripes are that 1) I would like a reference card for each player; and 2) the cards seem pretty thin to me.

old style game. kind of in the empire builder genre. connect cities to earn VP's anddeliver goods for extra VPs. little player interaction, and nothing to do on the other players turns. best with fewer players as a result. The card to board hex ratio is negatively skewed; since 51 of the 75 cards are exclusively for plains hexes (and 8 of the remaining 24 are wild cards) and 201 plains hexes with 101 mountain hexes, yet mountain hexes require 2 or 3 cards to cross. Hence the players that draw mountain cards do better then those who don't. removing some of the plains cards may help?? . nearly a good game, maybe the ??3rd edition?? will improve it.

The Ragnar Brothers have again created a very playable game, but it will be your decision if you like an "Age of Steam" clone where you build canals instead of trains. The comparison with "Age of Steam" comes quickly as also here one tries to build as efficiently as possible and there are also little goods tokens that go on scoring journeys. But "Canal Mania" is much more forgiving than it's predecessor, but this comes at the price of less actual decision making and more feeling of "being played". But then it's an engrossing game with clean mechanics that will not disappoint gamers looking for another variant of hexagonal connection buildling games.

This game offers a medium-weight experience of the whole "build track/move goods" train genre which offers a reasonably nice play experience the first time through, but is not deep enough to merit repeated play. The fault of the game lies in the randomness of the way the contracts and goods come out. Among equally skilled players, it will come down to who happened to build at the right time and match up the goods with the destinations. Were there a way to directly interfere with each other, I'm quite sure the game would be much more interesting. Unfortunately, downtime is a problem since you can't plan your turn ahead as you don't know which cards will be available, so it could be a good 15 minutes between your turns. 

With some tweaks, this could be something unique and fill a niche between Ticket to Ride and Steam/Age of Steam as a quicker experience of this type. However as it is, it falls into the unsatisfying no man's land between the two. I traded it away and moved on to Steam/Age of Steam.

A good production for a low run, a nice enough game, but long, a tad over-complex and I have some quibbles. The actual game of building canals and moving goods is sound, and the winner will be the one building the best connections, since moving goods long routes gets you the most in the long run. The phases and choices are sound, drawing cards or build routes for example. But the whole business of swapping the Engineers around and understanding their actions could have been handled better. The Engineers are a good mechanism, but seem a little unbalanced. Simply putting them on the board and using player markers and some cost would have worked better. The contracts seemed okay, but maybe a better pattern would have helped too. I felt too much luck was here especially as the five face up contracts dwindled. If you finished one contract just as the best one came up next, you had easy choices. Perhaps some auction or other mechanism here might help, maybe just keeping it full to five contracts. The end game went on a bit too. Overall though, the game works  and with practise you may play well, but I think the strong get stronger and you can't seem to peg the leader back. Faced with unrelated contracts, you are simply going to lose. It's only a question of by how much.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Canal Mania sits in the uncomfortable space between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam but lacks the quick lightness of the former and the intense knife fights of the latter, thus falling short of either.

The game rewards building large, contiguous networks, but then restricts the routes players can actually build by using a number of fixed canal contracts. In addition the tableau where you can get new contracts is fairly static so if you manage to grab contracts that connect to each other that's huge, if you don't not so much.

The canals themselves are built drafting cards and again some are clearly better than others, and if you end up with a set of identically useless cards (which is not that unlikely) you simply waste your turn.

Finally, the competition for the goods cubes which is the primary source of victory points in the game is disappointingly boring. Goods are seeded when you draw special cards. If there aren't any or they are the wrong colour, again no points for you. In most cases, players place goods on the board and ship them away in the same turn, too, so there is hardly any fighting over what is on the board. It all depends on the cards that turn up.

9/13/06 - Received from Game Surplus. First game, September 25. This is a good one. Our first play convinced another player he had to buy it. I came in 3rd in a 4-player (Cris won), but I really liked it. Lots of tension, goods are very important, but so are completing more routes than others. I mistakenly thought the number on the route cards (contracts) counted for points, but it is the number of routes completed that counts. A learner's mistake.

Canal mania is a good connection building game lying somewhere between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam.  the card drafting to build routes gives it a familiar feel to the former, while the goods shipping and tile placement are more akin to the latter.  With this said, Canal Mania does a wonderful job of being it's own game, offering up the engineer cards which in a way evoke memories of Thurn and Taxis' role selection, and turning all the said shared characteristics and mechanics into a fresh feeling game.  The components are wonderful for a small company, and being british born it's also nice to play on a map of the home land.  Initial scoring of an 7, but seems it could rise.

A lighter, streamlined version of Age of Steam, but with more theme.  This is one of those games where there is so much you want to do on your turn, but you can only take one action per phase, so there is plenty of angst.  I love how the goods work, since you really are torn as to what cards you want to pick up, and what goods may come onto the board as a result.  I would say that the board and the tiles could be just a tad larger as the board does get crowded.  For a small production run, the game looks quite good.  I am very much looking forward to giving this game another go.

RATING: 5
The game system is overwrought, and the prescription of the canal routes kills the game in the end.  There is almost no room for maneuver, little ability to plan ahead, and everything turns on the order of the contracts (and to a lesser extent the build cards).  Also, Canal Mania is one of those games with the feeling of doing exactly the same thing every turn - over and over and over until the end mercifully comes.  Two games and I'm done with Canal Mania.  I wouldn't ever choose to play this over the cleaner, more focused, more fun Ticket to Ride or the more strategic Age of Steam.

I am willing to play it again, but I don't see the interaction like in Age of Steam or Railroad Tycoon. Everybody does its thing and you are quite limited in what you can do. I played with players with analysis paralysis, which might detract my view on the game.

RATING: N/A
One play, five players, revised rules. As everyone says, Canal Mania is basically the love child of Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride. I liked it better than either of its parents, but I have two small caveats, which are that there was too much down time in our five-player game and that there is a hair too much luck considering how involved the game is.

RATING: 7.5
Rating after two 4player games. As I love Age of Steam, the concept of this game is comparable, some call it even a crossover between T2R and AoS, and therefore I like it too. I don't think 5 players are good as the board gets to crowded and downtime will rise. I found it strange that there were isolated city connections. Why are there no contracts to connect these to the network? While I have no problems with US or Europe maps, I had some troubles to find those small cities in England...

I got my first game of this played and really enjoyed it, even if it was with a sub-optimal two players.  The game play is fine with two, there's just less interaction than the designers want. It's the sort of game that has you thinking about it afterwards which is always a good sign.

RATING: 9
It's not a "railroad" game and those tiles are canals, not tracks... A nice blend of mechanisms that railroad game players will see have parallels from other games. It has some of Union Pacific in it (cards for type of build, etc.) and a bit of Ticket to Ride as well (contracts are more focused but like destinations in TtR). Least anyone think it is too simple, it definitely has part of Railroad Tycoon / Steam / Railways of ___. The goods movement in particular has a similar approach.

So, a good step along for someone looking to move from the UP & TtR fare up towards the RT / S / RoW designs.

I had heard a lot about this game from my various gaming contacts and finally got to play it. It is an interesting combination of mechanisms from several good games but definitley plays as a new game.

RATING: 3
I've only played this once, and I'm not likely to play it again.  With 4 players, it was rather chaotic -- hard to execute a strategy when other players moves can block you so easily.  And the rules were badly organized and hard to follow.

I can't believe the rules actually say that if you have already built a canal from one town to another as part of one project, you can't reuse that section of the canal for another project.  I mean, maybe it makes sense in real life, but it leads to a lot of redundant connections, and I prefer games that reward efficiency, because that means that you should *plan* carefully, and that means that you should develop a *strategy*.

Well, I didn't hate it. But it does borrow the uninteresting "draw lots of cards" mechanic from Ticket to Ride, which is not good. It takes the high luck factor of a game like that and puts a lot of complications on top of it, making it a lot of work for a game with so much luck. The town names are really difficult to read when you put a bunch of pieces on top of them, and since the names are so important, I wish they had been displayed better. Add a kingmaking problem and you've got a game I'm not really looking forward to playing again. (1 play)

 Definitely makes me think "TTR", but not as fast or streamlined, and with more consideration for Goods scoring, like Passengers in Marklin, or perhaps like a simplified version of Goods in AoS.
 In fact the strategies are probably much deeper- I'm giving it a 6.5 on a solo first play, but I could easily see it going higher if it vatches on or also falling just a little if it doesn't.
 The more deliberate feeling pace and some of the rules which fix issues arising in TTR need a bit more time for me to consider fully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good, solid game that is arguably a step-up from Ticket to Ride. Once one can get past the convoluted rules, there is actually a fairly meaty game here, with a similar feel to Cleopatra's Caboose. There are the engineer cards, which are similar to the role cards in CC, while the route cards selection is similar to TTR. Instead of destination cards, players select and try to complete up to two canal route contract cards, before moving on to the next contract. There is also goods cube delivery, a la Railroad Tycoon, but where having a discontinuous network may be more advantageous. This is because city/town bookend pairs are scored for every canal used for 2 VP, but only 1 VP for every intervening city/town. Thus, if a 3-link delivery is made, but another player's canal is used in between, they score 2 VP, while you score 4 VP. If you had owned all the canals, you would only score 3 VP.

The game seriously needs a player aid, and BGG user 'dumpty' has the best, as it clearly lays out the interesting decisions one must make each turn. You could exchange engineers for different turn advantages, but then you couldn't select a new contract or purge the current route card selections. You could then either select cards, or build routes, but not both as in TTR. You could then deliver a goods cube. If you could not do any one of these actions, you can always pull a blind route card. However, unlike TTR, there is a hand limit of seven.

Players can play as many route cards as they want, to connect two cities/towns specified in one of their contracts. However, instead of a single kind of canal (or track in TTR), there are four kinds: stretches, locks, aqueducts, and tunnels. The latter three score progressively more points as they are placed, but they are also harder to play, as collecting the cards for them is difficult, much like building tunnels in TTR:Europe. All in all, a fun game, most likely to see the table again real soon. Initial rating an '8'.

Update (03/02/12) 2 plays: It's been over a year since the first play, and this time on my own copy. Some of the rules were not clear and mistakes were made; we had to restart the game on the third turn. While the mechanics are straightforward, there are a number of subtle rules that make the game feel clunky. Once past that, the turns are quick with little downtime. Five "build" cards are laid out in a similar fashion to Thurn & Taxis, where three are chosen by the player OR the player builds routes playing the "build" cards. Again, custom player aids are an absolute must, as the decision flow tree can be convoluted; the ones that come with the game are hard to read and not graphical. Deliveries seem to be the key, and establishing a long series of links can be very profitable. Some city-town pairs never become part of the larger canal network, but that is probably what the junction contracts are for to make larger loops. As before, this is a challenging game, with many interesting choices. There is a flow to the game, initially picking up a contract(s), collecting build cards, building track, and then delivering goods along such track. Along with trying to form longer, continuous networks, there are longer term strategic-type considerations. On the other hand, there seem to be few tactical considerations and little interaction similar to Thurn & Taxis, except for stealing goods. Still, there's plenty to do here. This continues to be a solid '8'.

I used to feel this game was superb I have come to find more flaws, It is dry and never gets out in my group - mission cards, pick up & delivery. It has similar aspects to age of steam in connecting cities and moving goods along these (and opponents) tracks to score victory points but the game is structured differently. instead of trying to avoid debt or buying shares canal mania has players choose one action from each of three sections. Players must choose to collect cards before they can build but need to build in order to ship. usuall dilemas. Some analysis paralysis as a result, I hope we play faster when we become more experienced maniacs.

I've lowered this games rating after a few plays, some faults, routes and tactics that spoil the game have been spotted, but these are in the process of being tweaked by the Brothers themselves - looking forward to the new release.

First played October 9th, 2008. Taught in 20min, played in about 2 hours with 4 players. This has good luck/strategy balance. It reminded me of Stephen's Rocket rethemed and another player suggested it was like Railroad Tycoon. Each player is given a special engineer(each of the 5 have a special ability), two boats (to show canal starts) and a special contract route to join any two cities for 2 points, some tiles(regular, rail, aquduct, and tunnel). On your turn you have three phases. 1) obtain a contract/route card(may take two if it's the last two; when you complete the route you score pts specified, must take more hexes than specified value), swap your engineer with another player or one out of the game, clear route cards, or draw a route card face down(may play goods if it has an icon on it). 2) draw 3 route cards from the 5 shown face up(place goods in cities if you take a card with an icon on it; must be placed in cities that can ship first), build a route(and score if you complete) or draw a face down route card. 3) ship a good scoring 1 pt for each of your cities connected it travels between; must end on your line or draw a face down card. End of game is triggered when you reach specified points for players and then two more rounds are completed. This has some great mechanics for strategy and is recommended as a gameplay especially if you know someone who has it.

Its definitely got downtime issues with the full complement of players.  But it does scale to fewer players better than AoS.  The folks doing the components should have also remembered that Americans know nothing about geography, and English geography may as well be Mongolian (its not like Belgium, which we all know from wargames).  So, the components could be a bit more functional.  Still, like many Ragnar Brother designs, it is a diamond in the rough.  I will be tracking it down.

Not a bad game, but it didn't inspire me..
Just a bit too much of randoness and there is a strong syndrome of kingmaking.  I rarely complain about the latter so that might be the real issue here..

This game, at its heart, resembles Railroad Tycoon the most (sending wares through your links between cities).  Of course there is much more to it (like gaining VP for only building tracks err.. canals, engineers with special abilities, building tracks based on cards etc.), but I have a feeling 'been there, done that'.

I like it a lot!  It feels a little like Age of Steam and a little like Ticket to Ride. Though I've had to bump down my rating a bit now that I better understand the good movement; its just doesn't make any damn sense they way it's written!!! 

The one big problem with the game is downtime. I really can't understand why it's so bad since what you do on your turn isn't greatly effected by what others do. But trust me, it can be a problem.

Enjoyable game, but there's a lot to be said for the timing of what contract cards are available when your turn comes up.  If you don't get contracts that allow additons to existing canals you own, then you just aren't going to be able to accumulate many points for goods shipment.   There's some opportunity for king-making during the final goods reduction as well.   Still enjoyable, but out play time for the first game with 3 players was over 3 hours.  If you could really finish the game in the posted 90 minutes, I think that would be a benefit.

First impression: Kind of fun. Despite similarities to the Age of Steam-like games, CM plays and feels very differently, and one has to unlearn a lot of "AoS-think" to grasp this.

As Chris Farrell pointed out, the final delivery of goods seems strange, and in our game the endgame was more about delivering cubes situated in the middle of the other players' networks (spliting the profits evenly), rather than letting the opponent deliver them for himself. The whole process felt strange, like one was trying to "steal" goods from others.

I would like to try it again, though. There is a lot to like.

First play was a 5-player, and just a miserable experience as I made the mistake of building too close to the player on my right.  Way too much downtime as well.

Edit:  reevaluated after another play.  It's still no Age of Steam, and I'd probably always rather play Age of Steam or RRT, but this is not a bad game and I'd gladly play it again.

Worth trying again, but there's just not that much space for Canal Mania given the other, better games out there.  Now that Brass is out, I'm pretty certain this isn't even the best game about the golden age of English canal building.

After one play... here's my first impression:I like the game.  Not a lot, but I like the game.  I doubt that my rating, however, will ever get past the 6-7 level.  It seems to have just the right amount of luck (in the draw of the contracts) to keep everyone fairly close in scoring.  The action selection phases seem to be well thought out and give each player some hard choices each and every turn.Why I won't rate it higher... fiddly bits (hexes are much too small), confusing and restrictive building rules (if I already have a canal built between to areas... why should a card force me to build it again?!?), the build card mix seems to be somewhat out of whack (there are too many straights and not enough special cards), and the hierarchy for laying out goods cubes is confusing and not very logical.I'll take Voldampf or Railroad Tycoon over this game in an instant.  Needs a few 'house rules'.

I've really enjoyed my playings of this game. Some call it derivative, and it is, but it does what it does well. The drawing of cards to not only give you build cards that you need but also to allow you to seed the board with goods is a great idea that makes for some interesting choices. I also like that players when shipping must have goods go through their own canal last. Well done.

RATING: 6
A game I revisited many years after my initial play. It's not a bad game, but for this train game veteran, it doesn't have a lot to offer. The game feels unnecessarily finicky to me in the building rules and the goods distribution and choices are too limited by card draws. You are limited to filling contracts on your builds and you can only ever have two of them and you simply hope that you can get two that are complementary enough to give you decent delivery options. I like to have more control in my train games. Other than that personal preference, the game is fine.

Really good game. The only negative I have found is the cardstock (or maybe that should be paperstock) used for the cards, they are extremely flimsy, so factor in the cost of sleeves when buying the game. That said though, it is in no way a dealbreaker.

Canal Mania's pacing is off. It plays as long and is causing as much AP as Age of Steam, but the depth of decisions is on a middle ground between AoS and Ticket to Ride. Either one will be the choice in most instances. Canal Mania would be for the occasion when you're looking for a longer but not to brutal route building fix and don't mind a noticeable luck factor. For winning you need to get connected canals starting from the main cities early on and the best you can do is setting up a position that increases your chances of getting lucky.

All the comparisons to Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride are inevitable, because of the contracts (think TtR's Destination Tickets), card drafting, track laying (like AoS or Stephenson's Rocket), goods cube shipment (like AoS), and even a little bit of Thurn & Taxis (the engineer special privileges, which, even though they might not seem like it, are really open to everyone).  You do have to put a bit of thought (a little more than in TtR) into the cards you put in your hand, especially regarding the goods cubes and where they will be placed.  The rules are relatively simple, but once you start playing it ends up becoming much more interesting than one expects.  You really have to plan your moves carefully (well, as carefully as the predetermined Contract cards allow) to set up a good shipping network.

My unfamiliarity with English geography is a small annoyance (especially since the hexes are often covered with cubes or barges), but I greatly enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it more.  I suppose that if I was even marginally familiar with the English canal system or its history, it would be even better.  Also - let's face it, it's hard to play and remember you're laying down canals and not track - it's impossible to not think you're playing a train game.  I've played with 3 players, and it seem that the map would be a little tighter with 4.  Seems like there may be too much downtime with 5 players, but I'd like to try it out and see.  

Traded away.

RATING: 7.5
I would say that this game feels more AoS than anything else. Players are rushing to complete routes by picking-up and playing canal cards. In comparison to AoS, theres a lot less interaction so players don't really go up against each other, but there's also a better goods-seeding mechanic. Although the decision tree isn't large (given that the routes are more or less dictated by the contract), players can spend quite a bit of time in analysis-mode.

The game is fairly easy to learn for a mid-range gamer and has pretty high replayability. Components weren't great, art was functional (except for the ugly, ugly dirt spots on the map).

Balanced and tight train game that has an especially splendid piece of genius in the action choosing mechanism. I really enjoy the system to get the goods in the game, too.

RATING: 5
It seems to have a bit too much luck with cards (the wild cards and the proximity of contracts to existing routes you have built). The leading (or losing) player is a bit too obvious and an early lead can be hard to overcome. It also seems to have a lot of downtime - each extra player adds more downtime but it is meant to be a multiplayer game.

[LUP 05-Jul-2007] Played with Doug's set which is a first edition with the upgrade pack.  Have only played once so far and tactics wise it was a bit of a learning game.  Most of us were newbies and in retrospect I was certainly not clever enough about which routes I built and connected in terms of being able to maximise my shipping returns.  Future games would be more interesting. I would expand on Doug's idea of using some coloured cubes to mark the available contracts on the map to having sets of three cubes, two to mark the contracts on the map and one on the contract card itself.

Good quality pieces reminiscent IMHO of Stephensons Rocket. Played 1, 5 player game so far. Took a long time 3  hrs but I think thats typical for my gaming group during a first run through and it certainly will come down next time. Very enjoyable time playing it and lots to think about before the next game. . My attempt to win was scuppered by building all of my acuaducts early taking advantage of having the acuaduct expert and so being forced to wait for tunnel cards to appear later on for building through the difficult terrain. Doh! Overall, its just the right level of complexity for me and for that reason beats Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride hands down.

Ticket to Ride meets Thurn & Taxis.  Players collect cards to build canals (similar to laying rails) based on contracts selected.  Goods movement adds an important twist to the game.  A step above Ticket To Ride in complexity but not a heavy game.  Medium-Light weight.(August 2006) 

2nd Edition upgrade kit. (July 2007)

You don't play Canal Mania, Canal Mania plays you. The game combines painfully obvious choices with ultra constricting game system and the result is just terrible (route building game, where you have almost no control what so ever on the routes you build, brilliant). See CortexBomb's and Sisteray's comments for full explanation, then forget ever hearing about this game and play Age of Steam or Volldampf instead.

Little opaque at first, but once explained and played, fairly smooth. Plays like a combo of Ticket to Ride and Railway Tycoon/Age of Steam (without the monetary restriction of the latter or the limited pathways of the former). Interesting game on a fairly obscure theme - name could be improved... very little "mania" in this game.

RATING: 6.5
Canal mania is a game that despite it's simple art, simple rules offers some decisions.

It feels like an advanced ticket to ride. (cross with stea but a very light no income steam)
Problem for me is that the drawing of the cards can be a luckfest as you can only build routes from the two routes you picked.

I did a complete change of the five face up cards and would probably have won the game if a tunnel, aquaduct or a surveyor card came up.

Will play again to see if I have the same feeling.
for now it's 6.5. It will drop to a 5 or go to a 7.

I enjoyed it much more than Ticket to Ride and somewhat more than Railroad Tycoon.  There was definitely a certain satisfaction in building several canal segments linked together and then running goods up and down the canals.

Looking forward to trying the upgrade kit.

RATING: 5
A disappointment for me. Canal Mania really tries to mix Ticket to Ride AND Age of Steam, but more or less this combination doesn't work. Scoring mechanic is weird, there are downtime problems... but still... all the choices are quite obvious and very limited ones. Not my cup of tea.

RATING: 6
An historical simulation of building canals but it's essentially a building and connections game (or a train game if you will).  It has a slight feel of Age of Steam (which to me is a good thing) but there are major differences in mechanism & game play.  You can control one of five engineers at any given time (they have different advantages) and you have an equal set of tile mix to use for the whole game.  You can never build with the same type adjacently connected to each other (there are four types of canals).  Each new contract must be accomplished with new builds and you cannot use old canals systems (even if they are yours) to finish the new contract.  Move and deliver goods can use anyone's canals as long as they do not visit the same colored town twice and must finish the final leg on your own canal.  This is an excellent game with an interesting variety of contracts and networks to build that begs for replayability.  However, I belive the board and contracts are imbalanced (except with 3 players).  After over a handful of sessions, I'm starting to feel that the middle western portion of the board is an important network of towns to connect and run deliveries to; to the point of it being an optimal or very powerful strategy...  

Update:  Having played the 2nd Edition with five players, I still feel the changes have not improved the game for five.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The first game is pretty much a learning game but there does seem to be some bad luck with the cards at times and the unpredictability of what contracts will come up can be a bit of a pain.  Seems to be imperative that one gets a couple canals going down the middle of the board or you're toast when it comes to delivery of cubes.  Also, while this doesn't really bother me, don't get too far behind or you're toast as well.  For me, the game is too expensive for what it brings to the table for the most part.

(1 play 2nd Version 5 players)

Canal Mania is not purely a game but also a wonderful document charting the history of a key part of British history.  Though this is not unique in boardgames, where often designers put periods of history under the microscope, names such as the Sharpness Canal and Thames Navigation evoke in me a feeling of progress, innovation and the English landscape which I sometimes find lacking in train games of which direct comparisons can be made to.  I already have an affinity, as I have often walked the canal routes of London & Stoke through various periods of my life.  To discover the idea came from a walk in the English countryside sealed the deal for me ... this is one I must play.

Away from the emotions of the game I discovered a tight tactical game of hand management, route planning and transportation.  The second edition reveals an addressing of the problems reported in the first edition and offers a system, which not only represents the reality of canal building but ensures that everyone is competitive for the majority of the game; â€œAge of Steam with a safety netâ€.   It goes without saying that the Ragnar Bros. have learnt a lot of tricks from other games in this genre; Age of Steam the oft quoted.  However, where it differs and this is the point of most discussion is its turn structure.  Your move follows three clear phases which you fulfil before the turn moves to the next player (these are shown on clear player aids).  For someone like me who has to feel themselves into a game rather than quickly grasping the essence it is excellent as I was able to plan and execute my moves with little interference and at every point was aware of where I was in my move and how I affected other players decisions.  For players of a more clinical nature the downtime between moves and low level of interaction may of been painful but for me the game moved quickly, was pitched at the right level and was absorbing so I did not see it as a too great a negative.

With a clear logical structure and a transparent points system I would be happy to play this with people who have played Ticket to Ride.  This may be the greatest trick of the Ragnar Brothers to position themselves in a crowded market with a unique theme and as a stepping stone between two extremely popular games; TtR & AoS.  Congratulations, highly recommended.

One criticism, maybe caused by the level of historical accuracy, was the extension of routes.  I had bisected the north of England from Manchester to Leeds when the Manchester to Goode (?) via Leeds contract appeared.  I however could not extend my existing network (earning 7 points for the contract, plus canal tile points and any profitable goods movement) as you are able to do in TtR, which would of propelled me from last to being a contender, but had to build afresh which at the late stage of the game was impossible.  I suspect this is an adherence to history, which I am happy to forgive, but I could have been a contender!

Really enjoyed this game. Felt almost like a simplified version of RR Tycoon or Age of Steam to me. Simple might not be the right word since there is quite a bit going on in this one, it just plays very smoothly. I'd want to own it if I didn't already own RR Tycoon. Wish it played a little quicker, 4 players took about 2 hours. It's a fun 2 hours but I find myself wishing it would be more like 75-90 minutes.

Solid meld of TTR and a hint of AoS. 

The issue is that it certainly doesn't play in the 60-90 range without multiple plays, and even then does it stack up well enough against games of that length that I would still want to play.

I see this getting a few more plays to find that out as it's a solid design, a good effort and play might sweeten with experience and reduced duration.

Canal mania is a set collection and route building game with a bit of pickup and deliver.  You get contracts to connect cities and build routes.  You acquire cards to build those routes and must alternate types with stretch and locks on plains and aqueducts and tunnels on hills.  If a card has a good color you place a good on two cities of the corresponding color.  You can then deliver those later.

On your turn you typically get a contract, take cards or build or deliver a good.  If you deliver you get points for each city you deliver to with a different color.  Also if you cannot do something on a phase, you can blind draw from the draw pile.

Overall a solid game but this is really nothing new.  The graphic design is very bland too.  I would prefer to play steam but this is a nice change of pace.

I love this game as an antidote to Ticket to Ride. I bought it from Shire Games in Stoke on Trent, after a happy week traversing the Four Counties ring, so it seemed appropriate to get it (incidentally Shire Games is a really good shop).

Ok, but I didn't like all the restrictions. the routes are set and even the number of track tiles you're allowed to use between starting and ending points is limited. I assume this is to prevent you from cutting off other players, but I think allowing more blocking might liven this up a bit.

I really enjoy this game.  It is a great take on a traditional train game.  Everything blends together nicely and imo the game does not overstay its welcome.

Feb '17: First game in 8 years.  Building longer, connected routes a big bonus.  Has held up well as an advanced TtR or simpler AoS.  Pretty easy rules but sometimes not always clear from the book.  I won this one big, like 124 to 80's for James and Jacco.

Age of Steam's poor brother. Similar playtime, but not as engaging. I don't like the 1rst half of the game, where ressource cubes are popping up semi-randomly around the board, and very few canals have been built. This means that the lucky player can score dollops of points by being lucky enough to have built the right canal at the right time and place. My frustration was compounded by the fact that (unlike say, Ticket to Ride), you MUST follow your desination tickets, they are not mere suggestions. So I draw London-Oxford, and then all of a sudden ressources pop up in Manchester. But I can't build in Manchester unless I have the Manchester destination! So if a player picked a Manchester destination (on a previous round), he gets the good "for free". Frustrating. Of course, once the canals start being built, the luck decreases and the second half of the game is quite enjoyable. No revolutionary mechanics (some TTR, Maharaja, and typical train-game stuff); a couple of twists (ex: engineer powers that would make each of them more different from one another) could have really spiced up the game. As it stands, it's an ok game, but can't compare with the great train games out there (TTR on the light side, AoS on the heavy).

Yes its a good one for people, who like pickup and deliver or train games, but it´s too long for what it is. And it´s a little bit too fiddly.

And my problem is that I don´t like semi-solitaire games

This appears to be a well thought out game, but just not my kind of thing. As we went through the rules I started getting worried, but once we got down to the game I was surprised that most concepts (bar a couple that I still hadn't nailed even at the end, though I blame the booze for that) had stuck. Only problem is that the game just took far too long for my tastes, and that for every couple of minutes it took for my turn i was then waiting 15 for it to come around again. I really don't get enough of a thrill out of this type of game to invest this kind of time in it, nor does it suit my style of play (my style: GET ON WITH IT). I am in no hurry to play it or games of this ilk again.

really nice economic game based on canal building in 18th century England. Rules are nice and clear and pretty simple. Once you get started there is very little reference to rulebook (the refernce cards are pretty much all you need). First play with 2 players which I guess doesn't give as good a game as 3 to 5 as you can pretty much define your own network without clashing too much with other canal builders. Any game that involves building networks is fine with me, and the goods transportation rule has similarities to railroad Tycoon/ Age of Steam (move blocks along route and score for number of towns passed through) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice, light game of canal building and goods delivery. A bit lucky, perhaps, and intolerably light for a two-hour game. The worst problem is downtime: with slow players, it gets just intolerable. However, if the players are fast enough or I am patient enough, the game is actually quite entertaining. My rating is going up and down; let's have it at eight now and I'm definitely not selling this game quite yet.

I have first edition, but prefer using some of the 2nd edition rules: I give points for contract value and play for +10 points.

Described by several reviewers as a mix between the Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride. You connect cities along certain routes like TTR, acquire cards similar to Thurn & Taxis, and ship freight along the completed routes for points.

First impressions based on a five player game (which I lost comprehensively!)  Very impressive, well balanced and thought out, excellent components with simple rules.  Left me wanting to play more.

Update: have upgraded this to a 9 following several additional plays. It's just a great combination of elements: To get a result you need some hand management, thoughtful use of the engineers, careful selection of contracts/goods locations (for shipping) plus being able to keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing.  Excellent.

Update after a couple of years! - has superb replay value.  Never played a game that I didn't enjoy.  A classic.

A very solid design that nicely fills the gap between Ticket To Ride and Age of Steam.

The result is much more accesible game of track(canal) building, which still has enough depth to interest hardcore gamers.

First play. It seems that just having a good route that will get you many 5 and 6 shipments is not a guarantee to win. I had a route in the south that included Gloucester and London, so all of my cities had the ability to ship for 5 and 6. While I did make many shipments, the other player managed to pick up points through route building and the end game was close.

First impression: Looks quite like Age of Steam. Yes, in Canal Mania too you build links between towns and transport goods. But that's about all there is common between the games. In Canal Mania building is a lot more restricted. It is also harder to create routes only for you and actually you might even prefer to have some routes that are beneficial to you and some opponent. I liked the game as it felt a bit AoS but was more approachable. Actually if I'd like to play Aos-Lite, I'd rather play this one than Volldampf.

RATING: 5
A train game with similar looks to Age of Steam, but is more forgiving and easier to learn. However, it has a lot less depth or strategy. 

The main part of the game is card drafting which is the biggest flaw for me. Players can only have 2 contracts cards in play and are restricted to placing tiles that will add to the route shown on the contract card. Route building is very limited especially as a route can only be one tile longer than the shortest possible distance between A & B. Such restrictions make getting good contract cards essential and if the game forces you to pick the poor ones (due to turn order or luck of the draw) then you're likely to lose. There is no way of blocking which makes for little interaction. 

This game isn't bad, it's just that it has a long play time (with lots of downtime) for quite a light game. For the length and effort I'd rather play Age of Steam.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely a step or two up on the distinctly-average Ticket To Ride, but also a mite fiddly with it, thanks to one too many options and limitation rules. The 'goods' idea could have been better incorporated (what's wrong with a variety of goods, localised to various towns, rather than just colours? Why are we not earning per canal stretch rather than per town?), and the hex-crayon-rail system is becoming over-used and tired. Horrible, horrible cardstock is hardly helpful with shuffling.

Despite all these flaws, there's a terrific theme and atmosphere to the game which seems to be too rarely matched outside of Martin Wallace's ouevre.

Nice network building game with goods delivery like Age of Steam/RRT. I like the rule that you can't have 2 hexes the same next to each other, and you are forced to decide between building quickly, or more slowly but scoring more points for your infrastructure. The ability to swap engineer cards is a brilliant addition IMO.

RATING: 7
Has the advantage over AoS of having speedier turns and more diverse points accumulation strategies, but is lighter in feel. The restrictive contracts force where the track will be laid, which makes card selection and role selection the key decisions to make through most of the game. The luck / importance of what goods go out where increases as the game progresses. Strategies include building isolated track for guaranteed deliveries, a chain if at all possible for bigger runs, being connected to other people to add some points to your score by running their cubes for them. I'm not sure if the fixed building contracts is a good thing (you can plan) or bad (lack of variety) but the gameplay is enjoyable enough that I'm glad I have it.

Based on one play: A nice track and good delivery game. You get contracts and then must build tracks to complete those connections, but you cna only have two contracts at a time. Then you try and use the tracks you build and those of others to deliver goods for points. You have your own supply of tracks and using the more expensive ones gives you points also, but you need to collect cards in order to place them. Lots of fun and the game we played was very tight (six points between firts and last).

I like to play it, but in the long run I think it will get a bit boaring beacouse of the lack of variation: you have a set of contracts, and the cities are, obviously as it is a 'real' map, where they are. But hey, if I'm in the mood for AoS but not have the time, Canal Mania is my choise.

RATING: 6
A hybrid of Ticket to Ride (contract scoring and drafting) and Steam (power selection, track building and cube delivery to score), though wonder if the card drafts are too chaotic for the amount of thinking involved. As there is no competition for routes not as tense or exciting as TtR, though because you can draw build cards from the top of the deck Canal Mania is marginally better than Steam as there is some tense uncertainty. However the cube delivery system is bland compared to the coloured cubes to destination which creates an interesting puzzle.

One interesting innovation is the seeding of the goods cubes is done via card drafting, so adds more incentive to either pick up or discard. Theme is refreshing and educational.

Clunky and unfair are my thoughts after my first play. Draw cards or build track, so in reality you're only actually making progress every two turns. Draw cards, oh, there are five rubbish cards, redraw, oh, five more useless cards. Lost count of the many times this happened. Shipping goods via towns not canals? Is there nothing smooth in this game?
Want a new contract, great, however some people get to choose from 5 and you'll get only one, WTF.

1st & 2nd ed. Thank you Kevin.

1st 3-player game of 1st edition. A little confusion with the rules but it actually plays quite well. Very important to select contracts that have a good chance of connecting up together and then, at the end, connect up with others so you can poach their goods to your advantage. Goods runs are at least as important as fulfilling contracts (and take contracts that include the Cities!).

I did very well and would give this an 8 if I didn't think I was mostly lucky in contracts.

Update: Bumped up to an 8.

Has the Ticket to Ride collect building cards, to build 4 types of canal tiles. Where you can build is based on the city connection permits you draft.
The twist is the same time of tile can't be next to each other and each tile type has a different victory point values.
One part is building to score points the other is trying to have a network so you can deliver goods cubes (think Age of Steam).
The look of the connections when done reminds me of Magna Greacia.

The ugly love child of Age of Steam and Ticket to Ride. It inherits the fiddlyness of Age of Steam but not its depth. Unfortunately, it's less strategic than Ticket to Ride.

With Ticket to Ride, at least you had a choice when deciding where to build. In Canal Mania, you can only work on two canals (routes between two cities) at once, which are dictated by a contract card. Also, you can only hold two contract cards, so this limits any strategic planning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good player interaction, good depth of choices, though both could be better.  I'm not sure I like the method of scoring for deliveries all that much, it seemed like the colors serving as 'barriers' to delivery added frustration without adding interest, and I also felt too constricted by the 'contracts' dictating where the players could build, but it works fairly well and it's a decent game overall.

Don't be fooled, this is a train game in disguise. During turns players essentially draw cards OR build track (using the same cards). If that sounds familiar its because its how Ticket to Ride works. The players try to complete routes they have taken from parliament and then transport goods along those routes. There are a lot of small nuances but the most interesting is the transportation of goods. You can do this along other people's tracks as well as your own and you can forgoe transportation to draw cards, both of which create some interesting decisions.
On the downside this game has a lot to compete with and it is neither involved enough to compete with its heavier competitors or simple enough to compete with the gateway Ticket to Ride (though it probably doesn't breakdown so badly in the hands of competent players).

Players build canals in England. You have to grab contracts which represents two or more cities to be connected. Then you have to play cards to connect those cities. And then, you can ship goods through the canal network. The game seems to be a very good combination of Ticket to Ride (contracts remind TtR tickets, and you play cards to estabilish routes) and Age of steam (track laying and goods shipment). It is a small annoyance to find the various cities on the map (and often the name of the city is covered by a good cube).

First Edition: Yes, it was just one playing, but boy what a ride.  Tight choices between wanting to build or wanting to get more cards (for options later).  Choices between getting an ability (engineer) or contract.  Need to plan ahead.  While one person appeared to be in the overall lead, the end scores weren't that far apart.  Also familiarity with the contracts can only improve the game and tighten the route competition further.  Look forward to trying this one again.

Second Edition: Upgrade Kit:   Plays just as well as the first edition with a few modest tweaks.  Glad to have both in my collection via the upgrade kit.

Hmm, not bad, not good. The idea is sound, but man there is almost more luck in this than in Ticket to Ride. Getting bad card draw not only hurts you, it usually helps the other players as you pull out good stuff to replace the crap you just pulled. I won pretty handily, and had good luck, but that didn't save the game for me. I would play again, it plays in under 2 hours with 4 people, but I would never pay $70 for this game.

I prefer this to the more popular Ticket to Ride series.  It seems to me that while those games appeal more as gateway games, this title provides me with the extra planning and decisions that I like.   My only complaint, albeit a small one, is that occasionally bad draws followed by more bad draws can kind of cripple you...  but then again, its not luck free, so a future play of the game will usually correct that.

I really like train games of all types.  This is essentially a train game, though a little bit different.  As some have pointed out, there are some similarities to other games, particularly the delivery mechanism so similar to multiple Wallace titles.  However, there is enough difference with the constrained building rules and the limited choice of routes to make for an interesting game.  I enjoyed the first game enough to pick up the second edition expansion pack.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to play that one, so cannot count on it.  [06/21/2008]

Ordered from Ragnar Brothers. 12 weeks away on a slow boat. Sigh. Expensive too! Damn the British Pound.

Update: Excellent Ragnar game (minus tablecloth). This one is a mix between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam. Players draft cards in order to build their canal system to fulfill government contracts as well as have a network to ship goods on. There are engineer cards that allow players to break the rules. Players score points for shipping goods as well as for positions according to contracts fulfilled.

The game playes fairly quick with most games running 1.5 to 2 hours and there are good solid decisions to make (where to build your network, what cards to draft, which engineer to hijack from other players, etc). A little negative is the fact that it's a little solitaire-ish. Players could agonise over routes and cards to draft but there's no point really planning TOO far ahead as a contract you want may be snapped up before your turn!

The components are top notch: mounted board, thick hex tiles (1/3 the size of AoS), cards, plastic ships. The board gets a little fiddly but I can live with it. Well worth looking at...if you can afford the hit from shipping it from the UK. If not, wait till the US retailers get stock of this.

I have a hard time rating this game.  I'm torn between a number of factors.  

First and foremost we played it wrong, thinking that the turn order changes when you switch Engineers (it became a nuciance in the game, and I'm glad it will supercede our mistake Ipso Facto). Knowing this now, I don't think it overly effects how I feel about the game.  I do know that I we had a really difficult time with the rules, this took up a huge chunk of time, trying to figure out the ambiguities.

There are a number of elements to the game that I found didn't work for me. 

This is mostly a card drafting game. I don't mind drafting games, there is an intention to give control to players, but in this game I bumped heads with the sour end of the draft.  The system constrains your builds by forcing diversity, you must switch back and forth between the tiles that you place, this means that you are required to collect a diverse split of cards.  If you are in a situation where you can only collect the worthless stretch cards (which I must say isn't entirely infrequent in the draft), then you are SOL in building.  Contrary to this the wild cards are clearly much better cards than other cards, so those that are offered the opportunity to draft them are at a distinct advantage.  In addition to this the drafting also comes into play in the contracts that you pull.  The system pushes you into getting poor contracts to flush them through, which is fine, but if you are pushed up against this wall then you open a bunch of new great contracts for others. Yes, there is probably a valid arguement stating that this is part of the game and that one of your goals is to not let this happen to you, but it is irritating. 

The person that gets contracts that puts then in the middle of the action will score the most as people will most likely have to ship over them. The points to be gained from shipping are drastically higher than from building, so getting the right contracts is essential.  Once someone is on a good run getting goods out to new areas becomes difficult without giving more goods to the lead shippers as you must place in cities first.  I'm not sure how to catch the leader in this game.

What is really the key to my lackluster experience with the game is the overwhelming downtime.  There is nothing to do when it isn't your turn, most of your turns are dictated by what is presented to you when your turn comes around, so while you certainly can build a general strategy, there isn't a whole lot of pre-planning your turn.  In combination with this there is a large discrepancy between the time turns will take, some will take upwards of 4 or 5 minutes while card drafting turns take a few seconds, so it is possible (and likely) to wait a good twenty minutes before you can do anything effective.  When played with five players this gets obscene.  This is just too light of a game, to justify the exhaustion.

I'd give this another chance as I think it would improve with less players, but for the length and the effort I'd rather be playing a deeper train game (18XX or Age of Steam).

Similar to Age of Steam (pick-up-deliver, route building) but with more randomness: you can only build connections where you have contracts (which come up in random order, except for first 5); you need cards to build, which are randomly revealed (as in Ticket to Ride); goods enter the board when certain marked build cards are taken, where you have limited ability to predict where goods will go (unless you take the card, then you can choose, within rule limits, where to put the goods).
 Good game: definitely better than Railroad Tycoon, although not as good as Age of Steam for me. Still, worth owning the second edition, which fixed some end-game issues (no bonus for #contracts) and better thematic sense (must take shortest route if multiple routes possible).

I think most people will have a better time with Canal Mania than I do.  It is well designed and offers some interesting decisions, mainly with where to build track and the best use of the goods cubes.  The problem for me is it borrows the goods movement ideas from Age of Steam and that's the one part of that game I don't enjoy, especially as the game progresses.  My mind doesn't work that way for whatever reason, hopefully because I'm not interested in that type of puzzle.  Also, I had difficulty reading the city names on the board.  I would not recommend playing it with AP types.  For most others, though, I would take my comments with a grain of salt, as it's more of a quirk on my part than any flaw in the game design.

Very clever mechanics, game does not stall at ant point as the options in each phase can keep your network moving. Works well as a 2 player, the "spare contract" very important in tapping in to the other player's goods routes. 5th game a very close 3 player, with final winner only decided in the last round of goods draw down (i.e i snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by placing 6 goods which benefited others more than me). Managed  to lose last game (7) by not taking the London - oxford thus allowing opponent huge goods movement.
I wonder if it was re themed as a Railway game and the components tarted up a bit whether it would receive the acclaims and sales that it deserves. Ragnar brother genius. Ticket to Tide meets Railroad Tycoon.

As far as game design I will give this game a 9. I'm subtracting one point for the components: (1) The spaces are a little too small to hold the tiles, (2) the contract cards don't have any graphic representation of the routes, which make them very hard to discern, (3) the barges are too big for the scoring track *and* the board -- they cover up the names of the cities, (4) the cards are very thin.
 
One thing I would look out for -- when you're selecting contracts, be very aware of their value. For scoring, that value is used in tie-breakers, so I figured it wouldn't be too important. Well, when three of us tied with four contracts apiece, it suddenly became very important.

Also, the 8 is based on a three-player game. Subtract one point for each player more than three.

A game of two distinct elements that work together beautifully. Pick up cards from a face up set to build canals. Far more issues to address than TtR: contracts dictate where you can build and the maximum length of connections. Different tile types need to be laid, which requires different card types. There's a 7-card hand limit, and some cards seed goods into towns when they're picked up. The second element (which scores more points than track building) is to ship goods down your canals, maybe with the help of other player's canals; different from AoS in that each town can have only one goods cube, and goods don't have target cities, they can go to any destination but not through the same colour town twice. It's important to choose the right contracts & try to manage the goods placement and shipping to your advantage.

Pretty much a train game, just building canals instead of track.  Not a bad train game either, but actually a fairly good one.  My only gripe is the down time.  It's no good planning too much since what the other players do (taking three cards, taking contracts, etc.) can make a huge difference on what can be done on one's turn.  Definitely worth playing again.

The perfect game for those times when you are in the mood for one of the heftier train games but don't have the time to play one.  CM reliably plays in about 70-90 minutes.  It's high fun:time ratio ensures that it will have a place at my table for years to come.

(2nd ed. introduced notable improvements; bumping up 1 point.)

A train game... but with boats. Not sure I like that there are random card drawn with more stretch cards in the deck but you need to alternate sections when you build. Seemed to always come with three non-stretch cards for me when my hand was full and I was building that turn. Then on the next turn all stretch cards would turn up when I needed to grab more cards. I'd rather get money and then have to pay for the sections.

So so components, but all very functional. Pretty straightforward game play, but there might not be enough paths to victory in this game. Depending on how the contracts come out will set your strategy; one cannot just set a strategy at the beginning of the game. Lasts a little longer than it should. Definitely prefer Railways of the World over this game.

Rated after one play.  I think CortexBomb described my problems with the game well: "[T]he player who has the right contracts flip at the right time is going to be in very good shape simply because of that, and will be able to make 4, 5, or even 6 link deliveries solo, consistently, and is probably going to gaudily cremate the other players."  To me, this seems to be a rich-get-richer game, with the draw of contracts deciding the game.

The components don't seem to be well thought out, with too many pieces crammed into the tiny hexes and city names unreadable.  The cards are very flimsy.

Downtime was a significant problem.  I almost read the entire rulebook in the time between two of my turns.

I'll try it again because I like some of the mechanics and I expect my group to want to play it, but I expect my rating to drop, not rise.

This game holds a unique position for me: it is the first game of any kind over two hours in length that I enjoy. Usually I find longer games either too repetitive, too brain-burny, or some combination of the two. This one hits the sweet spot for me in terms of game weight, theme, multiple paths to victory, and just plain fun. They say this game is a combination of Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam. It definitely has elements of T2R, with Build cards needed to build various canal segments. I've never played AoS, so I cannot comment on that connection. It wouldn't surprise me, because there's nothing new here- just a very very clever combination of mechanisms done in a way that I found highly enjoyable. 

Something else that needs to be praised is the rule book. I think it is the best I've ever read (and I've read hundreds). Clear, concise, and logically organized.

An advanced version of "ticket-to-ride" type of game. It is better than ticket-to-ride, but ticket-to-ride is more enjoyable. If you like English geography, go for it. If you want something more with respect to complexity than ticket to ride, go for it. But its complexity does not add I would say to the experience of ticket-to-ride. Components are nice although the cards are not of high quality.

Easy to play connection game that may look like (Age Of) Steam, but certainly plays very differently. There is quite a bit of randomness in the game (mainly introduced by the track building cards that show up each turn), but it still offers interesting decisions. One of the things that I like best, is the choice between putting down track tiles (and scoring points) or taking track building cards each turn. Especially since the cards determine where the goods (cubes) arrive - another healthy source of victory points! And then there are the engineer cards that you can exchange at the start of your turn to obtain a different player power. Nice!

While not being a [i]great[/i] game [b]Canal Mania[/b] is a [i]good[/i] game.

It sits nicely between frothy, vaguely railway-y themed games; and the more intense, unforgiving, stock manipulating train games. Both sorts I tend to find tedious, with surreptitious glances at clocks and watches.

I do not notice the passage of time with [b]Canal Mania[/b] until after final scoring and the postmortem discussion. Always the sign of an enjoyable game.

I am reluctant to give any game a 9 after just one playing, but this game is pretty close to that.  It seems to be quite a bit longer than the 90 minutes stated above, but it remained interesting throughout.  I am also sure that we were extra slow due to inexperiance and turns went much faster later in the game.  The rules seem long, but that is mostly because they are fairly explicit and have lots of examples.  It took a while to explain the game, but everything makes sense and it isn't hard to follow.  Abount my only complaint is that the cities and towns on the contracts are a little hard to find (for an American).  It would have been nice if the contracts had little maps on them to help narrow the search (ala TtR).

The Age of Steam lite descriptions I have heard are not too far off.  It isn't all that much like AoS, but it has a similar gamer quality to it and I ended the game with lots of ideas about what to do differently next time.

Initial Impression; limited plays. 

Odd first player plays red requirement (no difference in components or number of components for any player color). 

Plays like something between Ticket to Ride and Steam.  Would work excellent as a next step towards train games, if all one has played is the TTR series. 

Likely runaway leader issues.  Interesting game never-the-less.

Three plays. Not very original to say it's a cross between T2R and AoS, though the historical fidelity brings 18XX to mind.  Personally I have no great interest in stock market games, and I'm more than happy to play a route-building game without having to count out money.

I had heard a ton of great things about this game, partly in relation to Age of Steam, so one spring when I had a windfall, I purchased this game without having played it first. I was REALLY excited about it, and my expectations were irrationally high.  Now, the problem with high expectations is that the only direction they can go from there is down. I'm willing to admit that my disappointment in this game was in part due to my expectations for it. But it seemed to be either (a) a watered down version of Age of Steam, with too many random elements to help with developing a long-term strategy, or (b) a more complex version of Ticket to Ride, which lasted three hours.

I like Age of Steam because it's challenging, and lacks a lot of randomness. The length of the game doesn't bother me that much, because I feel engaged. I like Ticket to Ride because it's quick, and even though luck can play a large factor into the game, it's over quickly enough that it doesn't bug me too much. Canal Mania falls somewhere in between these two ranges, and it just doesn't satisfy me.

The rules are overly fiddly (it took about 30-45 minutes to cover the rules, and even then we STILL had to refer to the rulebook time and time again), all you can do to get a good network on the board is hope that you draw the right routes, and there's too much luck in getting the cards you need when you need them.  I would be interested in playing a second game, with 3, and knowing all the details of the rules, to see if the game improves, but I don't have a lot of hope for that.  I see that the lowest ratings for this game are from other Age of Steam nuts, and I'm one of those, too.

After several plays now, Canal Mania is a firm favourite of the gaming group and a particular favourite of mine. A good combination of route building, card management and goods delivery ensures interesting decisions at every turn. It also has a certain 'charm' about the theme & components which appeals to me. 

*Update* Score reduced to a 7. Played well over 20 games now, the vast majority with 3 players. We have found that the game is so well balanced between us that it almost becomes a game of chance. The simple things that cannot be calculated, such as drawing a blind build card from the stack, can essentially decide the game. Probably won't play it again for a while now, and only with 4 or 5 players.

Umm I had problems getting the rules, but I did enjoy it. It also was a Secret Santa gift in 2008 I guess.

This is a tile-laying game with a canal building theme.

This game seems to be a lighter version of Age-of-Steam and Ticket to Ride.  In Canal Mania, you collect card sets to build canals connecting destination cities then delivering goods over canals scoring for the person whose canals you used.

I've just received the game after reading on the Ragnar Brothers site that there were only 2 copies left. The game was within a week at my place!

First play with 5 players. With rules explanation the game took about 2 and a half hours. Was well received!

What is written about the game is true; it has a Age of Steam feel. Except for drawing cards is has - for me - nothing to do with Ticket to Ride. 

It's a nice game! Building aspect is very important, you have to build your canals using your own contracts, so choose them well. No fighting over routes (canals) like in Age of Steam, everyone builds his own. But choosing the right ones is very, very important. After fullfilling of a contract you'll receive points for tiles used except the 'stretch' tiles.

It's very lucrative to have 2 cities (of the 6) in your network. You will receive goods on a regular basis and this goods are very important to score extra points. Connected cities will get goods before connected towns... 

Making a short canal connected to another player can give 2 extra points on a regular basis... Don't underestimate this... When delivering a good they have to use your route and each city/town connected during the delivery will score points for each player who's canal has been used.

The swapping of engineers happened often in our game; very nice twist to this game and often a hard needed one!

Be prepared for the endgame where goods on the board will be delivered based on the engineer numbers; some players can score many extra points. Being up front with the right engineer can be very lucrative. Number 1 and 2 in our game had a difference of 1 point after this phase, it was more than 10 just before... The contracts made the difference, number 1 had the same number of contracts as number 2 but had more points on his contracts. The best builder receives in a 5 player game 10 points, number 2 scores 8.

A well earned victory we all agreed. This game can be played with 5 but we have a feeling that 4 players could be better looking at the time frame.

Will be played again!

==============================
Update: Second play with 4 players. This second play was far more vicious then the first one. Players tried to block routes by using rival contracts. It was a very close game too. Number 1 and 2 had a tie, number 2 won by having engineer number 2. The other player had picked engineer number 1 in the last round to be the first one in delivering the last goods. We all agreed, good game!

Ticket to Ride meets Railroad Tycoon.  Quite a lot of luck in terms of what contracts are available when it is your turn but if you know the cards available then you can make best use of what you end up with.  Shame there are so few contracts to so many of the towns.  I would certainly play again but it is not one I am hankering to have in the collection.

I really like this one.  Kind of reminds me of a lighter Age of Steam/Railroad Tycoon.  Luck is definitely involved with the card draws, but it doesn't overpower the rest of the game.  Second edition:  if I remember correctly from my play of the first edition, there are a few more points scored by moving goods in the second edition.  Otherwise, not much change.

What initially drew me to Canal Mania was that it appeared to be an interesting twist on Age of Steam.  That perception is still correct, but what I've finally concluded is that Age of Steam is the better game, and there are no circumstances under which I'd rather play Canal Mania than AoS.

I really should trade this away.

Played once (with 4 players). Some interesting ideas make it a bit different from other "train" games, but the contracts feel a bit constraining. Getting a connected network as soon as possible seems to be required to do well, and you have little control on what contracts you can get. Still, an interesting game, which I would enjoy playing again if I get a chance.

Laurel and I played this as a two-player game the day it arrived and enjoyed it a lot (notwithstanding that Laurel totally destroyed me), but we both felt that more players would have improved gameplay immensely. It has many similarities to Railroad Tycoon and Age of Steam, but is a bit simpler. The Engineer cards are one element I particularly liked: each player starts with one and they give players certain advantages, such as being able to build certain types of canal section more cheaply. A players current Engineer card can be exchanged for any other Engineer card as one of the available actions in a player's turn, although taking this action prevents you taking other useful actions, so it's not without consequence.

After glancing through the criticisms for Canal Mania, I have to say that if you strip away the restrictions placed by the contract cards, wouldn't that make it even more of a clone to Age of Steam?  Contracts are in fact one of the many elements that set this apart from the other pick up and delivery games, even if I don't necessarily like every aspect that goes with it (especially how you are required to have a working one at the start of your turn, and this is particularly problematic towards the end when you obviously cannot finish what you just picked up, thus wasting a precious phase).

In the session I played in, there were plenty of interactions as goods are stolen, engineers and valuable track cards are taken, not to mention precious build spaces are occupied.  The tension between construction, shipping and whether to introduce more commodities to the board was almost suffocating at times.  Of course this is no AoS or even RRT, but I think it's a mighty fine effort to emulate what worked with those games as well as to introduce a few ideas of its own.  Highly recommended at the moment.

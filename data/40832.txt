Worthy lost cities variant that streamlines the scoring and supports multiple players (yet to try this 2p).

RATING: 5
Sorely lacks the tense feeling of Lost Cities, and just feels "slack" for 2 players.

The rules are also pretty confusing and there are a few different twists to get your head around. Not including score sheet/card clearly showing the points table is also an oversight (they are hidden amongst the rules).

We find the tile based "Der Weg der Steine" is superior in every respect.

RATING: 7.1
All the feel of Keltis as I remember it (note: I have only played Keltis once) - with some nice touches as you try to get wishstones, playing pairs of cards of the same number; and playing point cards to your rows of cards of the same number, or to a separate pile to gain a point per card. The use of end cards to lengthen the row rather than the "doubling" cards of Lost cities to increase points is interesting and in some ways avoids the bad luck of taking an early decision to play doubler cards. Overall game has a nice feel.

2-4. Lost Cities: the Board Game: the Card Game. I wish the game had cards to keep track of the scoring, but overall it's pretty impressive. Such a tiny little box (like Coloretto). Managed to reinvent the wheel again - discarding cards for artifacts finally allows the discard piles to become really interesting.

RATING: 7
The card game of the boardgame of the card game. I'm wary of games that look like an attempt to squeeze a bit more profit out of a popular system.  However, Keltis das Kartenspiel (KdK) is really a rather clever multi-player development of Lost Cities.  The additional elements of wish stones, end cards and wild cards all work nicely and provide a bit more to think about.

Sadly, the everything's gone green Keltis artwork has been retained for KdK.  Card quality is the usual standard from Kosmos these days - not that great.

Very similar to The Lost Cities. A little bit easier to play, becuase the cards can be played ascending and descending order. Maybe even more abstract than The Lost Cities and even less thematic. 
There is even a way to play The Lost Cities with the Keltis cards.

RATING: 7
Plays 2-4, up from Lost Cities' two.  Also has two ending conditions (deck runs out or five rows have "ended").  You're still playing for long rows and get negative points for short rows, but the scoring is based explicitly on their length.  And you can go in ascending or descending order with a given row - your choice.  There are also 'point' cards which can be played in their own row for a point or matched to lengthen color rows.  Finally there are 'wish stones' which you can get by discarding two cards (discard two threes and you get the only 3 wish stone) - you get negative points if you have less than two wish stones.  All this stuff going on and it's just a smallbox release with numbered/colored cards.  Fantastic work.  I'm actually a fan of Lost Cities, but all this action makes it look even lighter.  LC still has more tension, but it seems to come at a cost of reduced choices.

Keltis kártyaváltozata. Nekem a táblás Keltis jobban tetszett, és az Elveszett Városok is (mindhármat kettesben játszottam eddig, a Keltis táblával volt egy 3-as parti). Ha az Elveszett városokkal hasonlítom, akkor ez annyiban könnyebb szerintem, hogy itt a darabszám számít, nem az összeg. Ami a közös a háromban, hogy mindegyiknél az a fő dilemma, ki hány színt mer bevállalni, ki mennyit kockáztat. Ha elutazunk, akkor ez a legjobb, mert kicsi:) Van belőle direkt utazós pakli is:)
---
Nem saját ötlet, de ezzel játszható az Elveszett városok is:)
A játék most jobban tetszett, mint amikor pár éve próbáltam! Szerintem a kívánságkövekre, meg 2 (max 3) színre kell menni, 2 főnél legalábbis bejött ez. Nincs annyi lap a pakliban, hogy 4-5 színnel boldoguljunk.

Much of the game is solid and a lot of fun.  I like how it scales from 2-4.  On the negative I do feel the wishstones add quite a bit of luck and do not often enough lead to interesting decisions.  I would rather play with them than house rule them out but wish something cleverer was created instead.  Also it takes a game or two to get used to the scoring which is fine but makes it less ideal to introduce as a filler on a game night to people who havent played it.

As the mediocre game it is, Keltis succeeds in one thing only: growing boring soon and annoying the players quickly, all of which made it the perfect candidate for the Spiel des Jahres award (that it did win indeed).

Anyhow, the card and dice variants are way better than the original game, the dice filler still being the best of them all thanks to its simplicity and quick gameplay. (September 2011)

I like this game and rank it among No Thanks, For Sale, and Coloretto as good quick filler games. However, I think it would benefit immensely from a scoring cheat sheet for each player and chits for scoring. The non-intuitive scoring progression makes it difficult to switch between number of cards and points in your head.

Multiple uses for cards, and the new card types, makes this far from a Lost Cities multi-player clone. Ive just played 2-player so far, but it was good at that, and might just be a LC replacement.

RATING: 8
I like it more than Keltis and Lost Cities, and though I enjoy Lost Cities: The Board Game most of all, this is much faster and easier to set up.

Rating is based on 2-player games.  I suspect with more I would like it less, because the ascending + descending options make it hard to know what to discard.  With 2 it's fine either way, but 3+ I would want ascending-only, so the Lost Cities board game gets the nod from me.

One doesn't need to own Lost Cities if one has this.  The fact it can play up for 4 players and is in a smaller, cheaper package makes it even more appealing.

I'm still wondering how can anyone buy Keltis instead of buying this little card game that is even better than the original one.

- Would anyone pay the quadruple of his money for a similar, but worst, game?

- Don't anyone mind to waste 10 times the volume in his shelves for a worst game?

- This game is portable and can be played in less table space than the original.

This takes the beauty out of Lost Cities and adds lots more options and the ability to play up to 4 players.

RATING: 4
I only played the 2-player online version. There's nothing particularly wrong with this game, but I find it pretty boring; especially when compared to the similar game Lost Cities. Lost Cities feels like gambling, this feels like laborious collecting of stones. With all the cards being worth the same, all the decisions feel same-y. Only wishing stones, obtained by discarding a pair of cards, have a better scoring ladder. This means that more cards will be discarded early on, but then again, picking up the discarded cards will reduce your chances of collecting the valuable wishing stones.

This is a pretty fun game that adds a smidgen of complexity to Lost Cities. As of yet this doesn't get the effusion of love that Lost Cities has long enjoyed, but perhaps that's because we haven't played this enough. I can see this being an upgrade to LC.

Hmm, a card game adaptation of the board game based on the Lost Cities card game, which is somehow different from lost Cities but still worthwhile?!!  Rather incredibly, for a fan of Lost Cities, it's not a let-down and I'd quite happily play more - with a suspicion, perhaps even an expectation, that greater experience of the game would improve my appreciation and its rating, as was the case with Lost Cities.

One of the great aspects of Lost Cities is that you know what cards are left in the deck. However, Lost Cities where you can never be certain about which cards remain in the deck or which ones have been removed loses that charm.

An improved version of [gameid=50], plus the cards are standard size.  Here's hoping someone prints it in English just for a good rules translation to be included in the box, but I don't see that happening the way Keltis and Lost Cities are designated by continent.

A Lost Citieshez képest már 4 fővel is játszható, de 2-vel is ugyanolyan izgalmas, valamint sokkal többet tudunk befolyásolni a szerencsén, egy kicsit meg lett bolondítva a játék, de nekem bejött.

RATING: 5
I've actually never played keltis, or Lost Cities the board game, so I can't compare to either of those. But from what I heard, it was basically the same. Which makes this the card game version of the board game version of the card game. Seemed way less brutal than Lost Cities, in that you can start at the top or the bottom of each suit. And the scoring multipliers (in this case not really multipliers, but bonus cards nonetheless) are played at the end of the sequence, rather than at the beginning. I think I slightly prefer Lost Cities, but the obvious advantage here is that you can play with more players. I didn't particularly care for the new scoring thing about putting down two cards of the same number to make a set, and score # of sets. Seems unnecessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The refining of the concept first with Keltis and now the card version makes this my preferred choice over Lost Cities and Keltis as well.  It shines as a two player game and the fact that it plays well with more than two is gravy.

What a strange game to comment on - the card game version of the board game version of the card game.  Where do I begin?  Well, I guess the beginning.
Lost Cities was a great game, and still is a lot of fun at times for me.  I'm not convinced that Keltis is a big step up but it is pretty fun nonetheless.  (I do hear the expansion is great though)  Taking Keltis back into a cardgame made me skeptical at first, but it's Knizia so I'm on board.  First of all, it supports more than 2 players so that is nice.  Secondly, the green stones add in a nice element. Causes some decisions as to what to go for and provides some interesting discards.  I think the endcards and the wild cards make sense as it helps accomodate more than 2 players, but because of them, I don't like this game with only 2 players.  
I almost think that if you've got 2p, stick with Lost Cities, 3p - go with Keltis cardgame, 4p - go with Keltis boardgame.  And if you've only got 5-10 mins and 3 or 4p, go with the Keltis "travel game" (Weg der Steine).  Wait! What?  There's Keltis the Oracle??  Uh-oh....

Another of the recent crop of Lost Cities inspired games. As with the others, the main tension is when to start a journey or skip a card in progressing one. Swapping a card out often doesn't help since if you dont want it, there's a chance your opponent does.
This version has a sideline of a wild suit that can also be played as simple points and he end condition is slightly different.
But really, if you've played one of these, you've played them all. A nice filler, but that's about all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent adaptation of Lost Cities for multiple players. For two players, however, stick with Lost Cities. The Keltis card game with two goes on and on as the players re-use discards to score again. The tension that you feel with, say, four players as you try to determine the best use of a card is much reduced with two players because you know you're likely to get another shot at that card.

Players take turns playing cards from their hand and refreshing to eight cards.  Played cards can either meld in front of them (in ascending or descending order); be discarded (or discard a same value pair to claim a wishing stone card); or played as a "point" card to either extend a meld or form a bonus "point" meld.  Knizia goes Alan Moon by adding caboose cards to freeze a meld, and set the end of the game trigger.  Points are scored (or lost) for length of melds, number of wishing stone cards, as well as the bonus "point" meld.  I initially brushed this off as a spin-off, but in fact it's the best of the Keltis/Lost Cities games - a brilliant little card game full of subtle nuances.  The addition of the stone cards gives otherwise useless cards a purpose now, and you can now drive the end of the game via the "end cards" play.  I'd almost go as far as stating this is the best Knizia game I've played in a couple of years.

Keltis has good looking cards and plays as a quick filler. The only downside I can see is that getting the pairs is a bit of a luckiest, although choosing when and whether to play them is sometimes interesting. However, it packs plenty of interesting decisions into its short playtime.  A real favourite with my wife and a good game at a low price.  Scales nicely between 2 and 4 players.

The card game leaves the basic premises of Keltis unchanged. It offers pretty much the same value for less money, in less time, and in a smaller package. I don't know why one would prefer the version with the board to this.

Yes, Keltis has jumped the shark.  But this wasn't what jumped it for me.  The Tile game was much worse.

This one was acceptable.  I didn't love it, but it wasn't bad.

It did multiplayer lost cities in card form nicely.

The Blarny Stones and Point Cards were welcome distractions.

I think if the scoring went back to the sum of the cards somehow it might have been smoother.  Of course, it wouldn't work since you need to be able to go up and down for so many players to share the deck.

Anyway, I'll definitely be trying it some more.

It's a lot of fun to ridicule this as the cardgame version of a boardgame that was originally inspired by a cardgame, but like everyone else says, Knizia has an ingenious talent for revisiting old games and putting in just a little twist to improve the game.  I should say that this only seems to work for the Keltis series of games, as recent efforts like Strozzi (Medici revisited) and Masters Gallery (Modern Art revisited) have been very disappointing.

But this one is a drastic improvement on Keltis (which I would only play with the expansion board), in that it offers more choices, while still keeping the game moving along at a brisk pace.

The addition of the point cards and end cards are nice, allowing for longer strings of cards, which you kind of need to avoid negative points.  But what's really enjoyable are the wishing stone cards.  They allow for an extra option for worthless cards, but depending on your group they can be very hotly contested from the beginning of the game.  Since you have to have 3 of them to not lose points, you need to have a way of coming up with at least a couple.

My main complaint is that there is no summary card included in the game as in the BMM version.  You really need to have some kind of reference for everyone so that they know how many points you get (or lose) for having a certain number of cards or wishing stones.  This could have been so easily included that it is astounding that they did not.

I haven't played Keltis, so I can only compare this to its more distant ancestor Lost Cities, which is simpler and stricter. In Keltis Card you can build from either direction, there are duplicates of the mid-range cards and penalties are not so harsh in absolute numbers, though you still have to worry about turn efficiency. Card counts matter instead of card values and this is perhaps for the better. Not so sure about the double discards which mostly seem to come down to luck. In any case the game gives you a bunch of things to think about and like Lost Cities it's a good diversion. It can also be played with more than two, though I haven't done this.

First there was a Lost Cites (the card game). Then there came the boardgame version of it (Lost Cities the Boardgame/Keltis), now there is a card game again (and a different kind of boardgame as well). Well, this one works fine enough and is fast to play, but is this better than the first one ever made? Don't know, maybe this is more balanced but something is missing...

RATING: 7.2
Most of the fun of Keltis... in an appropriately small box. There's even a bit more tension (like in Lost Cities) as you don't have to move your pawns, only play the cards (and it makes it a bit faster). While it's closer to Keltis than to Lost Cities it's also better (although less thematic) than Lost Cities! The only thing that makes Keltis better than this for me (besides the beautiful board) is the combination possibilities of the clover leaf. Otherwise, it's really on par.

Delivers almost everything the vastly overrated boardgame variant has to offer. And since the expectations for small card games regarding depth are lower than for boardgames, this is actually an average game.

* Plays quickly
* The point cards add a little bit of intrigue to the game...but not much.

DISLIKES:

* It is boring - I much prefer the board game over the card game.
* Little to no interaction among players outside of denying each other needed cards.  

I have no interest in playing this one again.  It works but has little to no pizazz.

I first bought it because it was cheap and I played Lost Cities with it. I liked Lost Cities so much that I decided to buy the real game and then was doubting what to do with Keltis: the cardgame. Then finally I tried to play the original Ketlis card game how it should be played and I probably love it even more now then Lost Cities! It is less prone to luck due to the fact that you can start either way with a row and there are also more middle number cares in the deck. The wishing stones are a great add on, as are the point stones. It plays great with two and calculating the score is way more easy then with Lost Cities (although they should have added one or more score summary cards in the box).

Scoring rules are a bit more fiddly than Lost Cities. I prefer how card value matters in Lost Cities whereas all that matters in Keltis the card game is the number of cards in each row. The additional options of building from high to low or low to high, trading a pair for a wishing stone, playing a wild to a row, and capping off rows with end cards add some intriguing choices. Ultimately, however, I prefer the cleaner design of Lost Cities.

I can't believe I fell for this again. I like Lost Cities, so naturally I went for LC: The Board Game as it plays well with more than just two players, but it lacked the tension. I knew that Keltis: The Card Game is just the same, but inexplicably I bought it, and guess what. It plays well with more than two, but it lacks the tension of the original. Now I'm eagerly waiting for Keltis: The Card Game: The Board Game to let me screw up once again.

Pasziánsz, az ötletesebb fajtából.

Pro:
 - egyszerű szabályok,
 - néhány perc alatt lejátszható partik,
 - négyen is lehet (ami lássuk be, nem minden pasziánszra jellemző).

Ennyi kb. a pozitívum.

Kontra:
 - interakció szinte nulla;
 - túlságosan egyszerű, főleg azoknak, akik életük során legalább 10 windowsos pasziánszon túl vannak már;
 - a kártyák dizájnja sem győzött meg, túl egysíkú, túl unalmas.

Mindezt félretéve tényleg nem rossz, de nem az a korszakalkotó játék.

Definitely a superior alternative to the US version Lost Cities. 

Unlike Lost Cities it scales to support 3 and 4 players and with the addition of a number of new mechanics it makes for more tough decisions throughout. 

Additional bonus for discarding the utterly extraneous playing board and needlessly large cards in favor of a much smaller box and more cards to support the additional players.

Not officially distributed in the US, but I usually have a copy in my trades that I bring over with my orders from Germany.

RATING: 7.6
The entire Keltis line is worthwhile, and this is one of the stronger entries in the series. It essentially makes Lost Cities playable by up to four, without sacrificing much tension. Having to worry about collecting wishstones (obtained, first-come first-served, by discarding two like numbered cards) adds a level of interaction that Lost Cities lacked. Hugely recommended.

I've historically given a 10 to the original Lost Cities, my most played 2 player game of all time in the 10-15 minute niche. This version allows for 4 players, a plus, and provides the twist of playing pairs for stone cards (a more powerful scoring colour effectively) which drives more action into the discard piles. But it allows players to play in both directions which lessens discard action and reduces the decision tension associated with Lost Cities. Add some wild cards and cabooses for a touch more variety. Still, it's much the same feel, easy to teach, easy to play, a solid time filler.

RATING: N/A
Extremely portable version of Keltis/Lost Cities card play which at last maybe suited towards 4 players (I not keen on so many cards removed in the 2 player versions, so would rather play the original 2 hander for card counting purposes).

Some neat variants such as: an extra suit played to your side is worth a point or can be a wild; discarding pairs to pick up stones means some juicy options to draw from the discard, so instilling so angst as does the game end cards which are not visible and extremely unpredictable. I like how the scoring is alot easier than the predecessors, though a summary card for each player would have been helpful.

Reason for the game not rating as well as the older versions is the out of kilter distribution in the deck, and being totally themeless. But as always the gameplay  will always be interesting to play.

Where Lost Cities feels incomplete to me, this feels about as good as this sort of design could be. 

Also: no more pointless board needlessly making the box big.

Edit: On further plays it's become clear that the wish stones are too powerful, which makes the first part of the game too procedural. In a game this length and weight, that's a massive hit. (reduced from 8/10 to 6/10)

This has similar mechanics to Lost cities however, the game plays quite different.  We like this one and would be interested to see how things play out as a four player since Lost Cities is only 2.  The scoring is more conservative here so players can be aggressive and not suffer a horrible lost.  Also the race to gather wishing stones is interesting as one presses their luck to try to regain cards that were used on these stones.  There is even less theme in this compared to lost cities if that is possible but I think I like it a little better. games seems to vary a little bit more with this one.  Very good filler.  Edit:  oops played the points cards wrong the first few games.  They are a lot harder to use than effectively than I thought.  Great game that builds upon the Lost cities mechanic

The card game inspired by a board game, which was inspired by a card game. This iteration of the Lost Cities card game allows for multiplayer fun instead of just two player or two teams. This game is much friendlier and more forgiving than Lost Cities, but the tension is nearly gone.

On the surface, I really like a lot of the changes in this game. Being able to build up or down, the wish stones which encourage more discarding and shuffling unneeded cards out of players hands, the distribution of cards and the neutral color all allow for a pretty smooth game play. In practice, I've found the wish stones to be a little too prominent in the game- taking away from the building-a-path heart- and possibly overpowered in their scoring. 

While the less restrictive play has something to do with it, I feel a large culprit for losing a lot of the tension in Lost Cities is the change from the hand multipliers to the end cards which simply extend your row by one card. In Lost Cities, there was a little bit of a gambling nature to it. You had to play a hand card before you started a row. And you often did this with no guarantee that you would be able to finish it. It was always tense trying to decide whether to play the hands or not. And it could pay off for you big if you succeeded. The end cards have very little tension to them at all, and there isn't the thrill of success or agony of failure that comes from playing the hand cards. Part of that is the rule that you can play cards from your hands down at the end of the game; there is no incentive to even play them during the game. The tension of trying to complete a row with a hand in it really made each play and draw in Lost Cities crucial. This game has less agony, but also less tension and as a result, less fun.

Maybe the best version of Lost Cities yet. It's a small card game - and that's all it should try to be. Plays up to four players and keeps the whole mechanic streamlined and simple while keeping it challenging and entertaining. I like the stone system in the game a lot - a very nice development because it livens up the discard pile. This one has a place in my collection as a good travel game to play with infrequent gamers.

Quite a clever little one. Quick, fun, not too random but also not exhaustingly brainy. Can be played intuitively without becoming boring. Lacks long-term depth, but thats not a huge problem, because thats not what I want this game to do for me.

Építs különböző színű és értékű kövekből növekvő vagy csökkenő minél hosszabb oszlopokat, közben gyűjts szerencseköveket is. Jól működő, gondolkodós, mégis gyorsan zajló kártyás játék. Tulajdonképpen kétfajta nyerési stratégia van, ami ötvözhető, ezen túl azonban szerencse kérdése, hogy éppen milyen lap kerül a kezünkbe a talonból. Ettől függetlenül egy jó kis játékról van szó.

Another classically boring Knizia game. So far BattleLine is the only 5 suited card game of his that I really enjoy.  This was just dreadfully dull, and everything came down to the luck of the draw.

Funny that this is the card game version of the board game based on a card game, but it turns out that it's pretty good! In fact, I'm pretty sure  I prefer it to Lost Cities because it plays smoothly, scoring is much simpler, and it even accommodates more players!

--- Summary ---
The deck is again numbered 0-10, with only 1 each of 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10 (and 2 of the others) in each color. There are also point cards (#1-9) and capstones (2/color). Deal each player 6? cards. Lay out the treasure stones (#1-9) in the center. On your turn, do one of the following:
- play a color card in front of yourself, starting to or adding to the cards of that color (may play ascending OR descending; duplicates OK). Once capstone played, may no longer play to that color.
- play a point card in a separate pile (any order); at end, these will be worth 1VP each
- play a point card onto a colored pile (must be same number)
- discard a card to a central discard area (separate pile for each color)
- discard 2 cards of any color, but same number, to take the like-numbered treasure stone.
After playing, draw back up to original hand size (take cards from discard pile and/or draw deck). Game ends when 5 piles have been capped, or last card of draw deck drawn. Then score VP per color pile (same as Keltis), for point card pile, and for treasure stones; negative points if not enough collected. Most VP wins.

Only Knizia could pull off a great card game version of a board game based upon a card game.  He might be the only designer with enough audacity to even attempt such an undertaking.  He succeeds in creating a unique version that features the same fast gameplay and difficult choices that are hallmarks of his other designs.  Knizia is a genius!

Completely replaced normal keltis for me. It feels exactly the same, but is slightly less random (still quite some randomness from the cards, but at least someone with a lucky opening hand won't get a ton of extra moves etc.)

The way you obtain the stones is also more interesting, since you have to discard 2 same numbers and the decision to take the stone, but give your opponent those cards to take can be quite interesting.

I prefare it with 2 players, since it feels the most "strategic" since you can actually discard without helping other players.

RATING: 7
Not knowing Keltis, i can't compare. However it is a very good game. More to think about than lost cities, lacks some of the tension because points are for number of cards in rows than than the values of  the cards. However, can play with more than 2. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
You would think that by now, the idea behind Lost Cities would have been used to its full. But no, Knizia proves that with some minor rules twists, he can make another game that is equally interesting and fun as Keltis itself. Again, there's turn angst, risk management and timing, all the things that make these game so entertaining to play.
I can recommend this to anyone who likes Lost Cities.

[KOSMOS 09 edition] {Celtic; hand-management, set-collection; optimal 3p} Keltis: Das Kartenspiel would be a nice game if it appeared before Lost Cities, or Lost Cities: the Board Game.  It is still a nice game: good player interactive, challenging hand management, quick and fun.  The game time is appropriate (around 30 mins).  It appears it's more tactical in a 3p game. 4p game is still nice, nonetheless.  Luck is not very important in this game. (I believe it's not important in all Lost Cities variants.)  Collection of wishing stone is so important that one just can't ignore!  So far, I enjoy each game.

The card illustration is pedestrian but it's still better than a bunch of number cards.

I’ve grown to like Keltis & its derivatives a lot. This one has grey wildcards (with restricted use), coloured end cards to add a card or two to a colour, plus you discard a pair to gain a wishstone. A small box makes for great portability.

The true multiplayer Lost Cities. This pretty much makes the board version redundant, but note that the (already little) player interaction diminishes with no. of players.

RATING: 9
I've never played Lost Cities so no comment on how this compares.

This is a really good game. It's kind of like Knizia took the very basic idea of "play a card, draw a card" and fit as many tough choices as possible into it. The wishing stones add an additional way to gain points, but they also bring about more decisions because you need at least a couple of them to avoid negative points.

This may be the perfect light card game. Simple enough to explain to anybody in a couple of minutes, but enough nuance and tension to keep anyone engaged.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A lot like lost cities, but also so different.  The ability to go higher or lower and the tension of making sure you don't discard a card that somebody else can use.  There is also the added trick of having to get wishing stones so you do not get negative points.  This game is so much fun and we really enjoy playing it.

A really fun filler and a variant of Knizia's classic lost cities. I like the ability to create both ascending and descending sequences. This removes the artificial constraints of holding high cards and being unable to play them efficiently ala lost cities. A hand of high cards will not make game play unbalanced. I am on the fence about wishing stones. Not sure if they add much to the game and seems rather tacked on and forces players to at least pick one stone to avoid massive penalties. I do however love the neutral card play for either extending chains or playing them straight up as points. The best feature of this game is that it plays up to FOUR! Something that lost cities cannot accommodate.  In the end, this game is different enough from Lost Cities and a worthy addition to the collection.

Easily surpasses Lost Cities the card game, Lost Cities the board game, and vanilla Keltis.  I'd rank this third best in the Lost Cities/Keltis line behind Das Orakel and Neue Wege, Neue Ziele.  I'm blown away that this isn't recommended more often given that it's deeper than Lost Cities the card game which seems to be mention ad nauseum around here. Even more surprising since this plays 2p to 4p unlike Lost Cities.

You try to make chains with your cards in order to gain points.
I only played a two player game which is hopefully not the right amount of players to play it because it was very boring.

Fast, fun and small. Everything that was great about the board game in a fraction the size and much more accessible to non-gamers as it appears to be "just a card game"

I like it a bit more than Coloretto as well because it doesnt have that same, "Take that..." feeling to it but you can play strategically and hold out on other players to force their hand. 

One of the few games my wife has asked to play another round of immediately after finishing.

Enjoyed a 2p, although it takes some getting used to after playing so much Lost Cities. Want to try with 3 or 4 and see how that plays as that will determine if it's worth keeping.
'17/11/08: I don't often feel like playing a Keltis-like with more than two, and I have Lost Cities, which is more useful as an introductory game and really well honed. For multiplayer Keltis I'm keeping Das Orakel for now, so this one is being traded.

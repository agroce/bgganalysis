[I]tl;dr - A good abstract is hard to find -- even more so a good abstract that plays 1-3 players. I'm reminded of Carcassonne, with an interesting 'stack management' mechanic thrown in.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Micropul is an interesting little abstract that is one of the gold standards for PNP games. I tried it out and have been favorably impressed. It's flexible, playing from one to three players (though two-player is the best, as that's how the game was originally designed). 

In Micropul, you're trying to lay claim to blocks of micropul, which are on the tiles you're playing. There are also powerful catalysts, which give you tile draw or let you take an extra turn. Additionally, you have a supply of tiles from which you will draw your hand. At the end of the game, you score points from groups of micropul on the board and from every tile you've managed to get into your supply (you can only build your supply through harnessing the catalysts on the tiles). 

I like the challenge to claim and close groups on the board. Unlike Carcassonne, there's a timing problem to grabbing a group, because they can be hard to close, and if your opponent knows you've claimed a group, they can make it very difficult for you to claim. Even so, groups can be a reliable way to pick up 10 or 20 points at a time. 

You will also score points for tiles in your hand and supply. The only way you can add tiles to your supply is through the catalysts, so the game forces you to engage with the central map (rather than just avoiding the map and trying to stock up on as many tiles as you can), and depending on your tile draw, you may not get as many catalysts as you need, at least, if you totally ignore the on-map groups.

Micropul is an elegant game, but as an abstract it's got stiff competition. [thing=3][/thing], [thing=2655][/thing], and even [thing=949][/thing] would hit the table before this one. Might just be crowded out in a genre full of good games.

I'm not a fan of abstracts, but this is one hell of a great game -- either with two or solo. Thoroughly enjoy this title. Make a nice set for yourself. You won't be sorry.

Superb solitaire (9.5) and very decent 2-player (7.5).

Where did this come from? Hideously addictive, and free to boot! You need to be lucky with initial draws to get into the 100  scores, but somehow, with less than ideal tiles, the puzzle to make a reasonable score, or even find a way to stay alive, becomes even more intriguing. Simple rules, simple idea, a great online solitaire version, and the hours just fly away. 107 has been my highest solitaire so far. 

The interaction of tile placement, score building, tile generation, hand management and endgame triggers flows is very coherent, and the way that available pool tiles are acquired is particularly inspired. A lot of solitaire games become more mechanic as the game progresses. Not here. The endgame has real sting in the tail, when placement without causing further tiles to come from the draw-pile suddenly becomes a more pressing focus.

Making my own set from wood has just gone to the top of my to-do list, so we can take this on our hot-chocolate-cake-and-a-wee-game jaunts. The best bit, if the other one is late in arriving, you won't be bored waiting. You'll probably not even notice. A bit like the theme of this one. Apparently it's got one.

A very pleasant tile laying game.  However, I'm not entirely sure I like the emphasis on building a large supply stack.  I felt that the game rewards luck more than it needs to, since you don't really want to draw tiles from your supply stack to your available pool as it costs you a point every time you do so.  This means that whoever gets lucky on the draws they do perform gets a pretty decent advantage.  Still, I liked the game enough to bring it out once in a while.

This free-to-print game (also available from the designer as a purchasable game on lovely wooden pieces) is easy to assemble and a decent 2-player filler.  All of the cards can be printed out on a single sheet of paper in black-and-white--this is a big plus because I have two printers at home that both (currently) only print in greyscale.  The copy I "own" is printed out on cardstock.

My first PnP game. I made it by hand with a pair of scissors, a few sharpies (colored for tokens and black for the tiles), and 1 sheet of standard lightweight cardstock in about an hour's time. 

Seems like an abstract Carcassonne. The wife has played Carc many times and loves it, but didn't quite "get" this game the first play through. Art and theme make a huge difference to casual gamers, so this one may be reserved for those a little more used to abstract games.

I really need to make better tiles.

The rules feel a bit artificial and can't be surmised simply by watching a game, the way Go, Palago and spangles maybe could be.

They are simple enough to be easily undersood though and have enough repercussions to force us to think about the strategy a bit.

Deserves more playing.

2009-11-16 8plays
It seems that the main strategy is all about getting more tiles. "Claiming" the resources can be important but it seems to be all about using your tiles to be able to utilise the '+2 draws' whilst denying the opponent access to them. Having a finite hand size and having both hands visible keeps it manageable enough to plan ahead not only your own move but the opponent's too. You can take advantage of their weaknesses and keep tiles for when THEY have a +2 draw...

2099-12-03 27 plays
Played against a human for the first time (smcg). He showed me how to properly use the extra moves - setting up an opportunity to score multiple times with a draw 2.

The game does contain some luck - the pieces with the drawing power and an adjacent empty spot seem like the best pieces to have generally and there are times when you are gambling on getting certain types of tiles to either close a group or prevent your opponent from doing so - but it is far more about skill since each piece can be used beneficially in certain situations and there are so many macro-decisions to make. When to claim a group, when to sabotage, when to close a group, checking to see if you can score your draw-2 multiple times (or if your opponent will be able to claim it before you do)...

[b]Rating based on - 20+ plays, 1 player, 2 player[/b]
Crafted on 9/5/15 Abstract Tile Placement with Activating Powers. A one sheet Print 'n Play game with many different and varied designs. Try to make/expand large groups of micropul, claim them for yourself, and close them off while earning extra tiles or turns by placing tiles. One of our favourite tile placement games with a good level of hand management thrown in. I've played both solo and 2 player and I like both but will give the slight edge to 2 player...just because I am pretty inconsistent at getting solo games to the table . If you've played Ingenious with the solo rules, then this feels similar. For 2 players it's a light, thinky, but not brain burning game where you can have a decent level of blocking, or expanding your opponent's territory so they can't score as only closed groups score...dependent on tile draw of course. A great game to take on your travels as it packs small and the table footprint is also quite small.

I made my own set. For solitaire play, it's a good game: interesting, easy rules, plays quickly, doesn't take up a lot of room, either in play or in storage, and it feels less like a puzzle than many solitaire games which, to my mind, is a good thing. There is a fair amount of luck involved, but not so much that it hurts play. As a 2-player game (which I haven't tried), I would imagine that it would fall short in comparison to the Carcasonne base game in terms of difficulty of decisions, aesthetics, and fun factor.

Apr08: Pretty darn cool Print&Play.  It's a single black and white sheet, so it really doesn't take any effort.  It's known for it's solitaire play, but I've only played it 2-players.  It is short, but packed with interesting decisions.  It actually has a few innovative ideas for a mostly abstract tile laying game.

I thought another theme would better assist teaching the mechanics, so I wrote up some alternative rules here:

initial rating could rise...

A good little abstract for 2 players (maybe 3 or 4 by adding pieces) and well worth printing out to make it, makes a great little weeknight diversion.

Some room for strategy here for sure and quite analytical but it moves along at a good pace and has a good little play time of about 20 - 30 minutes. 3 ways to score keeps you interested as well as enough going on the board also. You get points for having "closed" groups of micropul (1 each), tiles in hand (1 each) but also more importantly tiles in your supply which are 2 points each. 3 things to do on your turn, play one of your 3 stones to claim some micropul, take a tile from your supply to your hand and play a tile. 

You can plan and setup some good moves with the 'play again' catalyst tiles and the whole claiming of groups of micropul plays a little like Medina where you want to wait until it gets bigger but if you wait your opponent might grab it.  Once a group is claimed it will not score unless it is closed at the end of the game, this makes it tempting to play into your opponents group to make sure it doesn't close but it is a risky venture as you are making the group bigger at the same time.  Might be suited for 3 player, 4 player and especially 4 player teamplay by adding more tiles but you will be adding more downtime inherent to abstract games as well.

RATING: 7.5
Free print'n play download.  A pleasant abstract tile laying game for 1 or 2 players.  Laying a single tile serves two purposes:  1) to orthogonally attach like micropuls in order to 2) activate catalysts to draw more tiles.  This game is a balancing act of attempting to expand, claim and close territory for end-game points while at the same time drawing enough tiles to stay in play.  BTW, the 'physics' theme is nil, so don't expect a lesson in nuclear fission.

Solid print and play game. The interplay between getting large stacks and getting large board points makes for some very interesting choices. Plays fast.

The solo play game, however, is horrendous. Don't think they should even be included. This is a 2 player game through and through.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Printed and played. Extended solo play has confirmed the initial rating, as reaching top scores becomes a matter of increasingly unlikely draw sequences. Once you know which factors must click to result in a top score, you'll be able to halt most games within a few moves, knowing you can't get there. Consequently I'd recommend playing not just to beat your all-time top score, but to beat your top score of the month, top score of the trip you're on, and so forth. Rating might go up if the 2-player game proves interesting. Personal high score: 107.

Update: Lowered the rating from 6 to 5 as part of general ratings update, not having played this for two years. Have only played one or two 2-player games.

This game really deserves to be published and put onto the bakelite pieces.  Great 2 player game that takes around half hour to print and cut out.  Then all you need is 6 beads 3 of one color and 3 of another and you are set.  If you haven't printed it and made one you should do that now.

It's abstract, it's very fast, but it gives you some thinking opportunities. Great for 2 players quick brain warm-up. Carcassonne-like - that's an advantage, and a disadvantage in the same time - I don't play it any more, since I got my Carcassonne...

I've tried the solitaire mode recently, and it's rather interesting if you have nothing else to do and nobody to play with at the time.

Really nice game. The only thing that seems broken to me is the scoring mechanics. Because each tile in your stack is worth 2 points, and completing an area will worth approximately 1.5 point per tile. So there is actually no interest in making an effort to create areas because it is worth more to just stack tile. According to JF, making it 1 point per tile in the stack is not enough. So my suggestion is that each dot in a closed region are worth 2 points. Each dot in an open region are worth 1. The big dots are worth 1 if open and 5 if in a closed region.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Solid abstract in which you gain points by claiming areas of connected dots of the same color, 2 points for each tile in your storage stack, and one point for each tile in your hand.

Selfmade version, print & play.
After first 2 plays: Great little abstract looking tile-laying game. I could easily rate this one much higher if I would consider the "for free" factor.
I think everybody should give this a try, since it's so easy to make: Just print it out on heavy paper (I upsized it a bit, and printed it on one 200 grams sheet) Cut it with scissors, ready to play in 5 minutes.
Makes an incredible small game to take anywhere (I'll definitely try this on a plane)
Update: best free holiday game! Fun, tactical, fast. Rating goes up half a point.

[u]24-May-2015[/u]:  This is another tile-layer that plays one or two players.  The solo game is a point attack affair.  You are trying to create three separate groups of micropul (I think the singular and plural are the same spelling...maybe).  The larger they are, the more VP they generate.

However, you must also manage the draw pile, your personal stack (facedown tiles), and your hand tiles (faceup tiles).  As soon as the draw pile has been depleted, the game ends.  You score 2VP per tile in your personal stack and 1VP for those in your hand.  So, you need to find the right balance of playing tiles to the board, your stack, and your hand to maximize your endgame points...not an easy thing to do despite how it may sound.

Super fun if you enjoy tile-laying games.  There are many graphic redesigns to choose from as well, so there's probably something there that will catch your eye.  Very much recommended.

RATING: 8
Sleek, not too heavy but indeed very solid tile-laying abstract that works well both for two players and as a solitaire. The design is exquisite: the different combinations of white and dark dots and spaces in the tiles allow for nuanced but varied approaches to the game. The balance of tiles in the reserve for more points and open in hand for safer plays is quite difficult to reach, and closing big groups towards the end of a game can become very thrilling.

Resembling, more or less, Carcassonne stripped down to the core and given more depth, Micropul would already be a hell of a game with a price tag on. Many thanks to the author for making it free to print and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As stripped-down as abstracts get, but pretty good for all that. An idea or two have been pinched from Rat Hot and Carcassonne, and the alleged 'theme' is terribly dry, but this is still among the best P&P 2-player available.

I now have the 'Farmer' theme on lovely magnetic tiles, which is fully worth half a point on anybody's rating!

Neat little print and play with strong ideas behind it. Tile placement is revolved around some iffy physics theme and awful sounding card effects.

But the game is a solid abstract where players have to balance tile laying with scoring, the drawing of new tiles as well as the oppotunity to score large clusters of 'micropul'.

Should be rethemed.

1 play. A decent abstract game that I would normally rate a 6, but the components are annoying - the tiles are not all the same size and it all barely fits in the box!

Can't argue with the price. (It is free, just print and play ... well print and glue and wait and cut and play.) Not heavy, like a good card game?

Hand made Big Bang version.  

Played six times now -- great game!  I'm not very good, but I really like it... maybe my new favourite tile laying game.  This needs to be published!

Edit 01/20/2010:  Played the solitaire version a bunch over the holidays... at first I was enraptured.  Buuuut, it lost its lustre after a couple dozen plays.  My strategy isn't totally finely honed, but I don't find the solo game engaging enough to bother improving.  That said, the 2p game IS very good and still very engaging to me.

The object of the game is NOT to place tiles and claim groups like in Carcassonne, it's to build a very large supply.

You build a supply by putting tiles on the table in ways that will increase your supply faster than you drain it.
To remedy this expenditure of tiles you can claim groups, but it's not nearly as efficient as building a large supply.

Many people misunderstand this about the game and seem to think the supply-strategy is too strong: IT'S THE POINT PEOPLE!! :D

After seeing this game lauded by many people, I finally downloaded the rules and printed out my own set one afternoon and played a few solo games.  Later that evening, I found the online version and played that a couple of times.  Then that night right before the stores closed, I went out and bought tiles and clear labels to make my own set and stayed up until 1:30am putting it together!

Its is a PnP game, and as such is an excellent buy.  It is highly portable and highly accessible.  But I just don't get the wow feeling from it and the sense of achievement from it as I do with other AS games.  This is probaly due to not being able to glance at it and immediately see how well or not you are doing.  From memory it prints on one sheet of A4, so really it is probably a good PnP to start your collection with.

Traded for a simple black/white homemade set at Unity Games XVII in Jan 11, finally got to play a game. I really like it, especially because I love 2 player abstracts, and this one really works. I've now made my own set with one of the very nice graphical versions on BGG, and will love to play lots more!

I'm quite surprised how much I enjoyed playing the flash version of this game.  After hundreds plays (solo), it appears the random draw of the tiles heavily influences the final score.  If strategy played a stronger role, it would be an 8 or 9 in my book.

Rating based only on solo plays.  Even though I don't like abstracts much, I felt compelled to try this one after hearing it come up over and over again on BGG.  As expected, I was less than thrilled.  It isn't a bad game, exactly, but I didn't see what keeps so many BGGers making their own sets.  I would try it sometime versus another player, but I'm not exactly aching for the chance.

This isn't a bad game (the fact that it's free doesn't hurt), but the dry nature turns me off of it.  I like the way that careful planning can result in a HUGE turn, where you receive multiple actions and receive a large number of cards, but you're still at the mercy of the tile draw.  This is also a weird game in that I prefer the solitaire version better than the 2-player version.  Future plays may bump the rating up a smidge.

Just upgraded it to an 8. New tactics are unfolding, timing is critical, multiple paths to victory. And for some reason I can't put my fingers on it just is fun, doesn't feel dry or regimented.

Very enjoyable 2-player. I am new at it, so tactics unfold a little unexpectedly, but that is part of the fun. It is a real thinker. It has a spatial quality like Ingenious, but is unique.

I made my own set printing the large tiles from the file on BGG on adhesive paper, cutting them out and sticking them on a set of a kid's game of memory. Works and looks good.

I like micropul a lot.  You can go for large areas, go for smaller ones, go for lots of undrawn tiles for big points, blocking your opponents, extending your opponents so they can't enclose their areas, combos with extra turn tiles.  Lots of stuff going on for such a simple game.  We'll see if it lasts. :)

RATING: 6
It certainly was not what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting a lot: maybe something like [thing=164874][/thing] with a loosely tacked on theme, but yowzer, this was a card-playing video game!  Who drops paratroopers behind enemy lines with nothing but a pistol and tells an individual soldier to find an enemy ammo dump, fight your way through it, pick up weapons off of dead bodies, grab explosives, find a bunker, fight through it, sabotage a gun, and fight your way out?

Yeahhhhh, weird.  It felt like a game of Doom or Wolfenstein 3d, right down to the event that says you found a hot meal, add a point of health.

Weird, man, weird.

Yet it was oddly satisfying.  Maybe I miss the good old days of PC wargaming in college.

Finally assembled. LOTS of stuff to make for the full package, not all required to play.

This is quite a bit harder than its forefather ZIMP, this game is starting to click for me in its base form. With all the different additions such as the sceanrios, special ops, advanced rules, etc, this game has lots to explore.

Components are really nice looking. Wish the layout for the printing was better, but things are really nice.

RATING: 9
Another homerun in solo game design (well, game redesign).  This takes the "Zombie in My Pocket" formula, and really ups the ante with items and objectives. The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay keeps you coming back for more.  The game can be a simple Basic that plays out in 10-15 minutes, or you can make it as complex as you want with the additional expansions.  I like the Currahee add-on myself, fleshing out the Airborne component a bit more.  I didn't even mention the massive amounts of scenarios to play (w/ even just a stock game). This game convinced me to order an Artscow deck.  I only dock it a point because Zimp was first, but the designer has really taken the game into a lot more depth.  PnP at it's best!

Print and Play. This game was planned to release on Kickstarter, but the project manager (not the game designer) ran off to Australia with the money, along with the money raised from those who funded his other Kickstarter rip-off for Up Front. I lost money on the latter.

This is a fantastic solo game where your mission is to find the explosives at the ammo dump, make your way into the bunker, and plant the explosives in the gun room. Make it back to the entrance (basic game) or the drop zone (advanced game) before time or health runs out, and you win. Location tiles are drawn randomly, making the task easier or more impossible. The game also provides ways to make your mission easier or more difficult as you prefer.

There is quite a lot of expansion content which extends the variety considerably. I'm glad the author has made the print and play available so that its backers (and anyone else) can give it a try.

Great variation to Zombie in my Pocket.  Love the extra scenarios to add variety for each play.  Mine is an ArtsCow custom printed deck.

RATING: 5
The player represents an allied paratrooper, dropped into Normandy - they must find some explosives and disable a bunker gun room before time runs out.  Very simple print and play solo game.  A player on their turn moves, flipping a terrain card if entering a new location, then resolves an event card there.  The event card deck is only 10 cards deep, and the top 2 cards a discarded after each shuffle.  When the deck runs out, an hour passes, moving the game towards a conclusion.  Events are good - find stuff, heal, etc; or bad - enemy troops attack you, etc.  Combat is a simple differential, draining your health.  You have to locate the ammo dump to pull the explosives, then work your way into the bunker to find the gun room.  Cute, simple, works very well, and the artscow print/play decks look glorious.  The designer has piled up advanced rules, scenarios, and around a half dozen expansions on top of it - so it won't go stale any time soon.  10 minutes to play, and totally charming. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A well balanced light game. It can be solo, for 2 players or multi-player. It is definitely worth the trouble to print this nice artwork, glue it on cardboard for the land tiles and items and then play it. The rules are easily digested and implemented - they leave no questions or ambiguities. The booklet is a well done job by the designer and constitutes a dictionary on its own so much for the various weapons and items found on the battlefield during D-Day as well as for the expressions used in that era which their origin mystifies the vast majority. While a game play lasts 10-15 min., killing pleasantly one's time, one will return to pick it up from the shelf and give it one more try. There are so very many options and alternatives to this game that give an endless variety of play: mode of rules (easy or harder), multiple scenarios, items and special operatives. On top of these printing the rest of the expansions (which is worth it as well) will add even more flavor to your combat so that you never get bored playing it. A job well done!

Had Andrew Tullsen print the basic game cards with rulebook and campaign book. Then I printed some extra player aid cards with my Canon PIXMA on glossy photo paper. WOW! They came out great. Just printed backs on regular deskjet. Never thought to use my photo printer for print & play. Oh, and played the game tonight, enjoyed it a great deal! Fun, quick, and easy. With excellent artwork.

I made myself a copy of this little PnP on the printer at home with all the expansions. Even printed little boxes for the cards. All on very nice glossy cardboard stock. Looks like I am getting the hang of it.

Played a few quick games between Silent War, Steel Wolves, my Vassal game of Labyrinth with Blake Phillips, and my wife, eating, drinking, bathing...

Great little solitaire pick me up. Its very light, reminds me of B-17, as it has great narrative as your paratrooper makes its way to the Bunker and out. (B-17 is more thematic, less abstract and detailed though) Not heavy on decision, but more so than B-17, and there is certainly tons more replayability with all the expansions. (some expansions are better than others though). With the expansions in toll, there are a ton of weapons to choose from, more event cards and even different map tiles. All in all, amazing stuff for a free game. (Plays better than Zombies in My Pocket in my opinion). There is definitely plenty of room for chrome and improvements but the Zillions of scenarios should keep anyone busy.

Best of all, I played about 7 games under an hour, 3 of them wins. There is some deck management involved and a little luck with tile draws, but there is definitely skill involved as well. 

Its a little on the Euro-side of Wargaming, but the advantage is that I have played a two player game of this with my wife (yes, it supports multiplayer) and she actually enjoyed it! Much easier than The Settlers of Catan Card Game she thought and much quicker to play.

If you like ZimP, but thought it could use a little more variety, this game is for you! There are a ton of expansion rules/cards that you can use. The game has a slightly different rule set, but the basic mission is the same. Get item, go do something with it somewhere else. AimP adds a new requirement - Now get out.

My favorite two-player WW2 board game playable in under 20 minutes.  

The basic game is good - but the high rating is for the scope of the optional rules, expansions, scenarios and campaigns available.  I'm mostly using the cards from Artscow - but the print and play stuff works fine as well.

This well-designed, WWII themed (ZimP mod), mainly solitaire game packs a lot of punch into a small play time which makes for a satisfyingly quick filler with tons of replayability when adding the expansions cards and tiles. (Airborne in my Pocket Deluxe edition print & play by Andrew Tullsen.)

Awesome solitaire game.  Rated an 8 for the fun especially considering it is a solitaire game and considering the expansions I own.  Exp - Kilroy, Curahee, and Geronimo.  This is one of the first games I turn to for a quick solitaire game when I just have a little time at night.  

My printer stinks so I ordered the cards from Artscow.  Total with shipping for the base game and the expansions I listed was under $25.  Quality of the cards is EXCELLENT.  Amiral has done a outstanding job in producing this.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting little solitaire title. While not too terribly deep, it offers more than its ancestor (Zombie in my Pocket). I prefer the WWII theme over the zombie theme. Serves as a small diversion I can toss in my suitcase when I'm stuck in my hotel room. The Artscow version I have is quite nice, and I found a use for my airborne Axis & Allies miniature figure.

RATING: 5
This game's a bit like a remix album. Uwe fans will probably enjoy it greatly, whereas those who find his games hit-or-miss will be lukewarm.

Blends the combo-building possibilities from Glass Road  with the simple worker placement of Agricola, plus a bit of a logistics puzzle in getting a decent fish income and getting them into your supply. 

I was quite excited for this - an Uwe game with shares! - but there's nothing economic about this title whatsoever, the shares are just a means of trading VP for fishy dividends.

I've grown a little weary of the standard Uwe worker placement formula - my fave of his is Glass Road by a large margin - so this really wasn't what I was looking for. Removes the card play and resource management from Glass Road, two fascinating elements, and doesn't come close to replacing them with anything of equal interest. 

I also felt the Elders generally didn't warrant the price of admission as they bottleneck your fish income, but that's an impression after a single play. But if I get my way I won't be playing this again.

How can this be released by an accomplished author and an experienced company in 2017? It's unbelievably bland and repetitive. And even if you like this style of play (despite a million other games doing the same but better), the game disappoints in so many ways. The dozen available cards are designed lazily ("buildings" are just cards with text, nothing else) giving me a feeling this is still a prototype.

The only accomplishment of this game is solidifying the clichee of dry eurogames.

I'm a really big fan of this game.  The more i play it, the more i like it.  It feels like a big Uwe game, but in a fraction of the time.  It gives you that feeling of what should i do, i don't have the time to do everything i want.  In my opinion that is a sign of a good game.

Everything looks cool, the buildings and elders can create nice engines and make players very asymetric.

First Play: Pretty clear rulebook which left no doubt this was a game by Uwe Rosenberg. Worker placement, workers and buildings like Agricola, flavours of Glass Road and AFfO, I was concerned that this was just going to be a lash up. I had no reason to worry, this is an engaging game with plenty to think about and a need to stay flexible as other players take the Elders and buildings that you had plans for. I'm sure with more plays combos will become apparent, but it will be fun to discover them.

Not heavy but still engaging. Coins are a bit fiddly but the player boards are nice and thick. Three card decks for the buildings offers great replayability. A keeper for me.

Nothing offensive here. It has the virtue of its brevity, and simple straight forward rule set.

But it is YET another Rosenberg that is completely similar to ALL the other Rosenberg titles. Can barely tell the difference between his titles as they’re so samey samey. 
In this one, you're collecting wood, fish and money, and converting them to boats and buildings to points.

Uwe needs to wipe his slate clean, and come up with something completely new and different.

Im a huge fan of Agricola, Le Harve, Feast for Odin, Caverna, and Ore Et Labora - that being said, this game is sort of offensive in how inoffensive it is.  There is nothing new, none of the gameplay is really that compelling, and the decisions feel somewhat watered down.  The game works just fine, but there is so much better out there.  Honestly, it feels like this one was made to sell on the name of the designer.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game and Uwe proves he can design a streamlined game free from unnecessary bloat (see Caverna and Feast for Odin). Even better is that with 2p this can play in an hour or less and offer solid decisions. No worry about expanding your workforce either, Nusfjord still has some unique spins on shareholding and resource distribution that make this game stand out a bit more from the other typical worker placement fare. The 7 rounds with 3 actions each go by quick too and you do get that feeling that you cannot do everything you want over the course of the game. Similar to Glass Road the game features a number of buildings that come out each game with the added bonus that some of these building will be personal buildings to you at the start of a given round before they become shared to all a few rounds later. Even with the buildings divided into 3 decks you won't see all of them in a single game. 

My only complaint about this game is some aspects of the game feel shrunk to fit in the standard size Lookout box. Player boards split into 2, small resources, and even smaller coins probably keep this game from being a 9 for me. However, this game brings it in every other aspect and Nusfjord now competes with Glass Road for my favorite Uwe game.

Really enjoying this so far which I didn’t expect from first impressions when reading about the game. It has an abbreviated duration and # resources so the total package feels much more manageable than earlier, larger Uwe games- not that the other games are unwieldy but rather that this is great for a briefer, lighter experience. The footprint still sprawls somewhat though. 

The play offers depth of decisions in looking for the synergy between buildings and elders while managing one’s three resources (fish, wood, gold). This is lighter fare from my favorite designer and I am liking it, which is a relief as I have not cared at all for any of the recent Tetris-piece games of late (Patch, Cottage, Indian, Odin). Hopefully this starts another good run for Mr. Rosenberg.

How can a worker placement game make me feel like I'm in a small fishing village on a fjord, listening to strange gulls crying. Nusfjord is great. Easy to play, fun choices about how to build your small fishing empire. Fun that you can succeed with a large or small fleet. Games change a lot based on the cards that you play with (mostly in 2 player.) In spite of that, not feeling a lot of need to continue to explore after 7 plays.

I seem to be in the minority on this one, but I didn't care for it. But that's mainly for what it is, i.e. a game with lots of unique dudes to acquire and unique buildings to build. There is virtually no common game being played between the players. I may be missing a gene or something, but I'm not sure why people dig this sort of thing.

A wonderful Rosenberg game, and very different to the others.

[thing=234277][/thing] shows that Uwe Rosenberg is still on form and still coming up with innovative new angles on the Worker Placement mechanism.  This is my favourite Essen 2017 game so far.  And it really is not like any other of his games.  Really.

It certainly isn't like Glass Road, a game it lazily gets compared to.  Glass Road is closer to Witches Brew/Broom Service than it is to Nusfjord.  I love Glass Road and I love Nusfjord, but the only similarity is the designer and a few forests.

Nusfjord plays in about 20 minutes per player, even on your first game, and plays well especially with five, though four is very good too.

Nusfjord is an excellent medium weight game centred largely around the interesting fish-serving mechanic - this mechanic generates gold/vps as well as being the element which triggers the ability to use the powerful Elder cards. The game is therefore about the tactical timing of this fish serving, as well as the strategic building of an engine of card combos, your fishing ability, and your fish retention abilities. 

It feels very different from any other Uwe games, despite the apparent similarities with worker placement and building powers.

I like this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who likes Rosenberg games.

Kicsit kevésnek éreztem az opciót, nehézkesen megy minden, a 2-3 féle nyersanyag nem ad elég kombinációt. A megvalósítás se a legjobb, a szöveges kártyákkal nagyon nehézkes a játék. Hogy mikor mi megy készletbe és mi az udvarra, szintén nehezen átlátható. Cserébe annyira nem hosszú, aránylag könnyedebb is talán. A pontozós épületek elég imbának tűntek elsőre.

Másodjára egy picikét jobb élmény volt. Az épületek sok változatosságot visznek a játékba, de kár, hogy a karakterek fixek, hiszen azok dobhatnának igazán sokat, de nem merték ezekszerint meglépni ott a kombinálást. Kettesben sajnos nem annyira csillog, mert a terítés és a részvénykirakás sántít.

In the true worker placement mode, this game is very attractive. has a very good rules and appendix book, and fairly quickly understood parts.

Good box size - only slghtly biiger than it need be, but standard so it fits.  One downside, would have preferred meeples, so I bought them. They block out less of the action desciprion.

RATING: 6
Nusfjord is a very typical Rosenberg: gathering resources, using them to build buildings or feed people for lending a hand, elements you have probably seen once or twice in his earlier offerings. But, Nusfjord is also a very atypical Rosenberg game: only three different resource types, no conversion chains, an unusually restrained design. Now, the obvious question is: what does that buy us? My conclusion so far is: not that much. It's a Rosenberg for those who generally (and possibly theoretically) like the ideas in his bigger games but find them too sprawling or too long, too taxing or too harsh. Other than that, I don't think it's a game anyone has been waiting for.

Ein Wunder ist geschehen: Uwe Rosenberg hat eine Diät gemacht und es tatsächlich geschafft seine geliebte Tauschwarenkette auf drei (!) Tauschwaren zu reduzieren. Ich wiederhole: drei (!). Namentlich Geld, Holz und Fisch. Und vorrangig um den geht es thematisch auf den Lofoten. Fischfang mit süßen, blauen Holzfischen. Doch nicht nur die Tauschwaren sind weniger geworden. Auch Gebäude und Helfer und Helfershelfer, hier Fischfangexperten, "Älteste" genannt, sind geschrumpft. Dafür sind die Texte gewohnt lang und typisch Rosenberg geblieben. Lesen, lesen, lesen, was man bauen und welchen der fischerdorfweisen Ältesten man sich auf sein norwegisches Spielerboard holen will. Und alles kostest Geld, Holz und Fisch, Fisch, Fisch. Verleihnix würde weinen vor Glück. Die diätische Verschlankung des Prinzips Rosenberg tut vor allem jenen wohl, die das Ausufernde dick haben. So gesehen ist NUSFJORD nur eine Gräte von ODIN. Darüber hinaus ist natürlich auch NUSFJORD ein archetypischer Rosenberg, der innerhalb seiner großen Spielidee immer durch sich selbst wandert. Auch geographisch geht es auf der eingeschlagenen Nordroute weiter gen Wintermantelwetter: Ostfriesland, Skandinavien, nun also das nördliche Norwegen. Man darf gespannt sein wo der Nordmann Rosenberg als nächstes rauskommt, wenn er Norway in nördlicher Richtung verläßt. Handelnde Eskimos? Tausche Eisbärenfell gegen Hundeschlitten? Vielleicht rutscht Uwe auf der anderen Seite des Globus auch wieder runter und landet endlich mal in der Sonne. Das täte seinem Teint gut, der im Warenlager immer wieder neu stets an der gleichen Kette tüftelt. Wo immer die Reise geht, wir sind schon da und warten auf Dich, Uwe.

Played the final prototype and even though it's in the same vein as most of his games lately (Agricola and stuff), this one is on the better half. Reminds me somewhat of Puerto Rico, as you really need to be careful not to present the perfect option for the following player.

There are still plenty of tiles and stuff in this game, but feels less overwhelming than some of his other games. There are some quite different pathes to victory, which is great of course.

Pretty good game, even though it didn't blow me away (which is really hard nowadays). This should get some well deserved love.

Playing this game feels like I'm playing a combination of Uwe's past games - Agricola and Glass Road. The game is actually pretty streamlined and easy to learn. Play time is also relatively short for an Uwe game but there is depth in this game. I enjoyed my 5p game of Nusfjord, but I feel like it didn't scale well with 2p and was rather boring at that player count. Recommended to play at higher player counts.

KEEPER SOLO
I traded two very collectable games for this because playing them was a brain burn and I knew this would be a breeze. Best trade I ever did. I somehow knew this would become my favourite game by my favourite designer. I play Uwe games exclusively solo because they are so relaxing - almost non-games. My favourite games are business games with shares like 18xx, farming games and ship games. Hey presto, Uwe introduces a fishing company with shares that builds and owns boats. Bravissimo! And the artwork is beautiful.

Once again same old basic mechanics used by Uwe. So very similar to Caverna, Agricola, Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small etc. - you name it. These aren't my cup of tea and Nusfjord is not an exception. More I play it, less I want it to play more. Still have to admit, that at last Uwe has improved a little bit: now there isn't all the things available (or shown) from the beginning AND there are different card decks to use. And because Nusfjord is a bit more streamlined than other Uwe games, then it's a little bit better...

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

I was surprised to find myself enjoying this one and wouldn't mind exploring this one a bit more. Feels like some sort of combination of a number of his previous works/mechanics which he mish mashed together into a very functional game. You build a few of your own action spots by hiring elders which can only be activated by fish on the public table.

Ein Arbeiter-Einsetz Spiel der leichteren Klasse.
Die Spieler setzen der Reihe nach ihre Arbeiter ein und erhalten dadurch Boote, die den Fischfang (Fischressourcen am Anfang der Runde) erhöhen, Ältesten-Karten, die Sonderarbeitsfelder bieten, aber auch jede Runde Fisch kostet, man kann Gebäude bauen, die Sondereigenschaften und Siegpunktbedingungen mitbringen oder auch direkt Ressourcen erhalten. Nach 7 Runden ist das Spiel auch schon vorbei und wer dann mehr Punkte hat gewinnt.
Das Spiel ist ein, wie schon erwähnt, leichter Worker-Placement Vertreter. Ich finde es sehr nett gemacht und würde es auch gerne nochmals spielen um zu sehen ob ichs besser machen kann, aber es fühlt sich mechanisch an. Das Thema hakt hier und da manchmal. Jeder Älteste nimmt mir pro Runde 1 Fisch weg und bekommt auch bei jeder Nutzung einen weiteren Fisch. Wenn er 3 Fische auf sich gesammelt hat, erhält der Spieler einen zurück... Warum? Mechanisch sinnig, aber thematisch? Man kann mit einem Aktionsfeld 1 Wald abholzen und erhält dafür 5 Holz. Mit einem anderen kann man seine Wälder durchforsten und erhält soviel Holz wie man Wälder hat, soweit okay. Aber mit einer weiteren Aktion kann man 2 Wälder wachsen lassen, in der gleichen Zeit wächst ein dichter Wald, in der ich auch 1 Wald abholze? Was sind das für Mutantenbäume? Auch hier Spielmechanisch sinnig, aber im Spiel lässt man so viel Wälder wachsen und stampft sie wieder ein, dass es sich wie eine Krücke anfühlt.
Nicht mein Worker-Placement meiner Wahl, aber nett mitzuspielen. Thematisch Agricola immernoch wesentlich besser, wie ich finde.

Not a bad entry into Uwe's farm-ish series. The worker placement is the right tightness. The resource management is a little fiddly, with the shifting supplies and paying out stockholders.

This is rather good. There's plenty opportunities for clever play, in a small enough scale to make this quite a pleasant multiplayer game. I generally prefer Rosenberg big boxes with just two players, but this is an exception. Not to say the two-player game isn't good – it is.

People are making comparisons between this and Glass Road, but I suspect that's mostly due to the playtime. In practice, it feels more like a multiplayer version of the 2p Caverna/Agricola spinoffs. Players manage a few resources (three in this case), in hopes of scaling production enough to build late-game VP generating buildings. The fish mechanism is tied to a stock market so players need to weigh production versus mandatory costs and there are several possible ways to manage the wood-producing forests. In all, the game feels very interactive and streamlined when compared to the other multiplayer Rosenberg worker placement titles.

I've never been huge on the Uwe Rosenberg farming games and get less interested the bigger it gets I guess (I still think Bohnanza is the best game he ever made), but I do like a lot of his smaller once. 
This is pretty much a sweet spot for his "bigger" games for me, it isn't too long and too much, has a nice weight and length and thereby fits my tastes and needs a lot better than his big "darlings".

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]It took me a couple of plays to warm up to Nusfjord, but Uwe has managed to design another excellent quick, mid-weight Euro [i](Glass Road being the other)[/i]. While Nusfjord isn't difficult per se, there are a few new mechanics that took a few plays to wrap my mind around. The addition of stocks, elders [i](which function as personal worker placement spots)[/i] and the banquet table [i](a communal board where fish are placed and then use to hire/activate elders)[/i] help separate Nusfjord from Uwe's other games. In Nusfjord you are only managing three resources: fish, wood and gold [i](which is scarce)[/i] making it a more streamlined gaming experience. Wood comes from managing your forests, while fish comes from building fishing vessels [i](which are also worth some VP)[/i]. 

I've read other folks making comparisons to Glass Road and while there are a few similarities, both games play out completely differently. They are similar in terms of weight and game length [i](around 45 - 60 minutes)[/i]. The other major similarity is your player board where you manage forests, boats and buildings. Buildings provide in game abilities and may be worth VP. Later in the game you will be able to build new buildings which will provide end game scoring opportunities. There are three separate decks of buildings which will add a lot of variety to the game. Similar to Uwe's other games, Nusfjord scales quite well. The 2p game is just as tense as playing with 4 or 5. So far I've enjoyed playing  with 2, 4 and 5 players. The 5p game definitely makes the game go long, but despite the downtime I still enjoyed it. I'd say the sweet spot is between 2 - 4 players.

Nusfjord may be lighter than a lot of Uwe's recent games, but it is definitely one of the most cut throat. You will constantly be fighting with your opponent(s) over spaces you want to send your workers, which forces you to readjust your plans based on the actions available to you. While elders may help with this there will not always be fish on the banquet table for you to use. In the 4th round you will also get buildings only you can build until the beginning of the 6th round when they become available for everyone to build. I enjoy this kind of interaction/blocking in games precisely because it forces you to be adaptable and flexible with your strategy, but there will definitely be some folks who will not like this. I am looking forward to many more plays of Nusfjord and I'm extremely happy to have another 45 - 60 minute Uwe game to play with my kids.[/i]

Nusfjord is a worker placement game in which you're basically trying to build an engine to generate fish. Players can build buildings, recruit elders, and construct ships to make their fishing expeditions more fruitful. Fish can then be fed to the elders' feast table for big victory points. Like in some of his earlier games, Nusfjord also features a player board covered in forest tiles that players can cut down for wood or just to make room for more buildings. While the mechanics are quite different, the game feels a lot like Glass Road, as it has a similar game length/scope, the buildings provide the same scope of benefits, and you have similar player board management. I enjoyed this, but it didn't really stand out.

Finally, a more focused Uwe Rosenberg worker placement. The theme is great, the options are limited, which makes more interactions between players, and the low number of ressources means that the game is faster to setup as well. I also liked the different of options of getting wood: going full on deforestation or clean ecological selective cutting.

Very streamlined design from Rosenberg, it's even so streamlined it plays smoothly with the full player count of 5, which can't be said from every game. There are some familiar parts like cutting forest for wood, but the recruitment of elders, the issuing of shares and the distribution mechanism of the fish gives this game a very fresh feeling.

Well, I might be the biggest Uwe Rosenberg fan so I was definitely very excited to try this one. Doesn't hold up compared to the others in my opinion. I enjoy what it is doing but would rather play almost any other Rosenberg game on my Rosenberg shelf Still better than most of the games that came out at Essen that I have played. But, not to the level I was hoping.

You really have to find building combo's in this game, which is a great puzzle. It reminds met of Glass Road in that regard, but also feels very different because of the worker placement mechanic. The elders are a very nice extra addition and different ones will be useful based on the buildings you've built.

I have to say, that i am a big Uwe Rosenberg fan ... i own all games of him. So this was a important reason to get this game at Essen 2017. I played it already 6 times and enjoyed it very much ... its a typical Rosenberg game, but with a smaller action variety and a quite fast gameplay (i play the solo variant in 20 to 30 minutes) - i like this aspect - its tricky and fast to play and after a bad run you can do a second or third. There are also some negativ things for me: the boards and tokens are not the best quality in my opinion ... when i pulled out the plan tiles and tokens it was very heavy ... and i dont like the fact, that the main plan is a sort of many small tiles which you have to put together on the table - a thicker board would be nicer. Another little negative point are the very very small 1 coins ... dont like that, because its difficult to grab them. The cards have many text ... i miss a little bit graphics for the different buildings ... 


The theme is great ... i like it very much. Its not the best Rosenberg for me but still a very good one!

Pretty enjoyable small game. At 7 turns it feels short and like many of Uwe's other games you feel like there is more that you wanted to do that you wont get a chance to. The shares are very simple and not a real stock market, but do add something to the strategy: 1) if you don't issue yourself shares your fishing becomes very inefficient, 2) end game scoring is tight enough that losing points for not issuing shares can matter, and 3) it's hard to earn gold, so the 2 gold to issue a share is tempting - and you can buy it back later for 1 (if no one else gets it!).

There is nothing very unique here, but everything clicks together in a satisfying way. The solo game works well, although it's points-based the campaign mode adds a little bit of intrigue, with a ranking system to encourage you to attempt to do better.

As an Uwe Rosenberg design, Nusfjord is yet another resource management game in which actions are determined through a worker placement system. The difference is that you are now the owner of a fishing company in Norway, and have to develop the harbour using fish, wood and gold.  

…And that’s about it, really. The defining characteristic of Nusfjord is that it’s a patchwork of mechanisms taken from Uwe’s stable of designs. There are strong elements from Glass Road in the way players modify the landscape with buildings and forests, a hint of Fields of Arle in the way boats cover up the fishing track, and so on. Minor innovations such as the pseudo-share system barely make a dent in the grand scheme of things. So the greatest weakness of Nusfjord is that it plays very safe in terms of design and doesn’t spring surprises on its players. 

With that said, I actually quite enjoy Nusfjord for different reasons. One of those reasons is that I am more inclined towards Uwe’s simpler designs anyway, and Nusfjord’s complexity is comparable to that of Glass Road – but with slightly lower rules overhead and the ability to accommodate 5 players without too much fuss. Nusfjord also feels long and open enough to allow a distinct divergence in strategies, which is something lacking in Glass Road. Putting Nusfjord’s unoriginality aside, it succeeds in delivering a more focused Rosenberg Worker Placement Experience™ in a compact playing time of 20 minutes per player.

This is another game by Uwe Rosenberg, kind of borrowing a bunch from his other (heavier) games: worker placement, buildings (with unique powers), feedings, forests to clear, ships to help, boards on which to cover negative VP, etc. It's a streamlined version (we learned from the rules!), playing a bit faster than his big games but still with a lot of interesting decisions throughout. Might be worth trading for!

If you like Uwe's designs you will like this one as well. It is a solid and for me just another great game from a great designer.

I can not follow all the critics of the game:
- old fashioned game play: so what? If game is fun to play the mechanics can be from the 80ies...
- too small coins: I really do not care
- no pictures on the cards: I wouldn't have noticed without reading about it
- C-deck cards come to the game very late: no problem for me. Still enough time to fulfil them.

tl;dr: not original, but it still works well

Another year, another big [person=10][/person] game. And this one has his usual ingredients: Agricola style worker placement, buildings that will help you build stuff to help you, ships to help you, forests to grow and cut down, boards that give you negative points when not covered... You know, an Uwe Rosenberg game!
This one is a bit lighter. Probably about Glass Road weight. It also plays fairly straightforward thanks to that familiar WP mechanism. But still, there are enough meaningful choices to make and strategies to explore.
I heard from quite a few people they found it too basic and not deep enough, but I quite enjoyed my one five player game that I was in. There was always healthy competition for the action spaces and buildings and scores were relatively close. So yeah, I liked it!

This seems like the person and building cards of Agricola laid out as in Caverna, but a streamlined playing time. A couple of the other players said it reminded them of Le Havre, but it has been a while since I played that game. Overall, it was a tight, quick, and interesting game.

First couple of plays we made a big rules mistake: Sailor-guy served fish for a total of 2g1w per plate, which made that him really over powered. Seems like the cause was a poor English translation of that elder's ability. Too late we checked the appendix and realized our mistake.

I really enjoyed the game. I love the theme.
Being an Uwe fan, this game still feels fresh and has elements that are not typical for his games. The core is a worker placement game, but the economy is very interactive. The banquet table and the elders, as well as the shares, offer very interesting choices and you need to be constantly aware of what your opponents are doing.

RATING: 7
I've always been an Uwe Rosenberg fan, so I was naturally curious about this game. Somehow I hadn't heard about this one at all.

In the game you're collecting fish, wood and coins to build buildings and ships and get points. Every round, you first catch fish according to how many boats you own. Each boat takes up a certain amount of space on your fish track. You get fish equal to the first number that isn't covered by a boat.

Then you must feed any elders you've hired and pay out shares of your fishing company (which may be owned by you or by other players). Any leftover fish go into your reserve (which is an action to pull into your current supply.) The fish that were paid to shares you own are then added to your current supply.

Then players take turns placing three workers on the board. There's a couple of ways to get wood which deal with the forests on your personal player board. You'll be tempted to remove all your forests, but uncovered spots are negative points at the end of the game. (There might be ways to replant forests depending on the buildings available.) There's also actions to pull your reserve supply into your current supply, issue shares (to get gold), buy the shares that others have issued (which will give you fish in the fishing phase), build ships, build buildings, hire elders, and serve fish.

There's a large selection of buildings available, so you'll want to figure out which ones you're aiming for. Building buildings is a large part of the game. Ships are nice as they increase your fishing haul.

Elders are essentially new action spots that only you can trigger. When you hire an elder, they do their action once for free, but from then on you must place a worker on them to do the effect. And they require food every round (although every third food they reject which comes back to your current supply).

Serving fish is a way to convert fish into points. There's a row of plates and each plate takes more fish in order to satisfy. If you discard the required number of fish on a plate, then you put one of them on the plate to mark it has been fulfilled and score the appropriate number of points (and you can serve as many as you can afford). There have to be fish on the banquet table in order for players to use the elder action. So serving fish gets you points, but also sets up other players.

Later in the game fancier buildings come out and you get a hand of personal buildings that will probably give you a way to score points. After a couple of rounds any of those you haven't built get put into the public area and can be built by anyone.

The game ends after 7 rounds and ships, buildings, shares and unfilled spaces all score points.

The theme of the game is hardly exciting, but I liked it. A (fairly) modern day realistic theme appeals to me more than some generic fantasy setting would. The worker placement, get resources, build stuff structure of the game hits all the right notes for me. There are some interesting things going on, especially with the shares aspect of the game. You'll want to build shares for money and points, but you're risking having to pay a portion of your haul to whoever buys them (if that's not you.) I really enjoyed this game. I want to play this again already.

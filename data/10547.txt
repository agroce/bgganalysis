RATING: 5.6
I was pretty generous with this one too. From 6.1 to 5.6. If I want to read, I'll read. If I want to play a game, I'll play a game. Going back and forth between the two is just annoying. Worth another play under more ideal conditions but I doubt the rating will go up.

RATING: 7
The game is very dependent on having the "right" group to play it with. I've had some experiences with casual gamers being all "isn't this a little silly" and not really caring about the flavour texts on the cards...well, of course it is a little silly! In the way that B movies are silly but awesome at the same time.

RATING: 7
Did all the fixes from the website.  Had a good game.  And then has a dud game.  I think its a brilliant design, but it just isn't reliable for delivering a brilliant game.

Sold the first edition.  Then bought the second edition. Played it and had a dud game. Unfortunately this was the first game of Betrayal for two of the players and it might have killed it for them.

Lots of atmosphere but lacking as a 'game'. The different scenarios provide plenty of variety however and can be quite fun at the right time with the right group.

This game is fantastic. Oozes with theme, and a great play every time. I thoroughly enjoy building this house anew every time that we play. It is also so enjoyable that you have no idea what adventure you will have the first time you play. What detracts from the review is the convoluted rules on some haunts, and the unbalanced play on many haunts.

This game is a lot of fun. It feels pretty slow at first but when the haunt happens and the traitor is revealed, the game completely changes. With the tile placement, the random card draws and the 50 different scenarios, this game has a lot of replayability.

I believe we have played 3 games not 2. This is perhaps the game where we have had the most fun with storytelling games. I write this comment after having played Mansion of Madness for the first time.

While the mechanics are not the same, I compare the two anyways. The game is quite similar after the Betrayal have happened, but just with other tools on hand. The exploration are random in Betrayal, and it is cause for some hilarious and silly things to happen. But due to the randomness it can really tilt the game in each sides favor. It can be quite broken, but if your mindset is right, it is a very good game.

Mansions of Madness are more set in stone, and it might be the story we played, but the story was not as fun and we were just not as into it. But the overlord role is fun and different. sorry for the rambling. Two somewhat similar games, but with a slight edge to Betrayal.

RATING: 7.6
Betrayal has some interesting mechanics but many of its scenarios are hit and miss. Thematically it is great and with a group that are super in the mindset of the spooky goings on and a great imagination the initial house exploration can be great. The asymmetric gameplay that follows is also fairly novel. Sadly, game balance issues in a few scenarios and simply poorly implemented scenarios can ruin this, especially for new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have only gotten one play in, and it was subpar because there were only two players; we both controlled two characters and when the traitor was revealed, the non-traitor gained the traitor's non-traitor character.  Unfortunately, after all the exploration, we had to end the game because of time constraints shortly after the haunt began.  Definitely looking forward to playing again, with more players.   

Have gotten several more plays in, and the game is definitely better with at least 4 players.  It's a fairly random game, but that's part of its fun!  A lot of people complain it is broken, etc., but I haven't had that experience in the five haunts I've experienced.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The scenarios seem to work either really well or really poorly. When they work, the game is almost cinematic. When they don't, you're left to flounder around and try to figure out what everyone is supposed to do.

Poor play balance and broken scenarios hobble this potential gem. Mostly nice pieces though too many counters to sort thru and organize. I like the roleplaying aspect and the discovery part but I'm not keen on the hidden victory conditions and the core problems to the system. A game I wanted to like a lot but found myself feeling lukewarm about it.

RATING: 2
I really didn't like this game. I seem to be in the minority on this and most of my friends seemed to enjoy it, but here were my issues:

(1) Slow, Drags on Too Long. It took us a little over 4 hours to get through one game. Most of that time, I felt like I was sitting around doing nothing. 

(2) Very Arbitrary. There's not a one-size-fits-all formula for me, but I like strategy games that are maybe 80% - 90% skill and 10% - 20% luck, and I'm OK with social games that just allow people to have fun regardless of the "fairness." Betrayal plays more like a "strategy game" with the dumb luck of a social game; i.e. it's a strategy game without much strategy. Within 2 turns, my character was basically on the verge of death just due to dumb luck. Which might not have been so bad if it weren't for the aforementioned fact that the game drags on for quite a long time.

(3) Poor Gameplay Dynamics. The whole game felt very clunky to me. Too many things not well explained, the characters don't necessarily mesh together, omens and bad events are completely random. 

(4) Too Complicated; Too Much Going On. The true mark of a great game is that it manages to have complex strategy, while being a relatively simple and straight-forward game. This is where Betrayal fails the most miserably. There's absolutely nothing straight-forward about it and you're constantly having to learn all kinds of random rules to manage. 

I guess a lot of people are into the horror RPG theme, but that doesn't really do it for me. I can get into a "horror strategy game" if it actually has some real strategy (see "Zombicide"), but this was just painfully boring to me. I may be in the minority, but I hated this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is so cool in that it's never the same game. I like the fact that you start the game as a Co-op and have a chance for a betrayer and teams to form against each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once so far. Not sure how I feel about it. I don't like co-op games very much (at least I haven't found one I really liked). The traitor mechanic is what caught my eye with this one and I will try it another time to see if there is something here for me.

For Trade
Condition is Acceptable. There is a quarter size hole punched in the bottom of the box. Besides that all components and box are in very good condition. Played once.
All components included.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, light, short, and very thematic. Feels a bit RPG-ish as each player has their own character with their own stats and inventory. Makes a great story as you play that is remembered long after the game ends. There are two phases of the game: first, players explore a haunted house and find weird items and have spooky things happen to them. Second, someone turns evil and the players play out one of the scenarios in the haunt books. The haunts can be very one-sided for either the good guys or the traitor, depending on how the exploration part of the game went. It's pretty random and sometimes has incomplete or ambiguous rules; fortunately, the errata is available online. Must play for Halloween.

My copy has been edited quite a bit. The haunt books have been updated to match the revised books, and some of the haunts have been edited further. The underground lake tile and the event where you get an item through the mirror have both been fixed, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Basically an improved version of the original. Monster chits with pictures on them, clearer rules, and less errors. BUT, it also has flimsier cardboard (not an issue if you have BOTH editions :p ).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another fun and thematic party game that you can play also (or especially) with friends who are not hardcore boardgamers. Like [i]Last Night on Earth[/i], it's best when served with a few cold beers and a healthy dose of not-taking-it-too-seriously. This one's a bit heavier though, and involves some reading-a-few-pages-of-scenario-specific-instructions-halfway-through-the-game (and even a bit of role-playing) so it's perhaps not for everyone. But in the right kind of company it's a blast!

Fun game, although for newer players the traitor mechanic can offer some challenges. 

Further play of this game makes it feel tiresome, the game is a random meander until the haunt starts. Once the haunt starts if an inexperienced gamer ends up as the traitor things can be pretty shaky. I never request this game but I will sit through a game with a group that knows the game.

Great game, bad editor.  I want to give this game a high rating.  Based off the fixed version, I give this game an 6.  Now if I was more annoyed with errata, it would be like a 4.  However, this is a game loaded with depth and replay value.  I just wish they wouldn't have rushed it out the door with all the errors in it.  A definite detractor to an otherwise great game.

RATING: 8.5
This game is just fun.  Mechanics are messy, but it just doesn't matter.  The early game stress of Omen roles and not knowing who to trust, add the sheer joy of being the villain and this game is just too much fun to care about the flaws in the mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game plays best at 4-6 players, where the players might stand a chance against some of the super OP haunts, but at more than 4 players, the game drags like crazy and you hardly move every turn, only revealing maybe one or two rooms before your move ends. Then, if the haunt is too easy, it feels like everything you've worked for (building your stats, building the house, gathering items and special kinks to the house) was pointless as you demolish the poor haunted player until no one wants to play again. The game needs something for other players to do on the other players' turns, or to shorten turns/make them simultaneous; the game is too disengaging for a light, beer and pretzels horror game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Look. This is a terrific game when a few (more than three) friends want to have a group activity. As a game, it is not much. I truly enjoy the different scenarios in the traitors' and heroes' books, but once these are done, there isn't a game there.

My Favorite creepy game for Autumn play. 

First play was with the first edition. My wife and I loved it. The cards are thematic, creepy and intense. The whole thing has a horror/thriller vibe. I like the one vs. all the other players as you rush to stop the evil from spilling out into the world. 

My only complaint: You really need 3+ players, Otherwise I would play this far more often.

Great theme!  My wife hates it so I rarely get to play, but I wish I could more often.  Game length is good.  Any longer and it would drag.  The only drawback (aside from those that are already well known, we play around those) is that sometimes when the haunt starts, the odds are stacked against one side that it is almost impossible for the other side to win.

Everyone I have played this with loved it. Even extended family at a reunion (trust me, that's a feat). Can be a unfair at times when it comes to the haunts, but it at least does so randomly since it depends on how early the haunt is revealed and what the actual scenario is. If you're a fan of co-op or atmospheric games, you'll love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
This was a brilliant game. Although learning the game from scratch was difficult, it was easy to teach other people how to play. Having the game start out as non-hostile is helpful for newcomers to transition into the basic mechanics of the game, and then are introduced to the betrayal and monsters, which help advance gameplay. Although I can see how this game could potentially get old after playing so many scenarios (there will eventually be a repeat scenario), it doesn't necessarily detract from the difficulty of the scenario itself. Keyword being necessarily. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Finally, a game that my husband loves as much as I do.  Why?  Because he loves being the traitor and killing us all.  Sure, he just happened to become the Voodoo Master that one game, and had scattered dolls of us around the house that we had to find before they were destroyed (if our doll was destroyed, our character died.) Sure, he played it perfectly and committed a TPK against everyone playing, leaving him victorious... and sure he gloated about killing me for weeks.  

But even all that couldn't destroy my love for this game.  The shear number of possibilities - the fact that we win as much as we lose.  And the epic rescues! I remember the time I played as Flash. We were shrunk to the size of mice and had to get the toy plane to fly out of the house - and I single-handedly was able to rescue everyone and fly out the window because my speed was so high (which was the stat needed to fly the plane).  It was great.  Epic rescues like that - or the close shaves - are what I live for.  It's all about the story.  And this is a storytelling game with tiles.  The best of both worlds.

RATING: 7.5
Not really a boardgame but "assisted roleplaying". It can be a lot of fun, but all the players need to be involved and interested in the gameplay. The end tends to be arbitrary based on how late the changeover occurs, and how many players are involved (a full complement of 6 players and a late change almost guarantees a player win, and a loss is certain in an early change or fewer players). The scenarios are fun and varied though. Definitely needs better pieces for the monsters.

RATING: 6.5
This game does not get stale with the amount of randomness and variation that goes into the game. The reason for the sub-optimal rating is due to the atrocious rule book. The book is nigh incomprehensible and never answers any of the questions that could prevent a set of players from going about a scenario incorrectly. The pieces are of extremely low quality and the tokens are not clear at all. Were this game not handled so poorly it would be a much more enjoyable experience.

Playing Betrayal is like having dinner with a good old friend. You're going through stories that you've gone through a 1000 times before. There might be minor updates, it's not particularly funny or new or exiting, and sometimes there are weird things happening. Sometimes it's boring and meaningless. Sometimes there's nothing left to say. 
But at the end of the evening you realize it has been wonderful to see this person again, and that you had a wonderful time after all. And you're sad that it will take some time until you meet again.
I love playing Betrayal. The Other Player makes an art of introducing new players to the game without actually explaining a single rule in the beginning, just taking everyone down in the madness. And even though there are some weird errors in the game (looking at you, underground lake on the first floor) it is always fun to play and I will play it again and again until the last mad man has been hunted down.

It's a party game - this isn't for hardcore gamers.  No strategy to speak of.  But if you're a fan of horror stories, getting the chance to make your own as you go through the house is intrinsically fun.  It would help if the rules were clearer, so make sure you print up the FAQ.

Something about this game I just don't care for. In most of the games I've played, the haunt just kind of ruins the gameplay. I feel like everything leading up to the haunt is just random and you can't actually prepare for it. Some scenarios seem impossible for either the traitor or other players to win. However, some games I've played haven't been too bad. Just a hit or miss.

I gave this game away to my brother for two reasons: he loved it, and that way my friends couldn't bug me to play it anymore.  This game does a great job of capturing the horror theme it goes for, but as a game its pretty lackluster.  I'm not the kind of person who can enjoy a game JUST for the theme, and theme is about all there is to Betrayal.

Ok this is an update to a prior comment. I still love this game but I now own it thanks to my former brother in law selling me his copy.  Thank Cris for the game and hope to play it again with you one day.
I hope to some day make Scooby doo characters to play instead of the ones they have, just to add flavor to the game. The only negative I have of this game is the crappy character cards that you use to keep track of your stats. VERY easy to move the sliders and mess up what you had.

A favorite of our gaming group.  We've found at least once scenario that was incredibly unbalanced, but overall it's a lot of fun. We really get into the characters and reading the cards with creepy voices.

RATING: 4
Overall, betrayal on the house on the hill is enjoyable, plus quick to setup, unlike Mansion of Madness. I find the narrative like Zack's "Akimoto and Jaspers characters cant do anything with the word open in it.'' more entertaining than if we were talking about absolute strategy to beat the situation in depth. And among 'Adventure' games, it has more replayability than most. 
Downsides are the quality of the pieces esp. the pins to track the stats of each character and luck is a big factor of the game.

I felt betrayed by the theme.  I expected more, and unmet expectations lead to harsher criticism.  I like what the game attempts to do but it falls flat for me.  

Why?  I really liked how exploration develops the house, but exploration and house development ended surprisingly soon.  I liked how baddies could jump out of the woodwork, but they never really seemed to surprise.  I liked how there is a traitor, but the fact that at first no one knows the traitor---and then everyone knows the traitor---meant that a person's strategy with or against other players was not affected one bit by the hidden traitor element. Fear resides in the unknown, but in this game themed on horror everything of importance (room layout, victory conditions, piece locations) were either never hidden or revealed prematurely.  

The resulting story was uninteresting and unbalanced (I ask for challenge or entertainment, both is a bonus, but this gave neither).  The moment the traitor was revealed the best part of the game was over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first time I played this was shortly before Halloween and it was perfect timing!  The fact that you create the playing board as you go is a very cool twist with this game - each game can be slightly different.  When certain conditions are met early in the game one person is designated as a traitor.  The traitor then gets special abilities/powers and the ultimate goal of killing off the other players.  However, the other players don't know these special abilities.  Having a traitor provides for a lot of good-natured trash talking, and it was fun playing on both sides of that dynamic.  2 hour game (?).

I've tried to like this game, but every Haunt plays out in a manner where the winner is basically decided on the spot and it's just a matter of playing the game out to completion.

RATING: 10
An incredibly fun game to play with a group of friends that's relatively easy to pick up, also a good game to introduce new players to the "Strategy Game" category. A huge upside to this game is that every game is always different so it has tons of replay value, a good game to binge over and over with friends. No downsides to this game whatsoever in my opinion except that 3-player games seem to lack something over 4-player and over games.

RATING: 6
Interesting game.  I love the theme.  I like the room-placing mechanics.  Combat is by dice-rolling and is kind of meh.

The traitor aspect and triggering thereof by omens is really cool.  The number of possible scenarios and the way you determine which one you have, also very cool.  The instructions for the different scenarios (or at least the one we played), very not cool.  The scenario directions and instructions were very difficult to follow and fully understand, often vague, unhelpful, poorly worded and incomplete.  May require better reading comprehension and interpretation skills than is possible for a human being to possess.

Reason it rates a 5 instead of a 3 is because of the above-noted positives.  The theme and traitor mechanism go a long way for me (as they must in order to bump my rating to a 5).

I could probably be talked into playing this again.  *Probably*.

7/31/09:  Okay, so maybe I was a little harsh in my initial assessment.  The game is fun, of that I have little doubt, but it's entirely random.  If there were some nagging hint of strategy or tactics or planning, I'd probably like this one better.  It's not a bad game, not once you get past the horrible manual/instructions, but it's far from being a great game.  Rating bumped from 5 to 6.  I would play this again, though it likely won't be my first choice.

I have played this game more than 20 times. It's one of my favorites. The high levels of storytelling make it fun. The game has great replay value because it has 50 different scenarios. The rules are fairly simple and it's an easy game to get started. I love the board building mechanic. The game does, however, lack a bit in balance. Depending on how the board is laid out before the traitor is revealed, the game can be easy or hard for either the traitor or the survivors. I love this game!

I've only played once, and the game ended up being fairly short and a bit screwy-- at least so I've been told by others involved who have played more often. Regardless, I really enjoyed the game and look forward to trying it again. I'm a huge fan of games which have a fair amount of flexibility, randomness, and especially uniqueness for every play; all of which seem to apply to Betrayal. It does seem that at least one player with prior experience, though not necessary, is extremely helpful.

1st play: Simple narrative game with lots of replayability given the presence of 50 different scenarios.  The exploration is simple but random.  Not a heavy or strategic game, but a good, light, thematic game with monsters and scary stories to tell.  The events seemed to match well with the rooms we encountered.  Our first scenario seemed a little easy to complete, but we also got pretty luck with some of our rolls.

RATING: 3.9
Betrayal at House on the Hill is a game whereby players explore the rooms of a haunted mansion.  As players explore, players play tiles of rooms to create their own mansion, they are also trying acquire items or pets that are useful to themselves as they prepare for the final showdown with the betrayal.

At 1 point of the time, 1 player "secretly" plots to betray the rest of the party.  It is a race against time as the innocent players must complete their task before the betrayal to win the game.

Good points: It is interesting to see how the mansion develops internally as players joins up different tiles.

Bad points: The game indeed has a lot of bad points.  First of all, the rules of the game is not clear at all.  During the game itself, we had a hard time trying to resolve what should be done or it will be unfair to either the betrayal or the innocents.  Though it is interesting to build the haunted mansion, the mansion can develop into an illogical manner, with a door in 1 room but the room tile beside it is a solid wall.  During the phase whereby the betrayal plots against the innocents, the innocents read from a book called 'Secrets of Survival' while the betrayal reads 'Traitor's Tomb' booklet.  Throughout the game, the traitor and the innocents are trying to fulfil their own goals without other party knowing each other's goal.  When 1 side suddenly declares that they won, the other party is baffled.  Though in each booklet, it does hint on how to stop each other party from winning the game, it is not made obvious to the players.

After thought: I have made a lot of remarks especially bad ones on this game.  It may due to the friends that I played this game with.  One of my friend cares a lot about winning and the betrayal, which happens to be me, is discriminated by him throughout the game.  I did not enjoy during the game.  Throughout the game, I just want the game to end.  As mentioned above that one player "secretly" plots against the rest, the player is revealed and not in secrecy at all though I know that the secret means the secret mission that each side is going to take.  I think I need to play the game with some other group of friends to have a fairer comment.

This is definitely a game that you play for the experience, rather than the win. In my first game, my explorer stumbled from one bad room to another, until he got devoured by a tentacled monstrosity, which I ended up controlling...Except the beast ended up having the same rotten luck as the explorer.

It's not perfectly balanced, and it may be too random for some people's tastes, but even while losing, this game has been a blast. Definitely one for people who can stand being thrust into impossible scenarios.

Buyer beware: If you want to have fun playing this game, it is better to roleplay a bit and read flavor text on the cards. My group was purely ludic and simply read "If I roll this I will get this" and that totally broke the theme.

Love this light-hearted quasi role playing game. Explore the mansion that is different every time, change your traits with encounters. 

When the traitor appears, some of the scenarios seems better than other, and there is hundreds of small chits to search through when you need five or so of them for each scenario. 

Still very enjoyable, easy to teach and fast to play.

Honestly, I'd probably be happy if I never played this again. Players spend time exploring/building a house while collecting various items and encountering events with a bunch of dull flavour text. Eventually a haunt will occur, where one of the party becomes the "traitor". 

The haunt can end abruptly, drag on for ages, leave the party overpowered or with no options... it's completely luck of the draw. I think I've had a satisfying session just one time. 

However, I will give it props for the gateway appeal; it'll bring people who consider board games to be limited to Monopoly, Cluedo and Scrabble into the fold. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of my gaming groups' favorites. We've played so much that we've probably covered all 50 scenarios of the game. The exploration is fun, and the alluring possibility of there being a traitor among us (everyone wants to be the traitor) is what makes this a good game. Stay clear of the Junk Room, though. It's the most dangerous room in the game...

The first half of this game is wandering around aimlessly, watching your and the other players stat dieals being increased or decreased based on some random die rolls.  This can be interesting if played in character or reading the cards with a spooky voice, but in general is just an extended setup time until the real game starts.

Once the real game starts, it is 1 (vs) All, and the one person gets monsters & superpowers, trying to destroy the other players, who are trying to accomplish an objective before a time runs out (or death).  There are an incredible number of scenarios, which are chosen randomly each time, so there is definitely replay value here, but don't expect a thought driven game.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

RATING: 7
Betrayal at House on the Hill quickly builds suspense and excitement as players explore a haunted mansion of their own design, encountering spirits and frightening omens that foretell their fate. With an estimated one hour playing time, Betrayal at House on the Hill is ideal for parties, family gatherings or casual fun with friends.

Betrayal at House on the Hill is a tile game that allows players to build their own haunted house room by room, tile by tile, creating a new thrilling game board every time. The game is designed for three to six people, each of whom plays one of six possible characters.

Secretly, one of the characters betrays the rest of the party, and the innocent members of the party must defeat the traitor in their midst before it’s too late! Betrayal at House on the Hill will appeal to any game player who enjoys a fun, suspenseful, and strategic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It seems like a game of Betrayal could be cool. Or it could be just a bit... boring. The first 'half' or 'third' or 'two thirds' or whatever is a bunch of wandering around poking here and there a bit. Then things happen and they might be really interesting! Or weird. Or annoying? Maybe if the 'twist' was earlier on the flow might be more interesting.

I'm comfortable giving it this rating. The exploration is most fait accompli, in that there's not much else to do, but the haunt element is fun ... it's always *better* to be the traitor. The only thing is that the haunts aren't always reliably balanced, which can spoil an hour-and-a-half jaunt.

I enjoy the theming of Betrayal, and the concept of exploring is fun. The haunts and the variety in them is great too. My problem with Betrayal is with the fighting and damage. Since it's entirely dice driven, there's a lot of luck involved, and since you roll fewer dice after taking even a little bit of damage, being hurt puts you at a huge disadvantage that's hard to recover from. Depending on the haunt, you may also just be at a disadvantage from the get-go, which can really suck. I suppose this fits in with the unknown nature of the theme, but the damage and dice mechanic can be very frustrating

A haunted house crawler with two distinct parts.  In the first, the party splits up in time-honoured fashion to explore creepy rooms alone.  The rooms randomly offer items that may be useful or pitfalls to weaken your character.  The artwork and flavour text work quite nicely to build some atmosphere.  

Die rolls trigger the second part, in which we discover that one of us is a traitor and that there is a scenario with victory conditions for them and us.  The scenarios are where the game has, for me, come off the rails three times out of three.  They just aren't well balanced.  Even judging Betrayal as an experience game, I see that as a major flaw; don't all horror B-movies at least manage a nail-biting climax?   

My comments are about the Avalon Hill edition, which is the only one I have seen.  Production quality is good.  The pre-painted miniatures are especially nice.  The artwork is good too.  The rules are short and full of holes.

Cooperative game with a twist. Easy to teach and play. Prepainted miniatures. 50 different scenarios. The random nature of the game is an issue.

RATING: 8
At first I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this game because the components are not the greatest quality. However, with up to 50 different possible story lines, it ended up being a really enjoyable game. Since you don't know who the traitor will be, what the end game is, or even what order the rooms will appear, there is a lot of anticipation at the beginning. Sometimes the game can seem broken because the specific end game will give an extreme advantage to the traitor or the investigators. For example, If the goal to win turned out to be "escape the house" and the investigators are only two or three squares from the front door, and the traitor is on the second floor of the house 10 tiles away, then there isn't even a chance the traitor can win, but hey, then you can just reset the board and play again! I was also worried because it was aimed at 3 or more people and I typically play 2 player games. However, since you don't know who the traitor will be, and can't really prepare for it, each person takes two investigators and then when the traitor is revealed, they can give their other investigator to the other player and it doesn't really ruin anything. Its not the style of game where you can "sup up" a character to prepare for the end game.

Original Red-Box Edition - Played condition, some shelf wear on the box

Can be amazing, can be horrible, way too variable of an experience for me. Also the box is a clutter of tokens which are different for almost no reason at all. If you're going to have the same little orange token for every enemy, why not just say "use the orange tokens for the bats" and not make a thousand orange tokens with different tiny words on them? 

AUGH.

Super fun theme, great fun around Halloween time. It really is like being in a horror movie that you don't know the ending of. On the flip side, the variable "betrayal" mechanic doesn't always lead to a fun conclusion--sometimes it's pathetically easy to "win" the scenario, and sometimes nearly impossible just due to how items and other cards have come out. Also, tough to play with non-gamers because it requires everyone be comfortable possibly becoming the traitor, which can be off-putting to more casual players.

RATING: 7.3
The problem with this game and new players is it can go off the rails quickly. I've had it happen a couple times where the new players will draw the dog, or immediately find the mystic elevator, etc. Or the haunt starts far too early triggered by a new board game player who then has no idea how to treat the haunt/betrayer role and things slow or completely halt. 

That being said, with experienced players this game can flow very nicely and is a lot of fun. 

Just use caution to making this a gateway game for newbies as it requires a fun group that's willing to be thematic and interactive!

RATING: 7
A rather unique game with a fabulous haunted house theme.  Borrows traditional mechanics from role playing games and in fact plays a bit like one.  The first half of the game is rather random with frankly minimal decision making.  The second half consisting of the haunt that turns one of the players against all the others is very cool.  In the right mood, say on Halloween, with the right crowd, it might be one of the most compelling experiences in boardgaming.  
The second edition has very poor components compared to the first edition.  The tiles are too thin and warp almost immediately.

My favorite game! My brother got it for Christmas one year and convinced me to play. I was hooked from the start. I grew up in a big family where we loved listening to my grandmother tell us scary stories and playing this game brings back that feeling. 

The replay value is huge. We have the base game and the new expansion and we haven't played through all of the scenarios in either. Even if you replay a scenario you will still get something new out of it. 

I will play this game with anyone at anytime!

I love, love, love the theme, and I love the stories that come out of a good session.  But it often feels like the game plays itself, and for such a light game, there are lots of exceptions and edge cases that make it harder to play than it ought to be.  It falls into that valley of yucky complexity for me: a game that has too much happening to really have a good conversation about something else while you're playing, and one that isn't really engrossing enough to reward my full attention.

Interesting game with a clever house-building mechanic that reminds my of Mystery Mansion. Neat minis don't quite make up for an armada of lackluster counters. The rules are sound, but the scenarios run the range from awesome to deeply, deeply, flawed. Needs a second edition.

Inconsistent nonsense. 10% of games the timing and scenario work perfectly, but other times you meander around the house for 1.5 hours, then trigger the scenario which is abruptly ended by well-equipped heroes. Or, the opposite: it ends fast and the players don't have a chance. The latter is at least relatively quick and tense, but the former is a complete waste of an evening. 

Oh, and no real decisions at any point. This one falls into my "barely even a game" category.

This is a good game. Although it has 50 different haunts many are so similar they will play out the same. Some are a bit broken, sometimes making it nearly impossible for the traitor or the heroes. I like the game but don't absolutely love it. Will always be happy to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
High on luck and fairly low on skill, but the variety of Haunts and the fact that the house comes out different every time gives it a lot of replayability. Make sure you play with people that are good at reading comprehension.... the Haunt can get really screwy really fast if one or both sides don't understand what they're doing (especially the traitor since they tend to be alone and can't discuss the instructions with anyone else).

A simple cooperative game with a brilliant twist mid way to introduce a competitive element. The mechanics are simple to teach and learn, and the number of scenarios make for great replayability (esp after adding in custom fan made scenarios). 

This game is NOT balanced and gamers look for such an experience should be aware and think twice. I would say this is a game you should play like Arkham Horror where the experience matters more than the win.

I really enjoy the tile based house building mechanic, because it adds to the randomness of the game. The "haunt" and the "betrayer" also add a lot of tension to the game, which always gets everyone involved in the story and theme of the game. There are over 100 haunts to game and as many times as we have played this, we have never hit a repeat haunt. Would have given this a 10 but some of the haunts have errors which makes things confusing and sometimes hard to get through. I also recommend the downloadable FAQ from Avalon Hill that has some updated rules, we found it crucial to understanding some of the scenarios.

One of my favorites, but many issues. Had to put electrical tape on the clips to make them stay, and there's some card warping issues. As well, there's confusion within the haunts, but overall you just have to make a decision and go with it and it still works overall.

RATING: N/A
Simple to learn, easy to play game with an emphasis on theme and story telling.  Role playing during this game would be easy to do, even encouraged.

That being said... this game could be considered an anti euro.  This game has little to no strategy, is high on luck factor and largely depends on the ability of the players to "get into character".  

The fun of this game is in the story the players will write during game play.  Guaranteed, if players immerse themselves in the events unfolded by the game and take time to appreciate the imagery being presented there will be a fun and entertaining story to relate long after the board is packed up and the box put away.

Picked this up on a whim and loved it. Random house-building, scenario, and traitor mechanics keep things relatively new and interesting with each game. Happily replaced with second edition copy but cannibalized this one for parts like more dice and the character cards which are identical but thicker and better quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Happily picked this up to replace my first edition copy. Was finally playable after getting replacement tiles. Tokens are much easier to identify in this edition. Unfortunately the card stock is too thin on the player boards and the markers keep sliding off; fixed by using my first edition copies since they're identical and thicker. We never played this for several years and my interest in the game faded quite a bit so we sold this in the FallCon 30 auction to make room in the collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I feel like I am just going to be repeating what every one else says about this game. It could be SO GOOD but the Haunt can clutch up this game so bad and so fast. The first half of the game is the best part. You explore the house entering rooms where God only knows what terrors lie in store for you. Cards and tiles give you such flavor text that you cannot help but be drawn into the theme. 
But once the Haunt happens all that tends to fall by the way side. There are so many ways the game can go and there's no way to know if the game play will continue to work or if it will just break on you right then and there. Plus the haunt can happen so quickly in the right situation that any exploration of the house stops dead robbing the players of what almost everyone universally agrees is the best aspect of the game. 
Plus let's be honest ... the components are not great. Those character boards are a joke, the card stock is not good and those minis are atrocious. If some one can just fix the second half of the game it might go way up in all gamers' estimation

Never the same game twice! I love introducing people to this game as the first half is almost a tutorial for the real challenge that happens when you find out who the Betrayer shall be! When the game flips from cooperative to a versus game and the rules change based on the last artifact that was gained you feel read to handle the "real challenge" of the game. 

Playing with someone who didn't want to be the bad guy but has the luckiest rolls at the table is an absolute blast!

Theme is great on this one. You really feel like you're exploring a haunted house and are just dreading the moment that one of your allies will suddenly become the traitor. Random tile placement and 50 haunts = awesome replayability. My only gripe would be that there is player elimination.

Amazingly thematic. But this is more an "experience game" like a Dungeon Crawl - that's more about developing a story than solving a puzzle.

I found the rules issues not nearly as bad as the hype would indicate. And the errata pretty much clears everything up.

RATING: 7
Have played twice, would play again if asked. My fisrst impression of Betrayal at House on the Hill was a slightly boring generic horror dungeon crawler. The semi-random scenario mechanism feels like an interesting idea, but can add unnecessary complexity to the game depending on who you play with. After playing the game for the second time my appreciation of it has grown and I have raised my rating from a 5 to a 7. Much depends on who you play it with thou, as a good gaming group can take the game to a whole other level.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've played three times now and I believe the biggest determinant of victory is the number of players.  With few players, the traitor has an edge; with many, he has virtually no chance.  There are two reasons: first, there is no scaling up or down of the difficulty of the haunt beyond a very minimal "if 2-3 players then 2 hits are needed, 4+ means 3 hits are needed" and so forth.  Second, if rooms containing key items needed to defeat the haunt have not been revealed, then they're simply dropped in the good guys' laps.

This is not a bad game and has some clever mechanics but in none of my plays has the outcome ever really been in doubt as soon as the haunt began.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really fun game to play to follow the story. I find if it is played too often though I don't enjoy it as much because the cards pop up too often. It's fun to follow the little stories going on through the house and it's always fun to find out what the haut is going to be. It's fun even though I think the Betrayer will win 90% of the time. It will probably be a game that comes out a time or two around the spooky holidays!

RATING: 8
Someone has to take the time to go online and get all the revised rules and scenarios and learn everything so that they can run the game for everyone else.  But beyond that this is a great purchase because it's so unique as a cooperative exploration games that suddenly drops a random scenario and pits one of the players against the others on some novel task.

It's not very competitive and there's not much strategy.  The fun comes in finding out what's going to happen and then doing what you can to get by it.

I've only played it twice, and I suspect that some of the scenarios can occasionally fizzle.  But it doesn't take that long to play, so it seems worth the chance.

As a thematic game, this one does a good job of delivering.  The game starts out with all players 'on the same side', but at some point - someone becomes the 'baddie'.  The game takes a pretty hard hit for the transition because the baddie now has to read a section that explains the game they will now be playing.  This makes the pacing stumble right when it should get racing.  But once over the hurdle, the game returns to a quick flow.  The quirky layout and odd typos actually add to the bizarre feel of the game and that brings the game up to its final rating.

Normally a lot of fun.  It hasn't been perfect in terms of everything coming together for a fun experience.  However, one of the most fun experiences I've had in board games is a time that some friends and I lost to the Betrayer.  The haunted house exploration is fantastic.  The haunt stops everything for at least 30 minutes for everyone to learn the new rules.  The Betrayer phase has been hit and miss.

The game is fun.  I'm always willing to give it a chance, and it goes pretty well at a table with new players if I am there as a non-player coach.

Great theme, and a fun game but it's a little clunky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a catch-all horror/suspense style game with light RPG elements, such as different traits that will determine dice pools. There's a bit of a disconnect in the first 'exploration' phase and then the 'haunt' phase, since one player will suddenly find their game change to fit the new role, but when played properly, this can actually be fun. I think you just need to go into it knowing that since the narrative and objectives of the game are going to change so much in each session, that you're really along for a kind of generic horror ride inspired by a lot of the classics, but a little random feeling.

A very nice game at the start. Played it about 12 or 13 times now. It is mostly about the story, which is really its best part.
It starts off very random, but when the story begins it gets fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good co-operative game with the titular betrayal happening at a random time and to a random person. As if that wasn't enough to add re-playability there are also 50 different stories to experience at random when the betrayal happens.

A fairly quick (roughly 45 mins) game that will keep you coming back.

Though I do recommend adding either some sticky-backed plastic to the character boards, or to the insides of the plastic stat-markers as in this re-release the markers slide too easily and often move while playing.

Very Dynamic Horror adventure game.  You never know who is on who's side until the Haunt starts sometime early in the game.  You also have no clue why you are even in the house until this time.  In general this game is great fun.  I hear that it can be a bit easier to understand and play if you get the Errata but I have not done this myself yet.

Update - I have played with the Errata and have considered buying the latest version but this game is still very good and still a lot of fun.   If you want to really increase the creep factor play at night with 14 candles and blow one out every time an Omen is drawn (14 just so you can see if you get a high Omen count game)

I played v1 a few years ago (which is out of print), and happily bought v2 when it finally came out.  Apparently there are some slight tweaks/improvements, but it's so subtle that I didn't notice them. 

I brought my copy of v2 to another game group's game-night.  And it took over.  we played it 3 times in a row (about 4 hours).

The "trader" makes it all work.  You go from and "exploring" game to a "survival" game right about the time exploring is getting comfortable to you.  Then, when the game is actually over (after the survival half of the game)... you're totally ready for another round of exploring --> especially because you know the next "trader" will trigger a totally different "survival" scenario.

There's 50 trader scenarios, which means the game can surprise you 50 times. (and if you have a short memory, like me, it will surprise you every time! :) )

Also... just because you play a scenario a second time, doesn't mean the player controlling the trader will make all the same decisions as the trader did last time.  Even the same scenario is worth playing more than once.

I recommend this to friends and try to create reasons for 3 people to get together and play.  That's the only drawback, you need more than 2 people to play.  But that can easily be a bonus because more people are more fun in this type of game. :)

Initial rating, based on a single play, which we won without any effort through a lucky roll of the dice and a lucky item gain at the right moment. The traitor never stood a chance. That pretty much describes everything which is wrong about this game, and explains the rating.

RATING: 8
A B horror movie generator. There isn't much strategy to be found, if any at all. Almost every part of this game is random. Move you piece to a new room, place the random tile, pick up the random card and do it's action, and probably rolling a random die roll to see what happens. Haunts are problematic in that they are often lop-sided. It's not that they are all broken (some are), but that the board will often evolve in such a way that one side will have to jump through some ridiculous hopes to win; this particularly true if a bunch of required room are on the board and need to be found. There are some other problems as well, such as the rules a bit of a mess. The first edition had a million and one counters that need to be sorted (the second edition wisely pared it down).

Still, I rate it highly. Why? Well, it's short and you can knock out a couple of games in an evening. The kitschy movie horror theme fits this game very well.

This has been a great addition to my collection, and has given my group of friends a very enjoyable experience. The games a fairly fast paced, with most ending in an hour when all the players know what they are doing. I love the idea that you don't know who the traitor will be until the haunt reveal. There are some scenarios that are not balanced for the traitor, and others that are unbalanced for the survivors. Overall its an enjoyable game to play with friends.

RATING: 7.2
After a few plays I still don't find it broken, that has to be a good sign. The biggest problem I see is when you get an unexperienced player (and/or one not very skilled in english) to play the traitor. I can understand som people's opinions about 'no meaningful choices to make' and the likes, but so far I never saw it as a problem in the game myself.

This game seems like a recipe: it may or may not have a happy ending depending on the ingredients. While the first part of discovering the house is admittedly a somewhat boring procedure no matter(well, arguably so at least) the players involved , the after-haunting stage entirely depends on the players. If players don't immerse in the right atmosphere and drag everyone along with them, playing this game is just a waste of time for me. So choose your fellow investigators wisely or just spend all afternoon regretting it.

This was probably the board game that jump started me into the board game hobby.  I was getting out of D&D miniatures and was looking for "something else" when i found the java scripted cartoon style demo of this game on AH's web site
- I purchased the game but never ended up opening it up.  I actually sold it off on ebay when the price was through the roof years later, but from that demo i got the board game bug.  
I started to wonder if there were any more demos out there - then I found Board Games with Scott and Colin Sherman (obsessed with gaming) ANYONE REMEMBER THOSE ?? and i was hooked !!

Initial Impression: This is a game about the experience, where winning and losing shouldn't matter to the players. The game thematically presents the tropes found in many B-movies and introduces a traitor mechanism in the later half of the game. Although my first experience was wonderful, I can imagine that the random rooms, omens, events, and twist may not always line up for a cohesive story. Overall I enjoy the game with one caveat; for the 1st edition of the game, the FAQ is essential as the rulebook and Traitor Guide are missing critical information.

Great group game that can be loads of fun with anywhere from 3 to 6 players. It definitely is a bit more complex in regards to amount of mechanics and parts than Catan, Munchkin, or Ticket to Ride, but the strategy level seems to be much lighter than those games. The theme can be a bit dark for some people and the pre-haunt phase can be a bore if you aren’t playing with a solid lively group, but otherwise I don’t really have any complaints about this game! If you like thematic games that go deeper than your typical board game then Betrayal is a must! Recommended Players: 3-6.

I played through for the first time with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. I kept them in the dark about what would happen, and it made the first haunt a really awesome twist in the game, as they thought we were just having a mildly boring look through an old house. 

The first portion can be a bit dull, as is the beginning of any horror movie. It's slowly building suspense. Then, once the haunt triggers, the game is pretty terrifying. 

It's such a fun game. It'll definitely be a game to play at my game night this weekend.

This game can be a lot of fun, assuming you can get into the theme.  Playing at night, by candlelight, with eery music in the background is the definitive way of playing this one.

The downside is that the vast majority of the scenarios end up being completely one-sided slaughters for either the traitor or the explorers (so, technically its balanced overall).  The original rules ain't so grand, neither.

It's still fun, though.  It's good to end a gaming session with since it plays nice and quick.

My favorite game of all time. I've owned both versions. I prefer the original for the better components, funnier underground lake, and orange box, but the second version is fine too. I appreciate that they added more items and changed up the haunts a little.

After only a few plays I quite enjoy this game. Everyone is right though, the outcome of this game is in no way determined by the players skill. This game relies very heavily on luck, like almost completely on luck. The only thing the player actually gets to decide is the actual direction they move. 

I still enjoy this game though. But my group also got into it and just enjoyed the story that goes a long with it. It is definitely a role playing game and if you don't treat is as such you will not enjoy it one bit.

RATING: 5.5
It's fun and really feels thematic, but half the scenarios don't seem to work. Additionally there is the issue that once the haunt starts players can find themselves at very different power levels as far as what equipment and events they have randomly found. Ultimately for me, the game is just far too based on dice roll, especially the switch between exploration and the haunt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I really wasn't impressed with the game. It shows its age. I feel like the game play is quite fragile as things can fall apart quickly if the dice rolls are bad or room flips are unlucky. Too much dice rolling leads to a pretty random game.

In some ways I shouldn't like this game because it wades into the world of story telling but it works for me. There's enough actual mechanics that the story aspects become a bonus. Definitely needs the right group...one that's willing to go along with the story elements. If you take the game too seriously it's flaws become apparent. The fact that every game is unique (well, unless you play a lot) is a mechanic I wish other games could somehow copy.

RATING: 5
This was a fun game for awhile.  We had an initial creep out factor at first, and then the gameplay was clever, and the endgame/find out who the bad guy was mechanic was neat, and then the next game it was less fun.  And so on.  As far as it is a scary game, it is like Nightmare On Elm Street scary: creepy concept, and the first time you see it, still scary.  Then by the time Dream Warriors hits the VCR deck, it is a joke.  Too bad it's not like the Exorcist kind of scary.  That shit where she walks down the stairs backwards and twisted up?  That will be scary forever, not like this game.

An extremely fun cooperative game with a very neat traitorous mechanic when the Haunt occurs.  After 12ish plays of the game, I still haven't been the traitor, and I really want to be one.  There are also a lot of scenarios that can be randomly used when the Haunt occurs, so this game comes with high replay value.

RATING: 6.5
Really cool RPG feel to the different characters and their stats that gets you into your character and makes the whole game feel like a horror movie. Any game that makes you scared of cardboard circles is going to be a fun one. HOWEVER, the deduction in my rating comes from lack of quality in components and fiddliness. The stat counters slide back and forth, so we had one player keeping track on paper. There will also be multiple trips to the rulebook, which makes the flow a little stop and go. Fun and immersive overall, but too clunky to be great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
lacking in rule clarity completely. Fun until the second half starts. from there it gets misleading and hard to play. I have given the game more than a dozen goes and never been satisfied with the result - always hoping that the next scenario will work out.

Despite this the game is incredibly fun! There is no other game that I have such mixed feelings about. I traded it a while back so my friends would stop asking for it. I'd love another copy.

Worthy of a proper reprint!* acquired new edition. Finally! Too bad its not as good of quality...I miss the kidney token...

This game is the epitome of fun! The mechanics are simple enough to explain to non-gamers and the sense of cheesy B-movie fun it provides is joyous.  OK, yeah, it has player elimination in the haunt phase, but can you really capture the feel of a schlocky horror film without heroes getting offed?

Extraordinarily finicky, this game is a real hit or miss.  When it hits, it hits hard and that is all a person will ask for when I come around.  When it misses, it misses hard.  I tend to enjoy this game as much as those around me are enjoying it, so it is a hit or miss for me every time I play it.  It is as if this game were bipolar having a high one play and a low the next.  For a highly themed game that is reletively quick, this game is great.

Sure it's a luck fest, but it never pretended to be anything more.  The point is, you can still have lots of fun and laughs due to the rolls.

Sure that's luck based, but since everyone cheers in triumph, or sighs in defeat, how can you not have fun?

Like a spin off of every bad 50's horror movie but can still be mindless fun, but more often it just feels stale. A lot of the time, the game plays you as much as the other way around.

this is a neat idea for a game. much of the game is randomly generated as you play. will says the game is similar in idea to cabin in the woods. i thought that was a great movie, therefore, this game must be good. 
as the name implies someone is usually the traitor (spoiler alert). 
it sucks when you are the priest and fall into the basement immediately. 
mechanics are easy to pick up. a small child could play this game but could be disturbed by the mature themes such as conflict, implied sexual tension, witchcraft, exposure of ankles, small children in peril.

For some reason when you start this game you are right into the theme. Everything looks very good and the exploring of the house is fun. First part of the game does not really have a goal so you aimlessly wander around and explore. When the haunting starts the players have a goal, either to do evil or to save the day. Requires quite a bit of solid teamwork for the heroes to win some of the haunts. Can see how (the first part of) the game can get repetitive over time. For me it's still fresh and surprisingly fun!

(From library) Not a bad game but I think something's missing.

Although the first part of the game is supposed to be cooperative, it really isn't. If someone has to move really slowly because they don't have batteries in their flashlight, why would you stop doing whatever you're doing to help them? They could be the traitor. Also, why would you trade items or leave them behind for someone else to pick up if you don't know if they're going to be on your side to the end?

Initially I had this rated as a 9, but after about 20 playthroughs, a lack of playtesting has become really apparent in many of the scenarios.  A completely nonthreatening traitor is bound to happen once in a while just due to the random of the nature of the game, but in Betrayal this happens so often that it becomes plain frustrating for the random joe that gets picked, and hurts the theme and sense of dread for everyone involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is a lot of random, but it's almost always a fun ride, even if the endgame can be a one-sided anti-climax. That really isn't all that common, and with how many times I've played this game, I've still only seen maybe half of the 50 scenarios!

started, learned and explored the first time with only 2 players! it was fun playing the 2-player variant(4 characters, each player controls 2 until a haunt starts, where the traitor plays only 1 and the other then controls the other 3 characters) :D

eventually we found other people to teach and play it and so far it's one of my favorites.

I'm not a huge fan, but my (casual gaming) friends seem to like it.

The game can be very quick (if the Haunt happens quickly) or very long (if there's lots of exploring.)

The variant where the Haunt starts sooner sounds like a good one.  (If only I could find that variant!)

The game can also be hit-and-miss, for instance, if two items are necessary and you've already found both (instead of having just found one and having to explore for the other), the game's going to get a lot easier and less dynamic.

A game with a lot of great ideas, but not always successfully executed.  A great reason for the "accelerated game" variant.

Love love this game! 

It's all about having a spooky adventure, and there are 52 fun and kooky different stories that can happen.

Look, first of all this is a cooperative game. So those of you who love to win and feel like you are clever by strategizing, this is not quite that kind of game.

People who like clearcut games, this one is random and uneaven, that's the price you have to pay for the key elements of the game:
You never know what's going to happen, what behind the next door or who will turn on the group and become the traitor. 

Strongly thematic and all about random fun exploration and having fun with different stories.

Served best with thematic music, candelights and dramatic reading of the cards.

Played this one a lot more and it has improved in my eyes a bit.  The first half of the game is really completely random, but it gives the illusion that you have some control of what's happening.  The haunts have mostly been unbalanced one way or the other, but all of them have left us with the feeling that "If we'd done _this_ a little differently things might have worked out better."  Also, one of them had really neat clues and ended up being a ton of fun.

A bit unbalanced, a bit random, but some fun is certainly there.  What's with the vanilla pieces though?  I think a picture of a zombie on the token might be better than just "zombie".

In the horror game-type which features many crappy games, this gem shines probably due to lack of competition. The problem is that your experience is heavily weighted by which haunt you draw. With the right group though this can be enjoyed (and not take all night like Arkham Horror/Mansions of Madness) and my wife and I have even played this more like an RPG with each of us controlling 2 characters and then giving away 1 character to the other player when the haunt is triggered.

It's fun Ameritrash. Best with players who can get into the storytelling of it and don't actually care if they win or lose because the scenarios are usually not very balanced.

However, sometimes it unfortunately falls a little flat and can sometimes get repetitive. Definitely depends on the right player mentality...

Reading the rules and the haunts or literally anything in this game is an absolute struggle. Just house rule everything that doesn't make sense to you, trust me, it's much easier than trying to find specifics within the rules. Also, use an app for this game. It makes the character point tracker much easier than the garbage provided by the game. Components are less than adequate.

Now to the actual game. It's alright. Tile exploration that inevitably sets up the haunt is creative. The Haunt scenarios are also creative but good luck trying to be a survivor because every Haunt monster seems to be over powered. I try my best to avoid this game but the theme is attractive to people so it tends to come into play more often than I'd prefer.

Interesting semi cooperative game where the traitor is determined halfway through and there are 50 possible different scenarios, setup by every game having tiles placed differently. This one is very fun to play, although requires some house rules in certain situations. The only main con I have with this game is that it's entirely possible for the random "haunt" to be mostly in one sides favor based on what happened up until that point. But still, the variability and intrigue make this one a must try for everyone. 

Also, the way the two separate books was done can be incredibly confusing, and it's hard to tell what you should and shouldn't be sharing with the other players.

A typical AT game with story driven by walls of text on cards, too many effects to keep track off and shallow dice rolling. Hard decisions don't really matter, as pretty much everything in this game is random. Not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not really my type of game, too random in terms of the rooms you explore, the cards you turn over, the dice you roll. However, I really enjoy the mystery element of the haunt, determined by which Omen causes the haunt and in which room, leaving nearly 50 possible endings to the game with different stories, conditions and so on associated with them. I can really understand why this makes BaHotH so popular with the thematic crowd.

*Update* now own a copy and the kids love it. Will get several more plays.

RATING: 8.5
A fast-paced and fun cooperative game: even though Betrayal at the House on the Hill is quite complex it is very easy to understand and quickly grows as a satisfying experience even for newcomers. Unlike the usual witch-hunt games, this one’s betrayal system causes no problem, for everything about the turn of events is set by a table in the rulebook: thus it is immediately clear who the «betrayer» (often a victim himself) is, which prevents both confusion and the usual suspecting everyone else that in the end kills such games.

Enjoyment of the game wildly changes from play to play depending on how it progresses (and which betrayal you get).  We've had some wonderfully exciting games that left us wanting to play again and some horribly boring ones where we couldn't wait for it to be over.

Sometimes the game feels as though the traitor is at a huge disadvantage with a larger amount of players.

Definitely interesting in continuing to give it a try as the general idea of the game is great.

This game seems like it has a lot of potential, my family really seems to enjoy building the mansion up until the haunt.  When the haunt occurs no one is willing to read the traitor part so I have to just take over that character and figure things out myself.

Despite a million tokens that are hard to keep up with, I think this is a really cool game that works as a pseudo-RPG or an adventure game. It's a lot of fun, and I love building the house differently each time.

Chels: It really depends on who you play with, especially for a good storytelling experience and a smooth play (not for beginners!)

RATING: 6
When introducing this game to players, especially those used to the German school of gaming, provide these caveats before starting:

1. There are rule ambiguities.  The scenarios may tell you to do something but leave you with more questions.  Make a best guess and keep the game moving.

2. The haunts usually are either too easy for the traitor, or too easy for the heroes.  So the ending will likely be anti-climactic.

3. The game is not strategic.  You may die from bad luck and there be nothing to prevent it.  Whether you win or lose has little to do with how clever you are.

The game is more for the experience.  At the end, a story will be told, and the journey there can be fun.  If the players know what to expect going in, everyone can have a good time.  It is a unique experience and I am glad to own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After about 10+ plays of this game, it definitely gets pretty stale. Once you've seen all the different cards, you just know what to expect from then on out and no one at the table even feels like reading them anymore. It's all so random too. You can end up with crazy high stats when the haunt begins or you can end up one stat away from death.  

At least at the end, there is still the anticipation of the haunt. That feeling of not knowing what you're going to get in too. That will at least last a few more plays.

Two problems, the haunts are usually so imbalanced and random that they aren't very fun for at least one person and the rules are not very well written. For me, I needs detailed rules that don't leave anything out. We usually have to fill in the blanks and come up with house rules for a lot of situations.

Still, in all honesty, I look forward to playing the game. It's like an uncontrollable roller coaster ride that feels slightly different every time. Sure, The game is so random that it's hard to control the outcome, but at least if you have a good group of people playing, it's a damn good ride.

RATING: 7
Cute little game that has a surprising amount of depth to it. Not just boring filler - as you play it you will build your own horror story narrative. The two main problems with it is that it can't really be played with less than four (and five is better), and it feels long. If your group wants something fun and light to fill up a couple of hours, this is the one to go for.

The boardgame equivalent of Cabin in the Woods. It's just unfortunate that newbies can end up as the haunt and misread the rules. Only play with experienced boardgamers. And yet... not much by way of actual choice. It's theme is really what shines.

Engrossing game of haunted house searching. Reminds me of Chill: Blackmorn Manor. The second edition tightens up ambiguities in the original. No game plays the same way twice. A well done expansion featuring The Mystery Gang would be awesome!

If spooky fun is your thing, get it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game is good for a fun horror-themed romp. Don't play it with anyone that is too competitive, because based on the house layout and experience level of the eventual "betrayer", once the haunt happens, the game can greatly favor one side or the other. Plus, a "betrayer" that doesn't have a good grasp of the rules (especially when they change during the haunt) can ruin a play. This still gets played a good deal due to accessibility of the initial mechanics and fun theme.

Really loved this game for a while.  Still do, but don't play it much.  The tile drawing exploration is great, the cards and omens are really thematic, and the characters make it feel like a B horror flick.  Super thematic, and the hidden traitor aspect is cool, too.  But the haunts are hit or miss.  When I first played the game, I'd have ranked it a 9.  But I've moved on.  Would still play it if someone suggested it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game’s biggest strengths are tied to some of its biggest flaws: 
Pros:
It has massive replay-ability because there are 50 different haunts. I seriously doubt I’ll ever play all of them while owning the game myself.
I LOVE how the house exploration always give the game a new feel. Even the same haunt won’t usually play out the same way, due to the unexpected nature of the exploration and dice rolls.
Cons:
Because there are so many different haunts, you’ll inevitably run into some rule issues. I’ve seen many haunts that seemed very, very difficult for the traitor to ever win, or the non-traitors to ever win. If you have someone that is overly concerned about these “balance” issues, this game might annoy you at times.
Also about the rules… it can be fairly complex to understand from just reading the rulebook. A quick Youtube video showed me some of the mistakes I made trying to play this one “blind” out of the box. I’ve heard there are even some extra printouts online that can be printed to add to your rulebook to try and clarify some of the confusions caused by this rulebook, but I haven’t gone through the trouble to find and print these yet. A re-vamp of the rulebook would be helpful, and maybe the expansions to the game I’ve heard about also help this.

RATING: 5
Not as much tactics or strategy as I had hoped.  Much of the game plays out as a story that happens by the random card draws.  I like more control so I would rather play the Buffy:TVS (cooperative game) or Arkham Horror (2005 edition).  When the "haunt" starts, I enjoy the deduction aspect of the game where both the players and traitor are trying to figure out the secret powers and goals of the opponent.  OTHERS SAY: seems monotonous, lots of waiting, can get killed by the rooms if unlucky, bad gets worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A game that exists in two parts, building the house, then the haunt. It is a neat setup that makes each game feel a bit different with winning conditions being unknown. Good fun, though some of the games have been very easy to win with one side or the other. Not much tension.

RATING: 6
My rating of this may be coloured by the fact that I was the traitor the first 4 times I played it (pre-logged games). I don't object to being evil, but it does get old after a while. There's also the issue of the original rulebooks being so full of problems. But once you download the revised Survival and Traitor books (as of Dec. '05) and play a couple games with the right group, it's quite fun.

Make sure to play this with a group that doesn't mind some down time, and who are flexible about making up house rules on the fly to cover specific situations. Also, don't play too often, or it will lose it's charm.

Final suggestion: if you continue to be named the traitor and begin to tire of it, I suggest declaring a "[your name here] is not the traitor today" rule, and switch characters with someone at the haunt if you're the traitor again. Worked for me.

Love this game! It has such a massive amount of stories to explore (50!)that it just keeps the suspense and excitement fresh with each play. I love the aspect of starting the game cooperatively only to end up with someone becoming a traitor and the change in gameplay that makes for. The tiles are amazingly realistic for the various rooms and areas of the house with detail right down to the rugs in a room. A cheaper alternative to Mansions of Madness with more storylines to play through. It won't have the same depth as Mansions of Madness but it's worth the purchase. The tiles can warp if you get an older set though which is unfortunate but shouldn't ruin the gameplay itself.

RATING: 7
I absolutely love this game in it's opening, setting the stage, telling a story, this game is excellent at that.

Unfortunately, the wildly different scenarios make this game a very unpredictable one, and sadly, more often then not, unpredictable in the bad way.

Still a very fun game that threatens to go bonkers at any moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is, of course, a classic game that has been reissued and many of its original ideas have been copied in other games. It shows its age a little bit in the first half of the game where players wander around really waiting for the real game to begin. It's fair to say that the game's design "invites you in" but your group has to be willing to add the proper spirit to the play of the game because the mechanics won't drag you in on their own (as do the mechanics of Chaos in the Old World or Twilight Struggle, for example). That said, with the right group in the right mood, this has to be regarded as a game that deserves to hit the table once in a while. The fact that the traitor - along with a whole new set of mechanics and win conditions - are revealed halfway through each game makes this still a highly original and fun game to play. It's a must play game for Halloween.

One of favs, almost always gets played when we have friends over. It's just so goofy and fun, and I adore games with flavor text on everything.

Can't beat the spooky haunted house theme either- looking forward to the expansion.

PLayed it on Saturday for the first time and really enjoyed this one.  I ended up starting the haunt and being the traitor and I almost won but one of the remaining players roles a might role with 6 dice and rolled an 11...I couldn't believe it...what a great game.  It is very thematic and played with the right people it can be really fun.  Can't wait for this to hit the table again...it may come out on Thanksgiving!

RATING: 6.5
A lot of potential with so many different variations.  It is a mix of story and game, so play it with people who enjoy storylines rather than simply trying to win.

1st Play:  Traitor lost so quickly we made her do a second haunt and she lost again quickly.

2nd Play:  No traitor, we were all just walking around looking for treasure at the whims of dice rolls.  Bad.

3rd Play:  No traitor, we were all trying to fight and dice became a huge deal.  Pretty bad.

4th Play:  Traitor worked fine, but the haunt came so early that the things one side needed had no way to be found before a time limit was up.  Good, but suffered from too early haunt.

RATING: 6
The idea of this game really excites me. It is incredibly unique with high variability and a must have with the right group. Needless to say, the components and rulebook are subpar. Gameplay is flawed at any player count and most of the haunts are funny but anticlimactic. 

As a group, you'll randomly wonder around acquiring items with no strategy. You'll want to talk in spooky voices and maybe even laugh a little. Then suddenly, the game has had enough of you... You're placed in teams and given agendas with vague guidelines. Whether you win or lose, or some clarify rules, you realize it's too late... You were the ones betrayed.

Pretty fun game.  I have only played it twice, and I question replay-ability a little.  The end of the game seems like there are a ton of options.  We did however run into the same event cards both games.  They were very thematic.  I just believe after a play through or two you may just read the effects and continue, as opposed to reading the whole card.  Very good theme, and we did enjoy it.

RATING: 6
This is a really neat game that I would recommend, but I think it desperately needed more revision and play testing before it was released, because the gaming experience varies drastically between games. Sometimes it's a blast and sometimes it's a disappointment, and there's nothing the players can really do to guarantee this is a positive gaming experience every time, it honestly just depends on the freakishly particular circumstances at the time you just happen to be playing.

I haven't used the recent expansion just yet, but I plan to do so, because this is a really neat game with a lot of potential, but as it currently stands, there is far too many variables ranging from game to game affecting the experience in such drastic manners that it's impossible to make this recommendation wholehearted.

I love the way the scenarios are chosen by what objects are found, in what room, and by whom.  The game drips with theme.  However, I wish there was a little more to do after the scenario is revealed (or maybe a slower reveal process) - maybe a little bit more investigating or multiple tasks to accomplish.  The story seems to go from denouement to conclusion in one quick leap.

This is, by far, Avalon Hill's best non-warfare game.  This was the peak of their game development.  Unfortunately, that means that after this game, their ideas went downhill from there.  In this game, you play as a character, exploring a haunted house, looking for clues and items.  The house is built from randomly shuffled tiles, so the house is NEVER THE SAME WAY TWICE!!!  My friends who hate board games always insist on playing this one, so you gotta know its a winner!  If you don't have this in your collection, then your collection is incomplete.

RATING: 7
Es un juego de exploración en el que unos personajes se adentran en una casa encantada. Cada jugador lleva un personaje que está caracterizado por cuatro parámetros (fuerza, cordura, inteligencia y rapidez). La partida está dividida en dos fases. En la primera, todos los jugadores son compañeros y se dedican a explorar habitaciones (losetas que se van añadiendo a la casa). La casa tiene tres plantas. Las habituaciones en ocasiones ocultan sucesos, objetos y presagios. Cada vez que se descubre un presagio hay una tirada para determinar si se pasa a la segunda fase del juego o no.
Cuando se pasa a la segunda fase del juego, uno de los jugadores se convierte en un traidor. Según el lugar donde se haya descubierto el presagio que ha causado el inicio de la segunda fase, y el presagio, se determina un reto. El reto es diferente (y oculto) para el traidor y para el resto de los jugadores. A partir de ese momento, el traidor y el resto del grupo tienen que tratar de cumplir con el reto. Cuando uno de los dos lo consigue la partida termina. El traidor puede ganar o perder la partida. Si pierde, el resto de los jugadores ganan.
Está entretenido  y jugado con la gente adecuada, puede ser muy divertido. Rejugabilidad inmensa.

RATING: 5
A game so thin it's almost sickly. The first half is a randomly-generated exploration phase that is meandering and meaningless thanks to nonexistent goals; the second half is more structured and satisfying but still neutered of its complexity thanks to the first half. The thrills of turning over a new house tile and seeing what gets built where wears thin after the first few plays, and a few of the Haunts -- the second half 'activities' -- are either overused or totally broken. This game does serve as a good introduction to more complex, similar games like Arkham Horror, but ultimately doesn't have any staying power once you migrate to games with a tighter design.

Eh.  Only played once, and got dragged into it by a VERY enthusiastic person who got frustrated by everybody else's reluctance to roleplay.  Would like to try it again with a different group (and when I'm in a more receptive mood), preferably after the rules are cleaned up a bit.  I suspect, though, that it'll go in the trade/sell pile after that.

This game is an absolute blast to play. I've heard a lot of people say that they hate the game because the mechanics aren't tight or there is frustrating randomness. I don't experience this when I play. This game is a ton of fun and that's what should make a game good, is it fun to play. There is replay value like crazy in this game due to the number of scenarios and the tiles make sure that the house will look different every time. Overall a fantastic game that most groups will enjoy. Component quality is an issue in this one, specifically the clips used on character cards. If you can download a Betrayal app that solves the issue or you can get mini paperclips to use instead of the provided clips and that works fine as well.

Me gusta el concepto general de grupete de coleguillas que se mete en una casa encantada (al más puro estili Scooby Doo) y en un momento de la partida acontece un evento que desencadena una tración. A partir de ese momento el juego se convierte en una competición de todos contra uno, con objetivos secretos.
Las mecánicas son sencillas, permite jugar a entr 3 y 6 jugadores, y los "guiones" de las partidas que he jugado me han gustado mucho mucho. Tiene que ser muy curioso el estar persiguiendo al "malo"  sin saber exactametne que debes hacer con él.

My kind of game.  Like exploration, the characters, the traitor.  Neat how the story changes based on the tile explored when an omen check fails.  But, it needs a nice upgrade--components are boring and uninspired, detracts from the game.  The rules are vague which slows the game down.  But, I would definitely play more.

This is the first exploratory, board building game with an emphasis on horror that I ever played.  
All the rules can take a bit of getting used to for the uninitiated gamer, but once you get rolling this game is plenty of fun.
As with everything. the more you put into it, the more you'll get back. 
Now that I'm starting to play with more seasoned gamers I'm starting to look at 'Mansions of Madness' which adds even more depth and storytelling elements to this style of game.

RATING: 6
Bad first impression. M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶t̶a̶ ̶r̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶.̶

EDIT: Much better go of this the last time around. The randomness can be annoying, but I don't mind a lot of randomness in games. And the dice, especially for the haunt, do add great tension. Some of the events are awful, but overall the game is a breeze and quite thematic and a very fun tile laying exploration meets horror. The atmosphere is infectious, if only the mechanisms didnt feel dated.

EDIT #2: And a bad play through rears it's head again! I hate the inconsistency to this game and that the expansion did nothing to solve the issues with obtuse rules. If there's one thing I really don't like this game more than anything else it's the weird pace. The first time you have to go away and read your own section, it's a bit exhilarating. But after that while having to pause and learn what new game your playing gets so old. And the first half of the game starts to feel way too samey and the second half can be so long! Not sure I'll get through too many more games of this one... but some people really do like it, so who knows?

This should have been more fun than it turned out to be. Both plays, the haunt started before we even made 2 passes through the player turns. Players didn't have a chance to "item up", and the house just wasn't that big. We are going to use a house rule to change things, though. We enjoyed the traitor aspect so much, that my buddy's girlfriend wanted to do it the second time even thought the rules said it should have been me.

RATING: 7
The game that keeps being new. It always starts out the same - characters exploring a haunted house - but there are many different ways the house can be haunted. One game you may be trying to re-unite a ghostly bride with her groom's dead body and the next you may be fighting a frankenstein monster. For most scenarios, there is a traitor so one player gets possessed by the house and starts working on the side of evil (as well as controlling monsters). 

The one drawback is that there are a MILLION tiny little pieces. I highly suggest getting lots of tiny little bags and finding a way to label what's in them so you don't hold up a game that can move fast and have an excited, quick pace by searching for the little cardboard circle labeled "girl" or "rat" or "secret passage."

Some of the scenarios are better than others. Most require teamwork and cooperation, some more than others. 

I've run this game in the YP (Young Player) room at Kublacon and it works great with kids. However, if you are going to play this game with younger people (I don't recommend under age 10), you might want to pre-select the haunting scenario to make sure it will be something that is easier for kids to understand and will keep their attention like one where everyone is fighting one monster and then make sure that the traitor is NOT a kid.

This game has two parts -exploring and building the haunted house and the haunt where one player becomes the traitor.
When this was the first non monopoly board game I owned, it was really fun.
However
the big problems with this game
1) The first phase sucks. All you do is move into rooms and have things happen to you. There is very little real choice in this phase. Everyone just waits 30 minutes for the real game to start.
2) The 50 different "haunts" (ending scenarios) are all sorta same-ish and frequently unbalanced. Many of them boil down to "get x item and go to y room and attempt dice roll while avoiding monster." The first few times they are charming, but the gimmick gets old fast.

It can be a charming Halloween game, especially when paired with silly RP. However, there are better games to play. I'm likely going to give my copy away

I've only played this game twice and really enjoyed it both times although I wish there was more story around exploring the haunted house at first.

I would love to see this game reimplemented with a narration gameplay mechanic so stories and monster could play a more dynamic role, but that would require a complete rebuild of the game and could possibly destroy the heart and soul of the game.

Great theme, great replayability, great gameplay.
I love it despite a few flaws:
Although you have 50! different scenarios it always feels a bit same-ish.
The quality of the cards is not that good.
And, depending on luck and scenario, it can be an awful game to the traitor, where he is left useless and unable to do/change anything.
The game truly lives through it's theme...
...but the game itself, taken for what it is, isn't that great.

RATING: N/A
A co-op/traitor game which faithfully plays homage to the classic horror movies of the 50s and 60s. Explore the house of evil, discovering omens, mysteries and eventually... betrayal! This game suffers from similar problems to games like Arkham Horror in that IMHO it's overengineered and suffers from an overabundance of pieces. The game feels a little bit skewed in favour of the traitor too but that could be just be excusing my inept attempts to stop them. Despite its flaws I have a weekness for this game. If you like horror-themed games and are willing to put up with some flawed mechanics this is a lot of fun.

This one was a hit with the boys. The game balance can be all over the place depending on the haunt as well as the items found. But the game goes by fast enough and has enough story elements to it that the kids talk about it afterwards. So the experience fun factor definitely outweighs any game design issues.

I'd rather play Mystery Mansion or maybe even Dungeoneer instead.  This is not a strategic game so people who want to think shouldn't even bother playing.  And then once the haunt began, the book didn't even tell us how many hits the demon lord we had to kill twice had and since we were bored and more people had showed up we decided to ditch the game in favor of something fun.

Betrayal is one of those games you'll either love or hate.  It has very little in the way of strategy, but is long on narrative.  It has more control than Tales of the Arabian Nights, but less than something like Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness.  We don't play it often, but it does play fine with 2, and it is unique in that the horror theme is kind of general - there are all kinds of plots/story lines that can occur, which is neat.  Really, I own it because it reminds me of Mystery Mansion, which was one of my faves as a kid - building up the manor house is just plain fun.  Long on flavor, light on decisions, but very enjoyable once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is just a fun game to play. No, it's not perfect: timing of card effects and haunt instructions are often unclear, and the game sometimes does break down. There is very little strategy, and there is tons of randomness. 

But with all the bluffing and the suspicion created by the traitor, the game still makes for a silly, stupid good time. The theme is hilarious (it reminds me of all those campy Bruce Campbell flicks) and the randomness of the events/rolls just makes it funnier. My husband loves it, and I don't mind playing it, so we're keeping it for now. Just a warning for more die-hard gamers: if you take this game too seriously, you are bound to be disappointed.

I hope the reimplementation of this fixes all the unforgivable errors of the initial printing.  This game had such potential, but the huge book of errata distracted from the enjoyment of it.  I may buy the new reprint if I find that all the problems have been addressed.

RATING: 8
Very fun romp through an evil mansion.  Rules are a bit open-ended but that hasn't been a problem since the game is very RPG'ish -- you all just agree on what makes sense and move on.  The bits are disappointing for $40, especially compared to other Hasbro products at similar price points (HeroScape, History of the World, Star Wars Queen's Gambit, any of the new Risk games, etc.) and some of the haunts aren't very well thought-out, but it's a fun diversion and perfect for playing around Halloween.

When I finally got to play, it was with a well-loved copy the owners obviously played a lot, and it included many expansions.

I'd like to try it again with a different group.

Betrayal is probably the Worst game that ive ever LOVED. I say this because of how completely random the outcome is. Sometimes the game is unwinable for one side or the other, and the rest of the time its just very skewed. It's probably the worst balanced game ive ever played. Having said that i have a blast every time. Well most times anyway. Most people i play with get totally into the theme of the game and can leave the need to win at the door, and that is required in my opinion to enjoy this game. Their have been a few plays of this where a person or two cared about winning instead of having a cool experience and they brought the whole table down. For that reason and that reason alone i try to only play with people i know will be happy to almost roleplay this game. Im not sure why the box doesn't say you can play it with 2 players, my wife and i have played it several times each controlling 2 characters and when the haunt happens whoever controlled that character takes that role and the other person takes the three remaining. it's a blast this way.

UPDATE: Played this again for Halloween, just for grins. You know, it helps a lot if you go in expecting the game to be totally stupid, and probably broken, and prepared to roll with it. If you can be amused by the fact that these are some of the most horridly confusing rules ever, and that you are likely to have to read even a simple haunt 3 or 4 times just to figure out what the hell they are trying to get across, it's possible to come away feeling like the time spent on this game wasn't completely wasted.

The game is still total crap, of course. I was looking over the credits, and I blame Mike Selinker. He's the lead developer. It's clear that this was a complete and total development failure. And Mr Selinker has certainly been involved in more than his share of really bad games. I'll be treating his name as a monstrous red flag in future.
---
Awesome concept, poor execution. Oddly, reminds me of Escape from Colditz, although not as good. You will have fun directly proportional to the number of cards you get to draw and keep. If you are the bad guy and draw few or no cards, you're screwed and the game will be dumb. If you get some cards, you can maybe slow the good guys down. The breadth of scenarios sounds really cool, but it appears some of them weren't even proofread, never mind playtested. If you can get into the spirit of the game, that's cool, but in order for this kind of cooperative game to be compelling, it has to be *hard* for the cooperative side to win. With more players, this is not hard, and can even be a cake walk if the players stick together. An awesome idea and a valiant try I think, but it's just not well-executed. Play LotR: Sauron. People may say "but it's not a game, it's a role-playing experience", but it also lacks any of the good qualities of role-playing, and the utter randomness of the game fails to convey any real sense of theme. It's just Talisman. If you can get into it without much help from the game, you'll be in good shape; but you could say that about almost anything.

A fantastic game *IF* you have someone who knows the rules very well and has all the errata printed out and ready to go. The multiple scenarios (50 I think) take you to every corner of the haunted house/horror genre. I would love to hear that someone had picked this up for a reprint.

I have a blast playing it most of the time, but damn, could the rules have any more holes in them?  When the haunt comes along, nobody even knows what they're supposed to be doing half the time, or even what they can/can't do, leaving everyone confused.  This makes it nearly impossible to play with non-gamers who would probably otherwise enjoy this game.  Nearly every game of this I've played has been ruined by confusion over rules.  The game would have probably gotten an 8 from me, but the gaping holes in the rules leave me no choice but to keep this one in my ratings basement.

Game has lots of variety, fun mechanics, unique characters, nice pieces, and feels Like a choose your own adventure book or a little like Clue to some degree.   My least favorite aspect of the game was the clips used to keep track of your abilities on the player cards.  They don't fit snugly and it's hard to keep track of ability changes.  I suppose this can be remedied by using different clips at least.

Next to Arkham this is my favorite "co-op" game.  Even though one of your party members will turn on the rest, I still consider it a co-op game.  This game bleeds with theme and flavor.  From the exploration aspect, to the action cards, to the stories behind each scenario.  There is even a room called the mystic elevator that each turn can end up on anyone of the three floors.  If you are looking for a game that will put you in the middle of a slasher movie, this is it. This can also be a slight downer for some. Many of the action cards can be a bit intense depending on your play group. Tons of replay due to the 50 or so scenarios. One word of caution. If you own the game and play with a new group, force the fact that you will be the one to turn on everyone else. Otherwise the newbie might have some real trouble completing their part and making the game less enjoyable for both you and them. Only gave Arkham a 8.5 because of the time commitment.  This game gets a 9 because from the top down it hits nearly everything on the head.

Unbalanced, messy, heavily luck-based, far too many cardboard tokens, and a few of the scenarios are just plain broken. And it's my gaming group's favorite.

The game has loads of personality and charm, lots of fun elements, and gives a different story experience every time.

If you phase out some scenarios and let yourself sit back and enjoy the ride, it's a pretty good party game for nerds.

Hopefully the second edition will fix the rules issues.

A very fun party game with lots of replay value due to the multitude of scenarios available. Note that the game can be a bit of a struggle early on, especially for new players who end up as the villain. But once people are familiar with the game, it becomes quite enjoyable.

RATING: 9
Create-your-own adventure style game.  Explore and build a haunted house as you go along and activate one of 50 "haunts" which will dictate how the rest of the game is played and won.  most haunts turn someone into a traitor.  Really fun, though some haunts don't quite clarify everything well enough.

Fun game if you are a fan of the genre. I feel that the first half of the game becomes a bit repetitive over time as you explore the house waiting for the event to happen. I do love all the possible scenarios for amazing replayability but they are so unbalanced that some work very well and others are just no that interesting. Interesting but not on I'm dying to play all the time. Good for a Halloween evening with friends.

Interesting game with some unique elements.  The first half is kind of boring exploration with little difficulty, the second half the game changes completely as one of the players becomes a traitor and typically has a special win condition.  The players will get their own win condition and neither side is fully aware of what the other is trying to do.  It feels very satisfying and unique and is downright fun, despite the fact that balance is often lopsided.

This is a sweet game for a high school game group, which is who I have always played it with so far. There's a LOT of atmosphere and theme -- classic Ameritrash. Speaking of which, a lot of trash talking ensues after the "traitor" is revealed. A great game. So great that I'm not selling it despite the insane prices it's starting to reach on eBay.

Update: Kind of took me a long time to be able to articulate why I like Betrayal when I dislike so many fiddly American games, but I think I've finally got it:

To me, Betrayal feels like a light hour-long roleplaying game. The entire first half is like a playable character generator, and then the scenario proper kicks in and you've got to do the best with what you've got and see where the story takes you. Yeah, it's random and unbalanced but if you just embrace the theme it's a lot of fun.

A lot of people find the first half of the game dull and disconnected from the scenario, but I quite like things starting off slow and full of mystery. To me the whole start phase enhances the theme - I really feel like I'm exploring a haunted house and combination of building the map as you go and random scenarios really build excitement for me - [i]oh my god anything could happen! what's going to happen? will there be ghosts? skeletons? is that a vampire's coffin???[/i]

Almost no theme-first games have really stuck with me, especially not over the years. Betrayal has and I suspect it will be continue to be my go-to when I'm craving a spot of horror.

I have always had fun playing this. Even though the players have somewhat limited control the game is good, simple and atmospheric fun.

The bit when one of the players turns out to be evil (when the "Haunt" begins) can slow the game down a little if it is played with non-gamers who may not be confident with interpreting the sometimes hazy "Haunts" rules.  The fact that it plays very fast with a handful of players is a big plus.

You *need* the Universal Head files for this game that are available on its BGG page.  

Additionally, you also need the guide to counter storage too ( I cant remember the name of the kind BGG'er who made that).  It really works though.

It's a roleplaying game without the roleplaying.  Your character has no impact on the game whatsoever.  It just seems that this game was put together too fast to clear up its problems.  Everybody has all these items, but nobody knows exactly what they do or how to use them to keep the game intact.  This game is just too busy for me, and the haunt I played was just too boring.  I think it would be better to have character sheets like an RPG, that each person creates, and have easily recognizable items so that people know what is going on.  I think the idea was to make it easy for kids, but I even thought this game's little rules made it become overly complicated.

RATING: 7
Great game with a few but annoying faults.
The haunt can start very early, before even everyone has had a turn.
The game is great as a game to get people into boardgames unless they get the haunt as they get individual rules which seem to a lot of the time have one exception case not explained.

The concept behind the game is a good one: 50 different scenarios for a haunted house? Sounds exciting! The problem is that it's incredibly flawed in its execution. It really devolves to die rolling and card flipping. And every time I've played, the scenario is so poorly balanced that the winner is known about half an hour before the game actually ends. It's too broken to be enjoyable. Time and effort spent to balance the game would have gone a long way.

RATING: 4
This is a fun, harmless little game. There is some light decision making, but it's mostly an experience game. And it only takes around 45 minutes, so it doesn't outlast its welcome. 

That said, there are lots of rules ambiguities. And it can be bizarrely complicated when the heroes and villain have to read their special rules, and it is easy to mess it up, and those rules have their own ambiguities. Still, if everyone just interprets as best they can, so long as heroes and spirits are fighting to the death or insanity in a spooky haunted house, it all works out OK.

Also, even with multiple scenarios, once you've blown through the rooms and cards, probably not a lot of replayability. 

Update: Subsequent plays have been terrible. You really need to get lucky with the scenario as to whether it is interesting or competitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Definitely a game to enjoy the theme and playing, but with the random triggering of the Haunt, it's as likely to be unbalanced as not.  If you are very competitive, you won't like this.

RATING: 4
I was persuaded to buy this by two of my good friends whom my wife and I play games with around once every two weeks. They had played it before and found it to be a blast, so naturally I had to get it. Furthermore, it would fill a hole in my gaming library which I hadn’t managed to cover as I’m a eurogames guy. After we played it twice, I understand why I don’t like these kind of games but prefer eurogames, and I feel like I had been betrayed... 

It is just a lot of roll and move and overall not any fun. There are some tactics involved about when to use which items etc., especially once the haunt starts. But before the haunt starts, it’s a very uninteresting game which can drag. I understand that if you love the theme and feel you are a part of a group in this haunted house, it could be fun, but I don’t get the feeling of exploring a haunted house. 

Also, once the haunt starts, you need to read a bunch of rules, and if you are a new player and are the traitor, you might have some questions which can be hard to ask about without ruining the game. The actual haunts were quite uninteresting and I really didn’t feel like I was fighting a dragon – and that is important to feel in this game as the actual gameplay is lacking.

RATING: 5
RPG-lite game with lots of 'B movie' atmosphere. It's quite luck dependent and needs to be played with the right crowd who can enjoy the game for the experience it provides. The rules are fairly easy and the games short so player elimination is not too big a factor though it is frustrating when your character is killed off early on (usually by ending up trapped in the basement with the traitor). 

I think WotC missed a trick by not including some 2D stand-ups (like Steve Jackson's Cardboard Heroes) but I notice a fellow geek has provided a link in a thread so players can download their own.

Several plays to date. Here's a record of plays with my new 2nd edition copy (Scenario - Heroes [Dead heroes], Traitor *Winner*):

33 - Charlie (& his little dog, too), Nick, Me, [Keith, Robert], Mike the little girl *Heroes*

RATING: 7.8
Based on gameplay alone, Betrayal at House on the Hill is at least an 8 or 9, maybe even a 10, but the utterly abysmal components that this game came packaged with drag the score waaaay down. 

Seriously, the plastic figurines that my copy of the game came with are hideous. I am almost embarrassed to play this game with people because the miniatures look so horrid. 

Despite the crappy components however, this game is just dripping with theme and makes for a great, horror-themed evening. The rules are easy to learn, and that makes it a nice alternative to games like Arkham Asylum and Mansions of Madness. You can easily teach this game to new players in 5-10 minutes, and as soon as you know it, they will betray you and all of your teammates to some kind of terrible supernatural fate. 

This game is a lot of fun, but if you are serious about playing it often, I'd recommend looking for some spare components to replace what is packaged in the box.

A good 'experience' game. I feel like the theme is really strong in this one.

This is one of my favorite games, even though it can be a little 'wonky' at times. Some may say they don't like it because they don't have any direction at the beginning of the game, I can forgive that; I still enjoy that exploration phase.  Others will have negative feelings, because sometimes the odds will be stacked against one party or another, I can forgive it that, too (a necessary side effect of having app. 50 different stories to play).

This game is about atmosphere, and not tight mechanics.

RATING: 8.5
Quality Note - plastic clips used as markers on the character cards are the wrong size for the card stock. Ever so slightly too wide. Gently squeezing the tips together while dipping the clips in hot water (not boiling) for a few seconds before dropping them into an ice bath... Did the trick of tightening their grips. If they are too tight, widen them by slipping the clip onto the flat edge of a knife, dipping them in the hot water again and on to the ice bath. It would also be desirable that the clips reach to the numbers they point at, but this is a minor quibble. I am mostly upset that the game is not playable out of the box due to this oversight of the manufacturer.

Despite the fact that this game can be frustrating, monotonous and end disappointingly, when it shines it is tremendous fun.  A few bad rolls can start a spiral of doom, as your stats are reduced, weakening future rolls, and so on.  Sometimes it's just a struggle not to lose ground, and it's hard to be prepared for the haunt before knowing what it is.  Although I can't think of anything really positive to say, I've played games where both players won and antagonist won that were equally dramatic and exciting.

Since I've only played it once all the way through (this tends to be a game that comes out at the end of the night, which means getting booted out of the store halfway through), I can't speak for the variety with scenarios, which is supposed to be a strong point of this game.  In the one complete game I played, the strongest player had the item the good guys needed to win, and he was the one who turned on us, so we had no chance.  Other players told me that they'd never seen this happen in previous games; we just had horrible luck.  It was a good time, but I'm also told the game has an online errata list a mile long.

Main Positives: I like the two phases of the game from the simple coop game to "The Haunt" where it becomes a coop with a defector. An easy game with a cool theming.

Fun Factor: High to Medium
Complexity: Just lay tiles and roll dice when you draw an omen card. Then fight the traitor at the haunt phase. Not very difficult
Replayability: Yes! Hoping the haunt scenarios would be different every time.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Much better as a casual game but it doesn't take away the fun even if you're a gamer. Also, I might go for a game of this type of theme once in a while.

This game is gold with the right group. It has an awesome theme. The aspect of building the house as you adventure from room to room makes every game map of the house different. There are plenty of different haunts, which adds to the replay value. I have had a number of excellent experiences and a couple of bad ones. My only comment is that the haunt can get quite confusing based on the rule book language. Questions often arise on both the traitor and hero guides, especially for a new player. With the right group, and a bit of experience with the game it is almost always a fun time.  

P.S. I have many more plays than logged and have yet to play every scenario. I have also created a haunt of my own, and with some tweaking it is easy to adapt to the games rules.

This is a fun semi co-op with a traitor element.  It's not gonna knock anyone's socks off or blow the doors off of game design, but it's fun.  As for many little complaints you may see or hear, the components are just fine in new editions, although maybe a bit bland.  Having to pause when the haunt is revealed is not a big deal, in fact I think it adds to the tension and excitement in waiting to see what is about to happen.  It's not perfect, but decent.

There's always a rules question in each game, but just roll with it. The experience really plays out like a classic B-Movie. 

Eerie how the characters, events, rooms, omens and items relate sometimes when drawn. While random, it seems almost scripted. Really adds to the atmosphere.

When you start the game, you're not sure why you're in the house - it's more of a dungeon crawl as you explore and power up your characters - but once the haunt begins, you know why the hell you want to get out!

Cardboard components are well printed, but the stock they are on is terrible. Once punched, the tiles begin to warp immediately.

(Replacement tiles from WotC are better!)

Sometimes the game length can be quite short, for instance when one of your companion's somewhat rat-like face turns out to be more than coincidence and then you fall down a coal chute to the basement. Love this game. My rating, already high, may have to rise. I received the replacement tiles for my copy--happy about that.

What a broken, glorious mess this is. This is really more of a story-based featherweight RPG with pre-written scenarios. What I enjoy most about this is that it becomes more of an emergent story creator than an actual game, and as such I don't tend to care who ends up winning or losing. Ask anyone about their favorite experiences with this and you'll get handfuls of unique, personal stories. It's absolutely not for everyone and can be blatanty broken at times, but if you're in a mood to do something light and dumb, it's great.

RATING: 3.5
This can lead to some fun stories, but this one feels like a story telling activity and less like a real game to me. And that'd be fine except I don't think the writing is good enough to keep me engaged. This is a pass for me, i'll play to please my group but i'd never choose it or suggest it myself.

A fundamentally okay game, but one which depends heavily on randomness to determine if you'll get one of the interesting stories or not. It's a little clunky to learn for a simple game too, so not one that's teachable in a minute to new players.

Compared to other narrative games it simply doesn't fit the bill due to the inconsistency built into the single most important aspect of the game.

Really fun game. Could be an issue with limited hauntings available but there are community ones. They should seriously reprint this. You can't tell me they wouldn't make money off of the base game and haunt expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
The haunt is amazing, however this game live and dies on it's content as the gameplay itself is nothing to write home about. As a result the first half of the game is interesting until you've seen all of the event cards (maybe 3-4 games) then it's pretty boring and you're just waiting for the haunt to happen. But it works well enough to play like once a month or every two months, just repeat plays aren't really interesting enough (besides waiting to see what the haunt is - which there are enough of those to last a while).

The cooperative element is a huge bonus, allowing this to be easily accessible to casual gamers.  The theme is great.  The bits are nice....but the retail price is still too high for what you get.  Consider the source.

Played twice and would enjoy playing again.  This is light, make no mistake.  The rules are quick and simple...and not particularly tight. Be prepared to have to make a couple group rulings on unclear points.  But for a game that you can get on the table and start playing right away...they're ideal.  Just don't expect some intricate miniatures rules.

My two concerns with this game are 1) replayability and 2) niche.  There are the 50 basic scenarios and I'm sure there will be expansions. I also think they'll be pricey.  Once you've played a scenario, its not very appealing to do the same one again.  A lot of the fun is not knowing exactly what your opponent(s) objectives are.  Still, to be able to play it 50 times is probably plenty.  By then you can play "Betrayal at Van Down by the River" or whatever the next edition is.

As for "niche" what I mean is that this is not a gamers game.  Its a fun activity.  If I were meeting for 4-5 hours of gaming...I'd start with something meaty, then play Betrayal and then move on to something else meaty.  You won't get your fix of strategic thinking from this one.

Overall...I really like this game. I think the rating could go down with time...but right now I really want to play it some more.

Playing this is delightful -- we're fans of the "Oooooh! Spooooky!" genre.  I'd rate it higher, except that some mechanics are annoying (e.g., getting stuck in the basement for turns on end), as are the rules/errata confusion.

RATING: 5.5
How much you enjoy this game will depend a great deal on how you appreciate the mid-game twist. Partway through the game, one of you will be declared the "bad guy." Depending on your viewpoint, this could be seen jarring and unwelcome or a fun change-of-pace. The other problem is the lack of balance: many of the stories make the traitor enormously powerful, leading to a slow but inexorable defeat for the good guys. On the plus side, with 50 different mid-game twist storylines, there's a wealth of replayability here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent little title from old Avalon Hill. 

To summarize: the game is essentially a move and explore title for the first half, and then a frantic panic with combat affair on the back end. In the early going players are all cooperatively exploring the haunted house, however, as one comes to certain rooms Omen cards are flipped over which are, for lack of a better term, creepy events. Each time an omen card is picked up the player has to roll a number of dice (the Betrayal dice are 2 blanks, two 1's, and two 2's) and roll higher than the number of Omen cards that have been revealed over the course of the game. The first part of the game, this exploring aspect (wherein the party picks up useful items that will make the back half of the game more intersting) continues until one of these omen based (haunt) checks is failed; then the second half begins. The players then have to consult the massive chart in the scenario booklet (which contains 50 right now...I think?) and one of the players betrays the party and is given new objectives while the other players will continue to cooperate, trying to foil the betrayer's plans with the winner being the first team (betrayer or the 'good guys') to achieve their goal for the scenario revealed. 

The game play is pretty straight forward, and without going into it at super length, it works. The title isn't heavy by any stretch, the dice inject a healthy amount of randomness, as do the random mansion tiles, the random omen cards, and the random items. I think this game has to be taken for what it is, which is an experience game as opposed to a mechanically based one. Playing something like this is not about winning or losing, it's about seeing what happens. Like many of these types of games, deliberately gaming the system can lead to degeneration (i.e.: stat bonus rooms) and winning and losing is not even on the radar, at least it isn't if you want to have fun.

I think the hardcore strategy only gamers will be non-plussed by this, but anyone looking for a great horror themed light weight game that would be easily teachable to the casual set while still being fun should check this out.  I must finally add that the one hour playtime is perfect for this kind of game, any longer and the game would likely feel monotonous, but with it the pace is just right.

All of this said, this is one of those "occasionally it sounds good" sort of things. I would be willing to play it again, but on the balance I have now filled this game niche with the more versatile Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition, as that game has a similar vibe but fits a wider variety of game lengths than this one and is less dependent on having at least 4+.

I like the theme.  It was fairly easy to grasp.  
But, holy tokens!
That can cause a pause, when you find out who the traitor is, stalling the game.

I did swap out quite a few tokens for minis.  It's a pretty neat game, with a cool concept.

What's great is, it has alot of scenarios.  And you don't even know if you're the traitor until someone (including yourself) just happens to become the traitor.
(though I do think there is one scenario where nobodies the traitor)

Only good thing about it is the storytelling and role-playing. Other than that, you're just walking aimlessly and rolling dice, without much strategy or decision-making. Even for a role-playing game, the decision-making is lacking.

I like the idea of this game a lot, and used to be a lot more into it, but it rarely turns out to be as fun as I hope it will.

I enjoy that the house is built randomly each game, and the RPG elements remind me of the original D&D boardgame, which has a special place in my heart.

The problem ultimately ends up being the special rules that some with the Haunt phase. They are often very vague, and the person who becomes the villain is therefore so confused we can't progress without everyone reviewing the rules, which gives away the villain's secret goals.

I do really enjoy all the creepy flavour text on the cards, and the items are really fun. I have been able to do some pretty awesome things, like throw a stick of dynamite behind me into a room full of opponents as I lunge through a doorway, safe, into the next room. That was a good game, even though I lost in the end.

I also dislike the black plastic markers that mark your player's stats because they inevitably slide everywhere, and lose their place.

6.5/10 for everyone's frustration with the Haunt rules
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The haunted house theme is very fun. I also enjoy the fact that the game starts as a co-op and then, at some unknown time, the game play changes drastically. Someone becomes a traitor and it becomes one v. all. To enjoy this game, you need to take it lightly. Here are the problems: Since the time of "the haunt" is random, the board set-up can make a win for one side impossible. Additionally, the rules occasionally make no sense. More often than not, after reading through the haunt rules, both sides lean his/her head to the side and explain: "Huh... How does that work? What? Why?"

This game has such cool things like: different story every time, cool atmosphere etc.

But at the end is just like endless dice rolling over and over again. It has zero strategic deepness. You can be in a situation where you will almost immediately die after the haunt. Also the rule reading after the haunt is just... meh.

I had high expectations but I was disappointed at the end.

I don't want to play this game and my bad feelings towards this didn't go away.

Initial reaction is very, very good!  Rules are clean, simple, and don't get in the way of the atmosphere.  I _love_ how the game incorporates a distinct narrative arc with what is essentially a dungeon crawl.  I sort of _like_ the relatively crummy components because they remind me of original AH games- i.e., a zombie chit is a round counter with the word "zombie" in a plain font.  Old school!  Neat horror elements- Lovecraft, Dracula, black magic, demonic possession- it's nice to see a darker theme (that's not attached to some clunky game like Zombies) other than the usual Teletubbies-soft Eurogamer fluff.  I'm sure all the "Spielfrieks" will scoff at this one, because there is a lot of randomness (like all those trick-taking card games they seem to love) and the family un-friendly theme.  Bottom line- if you like the theme at all, you'll probably get a lot out of the game.

Lots of fun. A ton of scenarios can happen when the traitor appears (and no one knows who it will be until the last omen appears). There's enough variety to keep you coming back for more.

This is a fun game if you go into it with the right attitude.  Luck rules here and "try-hards" who have to win will be very frustrated.  I recommend you enjoy the ride as it is like acting out a low-budget 1980s horror movie.  I think the coop to competitive aspect is fantastic.  It's great to go from being an ally to the big bad in the story you are creating.  That being said, it's also possible to stumble into boringish, no-win scenarios where you simply just go through the motions until the game ends.  Still, it is enjoyable with the right crowd.

Very simple gameplay and quite dull throughout the first half of the game in repeat playthroughs, but the second half of the game following the haunt more than makes up for it.  Some of the haunts' rules are a bit quirky, however we thoroughly enjoyed all of them and it was quite a hit with our friends as well.

Love this game, mainly because it's one of the few games I can get my D&D group to play if we don't get quorum for D&D. Can see that it will have limited playability, though, repeating scenarios with the same players wouldn't be so good. Much better with the revised scenarios books - most of the games we played with the printed rules were decidedly in favour of the traitor, and one was decidedly in favour of the heroes. The revised scenarios seem much more balanced.

Where have my plays gone? I've played more than twice, and I'm sure I've logged more than it shows..

I like the way the house gets randomly generated as you explore and I like the fact that there are so many different scenarios that could happen depending on the omen and room. I don't like the beginning of the game because it feels like you are just aimlessly wandering the house watching your stats change randomly. It's worth playing through that part though, because the Haunt is always fun.

Great Ameritrash haunted house boardgame. Good betrayer mechanic. Unfortunately some of the games can be broken by bad layout or poor betrayer story draw and the components are a little lacking.

Can't really say enough good things about this game. Easy to teach, very fun to play, excellent theme, and good components in the 2nd edition.

This is not a anti-shill rating. Wow do I hate this game. It's not often that I actively dislike a game. Rather, bad games are usually just not appealing. But this is something special--in a bad way. The first half of the game nothing happens, at least not in any sort of controllable way. ANd there's nothing really that you're actively trying to do--again, in any sort of controllable way. I completely lost interest 5 minutes in. Why not just skip it and lay the board out and do the second half? The second half is still super boring, but at least it would only take half the time. I blame Tom Vasel for making this actually sound worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one's a lot of fun. Not knowing ahead of time what the story is going to be makes up for the randomness, even when the game ends up imbalanced. Just for fun, I like to force the haunt as early as possible, if I can, with a card that affects the dice. Definitely pick up the revised documents if you have the first (orange) edition.

Bonus points for theme.  You really feel like you're exploring a haunted mansion.   Minus points for mechanics.  If someone could take the bits and make a coherent game that would be simply awesome!

RATING: 5.75
This is an excellent game if the haunt roll triggers at a reasonable time. Otherwise it's wildly unbalanced and drags out until the ``inevitable.''

Players are encouraged to check the errata on a haunt as soon as it occurs, but should be careful about who reads it. [b] Second edition scheduled for some time in 2010, should incorporate many necessary fixes but will probably be cheaper quality [/b]

An innovative game that kept me interested the first 3 times around. After that - meh. It feels like something is missing to me and even with the multitude of different endings, it feel it could get old. This is definitely a good game for our Halloween game day as the theming is great, but will rarely see play otherwise.

Painted miniatures, quality board. You investigate the house that you build by randomly laying tiles. Collect items and abiities, right up until you fail the "Haunt Roll". Starts cooperative, then it's everyone against the Traitor!

There are 50 haunts, each with different victory conditions and special abilities for both the Survivors and the Traitor. Thus, lots of replayability.

RATING: 8
This game is all theme, and I love that.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good meaty Euro, but this game actually does a great job of delivering on the creepy theme.  I always want to play with the lights out with candles and creepy music, but my husband says it just makes the cards hard to read.  

The game doesn't work for everyone (and no one in my regular groups likes it as much as I do), but if you can get a group that can embrace the theme, I think this is one of the best table-feel game experiences to be had.

I suppose if you really liked the theme, maybe it would be OK.

Arkham Horror combined with Battlestar Galactica and Carcassonne? Plays in a hour? 

That's a quick summary of a fantastic survival horror game. Many scenarios, infinite possible layouts, traps, goodies, and a traitor who won't know they're a traitor until the fun really begins. 

My only problem is that some scenarios are pretty much impossible for the heroes unless they roll superbly on their first few turns after the haunt. Hopefully the expansion ones will be more balanced.

Sweet after a year of waiting just got a new second edition on sale for $24.00 shipped. So glad I didn't pickup a 1st edition, sometimes it is a good thing people hang on and want top dollar or an over valued trade for an older edition.

Having scewed up with that ratty what is best described as a Yahtzee game, Elder Sign, this is a excellent game for Halloween play. Just like a campy B horror movie experience. Yeah, B movies vary, from classic B movie to really bad B movie, so can game play in this game once in a while, so what, game is fun, changes with each play, not too serious, fairly short play horror game, and yes the second edition has few parts then the first, but those 1st edition parts slowed the game, better identified in 2nd, the underground lake is now corrected and is not an upper floor location but the basement. This is the game Ed Wood would have themed.

Amazing how so many people wax poetic and think Elder Sign is cooperative, so, so, token, so, so high ranked for a themed Yahtzee. Elder Sign the game is the horror. Zombie Dice is a better game than Elder Sign. Get Betrayal at house on the Hill instead.

Draw random room tiles. Draw random cards. Roll random dice. Random person becomes traitor. Repeat for 2+ hours until the traitor wins.

RATING: 7.45
A mostly cooperative game, Betrayal felt to me like Diet Arkham Horror Light.  Which isn't a bad thing by any means.  In this instance you still get a bit of the creepy factor, mounting dread, and fervent dice rolling.  While a bit more individuality in the characters would be nice, it's not a big part of the game.

I also like that you're watching the board develop before your eyes as players "explore" the haunted house and reveal new rooms.  The possible downside for hardcore gamers is the massive amount of randomness that's a hallmark of the game.  Which room you reveal next determines what event/object/omen you might face.  There are all those dice.  And to top it off, many different scenarios that determine who might be betraying the group and how.

It's quite a mess of mechanisms, but it makes for a tasty stew.  While I'll always prefer to play AH, a quick game of this one is an option I wouldn't turn down.

The verdict for this game is so split, but I'm happy I bought it. I generally don't like games with co-op elements (I couldn't get into Pandemic) but Betrayal offers a fun atmosphere that can make some great memories. Much like some comedy movies that are more fun to quote than to watch, I feel like this game is best played for the experience and moments that arise from it, rather than for the game itself.

Kinda booooring game. You draw some tiles go around the house, then something triggers the other part of game where you have to make pause to read some text or something to tell you how game is going to procede. Lost me right there. All five of us collectively decided that it's boring and procede to play something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
To be honest, part of the reason I hate this game is because I have extended family that want to play this game EVERY time we get together it seems like for the last 5 years. The more I play it the more I don't like it. 

The game only gets interesting after the haunt happens. The first half of the game is seriously move to a random new area, flip a random tile, do what the tile says, roll a die, oh dear looks like a possessed doll stabbed you. Too bad. Next person. Repeat.

Even after the haunt happens, sometimes the person who is the "betrayer" is in a position that is so unbalanced its not even fun. I was the "betrayer" one game, and the other players defeated me and finished the game before it was even my turn again. The number of players never seems balanced. If you have too many players the "betrayer" is at a disadvantage, a small number of players and he/she is overpowered. 

I can honestly see why some people like this game. I sort of liked it at one point. It's one of those games that has random stuff happen, you all laugh, and then move on. There are better games that do that.

Love how many different scenarios there are in this game--I've played it at least twenty times and never gotten the same thing twice (While I have gotten the same scenario, I've been on the opposite side the other time). My biggest qualms is that the stat sliders in my copy don't stick very well. Other than that, great game.

Interesting tile room exploration with character development and on top of that cool story books.  

Why I got rid of it :  It lacked strategic depth.  Frankly it felt like I ran around without direction and stumbled into stuff and read some paragraphs in a book.  Nice creative endeavor but not for me.

Bought it because of the many positive ratings out there.  To me, it is fun, but not as awesome as BGG crowd feels it is.  

Here's the good:
1) Very cool theme.  
2) Like the multi-story outcomes.
3) Love how someone among you goes bad in the game.

Here's the bad:
1) It's so complex that it's confusing at times.  Actually, confusing at many moments.  Perhaps with a bunch more plays I would sort through it.  Not sure if I want to invest the time.
2) There are conflicting rules because of so many variations.
3) The many variations can lead to some boring combinations of powers/events.  If you are going to invest 60 minutes, the boring combinations should be RARE.  They weren't rare.  

It's not a horrible game, but I was expecting more.  I'll play it a few more times to see if I fall more in love.  Perhaps I will create a house rule to eliminate certain storylines that aren't as fun...

For someone who played 1st edition Mansions of Madness before finding this game, Betrayal comes off more or less as a "lite" version of the former: faster and more streamlined, but a bit less atmospheric. The randomized board is masterfully done, and while the "haunt reveal" inevitably stalls the game a bit, it adds a lot of tension to the early stage.

This game is very fun based on the uncertainty of which Haunt will take place...Who will betray the other players? For people that like Clue or Super Sleuth Cluedo, but wished for more complexity, variety and suspense...you may like Betrayal at the House on the Hill.

RATING: 7.6
It's the perfect game to play at a Halloween-themed game night. It's pretty much worth having in your collection just for that, especially if you can find it on sale. The game is best played for the experience, not winning or losing. Some of the haunts (scenarios) are wonky, but some are fantastic. It's uneven in that regard, but there are so many different scenarios that I can easily forgive it for the added replayability you get as a result.

I really like the sense of exploration that you get in the first half (or so) of the game. It's very evocative and fun, and, for me, it's the best part. My enjoyment usually decreases somewhat once the haunt begins. I just want to keep exploring, personally, but I understand you have to end the game somehow.

I do wish the components were better. I wish they would do a new edition or a deluxe edition which fixes some of the problems and improves the components, but I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.

While this game can be fun, the chances of seemingly poor balance or ambiguous rules coming up in a scenario are too high for me to look forward to playing.

The game says to make your own decisions when in doubt (due to an unclear or unexplained situation). I don't like making decisions that influence balance on the game's behalf and it has come up many times. The game can also end very anticlimactically even when the rules aren't ambiguous.

All around fun with a good story to boot. Often the traitor tends to have an easy win / or impossible win depending on when the traitor is revealed...  not that many close games keeps this from being higher rated, but the exploration and stories keep it on the table.

One of the best tributes to classic horror movies that I have ever had the pleasure to play; Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, the Wolfman, the Mummy, Zombies, Evil Scientists, Pod People, enclosed puzzle boxes that will chop your head off... you name it and there is a Haunt in this game that features it.

The rules are a bit loose, in that one often comes upon situations that aren't quite covered in the rulebook(s) - but that lone complaint does nothing to prevent me from playing this snazzy game whenever it is requested.

A brilliant, yet 'sloppy' classic in the horror story-telling genre.  And one that I would recommend.

Claims 3-6 players, but can quite easily be played with 2.

Fun, very light cooperative game with a fun twist at the end (when one player becomes a traitor, looking to kill the rest).

There's really not a lot of meat to it though. You run around a house, exploring and having completely random encounters. When the "haunt" begins, things are slightly more strategic, but the correct move is almost always obvious (and not always possible).

That's not to say that it's not fun -- but it's definitely more beer & pretzels than brain-burning.

Very, very thematic.

Great fun, very replayable, only downside is everyone playing needs to be a capable player on their own - if you have a player or two that you have to help through games, and they wind up being the traitor, they will need a lot of guidance as the rules all change etc.

RATING: 7
Heaps of atmosphere, not much strategy, but good fun nonetheless. Best to play on a dark night with people who are in it for a bit of fun and a chance to use silly voices. A majority enjoy it in my group, but it tends to come out rarely - it's more a holiday or late night experience than a game-night game. Still, Betrayal is a keeper and I'm happy to have it in my collection.

This is a game that I've enjoyed a lot with many people. There are some flaws in it, but there are flaws in every game. I think sometimes I judge too harshly, but it's sometimes quirky pacing can ruin the atmosphere of tension it hits so well when everything goes right.

RATING: 7
This game is not the heaviest or most intricate of games, but I've always had a blast playing it. Really easy to teach--so a great game for non-gamers. The mechanics are a great blend of co-op and competitive, and the theming is at once suspenseful and silly. 

The randomness and luck factors can be occasionally frustrating (especially if the haunt comes in the early game), but even in such a case, players always seem to enjoy the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost endless replay ability between fifty different hauntings, a different house each time make this game have a lot of staying power. For people who enjoy exploring and atmospheric horror combined with board games, this is a do not miss.

It plays quite easy though there is some stuff to learn. However this does not seem to really slow down the game much when you have a few new players. Even they can get in to the game.

the random exploration aspect of this game is great, as well as the sudden twist when the traitor is revealed, and the differing victory conditions. Not always balanced but the games works as an experience rather than a winner/loser contest.  Traitor gives great scope for comic roleplay if you like that kind of thing. Oh yeah, essential to obtain and print the oversized faq/errata for this game.

Terrible game. Haunts are a grab bag of decent to terrible haunts. RNG can leave players dead very quickly. The key issue is that it's barely a game. You never really have decisions to make - and when you do, the right choice is almost always obvious.

RATING: 6
Played 3x

Seems pretty random all around, like a shorter version of Talisman. As a favor to the whole group, if a first-time player is selected as the haunting player, just have a more experienced player switch characters with them. New players should not be expected to read and carry out the haunt rules and things could get really messed up, ruining the experience for everyone.

This game in my eyes is really a party game.  It is  something ,my gaming group and I like to play while enjoying an adult beverage needing to play a not so serious game.  We tend to turn this game into a silly B-Rated Horror Film roll playing game, making up silly backstories and narrating our movements throughout the game. It makes for a very enjoyable evening with lots of laughs and good story telling along with beautiful / horrendous "Take That!" moments when the traitor is revealed.

Found that there are times at the end where either the traitor or the heroes can't win.  That ends the game on a real sour note.

I really enjoyed the exploration and story that builds as the game progresses.  I love the dice and the creepy cards.  However, there were too many flaws in the game system to make me want to own this game, or even want to play it again.

Oozes theme, this is a game that begs to have an entire themed night based around it.  Put some bad b-horror movies on in the background and you'll be set.  

The exploration part of the game is great and again really nails the theme with the various rooms and the events that can happen.  The bulk of the games occurs after the traitor is revealed; then you get all sorts of rules and special conditions added in and the end-game and winning conditions are defined.

My main issue is that the scenarios seem to be very vague at times and it can be tough to understand exactly what is intended, especially when there seems to be conflicting info in the traitor and hero books.  The random nature of the board setup means that a given scenario could be extremely balanced one time and completely tipped in someone's favor another.

The game isn't meant to be particularly balanced, just fun.  You can't take it seriously, but few games capture and invoke a theme like this.  Not something you'll probably play often but it's perfect for taking out from time to to have to have fun with.

RATING: 8
This game is a good game once you get the errata and other "information" from the web-site.  There are a lot of good mechanics that can make this game stellar (i.e. random house creation, random scenarios, etc), but there are WAY too many questions that need to get answered to make it enjoyable.  Once you have all the erratas from the site, it becomes better.  But be warned ... this requires a good imagination to be a GREAT game!

"The Cannibals are going to get you, Nick. We just need you to let them attack you so they can't get to the helpless victims."

"Wait, this house has no exit... the rooms go fully around the 'front door'... wtf!"

This game certainly has a great feel to it. There's the theme and the humor and cooperative feel. Every game is different and new. But it also seems to have a bit of problem with the randomness that makes the game different every time -- it can make the actual "game" portion of Betrayal quick and one-sided. If the Haunt comes at a bad time or on the second turn of the game b/c someone rolled all blanks, then there is no question who will win. And the game either ends before you got started or it ends completely anti-dramatically. The first two experiences I had with this game was the Blob auto-winning because it's Haunt started after Turn 2, and the Cannibals being stomped by the victims without even breaking a sweat. But I can see how this game has a lot of endless potential in it. And we had great hysterical times even though those two games fell flat technically.

Always is a blast playing this game. The gameplay, art, and horror aspects are always enthralling and make me want to play this game more and more. I just played it this past week and loved playing a scenario where I had to kill my doppelganger just to survive. It is one of those roleplaying in a box type of games that is short and sweet but you automatically want to play another game just to see what will  happen this time. Definitely worth buying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The first half of the game is a random game of wandering around and drawing cards to see what you get. Then you start a haunt...and hope you got one that works. It can still be fun if you don't take it seriously, but if you end up with a broken or dull haunt you've just wasted an hour or two.

for trade: US-edition

It's not really a game.
It's a tile-laying, scripted, light-weight-introductory ameritrash RPG.

It could be okay, but every time you open the box there is about a 37% chance the whole experience will just be boring due to completely randomised EVERYTHING.
There is about a 23.8% chance that you will be immobilised in the first couple of turns and just watch the rest of the players carry on without you, and a 26.3% chance that you're dead bedofre the haunt starts. about 2/3 of the scenarios are never any good but nobody knows because they haven't ever been played...

terrible...

RATING: 8
This game is a little silly, but the sheer number of different haunts makes for some serious re-playability.  There is also an equal amount of work expected from each player, which in my opinion puts this game significantly ahead of the similar mansions of madness which requires one player to sit out and organize the monsters.  Some may say the quality of paint on the miniatures is sub par, but I actually think it's pretty cool that all my characters have an African skin tone, though it doesn't really reflect the unfortunately mostly all-white casts of classic horror movies.  My only complaint is that it can be a little nerve wracking for first time players to be cast as the traitor.  But it's better than the alternative of one player having to sit out and manage.  That and the clips for the player stats are constantly falling off.  They need to be redesigned.

A wonky weird thematic mess of a time. Sometimes haunts are even and challenging for everyone, sometimes they are lopsided to one side or the other.

This game is broken, and badly so. There's no way around that. Once the haunt begins and the traitor is revealed, things can swing wildly in either direction. Often a game will fall completely flat on its face. 

But when it works, it's oh-so-fun. This is theme done right, and even though I know the game is broken, I can happily look past that. What a blast to play, if you can get a group of people who won't get too hung up on the "strategy" of the game.

RATING: 7.5
This game is great fun. There are only 2 problems with it that I have come across. The first issue is that it is very possible for a players character to become useless in helping to completed the objective, making that player feel left out. The second is that you either need to play with a group of people who all know the rules or you need to have a player that does know the rules that's will to sit out and help the game along. The reason being that when one player becomes the traitor they need to be able to figure out what they are doing on their own, otherwise the game breaks down.

Players all run around exploring a mansion gathering up experience and items until one player becomes a traitor.  The game then changes to the explorers fighting against the traitor to stay alive.  Tile laying mechanics with combat resolved by dice.  Excellent replayability with many different traitor scenarios.  
This game is excellent for those who like a bit of story-telling in their games (similar to Arkham Horror).
FYI, my plays were with the old printing.

Pros

Lots of replayability in the 50 haunts that the game has. It is a pretty random exploration game where you hope to power your character up instead of hurt your character prior to the haunt being revealed.

Neutral

Very much a medium weight game with small tactical choices. The semi-cooperative nature of the game can't be planned for so it is more of an adventure game than a strategy game.

Lots of the game is dependent upon random tile draw, card draw, and dice rolls. 

Cons

Cardboard quality is good but the art is a bit lacking and the character cardboard sheet is not of the most practical design.

Don't take this game too seriously and you'll have a decent amount of fun in about an hour to an hour and a half.

RATING: 9
+ Scooby Doo meets B-horror films
+ The prospect of having 50 different scenarios offers an unprecedented amount of replay-ability
+ Excellent writing for each of the haunts
+ With the predictability of each haunt being non-existent, the tension and necessity to explore and acquire as many items/stat boosts to prepare for any situation
+ The aforementioned will likely come back to bite you and require that you get assistance from your fellow explorers, or will simply hinder you more than help you
+ Rules are easy to explain, and the unique rules for each haunt are very well laid out and understandable

- The character stat trackers are useless because the plastic stat tracker piece that accompany them do not stay on the character tiles
- No official app or replacement pieces to deal with the above issue, but 3rd party apps are a-plenty and all work well
- While 50 different haunts are available, the likelihood of playing through all of them is low as there is no real way to control how/what haunt will occur

This is a guilty pleasure. The game is totally random and the haunts sometimes don't make sense but neither is the point to playing. This is the game you pull out to not think, enjoy the ride and laugh about how cheesy the story was. It's never disappointed to provide entertainment for the evening but not something I'd play all the time. The game knows it's a joke and doesn't try to take itself seriously. 

[28 Dec 2017] - 7.25 (5 plays)
Tried the game out with 2 players and the multiple characters per player variant. It seemed to work out well and the exploration phase didn't take too long before the haunt was triggered. We then got Haunt 21 and the movement and combat in the game took longer than we thought. There are lots of little rules in the game and with only 5 plays, I'm sure we got some rules wrong. I personally enjoy the story that unfolds with Betrayal over the more serious kind of game like Mansions of Madness. That doesn't mean there are flaws in the game and over complex rules - just that I can tolerate them in this play time.

It hasn't gotten out on the table nearly enough considering the variety it brings. A fun game - but needs the right players to be a GREAT experience.

My friends that don't like this game are the ones who, for their first time playing, get stuck somewhere and die really quick. Which can happen a lot. Also some people are reluctant to be the betrayer. To have fun with this game you have to be really into it. Reading every card intensely, dimming the lights, creepy music in the background, and other ambiance choices. Create that experience for the players, then they will be addicted and going out to buy their own.

My first impression was not a good one.  Slow to build up any tension or interest, and I really wanted to like this game.  Then just when you think things are going to get interesting, you might as well just quit.  When you can immediately see that there's no chance the good side can win when the scenario is triggered, that's not a good thing.  Maybe it was just a bad scenario.

A game you hope to play mmmmaybe once a year if you're lucky is a waste of money.

This and its new re-theme (betrayal at balder's gate) are solid games when you want something shorter and different.  My friends and I play it a lot and many have copies.

I have been playing this for years, and have yet to find another game that has dethroned this as my #1 favorite game. Immersive, intense, and a very unique experience every play. Due to the extreme variability of gameplay post-haunt, there are other games that are certainly more consistently good, but when Betrayal is good, it is GOOD. Also, this was one of my gateway games, so there is some personal significance as well.

Eh, not very deep in gameplay, feels like a stripped down version of Arkham Horror. The two phases are unfortunately lacking of cross-activity. Pre-haunt, you find interesting items but nothing of consequence occurs. Post-haunt, it's easily the most interesting part of the game thematically, but discovery is now over. I think it pretends to not be a party game, which ends up being its downfall as it is not balanced enough to be a real game with too many rules to be a light pickup.

Dissappointing, shoddy production and baffling rules.  But wait, there's a truly enjoyable experience in Betrayal.  No one knows who the traitor is or when they'll arrive.  The exploration is excellent and random things that happen feel fresh.  The one haunt we played was very detailed and exciting.  Look past the lame counters and you WILL have fun!  DOWNGRADE.  That Caesar episode stinks to high hell.  DOWNGRADE.  God damn, this game is just too much of a risk.  The prehaunt can languish and the posthaunt can suck.  UPDATE.  Played again and we got lucky.  The game lasted for a tolerable duration.  Fun.

I thought it was fun enough, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  Basically we wander around some creepy old house until someone finally breaks bad, and then everyone else has to scramble to GTFO.  Meh.  Maybe we need to try it with the lights out or something.  I'll play it again, but I won't be in any particular rush to.

Hard to rank versus other things since there's so little in the way of strategy or normal brain-powered gaming activity here - but if you're with a group that's ready to get into the spirit of the thing and go on a little adventure together it can be really fun.  Maybe a good 'gateway' game for people coming in from D&D.  Still, it would be nice to have SOME chances to make meaningful choices along the way; even if you don't know what encounter you're girding yourself for, it'd be nice if the cards prompted choices (developing one stat versus another, say) rather than just things that happen to you.

With as many issues as this game comes with, I still love it. There can be too many issues for serious gamers, and the balance of the haunt can easily swing in either direction depending on the situation, but in general, the balance has been put together well enough. The flavor of the game is what I enjoy more than anything. The game gets a little boring after playing multiple times in a row, but otherwise I enjoy playing this one.

A game in the same vein as Arkham Horror or other exploration/adventure type games where you pick a starting character and move him/her around the board getting equipment and prepping for the end game (which is the true meat of this game). It is at this point one of the players is revealed as the 'betrayer' and the haunt of the game is revealed and it becomes a competition between the betrayer and the other players.  50 haunts and a radomized way to determine who is the betrayer makes for different games everytime.  I like the production values in terms of look of the game and style of the art and such but this one suffers from poor editing and proofreading.  Butif you like this style of game do not let this discourage you.  Pick up the errata and use some common sense and this thing is utterly playable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A delightfully wicked survival game. Better with a group, this game takes all the tropes you'd expect from a horror film and puts the reins in your hands. The tension escalates with each new Omen and the haunt roll is almost always made with baited breath. The breadth of haunts and the variety of character and item combinations make for a frightfully good time with great replay value. Some scenarios favor different group sizes and some items and omens are way more powerful than others (I'm looking at you, Dog) but each playthrough has been unique for me so far.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Repeated play often yields the same rooms resulting in same-y exploration phases (Junk Room please stop)
-> Horror games aren't for everyone - I can personally only do a few

I have only played this twice, and the people I played it with seemed to quite enjoy it, but I just did not find it very engaging. There seemed to be a lot of a dice rolling and not a lot of thinking required.

I love this game!  As a horror, ghost story fan this fits the bill.  It is a different game every time thanks to the tile layout design and the 50 Haunts that can be played.  My only con so far is some of the Haunt directions are unclear.  I did find and download a revised Traitor's Tome that I found on this site.  

I love the fact it has two phases, one playing cooperatively and the next having a traitor.  Makes it very exciting!

I play it with my children, ages 15, 13, 10 and 8.

Highly recommend this if you like the horror, ghost, supernatural theme.

Betrayal at House on the Hill has pretty much every characteristic I love: a modular board with basically no set up time, a traitor, good loot, and a fun random element that creates events that will be remembered for a long time.  The last time I played this game was a year ago, but I still remember one of the scenarios we played due to the epic dice rolls.  Unlike most people I do not really care much about theme--the game just has to be good, and Betrayal is good.

This is a game similar to Arkham horror but without the deep seem. You basically are going around in a mansion revealing cards and reading them to the group. Eventually one person is found to be the trader and that person tries to kill everybody else. I was bored halfway through the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A potentially fascinating haunted house themed game.  You know the story, stormy night, car breaks down, you see a creepy house on a hill and dash for shelter... players spend the first half the game exploring the house by flipping up tiles.  Tiles can appear on the ground floor, the upper floor or in the basement.  Room tiles often have event, item or omen cards in them to spice things up.  At some point in the game, an omen card will trigger the second half, where somebody turns traitor and a scenario is set to finish the game off.  The traitor/scenario selection is very ingenious, based on a two dimensional matrix of omen type/room that tripped the scenario.  A game that very retro in feel (remember Sorcerer's Cave, Dungeonquest, Talisman, etc?), but very fun.  The rules are clean, but some of the counters are a bit fiddly to find.  Tip - don't punch them until you need them!  Overall, you have to appreciate the labour of love this obviously was for the designer - good stuff.

The complaints about the limited replayability are a  joke imho. The game comes with 50 scenarios I believe and there are some available online. Sure, if you play it 50 times a week it might not be so hot anymore... The game is super unique and I would rate it a seven just for that. Also I like the style and it even plays decently (albeit a little makeshifty). Take it for what it is, a fun game. And no, the best player will not win.

It would be a lot of fun with the right group. If you can't easily put yourself "into" a theme, I wouldn't recommend this one. The elimination can be a bummer if it happens too early, but it didn't last too much longer for us.

From what I gather, you wouldn't want to teach this without being very familiar with the game. I still like the idea of it, and would jump at the chance to try it again - I'm very curious as to the range of haunts that can occur.

An original horror board game. All players (the more the merrier) start at the entrance of the main doorway. The door shuts and the thriller unfolds. Everyone is trying to explore as many rooms as possible in this abandoned mansion. Random room tiles are placed by players during their movement thus having a ‘new’ mansion on every game.  After having discovered almost half the rooms, under specific circumstances, some dice are thrown. If you score the number needed the mystery starts. Based on the room tile the event occurred one player will become a traitor and try to kill everyone else and the rest try to solve the mystery while avoiding the traitor and if possible to redeem the possessed one i.e. traitor or kill him. Although there are many rules, with one game play everything is sorted out and play becomes thrilling! Items, amulets, weapons, minions, ghosts, trapped doors, secret doors; puzzle rooms, a mysterious elevator, a basement where you have to find the connecting exit to the mansion, more creepy stuff and lots of different mysteries to solve.

This game is great starting out, love the mechanics and exploring the house. The layout of the house changes every time we play this. My group fully enjoys this game, that is, until we get to the haunt part of the game.

The haunt portion of the game just disrupts the flow, it needs a lot more work to naturally transition the pace of the game. Usually the game sits at a standstill until the betrayer reads the haunt book and tries to figure out what they are supposed to do, meanwhile the rest of the group is trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing. 

On occasion, the haunt can be pretty fun for everyone, but usually everyone just becomes frustrated with it, unclear on what they are doing or how to stop the traitor. 

*The most fun i have had with this game was using the room tiles in a D&D style campaign.*

Other stories are simply great and we have enjoyed them very much.

A standard coop game with a traitor twist, don't take Betrayal too seriously.  The miniatures are poorly painted, the stat counters require paper wedged in them before they will stay in place, and much of the writing is laughable.  But beneath, or perhaps because of all of this is a light, thematic B-movie horror game which delivers a fun experience for newcomers or those looking to tilt a few and pretend like it makes sense that they inhaled grave dirt for the third game in a row.  Seriously I became a grave dirt asthmatic three games in a row and loved every minute of it.

RATING: 7
A deeply flawed game that's fun nonetheless.

Many of the scenarios are near-unplayable, the bits are pretty craptacular, and extensive errata is needed just to begin fixing it.

Yet, strangely, we all still enjoy the game.  Must be the fun text on the cards and the exploratory nature of the map?

It's quirky and thematic, sure. It has a lot of different haunts, which adds a veneer of variety. But most of the haunts are awful at balance, as is the rest of the game. The first half of playtime is wandering around the house aimlessly. For a game that leans so heavily on theme, it feels like nearly every event falls short as it goes from mildly interesting blurb to pure mechanical result.

I had fun with this game the first couple of times, before every single issue started popping up and feeling louder than any of the benefits. This game just gets worse and more boring every time I play.

RATING: 7
I really like this game.  I have played 3-player & 5-player games, but I think it would be just as good with 6.  For me, it is all in the flavour text, which gives it such a creepy atmosphere.  It is one of those games that gamers & non-gamers alike will enjoy.  The only draw-back I see is in the reprints where the tiles have a warping issue, which is problematic where a tile-laying game is concerned.
The original edition seems to be the same thickness of tile, yet no issue.  So, there comes a time when the reprint is no longer supported by Wizards of the Coast, the first edition may be coveted.

RATING: 9
Two plays so far, and each has been significantly different.  Early haunt on the 2nd one almost made the game impossible for the heroes, but another important early roll made up for it rather nicely.  Quite fun so far, looking forward to seeing more haunts!

Several other plays.  The haunts can be nearly impossible for either side, but it's still quite fun either way.  Having a random "bad guy" makes the inevitable end much less painful when they do come up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Has the potential to be a huge hit as an "experience" game, especially with non-gamers, but it also runs some risk of falling completely flat, depending on which Haunt emerges from the game.   The box claims this is a "strategy" game...  but not really.   It's mostly random.  But it succeeds at telling a story and creating an atmosphere.   The only real strategy comes when the heroes decide how they are going to tackle their necessary tasks before the traitor can defeat them.   (Kudos to WotC for replacing the entire set of punchboards after the shockingly badly warped components of the intial print run!)   I've never really played a game that's quite like this one.  It stands apart.   I've enjoyed all of my plays so far.  Light, evocative fun.

Not strategic at all, this game still provides a fabulous atmosphere. I would play it more if there weren't 3 million different tokens to manage--as well as a ton of errata in the 2004 edition.

RATING: 5
In many respects, the game seems to play itself. In the beginning, players typically spread out, exploring the house and collecting items and events. There are few decisions to be made. When enough of the "omen" cards have been drawn, one turns traitor. Each side then has explicit goals to achieve victory. Again, few decisions are made other than optimizing the victory strategy already specified by the constraints of the scenario. Victory is also sometimes reliant on the luck of dice rolls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My rating would be higher, as I think this is one of the best horror themed games of all time, but the rules for the individual haunts are sometimes quite unclear. Also it helps to have a large collection of monsterous minis to substitute for the uninspired counters. All in all though this one has been popular with both hardcore gamers and the novice gamers at my table.

What I really like about this game is it takes so little to get people up and running. And what's even better is the confused look people get when they ask "So what's the point" and I respond with "I don't know, the game hasn't told us yet." The downside though is the game is volatile, where some are amazing and others are next to impossible and fall flat.

My tale is no different to the usual: I heard about this unique system, with tailored scenarios built around the concept of a member of the group betraying the rest. I eagerly picked it up - and within two or three games had realized just how broken the system is.

While you can have fun and crazy moments in many games, too often does the game collapse upon itself: the 'Haunt' (when the traitor is revealed and the victory conditions set) triggers, but is clearly evident that one side has already won, the rules aren't clear enough on the correct way to handle a situation, or some madness with the board layout results in a poor experience for one player.

Here's hoping this is all fixed in Betrayal Legacy!!

RATING: 6
Great theme in this game. The scenarios are many and varied. The game is slightly flawed mechanically, though, hence the slightly average rating. What you do in the first half seems to be only indirectly related to what happens in the second half. You can spend an hour exploring the house in the first half only to have the game end after only a turn or two in the second half. Quite a lot of luck, not a lot of strategy, so if it weren't for the great theme I'm not sure I'd play it much at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My wife and I really enjoy the story telling aspect of this game and so far we have always enjoyed recapping the story after the game. Very fun game.

Edit. Lowered the game by .5. I still like the game, but sometimes the roll of the dice or draw of the cards can really throw the game. In my last game, Person A entered a couple rooms and ended up with 5 items while person B had no items throughout the game.

IMO, its a simple fun game to play with the not so serious or new gamers. Nice fun intro game when Ticket to Ride gets played out and people want more interactions and discussion. 

Edit 2: Played with new-ish gamers and felt bad because the endgame consisted of them giving me a weapon due to higher strength and killing the betrayer while for two turns they really didn't do anything. The game is highly variable so some plays might be dull while others are great, just be aware of that. But it can stink to play if for over an hour and have the game end with a whimper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
First half of the game is very exciting and full of suspense, reminds a lot of the movie "Cabin in the Woods" and is similar to Arkham Horror.
The second half is too weak and too random. Often the outcome is obvious and there is no point of playing it to the end or it end with no climax, if you know what I mean.

RATING: 6
Run around a house flipping tiles and surviving event cards until the haunting begins. One player based on a look up table becomes a traitor and a plot from a horror movie kicks off. Its pretty random and built on the old read text from a card deck approach to action but it works. I enjoyed it but expect it to be an occasional experience rather than a repeat play title.

I want to love it. The variable board, thematic flavor, and exploration are all great, but the haunts are just too inconsistent.

This game, despite its age, remains a fun romp with friends.  Not knowing who will become the betrayer when everyone sets out gives it a fun edge every time it's played.  The game might have a higher rating if it wasn't so samey with the room exploration, but as you can see, it's not really a big hit against it.  The way you choose the scenario when the titular betrayal is kicked off is a good bit of genius, if a little dated by now.  Still, there's lots of variety and enough scenarios in the book so that if you only bust this out every once in a while, the game will remain fresh.

Another good co-op until someone betrays everyone. The wife likes co-op games, I prefer competitive. These (this and BSG, for example) are a nice compromise. She likes competitive games, too - but this slakes her enjoyment of co-op as well while not having it be only team effort against the game.

Betrayal at House on the Hill has too much random or luck to my liking. Not my genre of board game. That was my impression at first after mt two first games played.

Betrayal at House on the Hill is the same genre as Arkham Horror I find, buy WAY shorter. This is more playable than Arkham Horror in my opinion. Played Arkham Horror once and it was a disaster.

It's safe to say that I enjoy Betrayal at House on the Hill better than Arkham Horror.

Another game or two might change the game's rating.

UPDATE:

Well, it actually did improve my rating the last time I played Betrayal at House on the Hill. 

Played 2 games in the same day. I won the first game with the group (I killed the traitor with my first try, and won the second game as the traitor. We played with some rules corrections. The game went alot more smoother.

Definitely better than Arkham Horror.

Who knows, maybe with more plays I'll even consider buying Betrayal at House on the Hill.

UPDATE 2:

Got Betrayal at House on the Hill in a game trade.

Played it again and am still enjoying it. I guess it took more tries to appreciate this game more.

UPDATE: 3

Played Arkham Horror more. It`s not as bad as I first thought. Right now, Arkham Horror rating is higher than betrayal on the Hill because it has numerous expansions.
8 plays since recording games played.

I love the theme and the haunts (of which there are 50) are interesting and creative.  Where the game suffers is in component quality and balance.  The cardboard warping has been well documented but my biggest gripe are the little plastic sliders that go onto the character cards.  They are too big and side right off.  Additionally there is too much empty space between the pointer and the number which can lead to confusion.  In terms of balance, some omens or weapons give the player an extra dice (or 2!) when combat rolling.  Getting a perk like this (entirely by luck) can really throw the game.  I would rate the game an 8 because I love the experience but with those production problems and balance issues, I'm gonna have to give it a 6.5

I really liked Betrayal the first time I played it. The atmosphere of mystery is really good in the game. Sadly it does not last. The limited number of haunts, number of so-so to bad haunts and rules glitches tend to have me annoyed after one game.

Never again.

I've played this twice. I don't understand why this game is appealing to people. 

It just doesn't have anything interesting going on. Its like a 80's horror movie that just throws endless gore at your but has no point.

The second play really killed it for me. The first was meh so I thought I would give it another try but after the second play where I got to be the bad guy only to have the party wipe me out in one turn. I felt like I wasted 90 minutes.

Its just not balanced. I understand that it tries to make high replay with how the bad guy becomes who he/she is but I wanted to flip the table. Its a boring buildup for the end only to have it leave you with a bad sour taste in your mouth.

Plus the pieces are awful quality, they are all warping terribly to where its almost unplayable now (Not that its a bad thing in my mind.)

I'm still waiting for a horror game to be done right, I haven't seen it yet.

I compare this game to the movie "Enemy". The end just makes you so very angry..

I was hoping the 2nd edition of this would be my thematic go-to game for when I have 4 players and am 1 person shy of being able to play Battlestar Galactica.  Sadly, it was not acceptable.  If you ask me Betrayal is damned if you do or damned if you don't:

The game is really light and seems to lack interesting decisions and tension.  Alternatively if they made the game rules more complex to allow for more decision-making then the scenarios would reflect that and the mid-game learning would be more horrible than it already is.

I really disliked how in you completely disconnect from the game right in the middle of the game you had to essentially 'learn the game' because objectives and special rules aren't revealed until half way through the game when 1 of the 50 scenarios are randomly determined.  Alternatively if you are familiar with the rules to a scenario then the game is less interesting because you know what to expect.

The components for the new edition have been detailed as pretty horrible due to the warping.  I also can't believe they introduced a hidden traitor element and want you to use markers that regardless of the monster type you choose they are all essentially marked because the tokens are different shades within their specific color/type.  Alternatively you can get the old edition, but then you would have errors on a tile or two (?) and have to update all of the scenario booklets because the first editions rules were even worse than they are now.  

My final complaint was that even with these updated rules there was still more ambiguity in them than I would have liked.  I'm so disappointed with this game.

Try as I might, I simply can't seem to play a round of this game without having a frustrating end-game experience, usually resulting from some rules conflict.  So many specific rules contradict each other in the specific scenario descriptions that come up.  Played 6 times now, and batting 0 on that front.  BUT, we keep seeming to have fun early on, and it keeps coming out.  So much promise, and awesome components.

The game of this I played was not too enjoyable - it all felt very obvious what needed to be done.

RATING: 9
This game works relatively well as a traditional exploration/character advancement game, but really kicks into gear when it comes to the second part, where one player will be the evil traitor and the other players fight together to overcome one of 50 totally different evil scenarios. Some of them play like little wargames, others demand deduction and skill. Great fun for everybody involved, as the game really depicts the theme well, and the scenarios have been lovingly crafted to represent every imagineable haunted house story/cliché.The replay value is high, as the endgame is always different, but the exploration stays a bit samey. The game would profit from expansions, which could easily be integrated. Great design with wonderful atmosphere, easy to pick up, relatively short playing time - what doth the geek wanteth more?

The best part of the game is when the haunt begins and the players have to discover what has happened and how to deal with it. I can’t think of another board game that has this extent of an unknown element. The idea that the players have no prior knowledge of what the haunt is, is a concept that normally would be found in an RPG not a board game.

I suspect that if BatHotH was played too frequently, the novelty of exploring the house would fade causing the first part of the game to become a little boring.

RATING: 7
I have a love-hate relationship with this game. When it works, it works great. When it doesn't, it feels clunky and poorly playtested.

The setup for the board is ingeniously worked into the game itself--players explore rooms and flip over tiles until one triggers the Haunt, which is the [i]real[/i] game. The scenarios are enjoyable and flavorful, but usually cause some rules confusion. The rulebook and cards are in need of a great deal of editing and streamlining.

Speaking of streamlining, there are too many tokens. TOO MANY. This is my biggest gripe with the game. Most haunts will use five or six tokens to represent ghosts or secret passages or weapons or what have you. But instead of making generic tokens labeled "enemy" or "item" that could be used in every scenario, the game includes a separate token for every single thing you'd ever come across. The game grinds to a halt whenever the Haunt begins as players dig through the piles of tokens to find the appropriate one, though smart (and frustrated) players will just grab the first available token and ignore what's printed on it.

RATING: 7
Pros
--Absolutely fantastic with a group who's willing to delve into the theme.
--Unique game that can be a great gateway game
--Creates stories that can last for years.


Cons
--Very unbalanced, and I don't mean in terms of fairness.  Length is variable, betrayer vs. group can be very uneven in either direction, some scenarios are just outright better than others.
--Way too many nuanced rules for how simplistic the gameplay is.  Just a poorly written rulebook perhaps?

Overall, this game has grown on me.  At first I didn't like the wonky, loose mechanics, but I've grown to tolerate them.  This game is an absolute treasure if you're in the mood for it.

Betrayal is a really fun game. It is also however, really random. Some games are short and easy, some games are long and hard. Sometimes the villainous traitor thinks they are going to win, only to get killed by a random event. The fun level can definitely fluctuate wildly between games. The rules are also plagued by vague wording and poor organization, so there will be plenty of rule of consensus going on.

RATING: 4
It's all luck. Randomly draw a room tile, randomly draw a card, randomly resolve situations with dice. Repeat. Would like to see more skill.  Have found a little more appreciation for it, but I still stand by what I think overall. 

I guess it's got theme going for it, but I haven't been swept up by it. 

About 3 plays before logging plays.

RATING: 5
Bordering on broken due to problems with many of the scenarios.  I like the theme, but to bring any balance to the game you really have to do some serious modifying.  The components are hit and miss as well.  I can't believe the prices this brings on EBay.  Vegas Showdown and Nexus Ops are both much better games.  The people who are willing to pay $100+ for this have absolutely lost their minds (and obviously never played it).

The first (thus far only) time I played this was with a large group ~ some people doubling up to play a single character.

It was (apparently) a non-typical game, and it went on forever until we finally got a haunting.

And then we finished it off before the witch even had a turn.

Suffers from the 1-player ends up doing something different from everybody else problem (e.g. pile in). Also "Haunts" are very random vs one another, so game is different every time. Could be a "10" one game and a "3" the next...

Betrayal at House on the Hill quickly builds suspense and excitement as players explore a haunted mansion of their own design, encountering spirits and frightening omens that foretell their fate. With an estimated one hour playing time, Betrayal at House on the Hill is ideal for parties, family gatherings or casual fun with friends.

Betrayal at House on the Hill is a tile game that allows players to build their own haunted house room by room, tile by tile, creating a new thrilling game board every time. The game is designed for three to six people, each of whom plays one of six possible characters.

Secretly, one of the characters betrays the rest of the party, and the innocent members of the party must defeat the traitor in their midst before it’s too late! Betrayal at House on the Hill will appeal to any game player who enjoys a fun, suspenseful, and strategic game.

Betrayal at House on the Hill includes detailed game pieces, including character cards, pre-painted plastic figures, and special tokens, all of which help create a spooky atmosphere and streamline game play.

I played this game with my daughters. The hunt that we played was very well laid out and it made sense. Unfortunately, leaving the girls to read the part of the heroes without help was complicated because they didn't understand what they had to do to win. The game is more like an experience.

El juego tiene 2 partes una cooperativa done todos somo coleguitas y vamos intantando mejorar nuestras estadís­ticas y coger objetos y en un determinado momento unos de los jugadores se transforma en el Traidor que debe acabar con sus amigos; cada vez se ambienta en un tipo de bicho pero al final casi siempre es todos contra el traidor que se ha convertido en algo.La clave es intentar estar lo más preparado para cuando se produzca la conversión; y así serás fuerte contra el traidor y sus secuaces o serás un traidor fuerte, preparado para acabar con los que hace poco eran tus amigos.Hay que ambientar el juego para difrutarlo más.

04/04/2008 Partida de 4 jugadores (Pi, Juas, Tyrion y Gato). Pi se convierte en la traidora y jugamos la aventura del abismo. Por diversas circunstancias acabamos todos en el sótano donde poco a poco avanza el abismo devorando la casa. Tyrion es absorbida con gritos de "¡¡¡Otra vez!!!" y en el último momento cuando sólo nos queda una habitación (la de "El Pentagrama") y en ella estamos Juas (con el viejo) que hace su tirada de la habitación y la consigue y luego voy yo (Gato) que gracias a "El Anillo" y con un "Chute de Adrenalina" consigo pasar la tirada y vencemos al abismo. Cuando sólo quedaba esa habitación y no tenÃ­amos salida. IMPRESIONANTE!!!!

Great collaborative adventure game that appeals to many of our non gamer friends. Game play is very dice roll oriented which is not my favorite mechanic (I prefer more decision oriented results), but gives a nice feel to the various outcome possibilities allowing for a needed randomness to the game. The game pieces could be better constructed, specifically the trait markers on the character squares come off quite easily making it possible to loose your character attribute place if anyone bumps your card. 50 Different haunting scenarios makes for extreme re-playability and a different feel each game.

Good idea in theory. Some of the haunts (new edition) do not work out. All that searching just to have the haunt end in half a turn or be a guaranteed win for one side. Potentially could have been very good. Nice components (including the non-warping tiles).

RATING: 6
This can be a fun game to play. It is offset somewhat by the the widely varying difficulty of the scenarios. At times, they are next to impossible, while at other times, they are far too easy. If there was a referee to make sure the rules worked, it would be fine, but there's no such luck.

Betrayal at House on the Hill is part board game, part B-movie horror that you take part in, and I think it's great. If you and your friends love horror films, I think you will get a huge kick out of it, and would thoroughly recommend it.

Great "party" game.  The mechanics are simple and the 50 different story paths are awesome.  I love that many of the items and events are obviously based on classic horror themes and even movie sequences, etc.
Edit: This edition is the "warped tile" second edition. Received replacement tiles direct from WotC
EDIT 2: I've since reduced my score from 9 to 8.  After repeated plays and trying other games I realize this one is definitely fun but some of the scenarios just aren't all that fun and don't play out that well.  And I have had a few people think the beginning part of the game feels pointless other than trying to gather stuff to prepare for the second part.

RATING: 5
A light, Ameritrashy game that must be played in the right mood with the right people so that you can at least have some laughs if the game goes off the rails in terms of balance. I don't think they were too concerned about playtesting the haunts for any semblance of balance; rather, it's a novelty game in the vein of Tales of the Arabian Nights. I'd play again if asked, but then again, if I don't ever play again I won't miss it. I actually find it more enjoyable than Tales or Arkham Horror, for that matter, since this provides a thematic experience of the horror genre with a fraction of the overhead and time required. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Very disappointing. Fun during the general exploration phase, but the extremely poor scenario book undid the game. A pity, as it was a wasted 3 hours which left everyone dissatisfied. In my view there's no excuse for selling a game with such profound errors.

RATING: 6
This game has so much potential, and when you're playing with the right group, and get the right haunt, well, it can be a real blast, and will provide you with plenty of "Remember when.." moments that will be evocative for a long time. The key words there, unfortunately, are 'potential,' 'right group,' and 'right haunt.'
As you probably know, much of the game is flat-out broken, and there's nothing that kills a vibe quicker than getting a haunt that you simply cannot play. Errata abounds, and there is a revised haunt book online, but it's still not perfect.
Having the right group, I think, is an even bigger issue. If you don't have people who are going to get into the game, and really run with the theme and have a good time with it, then it can be quite the lifeless affair, as mechanically it's a very dull game.

RATING: 6.875
I love, love, love:
- exploring and revealing rooms to a house that's different every game
- the creative Haunt scenarios and different gameplay for each

I dislike:
- there aren't many Omens, Items, or Events, so there's a lot of repetition of seen cards by game three
- that the Haunts are so poorly explained that we always end up spending 15 minutes asking each other if we understand what's going on and at least one of us ends up checking BGG for answers

Final verdict: Love this game because the house set-up is always different and the Haunts all play so differently that it feels like we're getting multiple styles of games in one box. On the other hand, there needs to be more variety in cards and better explained rules for the Haunts.

RATING: 8
First off, let me say I am an owner of the first edition, not the revised one.

This game is great but you have to set it up correctly : it must be dark outside, put in some eerie music, dim the lights, fill up the glasses. The game is all about the immersive gloomy-horror experience. You will read text. Read it loud. And you need to be somewhat a good reader. Keep that in mind for your first game and warn everyone that it's not a «Spike» game.

Your adventure will have two parts - at first, you'll get into that strange mansion which you will explore. The tiles being independant, you're playground will be different everygame. Strange stuff will happen. You might not understand anything. That is alright. Nothing right can happens, right ?

That is until the second part - the revealing of the mission. Anything can happen, litteraly : there is over 50 differents scenarios that can happen - collaborative or not, with a traitor or not. That is the real fun begin, but be warned : in the first edition at least, some quests are NOT clear at all.

To sum it up : great experience, great replayability, well-paced BUT some quests are sometimes mixed up.

Rating after one play. Seems to get a lot of good press on BGG, but after one game, I thought there was going to be more meat. Should try it some more to get different scenarios under my belt to see if that helps with the rating.

This is a great light game to pull out when you have newbie gamers. It's got a great hook and the mechanics are easy enough for anyone to grasp. With fifty scenarios you have GREAT replayability. But the components are subpar and there's quite a bt of bloat. Countless tokens to rummage through, and the markers which track your stats just fall off the character, leaving you to guess where you were at in the table is even bumped.

I want to love this game so much, but I can't. The premise and theme are both REALLY cool! The actual game play just isn't that fun and feels unbalanced. Being the betrayer seems like it would be fun, but after about 5 games of never being the betrayer and mostly getting killed or anti-climatically eking out a win, what's the fun in that?

Based on 25 plays.
+ One of the best games I've ever played.
+ This game provides good memories for a lifetime, as most role-playing games do.
> The game is at its best with people who are ready for a light role-playing experience.
> In my opinion, best with 5, 4 and 6 players, respectively. Haven't played with fewer players to avoid wasting good scenarios. The larger the crowd, the better the experience?
- You should download revised scenario booklets (in color here on BGG, by UniversalHead). Also, you should have some kind of chart in order to find appropriate tokens fast.
- The players must be able to make up rules for unexpected situations every now and them.

Updated 9->10 in 2011 after 25 plays. I've come to accept this game as it is, even with its major flaws. I still have a constant urge to produce custom stuff to this game: new scenarios and alternative Finnish translations (in addition to the one I already did).

An outstanding mix of co-op and competitive gameplay, with enough scenarios to ensure many enjoyable replays. This is one of my all-time faves.

My group has a house rule that I’d recommend: A first-time player can never be the traitor, but don’t tell them that unless the occasion arises that they should be, that way it maintains some suspense. We adopted this rule after a couple of games were...I don’t want to say ruined, because we still had fun...but definitely altered just because a first-timer trying to get their head around the scenario, win-condition, various tracking stuff, etc, didn’t go well for us. The situation seemed to favor the group over the traitor. Still fun, but less challenging for the group.

The game I owe the most in all my collection. My thoughts on the subject can be read here, on Slate (http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gaming/2015/11/betrayal_at_house_on_the_hill_and_the_golden_age_of_board_games.html).
I will add that it's delightful and fun and a great starter game for a collection. Wizards of the Coast has done a terrible job fixing errors and balancing the game (some haunts will haunt you for years). I suspect the new expansion won't change this as it only adds more, but hopefully the prospective game designers who wrote the new haunts did so with care and a keen eye. Only time will tell. Still, holds the highest place in my heart.

A game full of classic horror stories. Perfect for Halloween. A lot of stuff in the game so every story does not feel much the same. The tension when people are rolling for the haunt begin is high, no one want to be a traitor!

I like it but it feels like it wasn't play tested enough.

All the haunts are either very "evil" or "good" biased. There are no situations where it feels like it could go either way which is a bit of a let down.

Plus the cardboard tiles bend like crazy.

On the plus side boyfriend got me replacement tiles.

Sold in 2014.

I love this game. I find it fun and love the haunt mechanic. It's a bit hit or miss from haunt to haunt and I don't care for the haunts that don't have a traitor - the AI leaves something to be desired - but I still enjoy this game on the whole. I've gotten my family into it and they keep bringing it back to the table. This is the heaviest game they've been willing to play over and over and that makes me super happy.

In interesting game and a nice recreation of the theme, but typical of US games, lots of rules, lots of conditional rules upon rules, lots of modifiers. The basic mechanism works well, I liked the Player Characters and pentagon with sliders is a clever idea. If you like this sort of game, you'll love this. If you don't mind it, it's worth playing once.

Played game once. Got a really flat scenario (alien spaceship) and since I had defect components (backside of cards were badly printed) I took my chances and returned the game. Just too many random elements regarding the scenario, house set-up and character stats before the actual haunt begins. I also feel the time before the haunts start gets a bit boring even though I like the Idea of actually exploring and building the house.

It's a shame that this game's scenarios are of such a varying standard that it can become a home-run or a total failure. If you want a game with similar mechanics but less random elements I would advice you to check out Mansions of Madness instead.

Played 1 time. Ugh! This game bites -- it's not even the best of it's roll-and-move/dungeon crawl brethren! (I don't like those types of games much, but this isn't as good as some of the better ones like Dungeoneer...) Every scenario basically the same since the first half of the game is 'exploring' (roll and move and random events) and the second half is the hauting in which some random scenario spits out a winning condition for both players -- but the conditions are still all quite dull and random. Now as good as I'd hoped, and the components are mediocre.

A salesperson talked me into this one, but I hated the graphics on the box so much, couldn't open it--especially after I read mixed reviews.  So this was one of the first games I ever sold.  That was a couple of years ago.

Tonight I saw the insides of the box for the first time, and played it.  Wish I hadn't sold it.  A very good party-style game that eventually turns into a co-op/team game.  It is just the kind of game board I like--one that changes each time because you build it as the game progresses. Also, many different game scenarios included. 

And, the game graphics are much better and do not match the horrible, cheap, total turn off, box graphics.  

I purchased the new version, but the tiles are thin and so badly warped the figures won't stay upright on the tiles--huge disappointment. 
NOTE: Contacted Wizards of the Coast publishers, replaced immediately.  Obviously a guality company--admitted problem & fixed it.

What drew me to buy it is exactly what the people I played it with enjoyed - nearly endless replayability. 50+ scenarios, house layout / size / composition never the same way twice, traitor / hero role always up for grabs, and the theme is great.

RATING: 6
A good late night game.  This has the feel of all those wacky horror movies that start out as an exploration of an old spooky mansion and ends in morally justified bloodbath.  Well, this is the game to relieve those glorious moments.  Some of the scenarios will befuddle even the most experienced gamer as the description leaves you with a lot of questions that you can't really ask the other players if you're the traitor.  I suspect this just requires some getting used to, but since that is about the only detail that's not too clear, we will play again.

Not my favorite, but I am willing to play it.  It's fun if you get a good scenario, but kind of a let-down when the scenario is stacked in favor of the Heroes or Traitor.

RATING: 7.5
Despite the overall cheesy design and a B-movie potrayal of the horror genre, this game has something going for it that provides for a unique gaming experience. It is a co-op with a traitor/DM element that circumstantially may breakdown, due to the random storyline and timing of the haunt reveals. My experience however, has always been positive. The only gripe I really have is regarding the faulty stat clips that are designed to slide out of position way too easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game itself is decent, although some haunts are better than others.  We got a crummy haunt that wasn't that scary and we easily beat it.  I think if all the haunts were more challenging, or the game went on a little longer I could rate this higher.  That being said, the theme works for an October/Halloween game night, but I probably wouldn't play it other times of the year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I don't usually like co-op games, but this one is only co-op for about half the game, then someone betrays you - and no one, not even the betrayer, knows its going to be them ahead of time.  You explore an old haunted house, picking up artifacts, finding secret passages, suffering curses and illusions, or getting blessings.  Then at some point, that happens somewhat randomly, someone is assigned to basically get possessed by a demon and try to kill the rest of you.  There are 50 different betrayal scenarios, and the house builds randomly as you explore it, so its got good replay value.

Honestly, though, its a little creepy of a game.

I've been playing this game for years. This is a pretty fun game. Even if you don't like horror movies or books, this is still playable and fun as a game. One interesting thing is that the board is always different: the board is made up of individual room tiles that are different each time. The ending is also different each time. I'm not sure how many endings/bad guys there are total, but you can play the game for years without having played all of them.

RATING: 5
True Ameritrash, with piles of randomness, stats that may or may not come into play, tiles, miniatures and custom dice, hidden powers and victory conditions, and lots of theme.

Duration: The game I played was pretty short; we kept it fast paced but supposedly it was the shortest the owner had played.
Design: I enjoyed the exploration, the traitor mechanic, and the variety of possible encounters. I liked that neither side had a good idea of what the other could do. The rules had massive gaps and I doubt they would produce a consistent experience. Lots of random things happened to the characters even during the exploration.
Strategy: This was cooperative when the traitor appeared, but we couldn't say anything that would give the plans away. Things happened quite randomly, so it was more of moving and rolling than of applying deep thought.
Components: Tiles, miniatures, character sheets with clips, custom dice, 3 decks of cards, and a million labeled tokens. There's a lot of stuff in there, and it did bring out the theme, though I wasn't a fan of the miniatures, the character design or the writing.
Theme: B-movie horror with a corresponding level of polish.

RATING: 6
Great concept, clunky implementation. There are 3 parts of Betrayal. Part 1 - Flip tiles, kinda interesting, ultimately dull. Part 2 - Sit around for a half an hour while the betrayer figures out what the hell he/she is supposed to do. Part 3 - Best part of the game, as everyone races to fulfill their victory conditions. Unfortunately the last and best part of the game is over way too quickly and can be subject to runaway players who got lucky in the early game. 

Would love to see an updated game based on this concept.

RATING: 6.5
The fun of this game is the end and how each side only knows part of what is going on.  Very fun, but it's best to just play a game or two around Halloween or the first part where you just roll and move is boring.

RATING: 6
I love the concept of this game, but for me it has a few problems. The lead-up to the haunt is a bit stale and can start to drag and then the haunt itself can be a bit wonky or anticlimactic depending on the haunt. 

It is definitely a good game when played with the right group in the right setting. But I don't think I have either so this is a pass for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
First half - dead boring. Second half - broken (I feel justified using "broken" here - the sides after the Haunt begins are rarely well-balanced, and the badly-written rules, especially those dealing with the Haunt, compound the problem). Highly unsatisfactory, BatHotH fails both as a game AND as an experience. It's not fun, it's not suspenseful, and it's certainly not strategic. Did they playtest this thing at all? Don't even start with the "it's in the roleplaying" nonsense - this is not even in the same neighborhood as CoC or Kult, proper "horror RPG"s. Theme? It's no better than any other game, and no theme in the world will save a broken game. And I'm not even complaining that it's random (dice and tiles and cards, hello) because you don't expect non-random games from Hasborg's kiddie division. Avoid like it's the zombie plague and you're its lunch. *** UPDATE: This is the worst piece of crap that anyone tried to pass off as a boardgame in 2004. The rules are unusable out of the box, and the only people who seem to enjoy it only do so because they've never experienced anything better in the horror RPG genre. I deny that this thing is a game, because it not only has abysmal balance, it has no working rules. That stupid "make up your own rules" disclaimer only works in REAL roleplaying games, morons, NOT in boardgames. Whoever greenlighted this at Hasbro/Avalon Hill/WOTC should be very, very ashamed. Oh, and at that price point, they should be able to produce something that at least rivals Ravensburger games like Java and Tikal. The shoddy bits only make this an even bigger horror story for the boardgaming populace. Do NOT buy this thing that's masquerading as a game.

Played my first game of this today (7-16-2011) with Mr. Billington and Gayle.  I ended up the traitor (Haunt #45, the bomb-maker) and lost the game when Mr. B's character killed mine.  Despite the time setting up, learning the rules for the first time, and putting it away, it was definitely worth it.  Three hours for a first game, including setting up.  Would love to play it again with them or anyone else.  Played my second game today (7-23-2011) with Mr. Billington and Gayle again.  This time Mr. B ended up the traitor (Haunt #26, pay the piper).  Again Gayle rolled the start of the haunt.  This time Gayle and I won and Mr. B lost (but we all liked the game better than last time).  2 and 1/2 hours for a second game, including setting up.  I think, though, that this will be it for this game for awhile, since I don't want to overplay it.  I want it to stay interesting and fun.

I kind of want to give this a 10.  But the confusion(s) in the rules are preventing me from doing so.  I do need to get over that and just play the dang game -- everything is sort of logical.  We even played the first game wrong, messing up some stuff that WAS clear in the rules, and when we discovered our mistake realized how silly it was.  The bits are TREMENDOUS, and if you let yourself get into the story, you will have a BLAST.  Trying to determine the secret goals of the Betrayer, as well as his attempting to figure out what the heroes are doing was great ("OK, he's just trying to kill ME, and I have no idea why!  Get away!").  The winner ended the first game one move away from losing.  ONE MOVE!  It made for a great intense finish.  OH!  One other thing that knocks it down to a '9' from 10 -- one scenario we played called for a certain character, and there was no token to represent it.  The thing has three hundred and ninety eight million tokens, you'd think there's be one for every situation!  We just used a random one.  They might as well not even label them.  That was frustrating.  But, again, the game is cool.

This is a great game .. Got a bunch of friends who are not avid gamers to play it . It was easy to learn for them and interesting enough for a board geek like myself ..

So much excitement adds on as the actual haunt begins and one player becomes the betrayer. I recommend this game very highly for a fun and unique experience that changes every time you play it

The more players the better and longer the game is. You don't want this game to last too long though... uggg. It's also hard to find the pieces you need for each scenario. Completely overshadowed by Arkham Horror for the best spooky game title. 

I used to have this at a 7, but with Arkham in my collection there hasn't been a need to get this out again. It's been fun though, I have a few fond memories from the scenarios.

In one game, one of my friends kept opening up a cabinet that has you draw a random encounter card. "AHH! Spiders! *slams door shut and opens it again* Ahhhhh FIRE! *slams door shut and opens it again* Aggghh ghost!"

In another game, a giant worm was slithering around the house and the person playing the athlete, amidst all the other players that were slowly being defeated, heroically saved the day with luck, preparation, and daring. 

In 2015, I think I'm ready to sell this game. It doesn't have mechanics or a story as interesting as others. Sold in 2016.

When this game works, it works really well. The problems I've come across is when playing with new players or people who haven't played a lot of boardgames in general. The initial phase usually doesn't take too long to master, but all bets are off when the haunt starts! Ambiguous rules don't help and the time it takes to resolve the confusion can sometimes break the flow of an otherwise excellent game.

My first choice on a great game that needs an expansion. This along with Arkham/Eldritch Horror are great gateway games to bridging the gap between tabletop roleplaying games & board games. If your players like this, there are plenty of horror or modern setting RPGs out there that your players might also like. 

Again, make an expansion for this as with the tile based rooms & heavy story, it would be quite easy to make a new sequel or expansion. Also get rid of the clips for the characters (as a phone app takes care of it better), 75% of mine just slide over the character cards & they are just a bad design over putting a token over that marker instead (if it was a simple rectangle sheet instead of a pentagon).

How did it take me this long to finally play this absolute gem of a game?  The bits are lovely (pre-painted minis) and the game is immersive and incredibly thematic.  Mechanically the game is simple and easy to learn.  The variety of haunts makes it highly replayable.  One play in and I am hooked for the reprint.

Update:  Just got the 2nd Edition reprint.  My tiles are all warped pretty noticeably within hours of being punched.  I don't think it is the humidity, its the fact that they used cheap, thin cardstock.  The game is great and certainly still playable.  I wish they wouldn't have cheaped out on the materials.  The new haunt we played was smooth going and seems to be a great update of the the game overall.

Update Feb 2011:  WOTC replaced the cardboard and all is well.  The game plays great and is a hit with non-gamers.

Very entertaining game with great atmosphere. The multiple different scenarios provide lots of re-playability. 
Sometimes it's too much luck based, so that one character is overpowered (=> you uncovered some "good" rooms which your teammates can't reach/haven't reached before the haunt starts/ you gained some good items).
Still it's fun to play together for the first part of the game and then set up a team versus the traitor.

Especially great for not too advanced boardgame players.

It doesn't get a higher mark because I wouldn't really call it a good game, there's virtually no strategy and very little tactics even when the haunt is revealed, and also I grew a little weary of it after some 15 plays or so. But with the right group, roleplaying it a little, and making fun of the inconstitencies, you can have a really good time. And at last a game that's proportionate to its depth in length and complexity (it would be terrible if it dragged on like munchkin for example, but it's fun and light as it is). The many scenarii ensure a good replayability. One of the very few games that my sister has fun playing, so that says something in its favour.

Played a few scenarios. The game has amazing replay ability due to the random nature of the game, however that is the real downfall as a scenario can be completely broken depending on when a haunt happens.

Betrayal is beyond a dice-fest, but I think it works thematically, adding tension to encounters.  There are still meaningful decisions throughout, but it's not exactly high-strategy.  

Betrayal lives and dies on the group playing it.  I find reading the omen cards is one of the highlights of the game, and a critical component of building the atmosphere that any horror-based game should have.  With the some of the groups I've played this with, they just rush through the cards, focusing on the effects rather than the story. The other aspects that make this game worth playing is building the house as you explore and hauntings (particularly the diversity).

lock ups and player elimination in a game that can drag is a poor recipe for fun.  The theme is appealing and strong, but there is so little game here.  The fact that someone can get trapped in a room with absolutely no way out, no actions they can take, and just be idle for hours is nearly broken in my opinion.  Poor game.

If you're ever in the mood to play a group of friends in a B rated horror movie, play this game!  You and your friends decide to explore a haunted house with moving parts; an event, a draw, a haunt count, and a toss of the dice decide the fate of the explorers.  Turning one into a traitor.  Will you all become a victims?  Or will you defeat the evil let loose?

I've played this game many times over the years, it usually comes out around Halloween. I enjoy the thematic of the game and the way things unfold, especially once the haunt starts. The haunts are both the strong part of the game and the weak.

Pro - Tons of replayability. You never quite know what's going to happen and what kind of game you will be playing. Highly thematic

Cons - The rules can suck. This is really hard to fix since the traitor has their own rules/goal and the rest of the players have theirs. But you aren't suppose to know what the other person can do so rule mistakes/oversights happen a lot along with unclear rules. Also some haunts are super easy and others are impossible, very swingy. Also it can be really hard for non gamers to be the traitor and read the rules


I think the best way to play it (if you have someone willing to do this) is to have a moderator person that can help assist with the rules and make sure both sides are doing things correctly. My rating for this game would go up if they could just fix up the rules for each haunt to make things very clear

RATING: 9
This game is absolutely amazing with the right group of people. It has a ton of great RP opportunities without having to require someone to write up a campaign and deal with stats and combat in any real demanding way. If you like board games and you like roleplaying, this is an excellent game.

However, it does have it's problems, but none of which really detract from it's score.

* The event, omen, and item cards will grow a bit tiring after a few games. There aren't many of them and you won't get many surprises once you've played more than 2-3 times.

* The game doesn't really start until the "haunt" begins. Before that it's primarily exploration and reading events, omens, and items mentioned above. Before then, it's entirely luck of the draw and doesn't have any skill or strategy to speak of.

* The game is heavily cooperative, and if you don't have a group that works well together I can see you having a really bad time once the haunt begins.

That all being said, none of those problems matter once the haunt begins. There are 50 scenarios and it will take a long time to go through all of them. Each scenario makes one player the "traitor" who has a goal that ranges anywhere from killing everyone, to filling the house with monsters, to trying to complete some secret task known only to them. This will range from seeking out certain rooms to perform tasks in, collecting items, or killing the traitor before they complete their own task. The rest of the players have their own secret task they must work together towards in order to win. During the haunt, the game becomes a 1 vs Many dungeon crawler RPG, and it's an absolute blast.

Feel free to message me if you're curious about the actual scenarios. I can't really go into more detail without spoiling anything.

I really really really wanna love this game more! I am a horror fanatic! If the rules weren't so confusing/vague so often this would be an 8 for me. If it didn't have so many boring round chits it would be a 9. After many more plays the game has definitely moved up in rank for us. With some house rules and a group with no hardcore rules lawyers, we have had a lot of fun with this. The 2 player variant works very well.

This was one of my first modern board games.  It was different enough that we LOVED it.  Unfortunately, after too many plays and lots of clearly untested (see, broken) scenarios it became quite boring.

I listen to the d6 Generation podcast and they are always raving about this game.  I finally got to play it and had a miserable time.  I recognize that a lot of it was just bad luck with rolls and card draws, and everyone else seemed to enjoy it, but for me it just wasn't fun.

It also didn't help that I was eliminated from the game before the end.  Admittedly, the game didn't run much longer, but I despise games where you can be eliminated before the end of the game.

I will probably be willing to give it another try some time, but I was very disappointed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I've played this twice now and that's more than enough for me. Basically equates to roll-and-move, then roll and draw a card then roll again for the haunt and then roll again for combat. It's all dice rolling and flavour text, there's no strategy to be had here. If you don't care about actually making decisions of any kind, then the game might have more appeal, but there's really nothing going on here. If I wanted to play an RPG module, I'd play an RPG module, but if I play a board game, I want to be challenged, not just roll dice read spoopy text on cards.

RATING: 7
This would have scored much higher (8-9) had the tiles not been so warped... everything in the box came out warped and I've heard this is a problem with this game.  The game itself is fabulous fun though.  Players enter a house and move around adding new tiles for the rooms and becoming stronger or weaker depending on what happens in each room, then, when the time comes, one person becomes possessed essentially and "betrays" the rest of the group. The rest of the group then must square off with whatever mystical/magical/demonic thing the traitor has in store... in the game I played, I was the traitor, summoned Death and forced the rest of them to play chess against him... they kicked Death's ass but we all had a good laugh about it. Good fun.

Lots of variation, but can be a rules headache at times. Fuzzy rules text in the survivor guide and traitor's tome mean sometimes you have to just be able to decide on a ruling. Even worse is when you can't ask the other side for an idea on how to make the ruling since it might give away what your side is trying to do... Still usually a great game with tons of flavor.

RATING: 3
You wonder around aimlessly for the first half, bumping into things and not in any way interacting with the other players and then boom, the haunt happens. That's when you realize you've either acquired the necessary stuff to win the randomly determined challenge or you haven't. Either way, the game is over pretty quickly. There's just not much to this game. I'd be fine playing it as a quick opener or closer to the day but it is certainly no where near a main event. Luckily, it runs pretty fast. Oh, and the sliders that came with the game don't even work! booooo!

Update

The more I play it, the more sleepy I get. It's not broken or terribly unbalanced and the production quality is okay so I feel I can't rate it too low. Yet, how does one equate boredom with a ranking? That's the challenge facing me.

RATING: 5
My group thoroughly enjoyed our first play of this game. The haunt we got was pretty evenly balanced--the traitor had killed off two of the party and had the other two on the ropes when the party prevailed. You'll run into some questions with the rules (we had to figure out which rooms had "outward facing windows," which took longer than it should've), but all in all, good atmospheric fun in a social setting.

This is not a gamer's game, by any stretch. But if you want to have some fun with a bunch of people who don't take winning seriously and would just like to have a neat, horror-themed experience, this is a great game to break out.

Update: Rating lowered after the novelty wore off. Still enjoy it, but it stays in the pack of the "I typically enjoy" games, and not "I will likely ask for it" games.

Update: Strictly reserved for non-gamers who want to goof around and laugh.

another really good horror game with the classic theme of the old haunted abandoned house. from 3 to 6 adventurer(the players who use curious civilians who venture the house)step their feet into the house whose door suddenly seals behind them. now they have to deeply go into the house trying to discover secrets long forgotten and whatever can help them escape the mansion. at a certain time during the gameplay, turns out that one of the adventurers is secreatly a traitor, or a mad man, or is simply a pawn of the house himself and here the game changes in a semicooperative. who will win, the good people trying to survive the house or the filthy traitor trying to kill them or dooing something horrible? the expansion is higly recommended

This is a great game for the right occasion (usually Halloween for me).  It's more of an experience than a strategic game - lot's of luck and randomness, which is fun and thematic if everyone going in understands this - it's also crucial for playtime, people need to crank through the first half of the game, building the house, rather than agonizing over decisions and slowing the game down (when the haunt will make most of the strategy of these decisions irrelevant anyway).

Not sure I like this.  

Very good sense of being in a horror film.  Enjoy the grim, horror aspect, but don't really enjoy the game play.  You really can get messed over by those dice and it feels like there is little decision making for the players.  Things don't really get interesting until the haunting.  Until then, stuff just happens to you and you react to it.  Not quite a roll and move game, but for the first half it might as well be for me.

Yes, it is random!  Yes, it doesn't allow for much strategy (any, really, for that matter).  But it was fun!  I can see all the potential issues raised by various reviews, it was plain to see after just one play -- but none-the-less, it was FUN!  

Surely some senario's aren't balanced (the one we played sure wasn't), surely there isn't a whole lot of things to plan for, but the story is interesting, and the replay value is rather high!  It is not a game you would break out and play every night, and it isn't a game that you would play with a bunch of hardcore gamers. 

The fact is, you don't really play this kind of game to win, you play it to be amused, and it does that quite well!  A great game for a mix of gamers and non-gamers! I look forward to obtaining this game and play it again soon!

UPDATE:  It seems that it is impossible for the traitor to win...

I think I just don't particularly enjoy horror themed games - especially ones where rolling dice well are very important.  In the game I played, I never felt I contributed much nor had much opportunity to help much once the haunting began...and I can never roll well!

Just got it; can't give you a rating or review yet. There's randomness (tiles, items and dice), but that's de riguerre for games with this much theme. Looks pretty interactive once the haunt starts. The counters could be a bit better, and there seems to be too much errata, for a really good game concept.

RATING: 8
Betrayal at House on the Hill is one of the few games that got me into board games a decade ago. Combining RPG elements, co-operative gameplay, tile exploration and a betrayer mechanic with unique end-game scenarios, there was nothing else like it at the time. Even though I've owned this game for a decade, I still haven't played through all 50 scenarios, even though it has made it to the table dozens of times!

It is worth noting that most of the scenarios are horribly balanced in one way or another (and that overall the game suffers from balance issues), but this is a game that you play for the collective storytelling experience, and in that regard, it succeeds masterfully.

This used to be my go-to game for friends that were new to gaming and it still holds a fond spot on my shelf, but these days we are more likely to play Mansions of Madness, which clearly draws so much inspiration from Betrayal, but polishes so many of its rough edges.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very light and not bad for it is.  I think I would rather play something like Arkham Horror though if I want to play this kind of game.  Arkham Horror has a little more meat to it and it is more involving.  Betrayal feels more like a party game in comparison, which is fine in the right setting.

The betrayal aspect of this game is quite neat. I can see playing this with a wider group of players so that gives this one a plus. I do wish the game had better quality components.

RATING: 5
Mystery Mansion rip-off.

This was more fun than I thought it would be, actually.  But it's still just something to play once in a while.

There's no real choices to be made anywhere, so the entire entertainment value is in the story the game creates.  And that could be pretty good, I think.  

It's easy to get killed arbitrarily by a random event, which could be frustrating but can be taken in stride.  But it does mean you will sit around for a while as the others finish the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The first half of the game is rather pointless. Move, random card event. Move, gain item. 
Snooze!

The 2nd half is when the story gets interesting! Something supernatural happens and a player turns evil. (This can actually suck if the player doesnt know whats going on, or how to win). 

That said...if I'm looking for a player vs others game, I'd rather just play Descent, or HeroQuest, or Mansions of Madness. 

Pretty 'meh'.

RATING: 7
11/17/15: Played this a fair few times.

Pros: Theme is excellent. Traitor mechanic, making survivors play cooperatively, is a lot of fun. Varying game experience means each time you play, something new happens.

Cons: Scenarios are often tilted one way or the other, especially if the players are arranged advantageously for one side or the other.

Lisa has had bad experiences because the survivors have tended to share text messages. Will experiment with table-talk-only rule in the future.

The idea of creative a game based on awful horror movies is not only hilarious, but actually really fun! Building the house room by room as your team explorers is one of my favorite aspects of this game, and it does it so well! But even more fun than that is the fact that it's got two equally important stages, one cooperative, and one competitive! It's one of my favorites and normally the first game I pull out to introduce people to board games that aren't just Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit.

Have to be in the right mood to play, game mechanics can get wonky, some scenarios seem to play out better than others.

Nice game with a different board each time you play. The down side is that scenario stands on it's own and has complicated rules to them. Because of large number of scenarios there are a number of unclear situations. Each scenario seems to lean more heavily in favor of the heroes or the traitor, not have them be balanced or have the scales tip back and forth. Still a fun game.

Very fun game if played in the good atmosphere. People have to read the cards seriously. Not the most strategic game obviously, more for the casual medium weight players. I played it around 5-6 times and all the people I played it with loved it. Why I don't give it 9+ is because sometimes you may die and you didn't really do anything wrong, also there's not that many omen and event cards so it might get a bit repetitive.

The first half of the game, which is centred around exploration is great. The second half, where the other players face off against the betrayer, is often anti-climatic. The game mechanics for conflict are severely underdeveloped, which results in a lack of tactical complexity. The writers also clearly went for quantity over quality when it came to scenario design.

Bleh.  First game was a dud.  First half of the game doesn't feel very creepy, nothing happens.  Then I turn traitor, and the first explorer dies immediately and has to sit out the rest of the game and just watch.  I really dislike player elimination for this very reason.  "Come over and play this game with us!  Now sit there and think about how badly you rolled those dice!"

Then I died and the game kept going.  It was only a matter of time before the last explorer was going to win, so it all just felt pretty meh.

I'm willing to give it a few more tries, but it's on deck for a math trade.

UPDATE: never played it again.  Sent it away in a Math Trade.

RATING: 3
The opening stages are more of an activity than a game. Once the traitor is revealed the game is too, but I've been frustrated by frequent discrepancies between the traitor's secret rulebook and the players' secret rulebook. Some of the scenarios are trivial to solve for a best strategy, or even worse, wholly dependent on dice with no meaningful decisions. I suppose it would be OK as an ambiance-creating party activity if nobody took it seriously enough to notice those shortcomings, but I'm not interested in that.

SOLID SOLID GAME!! I was gifted a copy of it by my friend who sadly doesn't have time to play board games anymore. I have played it from 3-6 players and it is ALWAYS a blast! This made me want to seek out more tile exploration games. The more players we had the more fun it was as it created a lot of chaos and that sense of urgency when the haunt hit. Everyone I've played with has loved it too. For the price, you can't beat the quality or replayability!

RATING: 2
The game feels clunky. This game is an experience- and a frustrating one at that. 

1/3 of the game is spent setting up the tiles of the house (the only fun part I think), and then the haunt begins and a random traitor is assigned. 

Most of the scenarios are broken. Either the traitor is overpowered or the survivors are. It's just not fun for me to play a game where the winner(s) win solely on the luck of the scenario- and this game drags on. If you die early, prepare to wait around for 30-60 minutes bored. 

*Played 4 times with a 4 player group.

Not all scenarios are created equal, leading to disappointment when the haunt occurs halfway through the game.

I wish there were more to do while walking around the house other than just looking for items and getting hurt; an alternative win condition seems like a miss. Otherwise, there's not much purpose to the game other than to wait around until someone loses their s***.

I recommend everyone gives this game leeway a couple plays, just because it is so unique.

Originally I had this at 8 and recently dropped it to a 7. Mechanically, the game is merely average, but it is dripping with theme. My one complaint is that you can trip the haunt very early in the game almost unfairly. Once, I played it with my wife and another couple and we tripped the haunt when the first omen was revealed because my wife rolled all blanks. That created a bit of a chaotic finish as nobody had any special items or cool cards to play out the rest of the game. While I understand that the odds of this are remote, it's still a flaw in the design. You shouldn't have to roll for the haunt until at least a few omen cards have been revealed, that way at least some/most of the mansion will have been exposed. On this particular occasion, I think only 2-3 tiles had been revealed! This one will probably go back up to an 8 around Halloween.

About twelve plays of the new edition. My friends love this game, and I love my friends, but I hate hate hate this game. You'd think that having all these different scenarios would be cool until you realize that none of them have been playtested.

It's basically a B-Rated horror film in a box. The game has the possibility to break itself mid way through play. Not as bad or as often as arkham horror, but still there nonetheless. It does have some charm to it, however the problem is after the haunt triggers it's RARELY a balanced game afterwards as the game state can drastically sway the odds in either favor. As a game I think it's poor mechanically, but gives a great experience. The max I would want to play it is maybe once every 2-3 months. Hopefully the expansion fixes things.

Edit: the expansion added new rooms, items, and haunts. Some of them are absolutely ridiculous, and the expansion overall hurt my opinion of this game.

I like the idea of this game, however in practice it never really works out the way I hoped. An adventure in BaHotH often breaks down because of poor rules, unclear haunts and/or balance issues. 

The components are mediocre at best, the character sheets and those blasted clips being the worst. The box does come with an insert, which is much appreciated. The 50 haunts give the game does a lot of replay value, but you will be seeing the same item/event cards after a couple of times.

Overall I want this game to be great but often it ends in disappointment.

This is a horrifically unbalanced game, and the secret nature of parts of gameplay makes it hard to teach to new people. That said, if everyone knows how to play already there are worse ways to waste some time.

RATING: 3.5
First part of the game is as fun as a simple roll and move game, ie not at all. It can also take way too much time to complete. Second part can be ok but you have no controll of what it might be so you can end up with something quite boring there too.

Betrayal is fun, but man, the designers could have really used a better editing team. There are some serious ambiguities in the rule book, and when you have to read the betrayer's section, you usually have to go over it several times because they use some seriously vague language. For a dungeon crawl/survival horror game, this is fun.

Fantastic game. I played this regularly with two seperate roommates, neither of whom was particularly fond of board gaming but who both loved this. The rules are simple to understand, and the traitor mechanic provides enjoyment for everybody, even when the scenarios are unbalanced.

Despite the game's "Minimum Player" settings, we were able to fully enjoy the game with two players, perhaps because imbalances weren't actually a major issue to us. In fact, I find it tends to slow down a bit after the haunt starts if we have more people. A great casual game. Taking it too seriously will tarnish the overall experience, so put aside your need to dominate for this one.

I like this game, even though it seems to get bashed quite a bit. I think that people want to take it far more seriously than is intended. If you intend on purchasing or playing this I strongly recommend downloading the updated scenario rules.This can be a great theme/mood game for an evening of horror.Update: Every time we play this game it seems to end badly.

Has a lot of thematic fun to it, but the first half of the game is completely random, with no real way to strategize, and the second half is largely dominated by what happened randomly in the first half.

This can be a lot of fun if you get into it, though

RATING: 2
I want to like this game SO MUCH but it varies between being irritating and pointless, with so many lazy design decisions that undermine the game's potential.
The whole experience could be stripped down to three dice rolls: one to determine who is the traitor; one to determine who wins; and the last to determine if it was tense and enjoyable or hollow foregone conclusion.

RATING: 1
Fun (as a lightweight RPG more than a board game) during the "we're all in this bad situation together" first half. The 'reveal' halfway through ruins the game about 80% of the time-- scenarios are unbalanced, or unfun given how the house is laid out, or have unclear rules. Too often survival depends on a single lucky Mystic Elevator roll.

But I sure could tell you some stories.

[Update 2016: I've lowered my rating from 5 to 2, because being near people playing this game has reminded me of just how bad its flaws are. Endless rules debates, the game lasts forever, etc. At this point I see its accessibility as more of a negative than a positive, since it misleads new gamers into thinking it'll play smoothly or quickly.]

Matt's (He has a ton more plays with his family too)

Dice rolling (Output randomness) and random exploration don't have me very enamored with this. The absurd replayability with different haunts/layouts is nice, but I don't know if it saves the fact that I'm lukewarm on the core mechanics. Having some haunts with random traitors/turning into the traitor midway through this game has a very awkward "competitiveness" to it: You spend the first half not caring about your fellow players, and then the second half being unsure of how trustworthy they really are.

Strategy/thought is almost entirely unnecessary for this game, it's usually obvious what you should do on your turn. Theme is well executed and the game is low enough weight for more casual gamers to understand and enjoy, but I might tend for something more raucous/non-competitive like Galaxy Trucker.

I like the idea of building a map before you play it and I really like the idea of the 50 different scenarios you can play. The only problem I have is the first part of the game seems a bit boring as you collect things and build the house. It doesn't seem like the game really starts till the game is revealed.

We played the game twice with 4 players and I think that the game was very hard for the people fighting against the traitor. I think the game would be best with 5 or 6 players, and I am waiting for a night with this many people to bring the game out again.

wander about aimlessly in a munchkinesque attempt to buff your characters, then a play a completely separate game with the characters you made.

Actually very light on rules and if you play it as a game  you may not get much out of it.  However, if you think of it as a movie, possibly a B Movie, then you'll start to see it's charms.  The first part of the game is simply a matter of exploring and finding items, but as soon as the betrayal occurs you find yourself in the middle of a demon-possession, invasion of the alien body snatchers or werewolf attack.

Jr. High B Horror movie game on roids.  Great game at first.  Eventually (after 10-15 haunts), you realize that usually the haunt is decided when it's rolled, and not by any effort of the heroes or traitor.  Still, it's a great game for the journey.

RATING: 9
Fun game with good twists and generally well thought-out endings.  Balance (ease of winning) of some of the end-games, however, is very reliant on the number of players or the number of tiles played before the haunt is revealed. I don't, however, expect this game to have the balance of a strategy game. I play it to be immersed in the theme, and BaHotH fits that niche. To date, I am surprised at the lack of expansions, which could be EASILY added to the existing game.  More events, items, omens and haunts could be added without changing the base game. In summary, a fun very thematic game with mechanics that fit well.

With over 50 different scenarios, this game never gets old!

Seriously though, I absolutely love this game. It starts as a team game, everyone exploring and collecting items, each time a haunt roll is done everyone tenses up and freaks out a little bit.

Upon the haunt starting someone is the traitor and now it's everyone vs them. 

This means the game now turns into a battle type game.

There is also took to add role play with the descriptions of events on the cards, and items. 

This game is tons of fun and with all the scenarios and a completely modular board this game will never get old. 10/10

This is a poorly designed, poorly tested, poorly edited game, which just happens to have a fantastic theme, a great gimmick (before the novelty wears off,) and cards which really do seem to manifest the kind of genuinely unintentional bad writing and silliness which is properly characteristic of the horror genre. If you only have bad games to choose from, and you're happy to ham it up a bit, then this can be a blast. If you want a really good game to play, though, look elsewhere!

Great short, light game.  Good gateway game.  Horrid production values, though.  Tiles warp badly.  If that is a problem for you, stay away.

Although gameplay isn't too complicated for kids, sending them off by themselves with the traitor book and expecting them to show back up understanding what they are supposed to be doing might be an issue.  I usually run a game and help if kids are involved.

Dripping with atmosphere and packed with a beautifully created theme, this game is absolutely loads of fun to play!

Huge replayability with all the different scenarios. We've usually played it with 5 or 6 players, and I suspect that the balance of the game leans towards the betrayer with fewer players.

A fun game that is always different scenario. A must for the halloween season (don't actually play it much outside of October).

This is strictly a thematic experience. You just explore the house, with random stuff happening to your character until the often unbalanced scenario is eventually determined and, in most cases, one of the players turns against the others. There is not much in terms of gameplay, but it's enjoyable if you take it for what it is, and the 50 different scenarios guarantee replayability. Also, it's simple and doesn't take too long.

good dungeon crawler type game dripping with theme for when I'm in the mood for that type of thing.  love that there is a haunt that is triggered and that you don't know who will betray.  love the way the haunt is somewhat random but becomes increasingly likely to occur as the game progresses

Superb game, flawed in only one way - There's not enough of it!
Games vary enough to be fun, strategy and team work play a part after the haunt begins at which stage the player leaving the room (the traitor) often seems to be either very over powered or very inferior depending on the scenario. A shame really as a bit more verity would have made this even better.

This is the second edition of the game.

Played many times but only acquired for myself in September 2015.  A simple premise, explore a spooky mansion as the dumb jock, the mad professor, the plucky young boy and all the usual horror stereotypes and then have the game turned upside-down when the haunt is revealed.

There are fifty scenarios to play - but the traitor is different every time as is the layout of the house so it's always different which adds greatly to the replay value.

Here is a perfect examply of a boring game made EXEMPLARY by the theme. Everything in a horror movie is jampacked into this box. The exploring part of the game gets repetitive and slow, as you discover yet another room and pick up another card. But when someone turns traitor, and the game takes a on a personality, everyone loves it. Only problem is that you don't really need all those different counters. Why bother searching for every last zombie counter for twenty minutes when you could just grab, well, anything and it'll work just as well?

How can a game feel like you're watching a funny horror movie? I don't know and don't want to, I'll just enjoy the game, thank you very much...

After only one game I feel there might be some replayability issues in the future, because of the thin item/omen/etc decks. But if the different scenarios address this by changing the stories enough, the rating might even raise to 9.

PLAYED OLD EDITION: It's fun enough and the setting is good. There's also plenty of possible repeat plays due to the different haunts but everything else could prove to be repetitive. Also in our game the haunt started pretty soon and then we had an early death so the player's game was done quite a while before the rest of ours. So yeah it's entertaining but not amazing.

The first half of the game is too disconected from the second half (after determining the scenario/bad guy). The scenarios are a bit inconsistent. The better ones make for a good game. It could do with a bunch of fan-made alternate scenarios. (Played a lot more games than recorded.)

Great theme and atmosphere. It's not really a test of strategy so much though. It helps if you treat it like one of those "Host a Murder" mysteries. The ending can come on suddenly and maybe even be a bit anticlimactic because neither side usually knows how the other side can win, but I still really enjoy playing this.
UPDATE: After 17 plays with 17 different scenarios, I am continually impressed by how well the designers have made so many different scenarios work so well within this system. They are all wildly different in terms of story and goals and it always seems to be an interesting finish to the game.

Cheesy-yet-fun trasher done right. You don't play this expecting to have a balanced and thoughtful game. You play it for see-what-happens events and fun scenarios. Also plays pretty quickly.

RATING: 2
Lots of dice, so no surprise that it's not exactly my toe of game.  Not a bad concept... co-operative exploration of a haunted house, until the Bad Thing happens and one of the adventurers turns into a Monster!  Could be fun with the right crowd if yo like to read out the event cards in full, including flavour text.

The rulebooks for the Monster and the Heroes about how to play the rest of the game are annoyingly complicated and interrelated.  How much can you share with each other?  If you're unsure of a rule as the Monster, you can't show the rulebook to the Heroes or you'll give things away!  That could be a problem in some game groups.

After a second play, I decided that I never want to play this again.  The rules really are complicated (there are three rule books and lots of text on item cards) and you have to trust that the monster gets the rules right, because the heroes can't read those rules.  And furthermore, if a player dies, they have nothing to do but wait for the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My feelings on Betrayal are mixed.  I've played two sessions so far, one where I was the betrayer and one where I was the hero.  Our group tends to like cooperative play more so than competitive, so the person who is singled out to be the villain might not have as much fun as the other players.  However, I think it would all depend on whom you play it with.  This game requires a group of people to be dedicated to the game and to be paying attention.  

I wish the rolelpaying aspect was a little stronger.  With so many scenarios that are possible, it didn't really feel like one was any different than the other.  Sure, there are different win conditions, but it seems like that's where the players get tunnel vision.  By the time the haunt happens and is set up.. players are eager to end the game as fast as possible.  It has no time to breathe and for people to get lost in it.  

Don't get me wrong, I would still play this any chance I get - there are just a few nagging issues that I wish were improved.  Also, be prepared to struggle and fight against the sliders on your character cards.  They're terrible.  You're better off making your own markers, or better yet - using a sheet of paper.

RATING: 5
I feel like my enjoyment of Betrayal diminishes every time I play it. After so many playthroughs, the event cards, exploration, and haunt scenarios feel repetitive and lose their appeal, which is a shame since the strongest element the game has going for it is its theme. Many of the haunt scenarios aren't entirely balanced or are just plain confusing, which makes for an awkward second half where we're more concerned about playing the game correctly than actually enjoying it. Friends who don't own it love it and always ask to play, but I just can't seem to get into Betrayal like I used to.

RATING: 6.5
The game starts out as a co-op with everybody exploring the house, and eventually (when enough omens showed up and the die rolls for it), one of the players will become a traitor. Since nobody knows in advance who that traitor will be, the dynamics of that first phase are interesting as well, and due to the tile laying nature of the exploration, the playing field for the second stage will be different every time, with bottlenecks and open areas.

I really like how due to the many different scenarios, you never know in advance what you'll get with this game. All you do know in advance is that eventually, everybody will have to fight the traitor.

What is a bit odd are all the chits and pieces that look the same (triangles, squares and pentagons) and have different meanings based on their text, that could have been streamlined a lot.

On the other hand, there actually are individual tokens for each of the type of monster or whatever that show up in the scenarios (spider tokens, bug tokens, alien tokens etc. etc.), I guess that is a plus. Bagging them however is a must.

A little downside maybe (making it more casual friendly though) is that the game involves quite a bit of dice rolling and lucky draws for tiles and cards. Strategy is less important than the experience of exploring a haunted house here.

RATING: 6.85
Very light game, not a lot of strategy, but neat to see how each haunt unfolds.  I hate the player cards/sliders--which nearly make the game unplayable.  Jesse's solution solves this nicely.  Very enjoyable to anyone who likes horror/haunted house stories.

RATING: 6
Some haunts are pretty rough to execute. The most exciting part is usually the beginning, when everyone is exploring the house and revealing rooms and hoping they aren't the one to start the haunt.

Some runthroughs go off without a hitch and others leave you having long discussions while you try to figure out how the game mechanics should work for the particular scenario you find yourself in. You need the right group to see this game through to the end.

An Ok game where the first part (pre-haunt) is a race to explore a house and gather items.  The second part (haunt) is triggered following a failed throw versus the number of Omen cards in play.  A traitor is then revealed and the players find out what their mission will be.

The game can be fairly fast.  Combat is unforgiving, as attacker or source will receive a certain amount of damage based on the differential of their dice throw.

Not bad. A little fluffy, but it has pretty good flavor and is a fun enough for the occasional romp if you're in the mood for something thematic. It seems unbalanced, but maybe that doesn't matter so much. The little clip/pointer things tend to slide around or outright fall off, and they really ought to be longer so it is obvious exactly what number is being marked.

RATING: 8.7
This game can be a hit or miss depending on what Betrayal scenario you get and who the traitor is. Sometimes the odds seem really stacked in favor of one side or the other as a result of the items that have already been discovered and the specialty abilities given to the traitor and the victims. However, I highly recommend this game to anybody that likes some suspense and wants a game that is unique every time they play.

Pretty good game Every game is fairly different. Lots can happen and 50 different plots keep the game interesting. The only downside is that the rulebook is not very well explained. many times my friends and i are scratching our heads about how the mechanics work once the haunt is revealed. Would like a second publication of the rule book.

I've played this a few times now and while I really like the theme, it can be really easy/hard when the haunt comes to win/defeat just by random chance of who has what/the most items.

Need to modify the slider pieces because they are too loose on the character cards.

This is a fun dungeon crawler game that has a lot of neat features to it. I really like all of the aspects of the game but my first playing came up a little short. I think this is one I'll play but certainly don't need to own. Update: I've played this a few more times and I think that I'd rather skip it if possible when it comes up again. I'm not a fan of the two rule books, they make sense but there should be text in both books that define things that both parties should know. There has been confusion 2 of the 3 times I've played. Another thing is that it appears that some scenarios can suffer if too much of the house is revealed, in the one we played last I was the traitor and there really was no chance for me to win. I don't really mind but it takes the fun out of the game right away. The game should figure a way to scale, but you can't make house rules for the game without spoiling the scenarios. Oh well, at least I've played it.

Absolutely love this game- a good game gives you stories to reminisce on well after the game is over, and on that front Betrayal delivers in spades- there are a few games that still come up almost every time we get together to game.

RATING: 3
This game sounded like it would be more fun than it actually was.  It's pretty linear, there aren't a lot of choices to make other than which direction to move, so there isn't much strategy.  Each game feels very similar to the last.  There is some nice tension in revealing room tiles and not being sure when the haunt will begin.  But once it does begin, it's really just chasing each other through the house for one reason or another.  If you happen to be close to the betrayer when the haunt begins, you're probably screwed.  The first game wasn't too bad, but after 3-4 plays, it's not very interesting anymore.

The 40 Haunts (gamechanging event in wich one of the players becomes bad) are super unbalanced. We had a Traitor Haunt in a 3 Player game. And as soon as we read the Haunt setup we new the traitor would win. And he did,

Components are good & it plays very quickly, but the unbalanced haunts outweight that.

Mansions of Madness is a bit more complex & more balanced (but not to a degree that i would recommend it either).

Map tiles, cursed items, big and scary B movie style haunted house - this one has all of it. On top of that, the replay value is way up there since there are so many different scenarios to play out.

I thought I would never get tired of playing this game.  I was wrong.  It's a fun game, I still like playing it, and I haven't seen everything yet, but I feel like the lead up to the Haunt is too repetative.  Also, sometimes the Haunts seem to be unbalanced.  I think this is more due to luck than game balance, but it still is a negative for me.

Looking back on my first few plays of this game, I wanted to like it more than I did because we had some laughs and some fun, but the lack of control holds me back from doing so.  Basically, my character did next to nothing in the games I played.  We almost won one of them simply because of the Dark Dice item, the most overpowered, gamebreaking card to put in this type of game.  The second game was very random in how things went down and I lost simply because I switched sides a turn early.

Random is the problem with this game.  You search random rooms for random cards and random events, which ends up in a random set of properties called the 'haunt' to give some victory conditions, where you finally have some control and some direction in what you're doing.  However, if your character was crippled by random events previously or is super powerful, that pretty much decides the pecking order of the endgame.  Similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights, it's more of a tabletop story, and less of a game.

Certainly it can be fun, but without any real control of your character, its novelty wears off fairly quickly.

Incredibly swingy and unbalanced. Yet, I cannot let these faults drag the game down too far... 

This was the game that got me into boardgames. I had played Catan and Puerto Rico once, but this game is the one that got me excited and made me seek out BGG itself. 

I think there is something to be said for sheer fun, and this game provides it when it isnt too frustrating because of the high reliance on luck and random elements. Its really like a rough gem or, perhaps better, a rickety county fair ride: its fun, even though it can break down at any moment.

If you like theme games then you should play this. If you also like horror B-movie stuff then this is your thing. This game is as good as its theme. You wont find balanced mechanics or strategy and depth here. It's a game that will bring a new story to life with each playthrough and it's all about that. Not winning or losing. Just the story. And there will be plenty of them with 50 scenarios randomized each time.

Moreso than Arkham Horror, this game is more of a roleplaying game than a boardgame. I would say that having a Gamemaster as a player is a definite plus. As such, gamers who aren't into RPGs will likely balk at the scenarios' imbalances. In an RPG, no one even considers questions of play balance, winning, or losing -- the play of the game is the only important thing. BaHotH plays incredibly smoothly and is suitable for non-gamers and Roleplayers alike -- as long as a Gamemaster is present to adjudicate. Admittedly, the extensive errata is a drag, but that hardly makes this game unique. I've noticed that most of the criticism levelled at this title are from gamers who are focussed on competition -- who wins and who loses is important to them -- clearly the mark of folks who don't play RPGs. To those who simply play games to have fun, this is a true gem. Folks who enjoy old horror movies will feel right at home.

Regarding the 2nd edition:

What did the little birdie say?

"Cheap cheap cheap cheap..."

The room "tiles" are printed on super-thin card stock that began warping as soon as I removed them from the shrink wrap. Probably less than half the thickness of the first edition tiles.

Sure glad I kept my first edition copy, since I'll be using its room tiles, character templates, tokens, and basically every scrap of card stock in the game.

Component quality of the second edition is extremely disappointing...

Good theme, but the game seems horribly random and unbalanced. In more than one occasion, the haunt was either way too powerful or way too weak, making the result of the game a given. Also, having to search for the proper bits makes the game's atmosphere break down. Do I really need to look for the drip token?
You could compare the game to the Munchkin series: Somewhat expensive, lots of flavor, but it's really hard to find the game in there. The fact that the rules are not clear doesn't help matters.

I have to be really honest in this one. I have just played twice and both were not at the full potential.

The first time we were short of time so even though we had some omens, the traitor did not appear. In the second time, the traitor did not read well the traitor's tome so the survivors had a very rough time and ended up losing.

Anyway, I feel it has good potential, I like the idea that everytime you play it will be a "different" house. Also with that many haunts the replay value is great, and if you have played that haunt you may choose the next one, simple.

I hope next time I can play it well, at least with no misunderstandings and enough time.

-----------------------------

Tengo que ser honesto con esta opinión. Solamente lo he jugado dos veces y en ninguna fue la experiencia completa.

En la primera ocasión no tuvimos tiempo suficiente, a pesar de haber jugado algunas cartas de augurios, no hubo traidor. En la segunda vez, el traidor no leyó bien el instructivo del traidor por lo que los sobrevivientes tuvieron una noche demasiado difícil y terminaron perdiendo.

Como sea, siento que este juego tiene potencias, me agrada la idea de que cada vez que juegas, la casa es "diferente". También la repetición del juego se presta debido a las numerosas maldiciones y en caso que vayas a repetir alguna, simplemente puedes escoger la siguiente.

Espero poderlo jugar bien la próxima vez, con tiempo de sobra y sin malinterpretaciones.

Many scenarios to play, always different and yet somehow the same. It takes some time for the haunt to come, which pretty much means you're just waiting for it to happen. Then the traitor is declared, and you'll almost always know from that point who will win and who will lose.

RATING: 8
A very cool "atmospheric" game, best played at night by candlelight with one of those haunted house records spinning in the background.  Replay value seems high at first glance (50 different scenarios!) but in reality the card text, while chilling the first time around, gets old with later plays.  My advice:  don't take it seriously (it's far too random for that) and play it as a party game.  Once a year, on Halloween.  In the dark.

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  As of November 2013, all of them in darkness and firelight, with that goddamn piloerecting spooky soundtrack—[i]A Night in a Haunted House/A Night in a Graveyard[/i] (1992)—whose sound effects invariably, eerily, line up with the action.  Never playing it during the day or in artificial light makes the whole affair rather... [i]mysterious[/i].  Straining to read cards with a candle in the fist really adds a lot to the proceedings.  Even now, in the happy shine of morning, I feel a vague unease upon catching a glimpse of the box...

[q]Highlights from the last couple years:

• Once the traitor was revealed, he didn't want to go into the other room to read his plot synopsis.  He was too freaked out—and we're talking about a grown-ass man here.

• My little dog had worked her way under the table and into the forest of our legs without anyone noticing.  The toll of a bell on the soundtrack made her bark and everyone at the table simultaneously leaped out of their skins and crapped their pants.[/q]
UPDATE OCT 2016:  Picked up a copy of 2nd Ed. for component-matching with the upcoming expansion as I have no confidence that the 12-year-old OG printing will line up [i]at all[/i] (cardstock and card sizes will, no doubt, be [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/3066908/hivegod]radically different[/url]).  I've heard they've rejiggered some of the haunts, not that this was ever a problem for us as we're RPGers first and quickly adjudicated any rules weirdness with the wave of a hand.  I do like the severe reduction in tokens, however, and the use of generic markers instead of having to search through a giant pile for the single "eyetooth of a penitent murderer" by candlelight while the narrative tension sags to the floor...  Though it must be said that I miss the Underground Lake in the attic (an accidentally thematic misprint in the original) and the twin "Image in the Mirror" event cards where one had actual mirror-imaged text.

FINAL ANALYSIS:  Parallel-universe me (the one with the evil goatee) would probably give this an unreserved 10!! (with two exclamation points) because 1) he's cool with the excitement graph having both peaks [i]and[/i] valleys on it and 2) because he's slightly stupid when it comes to exclamation points.*  Variability makes or breaks the experience—on the one hand this means no two games are alike; on the other it means sometimes the climax is more denouement.  The question, always, is will [i]this[/i] haunted house configuration make for a thrilling contest, or one that's impossible (or otherwise unfun) for one side?  There's only one way to find out...

Good family game but without a larger group, my youngest (11) lost interest in the early part of the game.  This is the stage where you are building, equipping, and preparing your character for 'The haunting', which pits one player against the rest via on of 50 scenarios (more with expansions).  As with most games, this is best with a bunch of people.

Betrayal like being able to sit down and play a tabletop role-playing game without all the fuss of preparation of someone having to be the GM. This is an atmospheric and creepy co-op exploration thriller which flips and becomes a competitive game of survival at the halfway point. With 50 different scenarios there's a huge amount of replay in this game.

Only downsides: characters with slower speed tend to have less fun in the first half of the game as they can't explore as far as other players. The default miniatures in the game, while functional are far less attractive than miniatures in other games. All require a decent repaint or replacing with other 25mm figures, if you're fussy about such things. Also, due to the random nature of the tile layout, sometimes the traitor/hero challenge is unbalanced.

This plays like two different games.  First is the build up to the traitor reveal and then the chase or whatever the scenario asks for.  Not always a great game.  Sometime you don't find the right items or you get the omens too quickly, but when it works it is great.  Our play group can knock out a game in 45 minutes.

Love this game so much! Each scenario is really fun and no two games are quite the same. I love the idea of roles switching over the course of the game. 

I really want to give this a much higher score because it's a really fun casual game but there's some pretty big balance issues with a lot of the haunts. Still fun though, this was the game that got me into board games!

Betrayal probably scores only a 6.8 due to terrible, terrible production quality - warped cardboard tiles! But, I still would purchase the game - it's simply amazingly fun and incredibly well designed, warped cardboard aside.  Also, extremely high replayability.  You play the part of one of up to 6 explorers searching a Haunted House, at some random point in the game (based on dice rolls with increasingly higher odds as the game develops), a "Haunt" happens - that's when one of the explorers may become a traitor and things go awry!  It has different scenarios - from digging up a hidden treasure in the house, to attempting to kill a Mummy, to trying to return the house back to your own dimension. (And of course, zombies, werewolves, and vampires!)

I like the concept of this game and for the most part enjoy playing it. My one complaint is that the rules are not always clear and that detracts from the fun. I have played a dozen scenarios and get stuck reading the scenario/rule book multiple times to make sure I am playing correctly or trying to find clarification on a certain point, which is missing in the rules. If there was a clearer scenario book (specifically for the betrayer) I would rate this game an 8.

RATING: 6
The theme on this game is very strong and I want to love it very badly.  But, most scenarios are so unbalanced due to the high luck value in the game that it can be very frustrating at times.  However the components and artwork are very nice and do a good job progressing the theme.  This game appeals to teens and younger folks alot who don't seem to mind the randomness.

My husband and gaming friends don't like this game very much (too many errors and weird discrepancies in the haunts, at least for all of our Type A personalities) so it doesn't get played as much as I want it to. Unfortunately, I discovered the updated tomes after my gaming friends had already played and didn't like it. I'm still hoping to convert people!

RATING: 7
This game is a favorite with some of the people my wife and I play games with.  I like it a lot, but I do feel that it is very difficult to win as the Traitor. That used to bother me years ago, but I've come to accept it as long as the group has fun playing it.  I think this is a good game for relatively new gamers.  The theme is something most people can get on board with and the pacing is good.  By starting out with slow exploration, newbies can get a hang of the mechanics before everything hits the fan.

The only real risk is if someone inexperienced ends up as the traitor. Some of the end game goals are a bit confusing.

This game should be burned at the stake for absolutely terrible game play.  Very shortly into the game, I became the traitor, and was constrained so much by the rules that I had literally no choice in what I did until I was eventually killed.

Only played this game the once (will update again after a few play-throughs) but it was great fun!

The traitor makes the game suddenly alot more dynamic when the haunt begins, trying to play as a team to stop the traitor is awesome! It's also brilliant not knowing what the objective is of the traitor/heros... 

When we were playing the traitor kept asking "why are ye rolling dice all the time?" it was our main path to victory which she did not realise! Great craic, can't wait to play the other 49 scenarios. 

Recommended for something a bit different!

Edit: after playing more scenarios, we all still love the game but it is usually very unbalanced in either the traitors or the survivor side. Needs more thought on balance when the scenarios are being written. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This a really fun game to play. Almost everything about the game is random each time you play, the house will unfold different for each play as well as what items and events will occur per game. 

Due to this randomness, sometimes the haunt can be extremely in favor, or against the traitor making for some underwhelming games, but there are few and far between, so most times you will have a good game. The game also suffers due in part of the component quality of the game from Wizards of the Coast/Avalon Hill. The cardboard used is very cheap and can start to warp after only a bit of time. A real shame on WotC part. Also, the game is 10 years old so doubtful this will receive any type of expansion/support. Still the game has 50 unique haunts each with weirdly different win conditions for both sides. A good game hindered mostly from component quality and the chance of a poor game happening, which seems to be the outcome as of late. We've had some terrible haunts occur that has caused our game group to just put the game away and switch to something else.

I'm hoping the new expansion will bring some much needed life back into this one. 

UPDATE: After my most recent, and possibly last playing of this game, I lowered my rating to a "4". After so many plays the events get boring, the game loses its luster since it is so themed. But the game overall is not exciting and recently hearing the expansion does absolutely nothing to fix the broken parts of this game really hurts its rating as well. I feel that the designers are content in keeping it that way, since it fits the "c-movie" horror feel. 

Betrayal at Baldur's Gate looks to be the game that completely replaces House on the Hill. Hoping none of the rules and same design mistakes plague that game. Still, I wish Mansions of Madness 2nd edition wasn't another Cthulhu-themed game and more generic horror themed. How cool would that have been?

Update(er?) Wow so Baldur's Gate seems to add nothing new to the mechanics, just a component re-theme. Plus they still kept those retarded pentagons to track stats! Why, oh why?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While the mechanics can sometimes be a bit fiddly, and it can be a real (REAL) drag to have the Betrayer be someone who has never played the game before, this is still a really fun game to play, and nothing else quite captures that feel of being in a horror movie (From Vincent Price to Jamie Lee Curtis) like this game.

October 2015 dropping my score after a few more plays. This game clutches up a LOT. The warnings about broken haunts are no joke, and even haunts that aren't specifically "broken" can seize up depending on the layout - a friend played recently, was revealed as the traitor, and was stuck in the basement without an escape route. The game ended two turns later with her helplessly trapped. I want to enjoy this so much more, but it may be a case of being easy to love and hard to like.

RATING: 4
Starts with a (possibly long) period if wandering around randomly, and concludes with an often-unbalanced end-game once the haunt begins. Rules are often unclear, and the nature of the game can make it hard for clarifications to be made. It can be fun, but more as a largely-random activity with friends than as a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played 3 times now, each time its been fun exploring the house and then the haunt happens and it always leads to an abrupt end where one party has no idea the games just ended and its all very...anticlimactic. 'I got into this room so I win' or 'i found this item so I win' - yet to leave the table happy at the end of a game (regardless of which team won)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Can be silly but fun (and provides an opportunity to get my friends to listen to Earth, very appropriate), can fall totally flat depending on which haunt you get and the board situation when it begins. Unfortunately there's no way of knowing.

It feels like every time I play this I get trapped in the basement with no stairs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting two-stage game of a group trapped in a haunted mansion.  In the first stage, the group explores the house, which is created by placing randomly drawn room tiles.  At some point a random scenario is created, and one player (the bad guy) is split from the rest of the group.  Great idea, but the execution boils down to the quality of the scenarios, which in both of my plays was not great.  In particular, I didn't care for the fact that the players are secretly playing from two different scenario books, using two different sets of rules.  The first clue that I had that the other players were winning the game was when they told me they had won.

A fun game if played every once in a while.  It is a perfect haloween game, play it a couple of times around haloween and then put it away for months.

Betrayal switches between a 10 and a 6, depending on how the game shakes out. Maybe someday someone will figure out how to take this core concept and make it work every time, but until then you're flipping a coin on how much fun a given session will be.

I love a good haunted house story, so the premise of this game really appeals to me. However, there are so many rules, it gets clunky. We've played it maybe 4 times and haven't gone back to it. This is my first "cooperation" game I've played and don't think I like it as much as say Settlers of Catan, where everyone is on their own. I don't know if my family would commit to really learning this game to see if we can break through to make this enjoyable.

RATING: 2
One of the most pointless games I've ever played. The exploration of the rooms is so dull and idiotic. Often there is no way to determine if one choice is better than the other, you simply wander aimlessly until something completely out of your control happens. Every single aspect of the game is luck based and nothing of what anyone does really matters. A few turns and I just wanted the game to be over. A complete waste of time. If I was rating the gameplay alone I would give it a 1 but the artwork and theme value makes the game a 2.

It got a little tiring to have to re-figure out the rules for each play. They're the kind of fiddly, non-intuitive rules that I can never remember (especially since the variable nature of the haunts means you don't even always use all the rules). With months between plays, it's just not worth the re-re-re-learning to me. Math traded!

It may be a little heavy on text, and the randomness of who is the traitor may bother some (but this can be house ruled or negotiated: some prefer the traitor and some don't). Player eliminations can only happen after the haunt is revealed and that is usually close to when the game ends anway...BUT this game is still incredible. 50 haunts mean lots of replay-ability and because of the tiles, the house is never the same. There is even a bit of an RPG feel with your characters improving throughout the game. This game got me into this hobby.

Not a fan of traitor games.  You play cooperatively for the first half, then a hidden trigger takes one player and turns them into the evil monster (whether they want this or not).

Has the common drawback of cooperative games where it forces you to blindly waste important actions just to screw you over for no reason.

Would be rated higher if it wasn't so uneven. Some parts are excellent. The tension of one person having secret goals that the other team may not know about is very entertaining. I also enjoy the kind of schlock horror movie aesthetic, and that you can see the callbacks to horror media.

On the whole though, it has too many warts for me to look past. The sheer amount of random chance is too punishing. There is player elimination, and not the satisfying type. The different haunts can be hit and miss, and sometimes the writing is so confusing that you end up with completely different interpretations of how you are even supposed to win the game. On top of that, the production value is absolute trash. Pieces are warped, tokens are half-assed, you get the picture.

I have had games that were fun, and tense, and creepy. I've also had games that had all the tension of a wet fart, and ended about as quickly. In a way, it's the perfect send up of horror as a genre. Occasional strokes of brilliance, buried in a deep deep morass of cheesy jump-scares and bad effects.

Much more "experience" than "balanced contest of wits", as this game is really about being with friends as the "haunt" unfolds.  That being said, our group really enjoyed the experience.  Exceptionally good for the Halloween season.

Yes, some of the haunts may not be very balanced, but it's actually quite an accomplishment to fit 50 scenarios into one boardgame.

Haunts played: 2, 4, 34, 44, 49

The game is simple until the haunt starts and then it becomes awesome scary chaos.  The theme, setting and mood are great.  Needs some sort of intro.  Why are the scooby doo gang in the haunted mansion? wins 0 - 4 losses

Finally got a chance to play this one.  It's just about everything you would expect it to be.  It's got theme and rules ambiguities out the wazoo.  If you can just take it as a light group activity, it's very enjoyable.  If you actually try and figure out what is and isn't allowed, it falls to pieces.

Originally I was worried about missing out on this one, but these days I'm leaning towards just picking up LNOE.

RATING: 7
I don't know what the problem with this is...it's just not that exciting or fun. I find that youngsters like it much more then adults do. I think you need a group of people who are into RPG-styled boardgames and "get into" the exploration phase and you need a good haunt. A bad/inbalanced/boring haunt kills this game. If you get a good, fun group with a good haunt, however, this game can be quite fun.

The variation in this game is fantastic.  It's let down by the huge number of fiddly tokens.  Getting a scenario you've already played, instead of a new one, can also be a let down.

RATING: 6.5
Hard not to get lost in this game, especially when riding the enthusiasm of friends that are in love with it. It is hurt big time by the limited number of scenarios and the inconvenient fact that 1 in 3 are just...well, really stupid. Additionally, a mis-timed haunt can make a promising game a throw-away. The expansion, however, might breathe some new life into it.

I didn't have a great first impression, the game felt kinda pointless with no real direction or decisions or challenge. Maybe immersing myself in the theme would help more.

The rules are not elegant enough to make it a good 'light' game and the gameplay is not entertaining enough to make for a 'heavy' game

RATING: 6.5
Ideal Players: 4-6

Description: You've been locked in a haunted house! Work together against the traitor in your midst to survive the night.

Pro: Random house layout and scenarios make for almost infinite replayability. Heavy theme works well with simple mechanics. Every game tells a story.

Con: Someone needs to know the rules and manage all the little cardboard bits. Players can't take it too seriously, since some scenarios are unbalanced and the traitor will be playing against them.

I love this 'choose your own adventure' of this game. In that you have 50 different stories to work out in the end. The only problem with this game is Hasbro rushed this one and didn't do enough spellchecking or playtesting for all the books.

This copy was actually bought by my fiancée. The box got crushed and destroyed ,but all the pieces were bagged and tagged and now kept in a small plastic tub.

Don't care to buy the second ed. because of the poor production quality.

The main problem with this is that the first half of the game serves no purpose other than to prolong the experience. Also it's one of those games with a poor ruleset that has tonnes of corner cases and unexplained interactions which slows things down even more. It's not even that spooky or thematic, either. Just avoid this if you want any kind of "gaming" experience whatsoever.

A Wonderfully themed game from avalon hill, very high in quality and richness, immresive and enjoyable.

Still a highly recommended game which will give you endless hours of fun!

Would have rated higher if playtesting and proofreading had eliminated more of the bugs before going to final print.  Still, if you are looking for a game that is easy to teach and doesn't put off "non-gamers" but has enough depth to interest the hard-core, this one strikes a good balance.  Excellent replayability (50 scenarios included) and could easily become a 10 with an expansion that also corrects some of the initial errors.

RATING: 4
Take heed the comments that claim this is only half of a game. Actually, it's probably even less than half. The first "part" of the game is a monotonous chore devoid of any meaningful player interaction, input, or choice. Nothing happens unless someone "explores" a new room, and so really the only option is to explore new rooms, and wait for the actual game to start. There are no tasks to accomplish, no advantageous positions or setup to try and guide the game towards, no strategy. Basically the first part of the game could be boiled down to "elongated setup, and stuff may or may not happen to you." Even if things happen, it is basically just the game telling you what to do in order to get to the "real" game.

Once the actual "Haunt" phase started, the game was  pretty fun (although the necessary break in gameplay to go read a new set of rules is terrible). The haunt phase brings with it goals, and enemies, and a sort of soft time limit to keep things moving. Players all can make decisions solo, or at the suggestion from other players to help or hinder their goal in the haunt. Player elimination is a bit of a problem, negated slightly by the mechanic that people have the potential for turning sides during the haunt instead of dying instantly. However, perma-death is still an issue in this game. 

I don't feel the fun I had playing the second part of the game makes up for the relative lack of a game in the first part. It's ok, but certainly nothing spectacular. 

A game with a lot of interesting ideas, but for the most part they are poorly executed.

Problems aside, this is a very fun game to play.  The updated rules fixes quite a few scenarios and makes it a more balanced game.  That said, not all scenarios are completely balanced nor do I want them to be.  Some should be easier for the Traitor to win and others for the Survivors.  I like the randomness of what game you will be playing.

None the less, it is still a great party game, especially in autumn and late at night.  This is one of the games where being over-organized will help you and speed the game along.  There are a ton of chits and having them organized or a sheet with what type of piece it is will spend the game considerably.

My rating is currently based on only one playing of the game.  I had fun and would play again, but in my opinion, it is better to look at this as an experience more than a game.

RATING: 6
The theme is great, the concept of the traitor is fun, but far too many of the haunts end up unbalanced. A haunt starting before half the house is explored--which happens often--usually limits the play and slants it heavily to one side or the other.

RATING: 8.36
Scenario based "co-operative" Haunted House survival game that captures the feel extremely well and plays fast while offering a decent amount of replayability. Best played with a full group of 4-6 role playing gamers and some thematic music playing in the background. Some issues with too-loose clips that track physical and mental character attributes but all-in-all a very good game. My favourite style of "co-op" ... one with a potential betrayer in the midst.#TOP 14

Role-playing flavor. Different scenario every time. Some scenarios are unbalanced. This is the only cooperative game that I enjoy. Worth pulling out at Halloween.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I WANTED TO LIKE THIS GAME!  It is such a great concept, and has such great potential for replayability.  You go into a creepy old house.  The tiles are placed as you explore.  The artwork is great.  There are multiple scenarios for what happens to you in there...  Genuinely creepy and intriguing every time!

But, especially for such a good concept, it's a pretty big hassle. 

The rules and instructions on many of the cards are badly written.  There are some fixes online, but there are too many to keep up with.  You eaither have to mark up your cards, or keep a large list of the fixes handy.  

The first part of the game is spent wandering through the house trying to build up your stats and weapons.  After a few plays, this can get boring, because you'll be so familiar with the "event" deck.  More event cards would have made this much more tolerable.

Another problem is, that when "IT" happens in the house, there are different possibilities to what chases after you.  This begins the part of the game we call... "THE LOOKENING".  You have to look for something like 15 chips of "zombies", or 5 chips with the word "mummy" on them... out of a pile of 75 or so.  There is no artwork to help you (The text is color coded, but it doesn't help, really). 

Another result of this, is that when you're running away from let's say, a bear...  you're actually not.  You're running away from a chip with the word "bear" on it.  The only thing scary about that chip, is that you and all your bored friends just spent half an hour digging through the bag of chips looking for it.  Sometimes we just write "bear" on a post-it note.  *sigh*.

I'm not saying they should include 75 miniatures, but COME ON!  How about some artwork?  On BOTH sides (to shorten "the lookening").
________________________

So, in summation: this is one of the coolest games I own.  Too bad my friends and I can't stand to play it.  It has a lot of potential, and all these things could be fixed pretty easily in a future release... if it wasn't an "Avalon Hill" game.  And if Avalon Hill wasn't owned by Hasbro Mega Corp.  OH WELL, guess it won't be re-released anytime soon.  Tough luck!

The game has two parts: exploring house and trying to accomplish a mission.  The first one is rather boring, the real game starts in the second part.

This game can be random, unbalanced, chaotic, having gaps in rules, but these are not biggest problems for me.  When you are immersed in a world created by the game and feel a proper atmosphere, you can forgive a lot, but actually I didn't feel it and the game didn't deliver excitement to me.

I don't know if I will ever get through all 50 Scenarios (or the other 50 in the expansion) and I don't really care. I will always vote for this game.

It's that no game could EVER be the same. So good. can't say enough about this game.

A fun game that shouldn't be punished for its complete lack of strategy.  The building element of the house is fun from a storytelling perspective and eventually one comes to the Haunt and things turn adversarial.  Great for beer and pretzels with spooky movies playing in the background for inspiration.  Loses points for lack of interesting monster chits, balance issues (it'd be nice if it -could- be more than B&P), and an unholy amount of errata.

Exploration:co-op:modular board: dice:rpg

Very cool themed game where you are exploring a haunted house and you do not know who/what is haunting it until it progresses. The absolute best part of the game I thought is that one of the players randomly becomes the 'monster' and tries to kill eveyone else! 

Not without faults, player elimination (not too bad as game should last an hour but it is there) and a lot of dice chucking, also very light with limited strategy but that last stuff is to be expected. 

Good things include lots of flavoured text, modular board, decent variety especially endings, characters not upgradable but do have 4 stats, somewhat easy to pick up and play and scales decent (3 - 6 decent but maybe 4 or 5 best)

A decent and fun light little romp in the house that I would play again, if you like this and want more detail see Arkham Horror

My third designer boardgame after Risk: Godstorm and Risk:2210. I have a lot of fond memories for this game since its my first thematic game. The whole idea of a group of people exploring a house with creepy occurrences and strange items with a backstory unraveling in the background is just very smart. 

This game is very dated by now. The mind boggling amount of tokens is OK back then but not anymore these days. Also the game pace seems to stall a little after the betrayer is revealed since moves become more and more critical after that point. Mansions of Madness has completely replaced Betrayal for me

This is fun though a little twisted. It's good that there are 50 different endings, so this game should warrant a lot of plays. But overall, the game is a bit repetitious and not worthy of the retail price.

I sold it for more than I consider it worth, seems the market for it really took off.

10/27: This was a first time playing the game. Since it was Halloween time, we figured to go ahead and learn the game.

It took us a minute to notice that the rule book is more of a guideline for the flow of the game. Everything else was listed during the game. The order play and what a player can do is about what the rule book does for somebody. The tiles and cards are what determines the game at that moment.

I've found the first half the game kinda boring with just trying to improve the character. The fun of the game is the haunt. The tone of the changes dramatically when this occurs. We are now in the action phase of the game. Death becomes real as we learned through our first haunt. Yes, the good guys lost.

Overall, we wanted to play this game again.

11/3:  This was the second time we played the game. We enjoyed this around of play more since we weren't encumbered with learning the rules.

RATING: 9
An old favorite of the group.  Loads of theme and atmosphere!  Coop game where you are exploring a very haunted mansion.  You can add one more room tile a turn.  You're trying to load up on goodies before a dice roll triggers the second part of the game, which is where one of the players (usually) turns out to be an evil betrayer!  There are fifty different such scenarios and you don't know which you are in till it happens.  They are often rather poorly written, causing confusion, but they are all fun and imaginative.  Folks will often rehash particularly amusing sessions for months afterwards, like with a good roleplaying game session.  It's very luck-driven and many of the scenarios are wildly unbalanced towards one side or the other so you have to play it with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.  If you play it enough times, you start knowing all the cards, unlike Arkham Horror where there are too many to know them all.  This desperately needs an expansion or two.

RATING: 3
This is just really not my type of game. It's extremely thematic at the cost of being a mechanically solid game. It's also a game I'd hate to play with a non-gamer that might be forced to leave the room mid-game and read a manual to understand how to win.

Really clunky. The first part is just moving around with no purpose or direction. The haunt roll is often ruined by randomness, it seems like it always starts way too early or way too late. Out of the 3 scenarios I've played I would say one was "okay" and two were pretty bad with confusing and unclear rules. We're not fans.

Great game if only for the atmosphere.  Follow the component sorting guide and it'll play much quicker.  So many pieces to find it can slow to a crawl if you don't have everything organized.

Excellent game.  Always willing to play with friends.

I've been toying with the idea of creating a rules set which removes the single player from becoming the bad guy.  It would be nice to be able to play as a complete co-op.

Played once and loved it.  This is a great story telling horror themed game where players collect items before figuring out the story part.  At  one point in the game, a single player switches to evil and the end conditions are set for both the good and evil players, but they are not necessarily known to both sides.  The game was a lot of fun.

Had high hopes for this game given the title, but they were dashed.  There is no "betrayal" or social deduction in this game - just that halfway through the game, one of the players is randomly and publicly selected to side against everyone else.  Besides that, the game is very random, often unbalanced, and gives players little agency.  I gave the game another shot a few months later, but found it to be lacking in the same way.  

Unfortunately, the game seems quite popular, and I may end up running into it on some inauspicious occasion.  Then it will be, "Betrayal at Some Random Gaming Group."

It was a great game for the family, because:

- We love horror movies and this one really has a feel for exploring a haunted house.

- We are all busy and have limited time to play games.  This game takes ~1 to 1.5 hours.

-  There is little room for hard feelings since everyone is a team once the game starts to explore the haunted house, and once the actual “haunt’ is started, it pits a team of ‘heroes’ against a single ‘monster’.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
B-Movie drama. Plays fast and hard. Surprising haunts (DO NOT READ THE HAUNT OR CLUE MANUALS or you will spoil the surprises). If you love Hammer Horror or cheesy 80s and 90s horror with vampires, dragons, mummies, werewolves, then this is a great night pass-time. Lucky dice rolls rule here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Fun to play just because of the randomness and if you don't like having to think as there's not much strategy (if any). There's some scenarios you can get into where it just feels like there's no way you can win.

Also the little things to track stats suck, they don't hold onto the tracker very well. Just use the stat app if you have an android/ios device as it's only a matter of time before someone breathes too hard and the little trackers move or fall off.

It feels like the game is playing itself after a while though especially if it looks like the scenario has already determined you're going to lose. The game feels more like you're there to just move the pieces as it plays itself. Okay for first time gamers or a beer and pretzels game but otherwise offers nothing of note. Some may enjoy the story telling aspect of it but the enjoyment from that doesn't really last very long.

I've got some friends who love this one so I play it pretty often.  It's the kind of game that goes well late at night when people don't want to think too hard.  Like a lot of flavor text driven games, hearing the same cards over and over again in the early part of the game can get old, although there are enough end-game stuff in the book that the conclusion will vary quite a bit.

I can't put this game down, if I find time and have the group, it will come to the table. My group is addicted to the concept of the betrayer and how it is addressed. This is worth every cent.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable with a group that is new to serious boardgaming or to introduce someone to the possibilities of boardgames. I find that, by the time the traitor comes out, the game is usually tilted so far towards either the heros or traitors that the game is a foregone conclusion. It's still an enjoyable game to play, despite the endgame.

RATING: 4
Too much randomness can mean you have a fun game or a terrible game just through drawing cards. No real way to pick yourself back up after a bad pull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is one game in my collection that my friends are always asking to get out and play.  It's an enjoyable foray into the horror genre where you and your friends enter and explore a scary mansion only to find out that one of those friends is actually a traitor in disguise who has invited you there for less than noble purposes.  With over 50 different random scenarios (haunts) and  a mansion built from randomly placed tiles that you uncover as you explore, this game has a lot of replayability.  And replay it you will.  This is a great game to introduce newer players into board gaming and one of the most fulfilling aspects is seeing the broad smile on their faces as the traitor and scenario is revealed.  

Now that isn't to say this game is a perfect one for all gamers.  While there is strategy to this game, randomness in the encounters you face and the stats you gain while adventuring will cause imbalance during the haunt phase, much of which you will have very little control over especially if you roll poorly.  So hardcore strategic gamers or eurogamers may find this game lacking.  But I also think that isn't quite the point of a game, a game in which you are immersing yourself as a character from a B movie, and a horror one at that.  A genre where not everyone gets to be the hero, makes the right decisions, or survives against the seemingly impossible odds.  Where sometimes the most heroic action for your weak character is serving enough of a distraction to give your stronger teammates that one extra turn they need to win.  And in this way, this game is always different as sometimes you're the weak player playing against an insurmountable foe, sometimes you're the strong hero who vanquishes the ultimate evil, and sometimes you are the powerful traitor doing all you can to destroy the people you considered friends only a few minutes prior.  This is a tremendously fun game that hits its peak when the players immerse themselves in the theme.  And when it does hit that peak, you keep coming back for more.

Final Rating: 9.5/10  (loses a half point for the loose fitting stat markers)

This comment is for the first edition of the game.

2013-03-12

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2010)

Betrayal at House on the Hill (First edition) was one of the first games I ever played and I really liked it at that time, however, since I have played many more games, this game doesn’t appear to me as good as it was before.

Still a fun game to play from time to time. The game has a huge replayability as each scenario is different, however for the same reason the game has a limited life span as the scenarios are limited and I would not want to play the same scenario twice. I really like the traitor mechanic. The game forte is the theme and narrative, it is hard for us to play sometimes because many friends doesn’t understand English and the game has a lot of text. The traitor has to understand English perfectly or he can ruin the game. Also the game has a lot of randomness in many levels but as I don’t take seriously the game, I don’t mind much. 

The components are pretty good and I generally was entertained by the game. I want to play it every two months or so. Good game to introduce non gamers to the hobby.

I continue to like the game, sometimes the games can be epic, others can be somewhat boring. Still a fun game to play from time  to time. Perhaps I will buy it in the future, if I do,  I would like to have the first edition as I think (but I’m not sure) it has superior components. I still don’t know what changed between editions.

 With the FAQ and sorted components, its probably a 7.  Straight out of the box it would be more like a 1.  The game is generally fun.  However, between game length, varying game balance, and the same scenarios coming up over and over, it doesn't get played anymore.  Somehow 50 missions in the book always boil down to the same 20-30 over and over.

The random nature of the board & haunts mean that some games obviously favor either the traitor or the explorers. Some games just end in a whimper, but these are more than made up for by the very tense and hard fought haunts that seem to come up 2/3 of the time.
The quick play time and variety of haunts allow this game to be played 3-4 times in an evening, minimizing the chances of a single sour game ruining the experience.

RATING: 9
Strengths:
Wonderful theme.
Accessible for non-gamers.
Mimics the horror movie well in a variety of ways (character types, events, omens) and I find myself imagining what it would look like in a series of scenes.

Weaknesses:
Lots of counters and chits. You'll need organization.
Challenging (and sometimes off-putting) if a newbie is your traitor.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun. Really, it is. The rules are a bit loose and I don't think it's all that bad as the game is suppossed to be loose too. The errata is needed for the haunts though and that does lower the ratings a bit. With those points made, and they really do need to be noted, the theme in this game is incredible and carries it a very long way; It's almost every horror film in a box. I, almost, tend to think of this a seasonal game (Halloween) and not one to play into the ground, but to bring out when the mood strikes and the group is up for it.

I do like it and it's fun to play, but the group needs to "have fun" with it. If you have a mess of stuffy players it may not go over well. You have to bring energy to it and laugh or it's really just a game of lay a tile, move, and roll. That's what all games are though in the end. 

This is not a 'dry' game in my mind...it 'drips' atmosphere and it's fun. What was that? Did you...? The house! The house is...what? the walls? what's in the walls?!  THE WALLS!! CAN YOU NOT HEAR THE WALLS???!! Hey relax sweetheart, relax...it's ok...there's nothing in the walls...just kind of lost my head there for a sec'....what? Oh don't get all prissy 'bout it; I mean, I'm only mostly dead right? This part ain't rotted yet...well, that's a bit over ripe I grant.... and, well, the house says I needs a bride; so, how's 'bout it? THAT's theme.

A game of two halves as the football pundits say: a simple tile-turning exploration game changes tack half way through when the random mission and bad guy are determined, which is a nice touch.

A fun way to spend the evening, especially when you have invited friends over who are not necessarily regular gamers. The game is cheesy, surprising and great fun - while the game does get repetitive after a dozen plays, it does not detract from the experience. Some of the rule mixups require patience, but as this is not a strategy game it doesn't matter that much. Play with people who enjoy getting into character for best results - in short, this is a game with a few small flaws, but none of which are too bothersome. I have yet to try this game with the fixed Traitor's and Survivors' tomes; rating might go up.

This game is very unique with role playing theme. I personally like it and what i like most is the exploration of the house, not knowing what i will face in every new room. Then the main theme came in possibly half way during the game where one player will eventually become everyone's enemy and the game takes a drastic turn into two parties going against each other. The theme is excellent and it always give me the feeling of suspense and guessing, such as who's turn going to be the traitor. I have played the first edition and love it and now own the second edition without regret. Give it a try and you would be surprised with what you will discover.

I love the theme, but the quality of the scenarios is incredibly dependent on the way in which the house has been laid out before the haunt begins.

I think This is one of the most thematically immersive games I've ever played. Yes, the first phase of the game is completely random, and yes, the second phase features potentially annoying player elimination and unbalanced objectives, but it's still a lot of fun. This is Cabin in the Woods: the board game through and though. We really had a lot of fun with it.

Update: I've only played this a couple of times, but the excitement I felt exploring the mansion that first time faded quite a bit once I had seen most of the rooms, and the haunt was just okay both times. It still had its moments, but I think I'd just rather play something else.

This is a good game that infuriates me.  I was going to write a review, and in it say, "The only betrayal here is Avalon Hill deciding to use the low quality components in the box."  But I'm too lazy.  Did they need to stick it in the same box Godstorm used to save money?  A much smaller box would have held it.

I liked the original, for all its flaws.  I've pre-ordered the new edition, and look forward to the new rules, errata, and components!

RATING: 7
Played several times so far, Love the game for the most part... it feels like a dumb-down version of the Arkham series games without being able to be lost in time and space for eternity...

What I like:
The dungeon crawl into unknown spaces and element of finding loot along the way is amazing, if you like imagining a haunted mansion and crawling through the rooms one by one, this is a fantastic effect. 
It is indeed suspenseful as a haunted mansion should be!
Super great Tiles and explorers for the game, Like the cards... would love to have more of a backstory to what lead this random party to exploring this house. 
the mechanics of character stats. 

What I do Not like:
I don't love the haunt mechanics. The dice are a must, but need to be more... well just more. I feel like the story needs more of a story, and after the haunt there needs to be an epic climax and well.. there really isn't... it's kinda like... "Ok... do we win? or does the Haunted? Cool... What's next" there's virtually no Epic battle with the haunted or limited game interaction after the climax of the haunt. 
The rulebook and the haunted going to figure out the role he/she will soon play - this just feels awkward. it was a co-op adventure/exploring game and now it's a plot between one of the explorers and the rest... with limited interaction and about 5 mins of figuring out what and how to do it... there needs to be more thought, more play and just overall a more epic battle to see what will become of the explorers and their haunted Foe. 
Wish there was an option to save the insane friend. 
The Mechanics post haunt are pretty not fascinating. 
I feel like I only got Half a game experience. 

Overall I give it a 7 for fun factor of the dungeon crawl. 3 star dock to the lack of post haunt play or an epic ending which will forever be burned into our memories as a Haunted encounter should be!

Nice game with lots of replay value, because of the many scenarios.

It is unbalanced, but that's fine in most case as the theme is quite nice.

RATING: 4
The best part of Betrayal is the horrific imagery it paints via event cards. As you explore the house, each room can hold an event, and each event comes with its own flavor text. Let your imagination run, because that's the only source of fun in this game.

The characters are thin, consisting of a few attributes and some window dressing in the form of interests that have no effect on the game. The challenges presented by the event cards are nothing more than stat rolls against your character's attributes. Roll well and receive a boost. Roll poorly and suffer a penalty.

The game is divided into two parts: pre- and post-haunt. During the pre-haunt phase, the players explore the house and discover rooms containing event, item, and omen cards. The rooms are revealed randomly, so there is no incentive to choose one direction over another. Each character has a speed trait that allows them to move a number of spaces each turn, but their turn ends upon encountering any of the aforementioned cards, effectively nullifying the importance of that trait.

After a number of turns, the haunt will trigger. At this point the game grinds to a halt as the players are instructed to read a special section in two separate manuals (one for the newly-appointed traitor, and one for the rest of the players). These introduce new rules for the players to absorb and shifts the game into something that could be called tactical. Unfortunately the game has dragged on for so long everyone just wants it to be over.

A great horror story-telling opportunity marred by poor design decisions that limit choice and drag the pacing down to a slog.

RATING: 10
My rule for a "10" rating is that it is a game that I will always be willing to play over any other game that isn't another 10. This game has fun theme, great production value and the replay value is huge. The board is made of tiles that are shuffled and reveal as you walk through doors and explore the haunted house. It begins as cooperative play, but then a haunt occurs and somebody in the group becomes the villain of the story. There are 50 different haunt scenarios! Couple that with the variable board, and you've got a lot of bang for your buck. At my house, wee turn off all the lights, light a few candles and give each player a flashlight to heighten the mood. Get into then story element of it and it's way more fun.

Having said all of that, and rated it a 10, I will grudgingly add that it is fairly complex, for some tastes and can be difficult to teach/play with newbie or nongamers. It can sometimes be difficult to even get my game group to play it, so it sits on the shelf a lot. That doesn't change my feelings about it, but know your group before your drop the cash on this one.

RATING: 7
A great horror board game. I love that there are so many different scenarios to play through. Betrayal does a great job at building suspense. The game's biggest flaw is that not all the scenarios are balanced. Other than that I really have no complaints about the game.

RATING: 3
Not much strategy in the first phase before the betrayer is declared, just move around try and get items or buffs. The attack mechanic is bad, if you lose the first roll you lower your stats, So basically its always decided in the first roll.

RATING: 4
Uneventful turns, unremarkable events, items of little value or interest - about all you get to do in this game is add a new tile to the board, and that's assuming you don't hit a lose-a-turn mechanic or have your speed reduced dramatically. 

I've given it three tries now and aside from a Halloween game night, you won't catch me playing this. This game does close to nothing right. The variability is a complete sham. 

When the haunts are broken, idiotic affairs (common), the game is a 3 at best. When the game ends in 60 minutes, it's a six. And I feel like I'm rating the company a six or seven, not this train wreck.

Good replayability with all the scenarios. I really wish the game had better balacing mechanics for different numbers of players. It ends up being good and bad. On one hand, it adds a little varity to know that you might have a real challenge winning some-times. On the other, you are going to have a real challenge (AKA, be really lucky with dice rolls) winning sometimes.
Edit: -1 point. Some of the scenarios suck.

I give this one a "4" because my gaming group hated the mechanics of this game.  I thought it was inventive, but the bitching factor by the players really ruined the experience.  It is destined to be a cult classic based on both good or bad responses by gamers.  You either love it or hate it.  My group HATED it!  I played it again w/ my second gaming group & by the time we finished, they were NOT impressed (& they were very enthusiastic about playing the game in the 1st place!).  This group didn't bitch while playing (which helped) but we've played so many sessions of ARKHAM HORROR (w/ expansions) it jaded us to where we projected onto B.@.H.O.T.H. the need for it to be just as cool as that game.  We obviously expected too much.  Conclusion:  A game we'll never see on our gaming table again.  As I've said:  You either love it or hate it.

This game has so many serious flaws that I won't even bother listing them all. The main problem I have is that it just doesn't work. Everytime i've played this game it has just failed. No one enjoyed themselves and the whole experience was just boring and dreadful. It does come with 50 different scenarios which is probably nice for reply value. This number is not very impressive when you consider that half of them don't even work.

RATING: 7.75
A game that doesn't take itself too seriously - and neither should you. Somewhere around the first 'Scream' movie, horror flicks started to become self-refferential, pointing out and playing off their own tropes and cliches. Betrayal follows in those footsteps, with a set of horror movie archetypes to pick from, and a setup not that far removed from a Scooby-Doo episode. And then at some point in the game, everything goes to hell (sometimes literally). 

We've been fortunate enough not to have run into any of the 'broken' scenarios in our limited plays of this, and I can understand how that would likely cloud my perception of it if we had. But by putting yourself in the horror movie cliche frame of mind, and just going along for the ride - there's a fair amount of fun to be had with this game.

The first half of Betrayal is aimless and deserves a 3. The second half is either a 7 if it works, as the theme can be quite novel and interestingly executed. Occasionally you'll have a broken scenario that deserves to be burned from the haunt book, but that's part of the B movie fun I guess. This isn't for me, but I'll play it during Halloween season every year.

RATING: 10
This game is brilliant. I was initially dubious about buying because of its current ranking but the theme and concept interested me too much. Glad I bought it. I've played 8 games so far - Traitor 5; Heroes 3. Each game has been well balanced and perfectly 'win-able' by either side. Best moment was when Dracula appeared with all heroes safe on other levels...until my clutz of a friend fell into the basement with Dracula, discovered the stairs allowing Dracula to get out of the basement and was promptly turned into a vampire, leaving me to fend for myself. I won...just! Whew. Best part about this game is that anyone can pick it up in moments and play. I usually play 2 to 3 games in a 2 - 2 1/2 hour sitting. Can't do that with many games. The haunts are fantastic to play and huge variety. Sometimes you've got to kill the traitor. Sometimes you've got to kill the monster/s. Sometimes you've got to put items together in the right rooms. As neither party is quite sure of the others objectives this keeps you guessing too. I was going to rate this a 9 as the rulebook is lousy but it's just so much fun I couldn't. Really hope they bring out expansions. If the theme and mechanic interest you then buy it. ###Parental warning### Some of the flavour text can be a little frightening for primary school age kids. Flavour text can add some frightening imagery. Suggest not reading it out. Just tell them how many dice to roll or such.

RATING: 7.5
Really enjoy the theme and most of the mechanics. Have had tons of fun with this, and it is great for those looking for a horror theme game, especially during october. Rating would be much higher, but some of the haunts (scenarios) are unbalanced, and some are even flat broken. There are 50 haunts, so lots of variety, but it would have been much better to give like 25 in the original box, focus on perfecting them, and coming out with new haunts later on. There is an expansion which I think has better haunts, but I haven't tried it. You can also find haunts online that are supposed to be more balanced, but I haven't tried any. Another issue is with the triggering of the haunt. Sometimes it can take a long time for the haunt (which is the whole point of the game) to trigger, which makes the game last too long. 

If it weren't for issues with the haunts, my rating would be more like an 8.5. I just heard that a Betrayal legacy game is in the works, and I could not be more excited. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Have only played once with friends (before purchasing). Love the dynamic map layout mechanic (like Munchkin Deluxe). 

I also picked up the first expansion, but they need 2 or 3 more expansions as this is very story-focused. 

I feel like the betrayer mechanic is not as practical as, say, Dead of Winter, because usually everyone knows who the betrayer is instantly. But, as long as you play with a tongue-in-cheek attitude and commit to the bit, it's not a big deal.

RATING: 3
[b]Quick Review:[/b]The player components are awful. I would almost recommend using a piece of paper and washers to track traits over what they provide. The miniatures also game bent and disfigured, and there are two characters for every one miniature provided. The miniature only matches one of those two.

Aside from that, the game starts off very bland, generic, and directionless until the haunting. That's when the game, however painfully imbalanced it may seem, takes off as one player becomes the bad guy with his own secret agenda and abilities that the good guys have to figure out and defeat (or survive).

Recipe for a serving of BaHotH:

[1] Enter a room, place a new tile, roll against one of your attributes to get a card, avoid getting hurt, etc. Repeat until:

[2] One of you is exposed as the adversary to everyone else. He/she will then have a unique goal which is generally opposite to that of everyone else. 

[3] If the adversary achieves their goal, he/she wins; otherwise, everyone else wins.

Each time the game is cooked, one of a multitude of different goals is possible.

Definately thematic, but few decisions and lots of randomness make it a spooky party game at best. 

...better than Tales of the Arabian Nights though.

I can see why people like these sorts of games. I am not a thematic game player, and even if I was, this type of haunted house theme would be at the bottom of my list. 

I can appreciate that this game could be really immersive with the right group, but my one play resulted in an experience that just about everyone recognized as kind of dumb. I don't mind one-against-all type games, but once the bad guy became apparent, having it be impossible for that person to win because they get trapped somewhere in the house is very dissatisfying. 

Not a terrible game, just one that's definitely not for me.

**at school. Super fun IMO. I wish the haunts were written more carefully and rule nuiances spelled out a bit more, but overall really fun. Hard to get to the table. Wants 4+ players and not very easy to teach for some reason. Update: The last two times I have played this game we had one or more players left with not much to do. I dropped my rating down one notch for this.

This has everything I love most about tabletop games. Heavily themed, a fun horror theme, player cooperation (mostly), incredible replay value, fun mechanics. Some complain that certain scenarios are broken, but, I've only maybe ever found one, and it was only circumstantially broken (played about 35-40 scenarios). If you care about winning and losing a lot, this game isn't for you. If you like playing games for the experience, then definitely try it out! Rules may seem hard at first, but they're actually relatively simple.

Betrayal is significant to me, because it was one of the two games that made me a "gamer." Over the years, I have realized that there are a number of flaws in the game, some major, some minor. I don't play it as much these days, but this game will always hold a special place in my heart.

RATING: 9
Many people either love this game or hate its guts.  Personally, I love it.  With 50 different potential haunts, the replayability is through the roof.  The opening of the game does get a little redundant, but with more plays it becomes almost second nature and you'll glide right through it.  I would definitely recommend adding some roleplaying elements as you play, to up the atmosphere and flesh out the scenarios.

Eurgh, feels thrown together. A major dicefest and luckfest with little incentive to win. Mediocre characters and mediocre theming. Worst of all (or best depending on your point of view) it's an elimination game!

Betrayal as a game is just a mess. mechanically its terrible, however my group still has fun with it...sometimes. The problem is you play the actual setup phase which lasts a little too long sometimes only to have the game end 5 minutes after the haunt begins.

RATING: 7
Experiencing all the haunts is where the fun is. Haunts are imbalanced and skewed to heroes or the traitor but in the end, it is about being engrossed in the theme and not about winning. However, after knowing all the cards, it seemed like a chore to activate the haunt. Sometimes it was a little TOO unbalanced .. Although it was fun when haunts were intense, I sold it because more often than not, the haunts fell flat.
P.S. I used a plier to fix the clips.

Épouvante et trahison dans une maison hantée.
- Le bien: Jeu très original, ambiance de film d'horreur, des tonnes de scénarios très différents et souvent de beaux clichés. Les héros ne savent pas ce qu'il faut faire pour gagner, on a peur pour de vrai. Le méchant s'amuse.
- Le mal: au début, longue période d'exploration hasardeuse ou l'on attend que le mystère s'active. Plutôt amerithrash dans la gestion des règles. Un peu long pour le plaisir obtenu. Pas toujours équilibré entre le méchant et les héros mais c'est pas grave pour ce point.

RATING: 3
Love the concept, but this is a deeply flawed game.  I would very much like to see this concept done well. 

The biggest problem is that the pre-Haunt portion of the game creates virtuous circles and vicious circles that often severely unbalance the Haunt.  A player character passes a test and gains enhanced skills, which in turn helps them to pass more tests and/or gain additional items (seems odd that someone trapped in a haunted house would actually improve themselves beyond acquiring the occasional item and/or clues that could help with the Haunt).  For others, their characters just spiral down a vicious circle of failed tests and diminished abilities.  It can get even worse when an unequipped and diminished character becomes the Traitor - then you are about to finish an anticlimactic, boring, and stupid game.  Ideally, I would like to see on balance an edge given to the Traitor.  Further, the house layout is often so chaotic and weird that it detracts from the game - Mystic Elevator(?!), how about another staircase tile or two.  Lastly, the game has problems with rules and components well noted by others.

Despite the game system, I have played one particularly fun and memorable game of Betrayal at the House.  I've also played many bad games always in the hope of experiencing a good/fun game session.

RATING: 6
Sure the rules aren't the greatest but hey, gamers are always complaining about rulebooks. Am I right? This is a fun, goofy, and silly game that tells a story. You will remember which one of your friends ended up succumbing to the haunt and started running around house trying to kill you and your comrades while you tried desperately to escape or defeat them. This is a game that creates those kinds of memories.

This is weird game that I am quite fond of. The first part to go through the mansion is a Little boring, but I can give it a go, because the latter part where they use some kind of horror movie cliché as a board game mechanic usually works really well. And the game is different every time which is also huge plus.

Great atmosphere.  A lot of fun.  Really cool pieces.

RATING: 3
Ohh, how can this be so bad?  I don't think it was playtested.  Such a cool idea, but absolutely falls apart during the playing.  Frustrating.  I wish I liked it more, and will play at least two or three more times, but I suspect this is headed for a rating of 2.

Even if the rule books weren't riddled with errors, this game would still not be nearly as much fun as it should be.  Too random, too much of doing whatever the card or dice say, too many pieces that are essentially all the same.

Too boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on one play.  The problem is that for an ostensibly experience-driven game, it just doesn't pull you in.  You spend a few turns wandering around bumping into stuff at random, and then the haunt randomly triggers, and you get to spend 15 minutes sorting out the counters that you need and reading the special haunt rules and then rereading the special haunt rules and then re-rereading them and trying to figure out how to address edge cases.  All of this takes you out of the moment, and the random bumping into stuff phase never really drew you in that much to begin with -- you see some iconic horror tropes but there's not (nor is there intended to be) a coherent logic to how they fit together.  And then when the haunt kicks in, it's just a stat-off.  After wanting to play the game for over a decade, I was really underwhelmed by the experience and frankly surprised that it made it out of playtesting.

Game is entertaining and the haunt is a nice twist to mix things up.  However, due to the random nature of the haunt the game may end up being exceedingly lopsided.

Definitely fun and entertaining as you explore your unique house and then cope with your mistakes!

RATING: 6
While this game hits home on the thematic and exploration elements, it fundamentally breaks down as an actual game when it comes to internal balance of the 50 (100 with expansion) end game scenarios. In addition, some of these "haunts" occur with more regularity than others, which make some of the replay ability feel a bit stale at times. The insert of this game is decent, but does nothing to help you organize the dozens of different tokens, clips (which are virtually unusable without modification of game components), and dice, making finding the tokens you need frustrating unless you get a custom insert. Completely replaced by Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition!

Based on 2 plays.  I've heard legends of the omitted rules, endless errata, and shoddy playtesting, but I did not experience any of these issues in my games.  Rather, the play was slow and cumbersome, without a whole lot of interesting decisions prior to the Haunt.  Even afterwards the game didn't engage me.  I'll give it credit for the ambiance, but milieu will only take you so far.  I'd recommend Last Night on Earth as a much better execution of this idea.

This game is great - usually.  Some of the haunt scenarios are let downs.  Other are fantastic.  The build up to the haunt is pretty lame but becomes an important element after the haunt starts.  It's a hindsight is 20/20 situation, which actually makes the game fun in a way that no other game does.  You explore the crap out of the house and then the haunt starts and you realize it would have been best to do the opposite of what you did - stick together or split up.  Fun game, you just don't know whether Jekyll or Hyde is going to show up.

This game definitely has some flaws (horribly imbalanced and some of the game components are below par) but every group we have played it with has absolutely loved it, so it's hard to knock it. Together you all explore a haunted house that is procedurally generated (at first the board is very small. Every time you go through a door you place a new room, creating the haunted house on the table. Makes the game different every time and adds greatly to the replayability) until something horrible happens and one of you (probably) turns against the rest. The theme is very fun especially with a group who will really get into and read the many event cards in fun ways. A great party game that we and all our friends have loved.

Also, most of the games I've played it's been a pretty significant landslide in favor of one side or the other.

A game that falls under my categorization of Descent, I've had the most fun in the game when I wasn't trying to win.

Most of the scenarios I've played were utterly broken (as were some of the rules 0 if you get this game make sure to check the errata online!) and by and large I found that the winner was usually based on what scenario was drawn as opposed to decisions the players made during the game. Some players may have difficulty playing as the betrayer - especially considering the game then puts everyone else against them.

RATING: 5
Based on two plays; one four-player game and one five-player game.  This description applies to my first game:  This game started off well.  I thought it would be a really neat game initially.  But once the traitor and demons were revealed it went downhill.  Although the last surviving team member ended up winning the game, the demons were too powerful.  There was no chance of my character surviving and I was quickly eliminated from the game.  Also, the rules and such for action and fighting at that point seemed vague and complicated.  I was glad that I finally had a chance to play this out-of-print game and I'd be willing to try playing it again.  But overall this left me interested in this type of game and wondering what other games of this type are out there that are better.  For reference, if this means anything, the scenario we played was number 28.  The characters are uninspiring.

A great haunted house theme that works well for experienced gamers and new players alike.

Only played once and it was like a tale of two games. The exploration phase and gathering items was really fun. You didn't know what each room would hold and what you might find. However, once the haunt started, the rules became very complicated with lots to remember and it all just seemed very disjointed. Maybe more plays with different haunts will change my opinion. I really enjoyed the game until the haunt happened. One vs. all games are typically not for me.

Finally played this for the first time, and it turned out to be everything I'd heard it was. A bit vague on the rules in places, but a fun romp for the right group. I've only had the one play, so I don't have a feel for the different scenarios. Our game's finale involved doppelgangers of all the characters; I understand that was atypical - usually one of the players gets revealed as the villain of the piece. We had a good group that kept to the spirit of the game, and I'd be happy to take a stab at another scenario sometime.

Not good for 2 players. Often the rules for each scenario aren't clear. Components aren't very good. Counters don't stay in place on the character cards - that's a pain. Can be really cool if you luck into a well-designed scenario.

RATING: 5
In fairness I have only played this once, and I enjoyed the first half of the game - the exploration/levelling up bit, but the 2nd half of the game only lasted about 10 mins.  This was a consequence of the fact that the ghost was the "mightiest" person, who also had a lot of speed.  So we were all killed off in 1.5 turns.  Others said that some of the scenarios that come out are great - which I can believe - but this one seemed unbalanced

This is a game that has staying power in my collection - it often comes out when we have a party or game day. While it's not "balanced," I don't even think it's supposed to be. Its ability to evoke theme is the reason for its greatness, and will likely stay that way. Of course, we don't play it too much, certainly not enough to memorize all the Haunts - doing so would rob the game of its magic. So treat this one like fine brandy - to be occasionally enjoyed for its richness, and not gulped like a cheap beer.

Betrayal is a casual tile-exploring game, that's very simple in mechanics, easy to teach, and has enough theme to keep things interesting. In addition, the eventual traitor mechanic results in somewhat guarded, selfish gameplay, even in a cooperative setting.

Cheesy horror doesn't get any better than this, easily the best semi-cooperative 3-4 person game on the market.

Smooth flowing mechanics and a cool tile laying floor plan make for fast games that are always different every time you play. The tension builds as the rapid piling up of chrome through exploration inevitably leads towards The Betrayal. 

My favourite game involved young Timmy risking insanity through wearing a spooky mask which granted him the much needed knowledge (extra dice!) to defeat Death (himself) at a Chess match!!

Argh. I really wanted to like this game, but you have almost no control over what happens to you. Both great and horrible components at the same time. Neat dice mechanic and damage mechanic. No way to plan anything, barely any input as to how you explore the house. 

At my game group, I can always tell that the table next to me is playing this because there's arguing and a player from that game is hovering over ours to see if at least *we're* having fun...

RATING: 8.5
One of the current hits of our gaming group. Played almost every time, and in most cases more then once.
Beware: the game is broken out of the box. You absolutely NEED the errata as given here on BGG (separate one for the traitor and the heroes). Also not to be played with rules lawyers. However if played to have fun this game is awesome. Almost tend to give it a 10, but migth wear off once you have played all 50 missions. Also the mistakes are too many for a 10. Actually I'd only give it a 6 out of the box.
German buyers warning: Not recommended if your English is weak as you have to read new rule while gaming without the ability to discuss them.

RATING: 7.5
A pseudo-cooperative exploration game, where the players begin by working together to investigate a haunted house.  Eventually, the evil of the house overcomes one of the adventurers and they turn into a traitor, trying then to kill everybody else.  What I think is most unique and creative about the game is that you don't know how to win (or lose) the game until after the "haunt" occurs and the traitor is chosen.  The game is a little random and fiddly, but is a lot of fun to play.

RATING: 8
Betrayal at House on the Hill is a great example of a story-based board game, but has bad balance.

To summarize how it's played: each player helps explore a house, collecting items and experiencing events. In the middle of the game, the "Haunt" begins and one of 50 (or 100 if you have Widow's Walk) scenarios begins, where one player becomes the "traitor" and the others become the "heroes", and each have different objectives. (NOTE: Some haunts don't have a traitor, but the vast majority do)

Betrayal is incredibly fun if you're looking for a game that takes you through a unique story based on the way the house is built (the board is fully modular and different every game), which characters are being played, and what haunt is activated. This makes the game feel very rich and full of things to discover. However, the game requires very little skill or thought to play, and there's not much strategizing. Oftentimes, the Haunt is terribly unbalanced because the investigator that became the Traitor was in the best situation, or vice versa. Also, some haunts are poorly scaled to deal with variable player numbers, as the game supports 3-6 players. This can make for a 1-turn Haunt that leaves everyone at the table wanting for more.

At the end of the day, it's a great game that a wide variety of players can enjoy. It may leave the adept gamers wanting more in terms of balance, but it's one of the best story-driven board games I've played.

The other players felt that the random layout of the house is so weird that it begins to feel really unthematic. E.g. the collapsed room that drops you to the basement doesn't make much sense in the upper floor. What happened to the ground floor part in between?
Of course the random haunt start can lead to some pretty unbalanced situations. In one case the non-traitors had to perform a exorcism to stop the haunt and had all the items and locations needed before the haunt even started.

So far I have played these scenarios with the updated game and have enjoyed them all.  While the game is pretty chaotic that is to be expected in a game that is simulating horror movies.  Most of that scenarios have been challenging but the "good team" has prevailed overall in each one.  We have been pretty lucky but I am not committed as yet to an opinion about the weight of the game toward one side or the other.  Give me another 6 games and I may have more to say.  For now it is one that I will not turn down playing.

This is a great game when you just want to get lost in a developing, unpredictable story.

Extremely modular.

Can be a blast with the right players or can be a chore with the alpha proned ones. Yes there is quite a bit of luck involved. Best part obviously is when the haunt sets in. However, sometimes they can be confusing for the traitor to decipher. But with so many haunts this game gives tons of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like this game well enough. It's great fun for a while but eventually the same haunts keep popping up. The balance of the game depends on how much the house was explored pre-haunt and it is often skewed greatly to one side, either the traitor or the heroes.

I've heard about this game from a couple people highly recommending it, but I just felt like this fell flat for me. It was long, drawn out and extremely repetitive. Move, read, role dice, repeat. There was simply too much reading and adapting to new elements introduced in countless cards to keep track of. Gameplay before the Haunt kicked in seemed pointless, the different haunts for each game causes confusion with having to read new additional rules for each game and it seems that a game would be won more often by someone dying than anybody ever completing an objective. This game literally caused groans and pleading to throw the game just to end it, but we stuck it out till the end. Not sure this will ever see the table again...

I love this game despite only giving it a 6. I just recently learned about this game and can't believe I had heard about Arkham Horror before this. My biggest complaint with this game is the limited number of options that exist amongst the enormous amounts of game ending outcomes that actually exist. More card tiles and characters would make this just as enjoyable as Arkham Horror, but without the support it is just a very solid 6.

RATING: 3
This game frustrates me to no end.  I like the premise of the game and the theme; however, due to the numerous uncontrollable, random elements I rarely find myself enjoying this game.  More often than not, I find myself stumbling upon some hidden trap or open pit that horribly cripples me at some point in the game (sometimes even the first turn), and then the rest of the game is spent waiting to die at the hands of the monster/betrayer (or the players if I happen to be the betrayer).  A lot of time is spent wandering around the house, setting up for the betrayal, but when it finally happens the game is frequently resolved in an anticlimactic couple of rounds.  As a result, I feel very much like the guy on the box, pulling out his hair.  The only reason I do not give this game a two is that my gaming group inexplicably loves it, and they occasionally convince me to give it another chance.  I will consider raising this rating if I eventually play a game of this that I enjoy.

If you like playing games where your moves/actions have even the slightest impact on your chances to win, this game is not for you.  In my mind it is the equivalent of a horror-themed "Chutes & Ladders", especially when you fall down a coal chute into the gaping maws of a newly summoned, two-headed snake god.  However, if you *like* games where you can watch your character fall down a coal chute into the gaping maws of a newly summoned, two-headed snake god, this is the game for you!

4 players. Clever but straight forward game mechanic that works very well, exploring a random house where someone can turn betrayer without warning. Enjoyed the thematic experience as well. In our game the dog follower seemed over powered, being able to move and fetch items in addition to a characters turn but that was mainly due to they type of haunt we got (fetching tomes). Game seems very re-playable although I've heard that some scenarios aren't great.

I have played this game a few times at Game nights at EndGame, and I must say, it has left me utterly flat. The theme doesn't really do much for me, and the whole thing seems (badly!) scripted, and run by luck. Perhaps it would be worth playing on Halloween. Maybe.

My adventure game dreams come true. Takes a smattering of dungeon tiles, a bit of the story book game from 80's West End games, and throws in a cat mouse chase sequence. Not always balanced and may need to have a massive FAQ based on the individual adventures, but extremely simple to learn and overall a pure joy to play, that small problems are easily forgiven.

I love this game. It is perfect for anyone that like humour and old horror movies (before they were even scary).

But you have to be more interested in a good time than to care about who actually wins if you want to enjoy this game.

Just got a copy.  This game needs reprinted.  It's cute, funny, moderatly spooky.  Great lightly goulish game.  Very simple.  A bit low on the complexity meeter.  Fun if you get "picked" as the bad guy or if you're the good guys trying to survive.

Fun game.  Like exploring the house and finding items and omens.  There are 50 scenarios that can end up being played out--you never know which one you will get. This can be a drawback too though as some of the scenarios are kind of lame.  Game has LOTS of errors though, ie underground lakes located on the top floor.  FAQ and new rule books available at AH website.

RATING: 4
Innovative game.  The first half of the game is a fun exploration, but the second can be very confusing.  This game would be endlessly entertaining if the rules were written better--if it were more player friendly.

UPDATE: there is another, more updated set of rules, but I haven't played it yet; because of the last fiasco, I have nobody to play it with anymore...

RATING: 7
The stat trackers are definitely not well made and don't hold without some modification.

All in all, after a couple plays, it's a nicely themed game that can bring in a lot non hardcore gamers.  The main problem is keeping track of 4 different stats and especially how defeating it can be when a haunt starts early and no one has any gear.

Make sure someone is EXTREMELY familiar with the rules/interactions before starting, otherwise a lot of time will be wasted referencing the manual.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Having played only a few times, my impressions so far are very good.  Turn play goes quickly, as there is not too much decision-making on each player's part, especially before the Haunt is triggered.  There is huge variability from one game to the next, so replayability is very high.

The first few games go a little slow as rules are learned, as with most games.  However, you do not need a table of 4+ players who all know and understand the rules.  You can jump into play and learn as they go.

One complaint is the mismatch between the thin cardboard stock of the game pieces and the markers for each players' stats.  The fit is so poor that markers slide too easily or fall off entirely, so much that they are useless for keeping track of stats.  This can be fixed with a few layers of clear plastic tape, but it's a pita that owners shouldn't have to mess with.

RATING: 6
If they ever came out with a Betrayal 2.0 with improved rules and mechanics, I would probably be first in line to purchase it.  As it is, the game mechanics are so bad, that its hard for me to see past it.  Tales of Arabian Nights is more story than game as well, but it isn't a chore to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First phase (pre-haunt) is lengthy setup with little player agency.  Flip tile, flip card, do what card says.  Would be much more appealing if the first phase could be simulated, and the game started with the haunt.

Second phase (haunt) is more interesting but suffers from poor balance and unclear rules.  Some haunts randomly shut off certain attributes, which can feel bad.

Some effects (e.g. Lights Out) can basically eliminate players under certain circumstances.

Prone to quarterbacking after the haunt begins.

Have had such memorable experiences with this game.  One of those games that after the first play, the group wants to play it over again.  Plays like a lite-RPG part way through the game as a haunting scenario is revealed.

Some scenarios are clearly better than others (also dependent on how soon the haunt is revealed).  The ones that are good though have always led to good stories.  My only gripe is having to use an app for the individual characters as players need to fiddle around with a device to recheck stats.

Awesome game to break out at parties. I find Betrayal to be fairly simple to teach and play. It CAN get a little tricky for some newer players once you reach the haunt, but they learn quick. There are some small flaws, but nothing game breaking. Sometimes you'll find the traitor in a perfect position to win, but my game groups find this entertaining. My only real complaint is the stat sliders are very fiddly. I was able to get them to hold to the character cards better by putting a bit of Elmer's glue inside them (it wasn't perfect, but it worked). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cheesy?  Sure.  But the game is really fun and surprisingly replayable.  I wasn't expecting that from a story-driven game.  There is actually a good deal of depth and strategy to the game, and each Betrayal is different, forcing players to adapt.  I find that enjoyable.  My one strike against it is that it takes a long time to complete the game.  Which is fine in the sense that you have an enjoyable two hours with your friends, but for my group it means that we usually only play this game and then we're done.  Some of us have to get up before 6 am to go to work.  :(

This is a light game played mostly for its mood and theme rather than for any strategic challenge.  The balance can be thrown off by the number of players and random factors, but it can be a lot of fun to play with like-minded friends in a darkened room.  It's probably best to treat it like a light roleplaying experience.

I enjoy the exploration mechanic in this game and how tiles are randomly drawn so that the houses you create are different every time.  I also appreciate how many scenarios there are for when the traitor is revealed; it adds a lot of replay ability which is fantastic.

RATING: 7.5
Not always balanced. Haunt often comes too early without house ruling (we don't even roll for it until everyone has taken 2-3 turns). Having said that, this almost always brings a great response. Tons of fun. Great theme. Play it for the group experience and not the technical brilliance.

We played it once hoping for a clever game with strong theme and some cooperative/betrayal mechanics and got a very very simple dice rolling game. Perhaps we just got unlucky with our scenario, but afterward no one wanted to play it again and that is a very rare thing at our table.

RATING: 4.6
It's quite probably a good game. But I'm quite sure it's not for me. During the game I kept thinking how much more I'd like to play an Euro.
What doesn't seem to be very AT-specific though is that it has a very long set-up/exploring phase for a quite short and anticlimatic payoff where everything can go wrong or right depending on the luck of the previous long phase. It's really not a game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The first half is definitely a lot more fun than the second, because the focus is more on exploring the house than on defeating the traitor. I feel as though the game is heavily stacked against the traitor, and whoever is determined to be the traitor never seems to have as much fun. For example, one scenario calls for the players to battle the traitor and some enormous tentacles that appear in various rooms throughout the house. the only way for them to win is to use certain items that only appear in certain rooms. Rather than have to continue exploring the house to find them however, as soon as the haunt occurs those rooms are pulled out of the stack and added to the house. Inevitably the players have the tools they need to win within a turn or two and it's only a matter of time until the traitor is defeated.

I feel like this game is more fun if you don't play it frequently, otherwise it gets very frustrating to repeatedly fall into the same situation of defeating the traitor without them really being able to do anything about it. The best game that I participated in actually had a scenario with no traitor, so it was more like the first half of the game flowed smoothly into the second, rather than an abrupt shift.

Semi-cooperative, story-telling game. Basic game rules are easy, and pretty self-explanatory once started playing. The win conditions are different every game, though generally the heroes want to stop the traitor, and the traitor wants the heroes dead.
There are some complex edge cases, however, that requires more attention and explaining. Such cases are monster movements, item usage, speed effects, and more. It requires reading a lot of text, especially for the revealed traitor, thus English proficiency is recommended. 

Replay Value: 3, once you know the story (there are 50 of them), you know how to play against the opponent

Its Saturday night, wife has gone to sleep, nothing on TV. Time to play a game. This was my first solo run to learn the game. Really easy to pick up the rules. I just referred to the rules book as I went along.

So, Father Rhinehardt has persuaded Vivian and Heather to accompany him back to his childhood house, to re-live old times. During the exploration Vivian finds a dog and a young girl. Heather gets a few frights, and gets caught in a web for a while, until freed by Vivian.
Felt like I was in my own B movie. Rhinehardt triggers the haunt. Turns out he died in the house many years ago, and only has a living body due to a magical medallion in his possession. He wants the girls to join him in the afterlife. His batteries die in his flashlight so he can only move one room at a time. The girls managed to escape the sinking house.

Very easy to learn cooperative game with supernatural and horror-based quests. The game starts with the party wandering inside a creepy house, until one of his members betrays the whole group and starts to play against it with the help of evil figures. Many dice rolls involved, most of the fights are based on luck, which I find appropriate for this kind of game. It definitely isn't a german, really not my cup of tea. Boring and random.

RATING: 2.9
1st half of game (before betrayal occurs) is just silly in how random it is -- players have little to zero control in their decisions.  Then you have downtime as you have to stop playing for however long for both groups to read the scenario for the second half of the game. Only then does it have a chance to become mildly interesting -- but still has potential for player elimination. Ugh. 
UPDATE -- Talked into playing this twice more since I rated this a 4, with two different groups. Led me to reduce the rating to a 2.9.  Every game I played, the haunting was completely imbalanced towards one side.

RATING: N/A
My wife is absolutely obsessed with this game, it might be her favorite. I think it's a rough gem that would shine with better art and a more quick interesting pre-haunt phase. Once the haunt starts it's all great, it can get unbalanced depending on the state of the board but all scenarios are well written and interesting.

I was a bit skeptical about playing this game at first.  But after we started the first 'haunt', it was pure entertainment!  There was plenty of sheer ingenuity built into the scenarios.  Had fun, and couldn't wait to play again!  Neat game, but I could see it getting old after 10+ plays..

The haunt itself is intruiging, mainly meaning the very moment it occur but also the differences in information between the parties some missions give. I, as the traitor, may not know my own weakness. That’s the best part. And the only part. It’s really little more than a very extended setup, with no choice other than random stuff upstairs or random stuff downstairs. And after the haunt triggers, some (very lackluster) kind of gaming. Artwork is dreadful and I have actively disliked every character I’ve played. And sorting through all those awful chits as the bad guy, at least with the 1st edition... No, thanks.

At least most games don’t last all that long. Generally avoid this.

RATING: 9
Must be played with the right group. A lot of secrecy is necessary, so everyone must know the rules off my heart. Also, a certain acceptance of reading the rules alone is necessary for at least two people, and instructions are misinterpreted frequently. To fully enjoy the game, you need a smart group (no analysis/paralysis). Then the game is awesome!

RATING: 7
It's a neat, light exploration game which goes from "individual" gameplay and shifts into a "team/co-operative" style by rolling into a randomly determined monster scenario (of which there are 50 different types).  This is probably it's best feature, so depending upon which scenario/special monster turns up, and which player becomes the traitor, nearly every game is different with a different set of winning conditions.  The board tiles are modular so the haunted house is also different every time.  There is, with this kind of game, of course, a fair amount of randomness but also some "luck by preparation" as well.  This game reminds me a great deal of another haunted house tile-laying game, Chill Black Morn Manor, but this is much better as it's more balanced, rules are clearer/better and it is a cool "magic fun house" romp creating a fantastical haunted house with lots of fluff.  This may also possibly draw comparisons with Fury of Dracula and Buffy the Vampire Slayer games.  I really enjoy the quick gameplay and especially the theme as light games go.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite the horrible rule-set, this is a well themed game that is just a fun time to play.  Initially, everyone works together to power up their characters and explore the house but each time someone picks up an omen card, they roll dice and there is a chance that the haunt will begin (which generally means someone will then be acting as a traitor against everyone else).

I have to give big props to WOTC for replacing all of the cardboard components to fix the warped components that came with the game, free of charge. With that I can honestly say this game is a perfect 10.

Fun, relatively light, Horror-themed dungeon crawl.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I've enjoyed this game.  I can see how there could be significant game balance issues and replay might become a problem after frequent play but I appreciated the level of immersion into the theme that the game achieves with a relatively small ruleset.  After several plays, I can say that all of the complaints about balanced gameplay and how one spends the first half of the game doing little but exploring rooms waiting for something to happen are true.  Nevertheless I still enjoy the game very much and feel that it provides for a unique and interesting experience nonetheless.

Somewhere, under all those dice, there's a great game gasping to get out.  I love the house exploration, love the idea of special items, the traitor, and all the cool scenarios.  But I absolutely hate the COMPLEXITY of the game and all the stupid, tedious dice rolling.  "Enter room -- roll 8 dice to find out whether you fall through the floor.  You do!  Roll 8 dice to find out whether you escape."

Traded away after one play.  Was half-tempted to try and simplify the game into something like "Heroquest", but I'd rather just move on and play other games.

Excellently thematic game. The traitor mechanic is a huge bonus. The game mechanics are simple enough to teach to a non-gamer. Some of the components are poor quality though (I'm looking at you, plastic sliders). Comes with pre-painted minis, which are nice addition. This game has a big luck factor (you roll dice on everything), so if you don't like it, don't play this. Some of the scenarios are unbalanced, but in my opinion that is not the point of this game. I just can't take this game competitively. It's still an issue for people who like to test their skills against worthy foes. The novelty of the traitor mechanic wears off though, and after that you have a decent game with a fun gimmick.

I gave this a "7" based upon the game itself-mechanics.  However, I would give it a "1" based upon the quality.  I would tell anyone and everyone not to purchase this edition.  The cardboard is paper thin and warps to the point of being unplayable.  The clips used to mark player stats are too small to easily see the stat number and they fall off the cardboard.

The kids at the game club play this very often.  It has just the right mix of cooperation up to a point, and then BLAM it's the cooperative group trying to beat the traitor.  Once we got the errata problems out of the way (downloadable here), it became fun to play as it simulates so many classic horror movie stories.

A fun game for mid-level gamers.  Doesn't take too much teaching - new players can jump in pretty quickly, as it's cooperative at first.  

The little coffin-markers are terrible, though!  How were they not play tested?

And the fighting mechanics are a bit clumsy.

Love the multiple endings aspect of this one!

RATING: 7
Though this game is broken it's lots of fun and easy to teach. It's a great game or people who aren't really into board games or who are just getting into them. With all the various ways the board can be laid out this game will always be played out differently and the scenario will always seem different, even if you've already played it. It doesn't requires nearly zero strategy and can be played with divided attention.

RATING: 4
Played once with two players using a variant where each player controls two characters. The haunt that came up didn't work well for two people and kind of killed the game for us. 

Traded, but now have the itch to try it again after trying Arkham Horror. Unfortunately the OOP status gets high prices on Ebay.

The first half of the game you have no goal but to explore, and is pretty much random wandering and hoping for lucky card pulls. Things get interesting after the traitor is revealed and decisions and teamwork start to matter.

RATING: 8
The theme is strong and immersive, but the gameplay is very chaotic and random.
The first half of the game can be a bit long for new players, but it's a breeze later.
The scenarios are unbalanced, but really fun most of the time.
Don't take this game too seriously, just go with the flow and try to have some light fun.

RATING: 7
I own the original, orange-box edition, which is a fun-flavored tortilla that is filled with a bold theme, some spicy mechanics, and bitter, unmistakable failure. The game is great at core, but the haunts are clearly lacking in playtesting and copyediting, with shared rules not always shared between the Traitor and Heroes, impossible-to-win scenarios, and some just plain boring scenarios. I have played one game of the new black printing, which seems much improved; upgrading to that may just change my feelings.

RATING: 6.5
An entertaining take on the classic Haunted House movie. A really good storytelling game: interesting narratives and immersive play abounds. But when it comes to the haunts and selecting the traitor, BaHotH leaves a little wanting. It is so ehow unfulfilled. 

Oh, and threre are some serious game balance issues with some of the haunts
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Has a few balance issues, and tricky to introduce to some casual players as they may have trouble understanding how to play the Traitor, should they be it. 

Components are very poor quality, with plastic markers that are easily dislodged from the character sheets. 

That said, a fun game with nice variability. The theme is excellent, as is the flavour text for the various cards, and I never have a hard time finding people to play it. Always a fun game.

The beginning of this game suffers from a lack of direction, but the 50 scenarios adds a huge number of variety. I am probably biased about this game because it was one of the first "real" board games I played.

EDIT: After playing this again this game is definitely way too random and the huge amount of scenarios and modular board while adding variety makes it so it is easy for one side to have a large advantage over the other. Still gives a very good exploring a haunted house vibe, just don't take this game too seriously strategically.

If AH did something more with the game in the future I would look at it again and probably give it a few more rounds.

RATING: 1
Played this game a few times and it is the only game I've played and will not play again.  The first part where you are searching the rooms is ok.  Rather unimpressive and you don't get anything really neat.  The items don't help you very much for the second part.  Then you do the haunt, one person goes off and reads a story and the rest of the group reads a similar story.  The betrayer comes back and no one has any idea what is going on.  Nothing makes any sense, it is all very random and suddenly you'll die randomly.  You'll be tasked with something impossible and there is no fun to be had by anyone.  Stay far, far away from this game.

Another amazing thematic game, Betrayal is immersive and intense despite the occasional incredibly imbalanced scenario (the only time I was ever the betrayer, the scenario was literally unwinnable).

The expanding board is nice. I also like the story driven gameplay, and the fact that you can kill each other.

Kicked to the curb by Mansions of Madness. While I know Betrayal isn't moderated it's still a one versus many concept that delivers the same feel and the Mythos we know and love.

It's not bad the first few times you play it, but you'll get it overplayed quickly.  The exploration and map mechanics rule supreme, and often block out the lesser parts of the game: there is no game in the last act, everything is poorly written, and many tokens were really not needed.  Fun for something light but big.

The art/theme is a little bit... dark and dirty, and it seperate the adventure part and boss fighting parts, which is... non sense. If I win as a party, I didn't feel like winning, the same for losing and as a traitor too. This game is nothing compared to the Horror series.

Type: 3-6 players, half coop exploration, half traitor competitive board game.

Best With: 4-5 players
Weight: medium
Duration: 1-3 hours
Notes:
Traitor reads/interprets game rules alone in different room.
Role-play
Minor card reading.
Dice-and-stats combat

I really like this game, and works best with 4-5 players. The initial cooperative exploration half is pretty fun and flavorful with just enough tension and bite to keep things interesting.

The Haunt half, though, is super fun and varied as the rules change with every play. The downside, though, is if someone who isn't so good at reading and following rules on their own gets chosen as the traitor. That person needs to leave the room while the other discuss the other new rules in secret, and then all come back together to play the rest of the game out based on the new rules and goals. If someone doesn't get the new rules, the game breaks down pretty quickly and becomes less mystery and more just raw mechanics/race.

But with a group who can all handle consuming rules on their own, this game is crazy excellent.

Not unlike Arkham Horror, a storytelling exercise in the form of a game.  Maybe I had a good group, but the two times I played it, this was fun, fun, fun.  One game came down to the final roll in the final phase of the final turn.  The scenarios that we played were witty and inventive.  Unlike Arkham, you can't play solitaire, which is too bad.  But really, the game plays like a good pulp horror movie unspooling in your head.

This game has all kinds of dramatic, theatrical twists. Lots of flavor, although th ebits don't do the theme much justice... it's the text that does.  Speaking of which, it would rate MUCH HIGHER, if there weren't so many GAPING HOLES in the rulebook.

For the games potential with the very serious and numerous rules bugs worked out: 7.5.  With the rules as written: 5.5  Result: 6.5 overall.  I think I would consider it a 7 in the short term though, because it's still new to me.  Perhaps overtime it might drop.  

Certainly need to right crowd of people to make it work.

RATING: 8
One of the best 4-5 player games I have played. The game is easy to teach, simple, and full of theme. There is a decent element of luck here and some characters can get the raw end of the stick early on with the cards they draw. This game creates memorable stories that I still laugh about weeks later.  Each story is entirely different but all are fun and enjoyable. This game has a decent amount of reading and isn't appropriate for children. If you are a looking for a deep strategic game this isn't for you. If you like thematic game, however, there isn't a better one than this one.

You build a haunted mansion collectively in a cooperative mode.  Eventually there are a certain number of hauntings and one of the players will betray the others.  The rest of the loyal players must defeat the traitor.  There are a number of scenarios that you can play.

Betrayal for me came out of the mire of lukewarm reviews and shone pretty brightly. The length of the game is just right, the exploration is fun and has a good amount of peril without being frustrating, the endgame scenarios are nicely varied and interesting. 

The only caveat I can think of is this title can easily be overplayed. Maybe once or twice a year is as often as you'll want to bring it out, otherwise the surprises that make this game fun will quickly become old hat.

A very close second to Dead of Winter in terms of immersion and thematic draw. I love Betrayal. The cooperative-then-not concept is great, I love that everything just goes to hell and one player actually gets to control "hell." I love the exploration/board-creating mechanic too. Replayability is fantastic with 50-some different betrayer scenarios to play out, and of course a different map every time you play. The only real problems are that the rules can sometimes be "clunky," ESPECIALLY when you get to the haunt.

3/2006 A roleplaying game/board game cross over; and does a really good job of it.  I like the idea: "when the rules are not complete, improvise and roleplay".  Of cause, it requires players who follows the idea in order the keep the game flowing.

Theme is great, but what makes such a low marks is because

Clever game design that addresses the Alpha Player problem in an interesting way. Obviously, if you are looking for a skill-based competitive game this is not for you. This one is about the story and the experience.

The components and the artwork are quite poorly done, but when the story plays, you somewhat forgive. The scenarios are high quality and even though the replay value is not enormous, the sheer amount of stories that comes with the game easily makes up for that. Play it with the right crowd and you are in for a treat.

Betrayal (or BatHotH) is an interesting concept broken into two halves that ends up failing in the second one. The idea of exploring an old, haunted house is terrific thematically but the game bases this exploration around building up to 'the Haunt', which almost always turns out to be incredibly lame because it does not control for what happens in the first half. Haunts are either a complete rout of the players or a complete rout of the traitor with almost no in-between, which makes the game a foregone conclusion. It is not well-designed, but it is well-intentioned and can be fun if you're not picky about design or are looking for a low-complexity game.

Really the only thing I don't like about this game is the player elimination. But considering it doesn't take very long for the game to end after the haunt begins, it's not THAT big an issue.

Great game that is very thematic, HIGHLY re-playable and takes just a little over an hour.  The best part of this game is the haunt phase, I recommend shortening the early portion of the game by requiring a lower die threshold for the haunt.  My favorite horror-themed game.

4-6 players, 2-4 hours.

It's an experience game rather than strategy. We are exploring a haunted house to uncover its secret. With enough cunning and luck, we may even survive it!

Lots of flavour, luck of the die and manic running around the house.

Have only tried a 2P walk through of this so far.  We really liked the first stage of the game where you search and uncover the house and gain items.  The scenario we opened up was impossible to attempt with only 2P so we stopped there.  Will add more when we get a complete play through under our belts.

Edit:
Have played this with 4 players a few times and have really enjoyed it.  I really like how everyone works together until the haunt is triggered and then you just hope that somebody else is the traitor!  Although it is fun being the traitor and trying to kill everyone else before they can kill you.  Fantastic game with a lot of replayability.

Fun semi co-op oozing the horror theme. Basically has  every horror film / novel built in and a huge volume of stories. The story is triggered by failing a haunt dice roll in a certain room with a certain item which should mean you would have to play a lot of games to get the same story - Biggest gripe is that the character pieces to keep track of your stats are dreadful

Bien. 

Le fait de commencer calmement en explorant la maison et tout a`coup, la malédiction s'abat et un joueurs devient le traître, c'est très bien. Surtout qu'au début, personne ne sait qui sera le traître, le jeu réussi à nous le cacher tout le long!!!

Le seul défaut, la coupure qui survient lorsque le traître se dévoile! 

Par contre, à ce moment, le ju devient beaucoup plus stressant!

RATING: 6
Haunted house themed Ameritrash game made by the creators of D&D. The game starts as a co-op exploration of the house via laying unique tiles and drawing event/item/haunt cards. 

Once the haunt starts there will likely be a traitor with possible monsters. The haunts are flavorful and have a B-movie feel to them, so they are kind of funny. Unfortunately, some of the explanations of how specific haunts work are vague and this leads to confusion, especially if the traitor is a new player; in most cases, we try to play with whatever makes the most sense when the specific rules are lacking. In the end it doesn't really matter because most haunts are imbalanced (either towards the traitor or the heroes) and everything is determined by dice rolls.

Overall, this is a game that is fun and can really be enjoyed for the flavor as long as expectations of tight rules and balance are checked at the door.

RATING: 7
The game-content is OK, although the tiles for the House on the Hill are too think and wobbly; the miniatures are OK, but they lack the detail and finesse compared with other boardgames with miniatures;
the rules are excellent and very easy to learn and simple to be applied to the game;
the theme is caught nicely;
on our first game session we played a rather "boring" and in the end kind of unchallenging Haunt;
although the game is created to be played by 6 gamers, I wonder if 6 is not at least 1 too much; during the first half of the game you are supposed to develop and build up your character by searching and finding items and companions as well as raising the traits (aka attributes) of the character; with 6 characters you run short on the opportunity, and the Haunt gets started while not all characters are really developed - especially with the more challenging Haunts this may be too much of a trouble for the gamers? But here we lack the gaming experience, and this is only a certain pessimistic outlook of the game.

The rules can be a bit of a mess sometimes, especially when you're trying to figure out the stipulations of a Haunt, but I don't own any other game that's as easy for a 5-6 player group to get into and enjoy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great game provided you have the right group of people! The first time we played was late at night, and we read all the cards by torchlight and really got 'in' to the game.

The second time we played, with some other people, some of our group were getting bored waiting for their turn and didn't really 'get' the story.

If you can get in to the game, and the atmosphere, then it is great. If not, then not so much!

We haven't really had any problems with the rules yet (second edition). It has all made sense so far.

I can see there might be an issue if a more inexperienced gamer becomes the traitor - they might get very confused by all the extra rules that can come in to play during the haunt.

Overall I gave this 7.5 because we had such good fun on the first play-through, but I can see that it isn't for everyone.

Edit: Taking it down half a point because the balance in some (most?) of the haunts is a bit squiffy. Had a couple of cases now where it is literally impossible for one side to win. A little more care needs to be taken to balance up the haunts I think!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
good adventure style 
easy to walk new players along
random exploration, random events, and most importantly random betrayal and its following doom [insert rumble of thunder]
great with 4-5 people
also suprisingly fun with 2 players controlling 2 charactors (then switching to one betrayer and one good guys team)


gotta be in the mood for a light rpg to immerse yourself in, its not too long or complicated but you should want to get a campaign with a reason out of it.

If you like gloom and you'd live the same vibe with more substance this is EXACTLY what you'd want.
and if you have this game but you want something lighter in play ability go look up gloom

This game has so many problems, yet I still seem to enjoy it! The main issue is that the game will often end anticlimactically. However, you will -- every so often -- have a great game that comes down to the wire. The fact that the game has 50 (!) scenarios is cool: the downside is that implementing the scenario requires pausing the game in progress and reading a bunch of crap, much of which will be somewhat confusing. This can really kill the mood/momentum. 

But: theme! Oodles of it. Can be fun with the right (read: rowdy) group. Easy enough for casual gamers. Deeply flawed, but the theme, short play time, and occasional to-the-wire finish make up for it.

The replayability of this game is FANTASTIC. Each time, the game is quite different, and it's always so exciting to see which scenario will happen and what gameplay elements it will add. The biggest downside to this is that far too often, the scenario is HEAVILY in the favor of either the heroes or the traitor, and the opposing side has little to no chance of victory -- but I suppose that also has everything to do with random circumstance and luck.

     If you're in the mood for a very light game based on cheesy-horror movies, this is for you. There is a great variety of characters to play and items to acquire and loads of events from horror films are represented here.  The board is always different and so is the game. It really does play different every time even if played a hundred times in a row.  Unfortunately this game is all about luck.  Think Talisman but with a different board and quest every time, some teamwork and a haunted house theme.

In spite of a few wrinkles and the less than attractive counters, this is a wonderfully atmospheric game which we will play at least another 45 times to experience all scenarios.

RATING: 3.5
It's a fun idea, and the theme can be moderately entertaining, but it is not my thing.  I've played 5 or 6 games and the ratio of reading and discussing cards, rules, scenarios to actually making decisions and actually "playing" is just way off for me.  During the course of about an hour I'll only really make about 3 or 4 decisions, and they typically seem pretty meaningless.  On top of that, this is a game that can potentially knock a player out fairly early on.  So when that happens you're just watching other people read cards and discuss rules.  Zzzzzz.

The game that started my dive into board games. I love the story aspect of the game. While Eldritch Horror will be chosen above this one pretty much every time by me, it's still a great way to introduce non-gamers into the hobby.

RATING: 8

Looking for a simple game that all mystery and horror fans can play and enjoy? Probably you are in the right place. Betrayal at house on the Hill is an easy to learn game that offers 50 horror stories to play! Thus, no one can complain about the replayability of the game. Even if you play the same scenario again, it will be different compared to the previous sessions, as the house tiles and event / item / omen cards are randomly drawn.

In my turn I simply move my character from room to room. When I reveal a new room, I place a new house tile and I usually draw a card that matches the room’s symbol (omen, item or event). Then I follow what the card says and that’s it. It is common a card to ask for a check in one or more of my characterer’s traits, which are Might, Speed, Sanity and Knowledge. In such a case, I roll the corresponding number of dice and I see what happens depending on the result. The fun part begins when the haunting of the house is revealed. Every time a player draws an omen card, he have to make a haunt roll. This means that he rolls 6 dice (result 0-2 on each die) and if the sum is less than the total number of omen cards in play, then the haunting is revealed. One player becomes the traitor and his purpose is to kill the others or prevent them from put an end on the haunting, while the other players (survivors) are stuggling to survive and stop the evil plans. There are two books, one for the traitor, one for the survivors, which describe what is the story and what should be done by the players.

In order to enjoy this game, all players have to be in the right mood and like this horror / mystery stuff. I don’t recommend this game for players that want absolute control, as there are too many random elements. Sometimes a scenario is ruined by the game itself due to high randomness. For example, it may end too soon, even in the first or second turn after the haunting. My advice is not to take this game seriously and just play and see what happens like watching a movie but in this case the star is you!

Keep in mind that good knowledge of English is necessary by all players.

The perfect thematic game! The horror aspect is awesome. I would highly recommend you play this game with 4-5 players. Play starts as a cooperative game, and then the 'Haunt' begins!! One player then becomes the traitor. All the other players try to survive the house while exploring different rooms. Mean while the traitor attempts to defeat the players.
If you like Carcassonne, this is similar map building game. But way more involved and with Horror a la 'Call of chutulhu.
ENJOY!

Add on: The tile pieces warped badly as soon as I took them out of the punch out boards. I have received an email from WotC, they have told me they are sending me replacement tiles. If you own the game, and your tiles are warping email them for replacements. 

Update: Received new tiles to replace the warped ones. Everything is all good!

Granted this is based off of one play... but:
- Before the betrayal happens, I have no idea why I'm doing anything... 
- So my decisions feel pointless...
- Decisions are very limited (move... or move... or MOVE)
- Post betrayal, i feel like the bad guy just tries to run everyone down...

Needless to say this game disappointed me. Felt lifeless and flat.

This game is an instant classic. It defines the "betrayer" mechanic.
Good: Captures the horror themes very well. The haunts which occur are varied and interesting.
Bad: The characters aren't very well balanced. Bad luck can leave a character isolated or unable to assist. Poorly worded haunts can easily lead to confusion among players.
Bottom Line: I put this game in my list of games everyone should own.

I liked the game initially. I hate playing it now. I don't like to wait 20-30 minutes until the Haunt happens. I've come up with a variant that starts the game at the Haunt to speed things along and give the game an actual purpose in the early moments of the game.

I bought this when it was first released, and fortunately never ran into any of the scenarios that needed errata before the errata was posted.  Not a heavy game by any means, but it's all theme, and with the right group, it's a blast to play.

RATING: 7.1
The errata sheaf is pretty thick, but, with a little work, playable.  A good candidate for a Second Edition.

The traitor for our first go-round felt the game was imbalanced against the traitor, while recognizing that this was partially a function of which Haunt got drawn.  I think there was a bit more fortuity than he was aware of.  If the Crystal Ball had wound up in the hands of someone with low Sanity, we'd have had to waste time trading it off.  In addition, I was lucky to have the objective placed 3 spaces away when it came time to finish things.  Finally, if I'd rolled a room that hadn't been placed yet, we'd have had to waste time waiting for it to be drawn and placed.  The traitor did say he had fun playing it, and I definitely did.

I had a great time playing the game, with the right people is certainly a memorable experience.

RATING: 6
I wish we played this more often. Building the house and working up to the "traitor moment" are fun, and it's got great bits. My group can't stand it, though -- and I see their point.

Depending on the scenario that gets drawn, the game can essentially be over the moment the Traitor is revealed; that's kind of weak. But overall, I like it; it tries to do something interesting and different, even if it isn't 100% successful.

Ultimately, its problems, my group's distaste for it, and an abundance of problem-free games prompted me to sell this.

RATING: 8
Love this game, played it through with my games group and the next door neighbours about 6 times now and had a different scenario every time. Really easy to pick up as pretty much every rule change or instruction for playing is displayed on the item cards and scenarios you pick up through the game. What starts off as a co-operative adventure can very quickly become competitive. Currently considering buying the Widows Walk expansion as I enjoy the game despite only scratching the surface of end game outcomes.

Scores for this game are shocking me a bit.. the theme is great but I don't think this game is anywhere near worthy of it's current BGG spot (I know it's early .. needs more reviews)

This rating, granted, is only after 1 play. Thick theme (which is great) and ample opportunity for theatrics/voice-acting etc... make the game interesting and add flavor *BUT* the luck factor is HUGE.. and I was annoyed greatly when I was shut out of the game by being permanently blocked in a room (because the floor I was on was collapsing). So basically 2 people died (near instantly) to the Ghost .. 2 got blocked into the upstairs .. and 1 tried (in vain) to out-roll the ghost..

Perhaps it was my simple annoyance at having something cheesy happen (like blocking me into a room) .. but the dicefest that ensued was also aggravating to witness.

I'd play again though.. if others wished to.. especially if a different 'haunting' was played. Score could move .. or hold..

Got this game as a quicker Arkham Horror alternative and very happy with the results.  You gotta go in looking for a good story vs. a competitive game.  Once you are in the right mindset, however, it's easy to just have fun. 

Pros
- Replayability
- Simple rules which are expanded/broken as needed to keep in interesting.
- Tons of theme.

Cons
- Poor production values for the tiles.  (fixed with tile reissue)
- Intial house exploration can be slow if haunt is revealed late in the game.

Easy to teach if you don't have to deal with explaining all the minor details that usually never come up. The rules are pretty shitty in that they don't always agree with each other or totally ignore possible situations that come up with some frequency.

I just didn't jive with this game. Perhaps it was the group i was with, perhaps it was my complete dislike of the theme. But the sliders on your player cards fall right off, which drove me nuts, as it was critical to keep your player levels correct. I probably need to give this game another shot, but in my current subjective opinion, anytime i see this game all i can think is how bad i hate this game.

RATING: 6
Pretty decent party game, but dependent on the group.  Good cooperative game. It's our first "Arkham Horror" type game.  Interesting enough game for us to have anticipated its re-release in 2010.

EDIT 12/18/2013: If you're looking for a silly Scooby-Doo Mystery type game, and don't care about mechanical balance, then you may want to look into this one.  The scenarios are wildly unbalanced such that when the haunt is revealed it is rarely a surprise who wins.  However, it's great fun if you're in a quiet setting with only a few people and no other distractions.  I highly recommend really getting into the narrative of the story.

RATING: 6.9
I have a lot of problems with betrayal (like a lot!) but its appeal is pretty undeniable. I play with a lot of people who don't play a lot of games themselves, and literally everyone loves this game. Even when I feel it went on to long, didn't have very many actual decisions to make, and ended with a whisper rather than a bang, when I look around everyone seems to have had a good time, and it gets requested pretty often. the theme is fun and its really easy to play (for the most part). the first part of the game is spent aimlessly walking around, falling into various horror movie tropes (evil doll, ghost, collapsing floor, etc), and collecting items, weapons, and spooky items (omens). each time an omen is found, dice are rolled and if the number rolled is lower than the total number of omens found by all players then the second part of the game starts (the haunt). When the haunt starts one of the players is revealed to be a traitor, determined by the specific omen you found and which room of the house it was in. the traitor player goes into the other room with a special traitor book and reads how exactly they win this specific scenario, while the rest of the players do the same with their own book. most of the scenarios are just some kind of monster(s) trying to kill all the other players, but there are a few that are more interesting and complicated than that. It comes with 50 scenarios in the base game and another 50 in the expansion so there is lots of replay-ability, but because of the way the scenario is determined, its very possible (guaranteed) to end up playing a few of them many times before you've played them all.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the game, a motley crew arrive at an old creepy mansion and promptly decide to break the law, by trespassing when they enter uninvited.  The group explore the mansion trying to accomplish whatever the scenario dictates until eventually one member goes insane, or becomes demon possessed, or whatever the case, and turns on the others.  After that the traitor's goal diverges from the rest as that person tries to kill off the others, while they try to get out alive.

It's an interesting idea for a game, and pretty fun to play through.  The components are very good.  I especially like the pre-painted minis that represent the various characters.  As you explore the mansion you turn over thick cardboard squares that nicely depict the various rooms.  This mechanic ensures that the mansion will never be laid out exactly the same from one game to the next.

The game can grind to a halt for awhile, sometimes quite awhile, when the traitor is revealed.  When this happens that player, and the others, physically go their separate ways to read from different books to study what will be expected of them for the rest of the game.  After that everyone comes back to the table to continue play.

Overall, the game is fun, and usually not too lengthy to be a distraction.

I love this game's concept. The idea of building the mansion as you go is innovative, and makes for a unique experience almost every time you play. The miniatures (although not the greatest quality) are all colored, and varied (per character), which is a nice touch.

The rules... hmm... the rules, aren't too confusing. Well, okay... there is a little bit of a learning curve, I'd say. The strongest selling point for this game also happens to be its biggest flaw, in my opinion... the betrayer. Yes, the idea that one of the people you've been searching this maze-like mansion with suddenly turning against you is a BRILLIANT one. However, it's the execution that leaves a little to be desired. I appreciate the mechanic of a random betrayer appearing at any time, but that time could be faaaaaaaaaar into the game when everyone's stacked with equipment and stat boosts (including the traitor), or it could be your first turn... literally. The odds are EXTREMELY rare, yes, but I think I played a game where we'd gone around the circle of three players once, and on turn five we rolled the betrayal scenario. The game knows this is a possibility and has scenarios in place specifically to compensate for such an event, but it can still be rough.

Then there's the problem of actually becoming the betrayer. You leave the room to read from your "betrayal tome" while the other players discuss their strategy. So you read over the rules, and maybe it's just me, but some of them aren't exactly easy to understand. There's a certain level of ambiguity to what you're supposed to do, and since you have no idea what the survivors need, it's sometimes confusing since "A" isn't communicating with "B". And you can't really ask anyone for clarification, either. Maybe after enough times through, you figure you'll get the hang of it... but there's fifty different scenarios (not counting the additional fifty with the expansion), so there's going to be A LOT of learning, with little practice. The biggest issue is that if it's your very first time playing this game, and YOU end up as the betrayer... good fucking luck... you're going to need it.

Look, I don't want to come off like I hate this game, I actually like it a lot, it's just very unforgiving. I recommend it. And if you buy it, I HIGHLY recommend getting an insert. I found a great one at inserthere.me and it's made setup a lot easier. This game has like a THOUSAND tokens, most of which you will NEVER EVEN USE, and a lot of them have the same shape with only slightly varying color, so it's in your best interest to find a solution to sorting them out before you start a game.

RATING: 9
Betrayal is an atmospheric game of the highest order. Those seeking a hardcore strategy session should likely look elsewhere. Those seeking a good time romping through a B movie plot with your friends will have no end of entertainment. Sometimes when the haunt begins, one side will find themselves completely screwed. However, they likely won't care and even if they lose a new game will begin in earnest.

Too early to rate this, after only one play.  I think it has potential to be fun, once I have the rules down, but my wife was unfamiliar with, and didn't enjoy, the basic mechanic of rolling dice for everything (attacks, stat checks, events, etc.). Also, it didn't seem to be that much fun for two people.  Would probably be a lot better with 4-5 people willing really to get into the theme of the game (as my instinct tells me this is one in which the theme outshines, and has to outshine, the mechanics.)

I was really excited to play this game. Then I did. And it was way below my expectations.

RATING: 7
Good: 
It can be entertaining exploring a haunted mansion and see what happens to you and your friends as rooms are revealed. 

Finding items and powering up characters before the haunt feels rewarding. 

Because you don't know exactly when the haunt will happen there is a level of tension to the game leading up to the haunt.

Rooms are placed as the mansion is explored, and the haunt is determined by which character triggered it so each game is different.

Bad: 
The game is unbalanced to the point where some hunts feel broken. The haunt is when someone is changed to a super villain but the timing and power is a bit random. During the 3 plays of this game during 2 of them they started so early the heroes had little to no chance of overcoming the villain. 

When the haunt happens the gameplay comes to a stop, literally. People have to pull out manuals and see their win conditions, the villain has to go into another room and read up on their powers and their win condition. It can really kill the game's vibe altogether.

Haven't played enough rounds for the scenarios to repeat yet, will likely grab the expansion when we get that far.

This game is fairly random whether you feel like you've got a fair chance or not. The first game we ever played had to haunt start very early, with little room to move the heros were funnelled into a tunnel of tentacles and fairly swiftly came to their end.

However, if you're ok with a game that is very narrative, not a very competitive one, then it is a blast. Would highly recommend, with the more players the merrier.

It's a game that's far, *far* from perfect, but boy do we ever love playing it. If you're looking for a game with excellent balance and flawless mechanics, do not get Betrayal. But if you're looking for something that feels like you're in a campy b-movie horror flick, this is the game for you, and it certainly works for us. 

We like to play with some cheesy old creepy music in the background. Then, you get a random character and do an exaggerated character voice for it. All cards must be read in a "spoooooky" voice. And boom, a great time is had by all.

This is THE haunted house game. It is not perfect, definitely fiddly, and terrible components, but it is the best haunted house game around. The scenarios are fun, as is exploring the house, and I love the mid-game betrayer. If you can get past its imperfections, this is a fun, semi-coop, story-driven game.

Love the use of the traitor mechanic and the massive number of haunts.  Makes each game play out like a story.  And it's a different story every time.  The game can be heavily weighted towards one side or another in a lot of the haunts, and depending on how early the haunt starts, that bias can get even worse.

RATING: 8.5
Very unique amongst the games in my collection, it's like a cross between Mystery Mansion and HeroQuest without being as fiddly as the latter.  Scenarios are a clever way to set-up the gameplay and very well written.

Biggest downside's the whole player elimination angle, but the game plays fast enough that this isn't the kind of problem it is in, say, Risk.

One of my favorite purchases in '04.

RATING: 5
Rating based on a 5 player game. I went in thinking this was a game where "secretly, one of the characters betrays the rest of the party". Unfortunately nothing was in secret (except for special abilities). I don't see any value with playing as a team when randomly someone is going to trigger the haunting second phase by exploring a room. A big meh.

This is a game that I think really depends on the group. A good group may make up for the copious flaws of the game. It is extremely random with very few meaningful decisions to be made before the haunt begins. After the haunt begins, the place of the board and luck of card draws before the beginning of the haunt has more influence on the outcome than player decisions. You are along for the ride in this game, and if you don't have good passengers with you, it won't be very fun. To add to this, many of the scenarios are written so poorly that without looking at both books, you can't tell what the scenario rules are. The tiles are also about 30% bigger than they need to be. It takes way too much space to play this game.

This is a great cooperative game that builds a perfect horror film as you play.    The mechanics force players to separate into groups and explore the house in order to grow his/her character at the same time this makes the haunting more and more likely.  Highly recommend.

RATING: 6
This game is definitely fun. As someone who enjoys complex strategy, this game is also a decent bit inconsistent, and I'm not a huge fan of how significantly the rules change halfway through. That being said, if you're more concerned with the idea of running around a haunted house with friends to see what you find inside, then it's a game that won't disappoint. I recommend giving it a chance with theater of mind - that's how I find myself having the most fun.

RATING: 8.5
played it and loved it :) I do urban exploring so exploring an abandoned mansion room by room is right up my alley. What is behind this door? What is behind there? Love it. The fact that it is coop is great too. 

Ofcourse the beginning might seem like a luck fest, in the same way as "game of goose" (throw this, this happens etc) or "dungeons and dragons", but who cares, its the joyful exploring part that makes this part fun.

Yes the Haunts might seem imba, unfair etc and sometimes even broken but to the people who think this is really worriesome id just want to say, redefine what a game is supposed to mean. This is not as deep as Terra Mystica or whatever, but i would compare it more as Galaxy Trucker in an abandoned house + an exploring part instead of a building a ship part. You are exploring and building a house instead of a ship and see what happens with you. Storytelling in a box, i love it and my partner does too :D

played it 2 times more: GREAT, although one haunt felt flat the interaction is there :D love it, i love stories, i love this game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It has a large number of balance issues, weird rules interactions, and other problems - but damn if it isn't a fun time regardless.

The betrayer element can be a bit hairy though, especially if the game hasn't 'clicked' with new player that now finds themselves in a 1-vs-everyone-else situation.

Because of that, some games can be frustrating or not much fun, but when it all falls together, it creates some of the best 'story moments' board games have to offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros: Great theme, helps to capture the feel of old school haunted house movies, gameplay differs with each playthrough due to non-static mansion and varied 'haunts'.

Cons: If pre-haunt gameplay is too short or too long can make game feel rushed or draggy.

A difficult game to rate.  The mechanics don't create much depth or strategy, the rules have gaping holes, and there's a serious player elimination problem.  But the theme is insanely fun and perfectly captured by the scenarios.  And you never quite know what's going to happen....  All in all, I'd probably play this game 48 more times if I could (but unfortunately, it was not a hit with the group).

This game was an absolute blast to play.  It starts out somewhat like a cooperative dungeon-crawl game, but after a certain condition is triggered, a traitor is revealed, and the two separate teams of players must now compete to complete secret winning conditions.  Every game plays out differently, since the house layout is discovered randomly and the traitor and scenario are determined based on in-game conditions, which gives this game a ton of replay value.  I am concerned that the "secret" winning conditions could be easily remembered once all of the scenarios have been played several times, which would make the game far less exciting, but with 50 different scenarios to use, I can't imagine that this would become a problem until we'd played it many, many times.  While it's certainly not a strategy-heavy game, Betrayal is extremely fun to play, and it should be a long time before I ever tire of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fairly simple and atmospheric game.  I was anticipating an expansion fairly quickly.  However, the errata has gotten so extensive that I'm sure it warrants a new edition rather than just an expansion.

Game in a Nutshell: Explore a house creating a modular board as you go collecting items to potentially help you later on. Eventually something will happen and a trader amongst the group will emerge and a series of tasks are set so that eather the betrayer or cooperatives will rule the day.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: The sense of exploration created while playing brings tension with every turn. The different scenarios that occur when the betrayer is revealed are brilliant and well written. The co-op nature of the game made me care much less about the general randomness.

Cons: The game basically plays itself and takes the players on a ride. High on luck, low on important decisions. It'd be nice if the characters were fleshed out a little more other then a picture and some stats.

Other: I had a lot of fun playing this even though I didn't feel challenged or in control. Basically, I just loved the ride.

Best Use: A light-hearted haunting game of fun and the unexpected that's less mind-numbing then a strategy but more interactive then a movie.

More a game play experience than a true competitive game.  As a huge fan of horror movies and literature, I had to have this game despite the negative comments about the lack of editing in the haunt books (which are all true).  I have to say the theme and light hearted nature of the game more than make up for the fact you have to download an addendum to the rules for (almost) everything to make sense.  And they could have been a little more imaginative with the counters that represent the haunts instead of them all being plain text.  Still, it is fun and quick and you can usually get 2 involved games in under an hour.

So many wonderful possibilities and promises hidden within this game!  Unfortunately they just don't quite come to fruition.  I like the idea of the traitor and the diverging goals that happsn halfway through the game.  A few missions seem to handle this well and a few seem to easy or complicated for one side as to be laughable as a competition.  THis is a game I would play again though.  Just not incredibly high on my list.

This game is BRILLIANT, but it is also a mess.  It can produce spectacular experiences, but equally, it can generate disappointing let downs.

It will continue to make an appearance every October, and I'll never turn down a game, but this game feels like it should be a 10.  The promise is so great though, and it can truly deliver amazing fun and atmosphere.  Basically, the design is "fragile" and a bit antiquated.

Edit:  I bumped this a half point for Widow's Walk, which is fantastic.  It adds more variety, but changes the game quite a bit with a larger house and increased mobility. 
 It also adds another 50 Haunts.  On the down side, it can increase the length of the game due to the increased house size.

I've only played once, and I ended up as the traitor: Crimson Jack, the maniacal killer.

I enjoyed the game. It's got a great theme, and game play really flows. The rule book seems a little dense, but once you get into the game it all makes sense, and it's actually quite simple. I could easily see this moving up to an 8.

It appears, based on having read the rules and now having played once, that there is a luck element that can diminish the fun of certain scenarios. In my case, Crimson Jack rolled a 1, 2 and 2 on his movement dice and couldn't get in any early attacks. And the heroes had already found the weapon that killed him, so it turned out to be a romp for them. I think that's a minor criticism, but a criticism nevertheless. Probably a monster should have a minimum move in that situation.

Thanks to The Lone Gamer for trading this to me.

I loved this game, at first.  I thought the idea of varying stories, varying endings would give it so much variety, and the campy mansion out of a 1950s sci-fi movie was fun.  But I began to notice how easy it was for players to get knocked off the board early -- it's no fun to sit around and watch your friends play.  It's rare that anyone in the game gets to make any significant actions -- almost always, the jock character is the only one who gets to do anything, and everyone else sits around twiddling thumbs.

Great concept, awful execution.

Well, this is a mixed bag.  First of all, definite negative points for daring to be labeled an 'Avalon Hill' game.  Our scenario had lots of rules problems, and I had a character that lived WAY too long, running about the house pursued by demons while everyone else took naps.  On the other hand, it did have some nifty elements, and until the end of the game, I was having some fun.  Would play again, would not buy it myself.  Can dead people give their items to the living?

I have played this game about 5-6 times. I have loved it every time. It seems like a brand new game each time you play it.

It's like a kicked up game of clue. Definately a keeper!

This is a neat one. I love the exploration and variety of the game, and how the randomization options mean that when the time comes for your game about haunted houses to actually get, y'now, haunted, it comes as a surprise and keeps people engaged. The randomization does have its flaws, as the scenarios aren't exactly balanced and you'll always wind up with one guy as some sort of monster enchanted knight child while everyone else is running around blind and screaming, but it's a fun play, and what else can you ask?

RATING: 9
One of my favorite thematic games. So much replay value, great mechanics, great atmosphere, starts off as a co-op fun exploration RPG and ends as a horror-filled betrayal bloodfest.   As with many Ameritrash games, though, it's more about the story and experience than actually winning, so competitive Eurogamers will probably hate it, because the game's biggest issue is that it's very random and not particularly balanced.

The Haunts which give it a lot of variety and replayability also wreak havoc on balance, and some are just auto-losses for the Explorers while some are just plain bad for the Traitor.

I can see how some people would like this game but I found it a bit flat and too luck driven for my taste.  The scenarios really didn't pull me in and there wasn't enough control.  Oh, and need I even mention what a shoddy job they did with the rulebooks (see errata) not too mention the fairly poor components considering the game's price tag?  UPDATE: knocked down 1 point as there are just MUCH better cooperative games out these days where players can actually influence the outcome.

Instant love affair when I played it the first time. Then we spent quite some money on ebay before hearing about the reprint.

I greatly enjoy playing this with new players, without telling them what it's about. Needs some tweaking of picking traitor and haunt, but other than that it's been a success.

I give this game a low rating because you cannot play it if you don't know English. Not all of my friends read English, and unlike other games, like Settlers, where you can explain the cards, here you cannot play at all.

Only play if you don't take it seriously.  It's not balanced after "the haunt" occurs, and you typically can tell immediately which side will win/lose after a few plays, unless extreme luck changes it.  However, if you play this as a story with fun sound effects in a dim room with a soundtrack, it becomes way more fun.  Get into the story, but not winning/losing.

RATING: 4
I didn't really enjoy this game the couple of times I played it. The first half takes too long and seems aimless and the post-haunt half seems awkward and weirdly balanced. Additionally, each player's turn can take a while, leading to decent downtime between each player's turn. This game probably needs the right mood and the right group to make it work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Its a fun co-op which can be tense and with the right people in the right atmosphere can be spooky. Vaguely let down by the fact that the "haunt" can take awhile to get going and the secrets of survival and traitors tome really need to be read with the errata to make sense of it. But fun none the less

A dungeon crawl, the layout changes every game.  The actual goal(and mechanics involved in it) change from game to game.  Very high on the replayability due to these facts.  The core mechanics are good, but not great or amazing.  The game has a lot of choices made to benefit replay value and that give it some unique traits.  The theme is very well done, and ties in strong to the mechanics.  Plays in some ways like a light single session RPG session(probably Call of Cthulhu).  The entire group that played it wanted to play it again immediately afterwards, and if it hadn't been as late as it was,  there was desire for a third game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's generic B-horror film, the board game! Game play is based off of D&D-like skill checks (also similar to Arkham Horror). So far I've played two games (3 players each time), and each time it seemed like the heroes were completely out of their league against the traitor and his monster.

Nevertheless, delightfully fun game, especially if you get more into the role-playing and the theme.

OK, so Betrayal is not a deep strategic or competitive game, but for me anyways, it is an entertaining, light adventure/experience game that generally works well and often provides a good narrative.  Not every Haunt will be balanced and some may be less than entertaining, but if so, the group is only out 90 minutes.  I've suffered through much worse.

Of the adventure/rpg/boardgame hybrids that I've played (Arkham Horror, Runebound, Android, Fury of Dracula, Legends of Andor, Tales of the Arabian Nights), Betrayal is simpler and plays faster than other games in the genre.  The game's accessible nature means that it can be played with a wide range of gamers.

Might be a good game to breakout with kids.  I also like the co-op and traitor game mechanics which work well and thematically with the game.

With 50 available scenarios, Betrayal offers a good amount of replayability, and is a game that I hope to continue to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
All-in-all a fun game.

While the random nature can make for unbalanced situations, there are few games that match Betrayal in producing entertaining gaming memories.

More than a tad fiddly; slightly wonky (rules-wise); totally worth playing! Playing by candlelight is highly recommended if possible.

A more thematic game couldn't exist. Easy to play. Not too hard to teach and talk about replay ability. Over 100 scenarios with the expansion.  Components a good quality. Minis need produced well enough but slide outer need a lot of work. Not always heavy enough for me and much rely on dice rolls. That's why I need to be in the mood to play. That's why a 6.

RATING: 7
This is a really special game - it holds a unique place in my collection. It manages to create a perfect atmosphere within an hour or hour and a half timeframe. The artwork is simplistic, yet well made and very evocative. The scenarios are exquisitely written and provide for a different game each time - both storywise and regarding mechanics.

The big problem with it is the quality of components though. Room tiles and character sheets are made of thin cardboard and become warped, and the characteristics sliders are loose and inaccurate. The cards are very thin, and some of them even seem slightly worn even straight from the box. I don't find this to influence my game experience, but have still reduced my overall rating of the game for poor production values.

Had it been manufactured in better quality, it would have been a 9 or 10 for me - I'm very happy to have this game in my collection!

RATING: 2
Wow, I don't get it. The first half of the game is wandering aimlessly around the house with no purpose. The "intermission" basically amounts to a second reading of the rules (every time you play!). The second half, depending on which mission you are randomly running, may or may not have clear goals. The win and loss conditions are still likely a mystery and you stumble about the house swinging wildly while the super powerful traitor and, at times, the house itself, continually knocks you down.

It sounds good on paper and both the story and the frame of individual missions are interesting and clever, but the gameplay is terrible. It's 100% theme. It's too long and slow. It's boring.

The others in my group love this game yet I find myself having no desire to play it.  I don't exactly dislike it, but I am not drawn to it at all.  I also fail to understand why there needs to be 200 stupid little tokens made for the game in half a dozen colors.  None of them have pictures, only a word stating what the token is for.  We have literally spent 5-10 minutes clawing through the pile of chits to find the ONE token that says DOG or MUMMY or RANDOM DUMB THING that the scenario says to use.  For crying out loud, considering the lack of any kind of graphics that make it actually resemble anything, they might as well have saved you the time and space in the box by just printing out a dozen chits that say REQUIRED SCENARIO OBJECT #5 or some such.

Lots of luck and player interaction combined with gobs of theme make for a very fun, relatively quick and light adventure game.

Players all start out on the same team, but then at some un-predetermined point one of the players becomes the enemy.  Both sides read a separate rule book that explains the scenario (something like 50 are written), and the game continues.

Great fun, but it can't be taken too seriously.

I enjoy the haunted theme of this game. The haunts so far have seemed to tipped the favor of one side over the other, which isn't really important to myself but can't say the same for others.

More of an experience than a game, you have to not really care who wins or that you're just wandering for half the game. Broken scenarios and far too many chits that look exactly alike abound, but if you can overlook all of that it's kind of a hoot to see the crazy, B-movie horror tropes you encounter. Not for everyone, but it works for me as a cinema (and game) lover.

I've only played it once, and after the Betrayer was revealed, the game was over pretty quickly. I'm sure there's more to the game, but it seemed to be a lot of anticipation and set-up for very little reward.

Only played it once at FLGS.  I guess I had a run of bad luck since my guy kept getting bitten, smelling rotten things, or running into men on fire.  The omens were amusing though, although the actual quest seemed a bit too easy (this might be due to the fact that the other people were all experienced players).  My SO got toasted by the dragon and was upset since she was the only one that died!  Good components especially the character cards with the dials.

After a few more plays, I'm forced to drop my rating.  The different end-game scenarios are interesting, but this game just doesn't do it for me.  You basically run around, read haunts, and then you play an end-game scenario.  UGHHHHH.  Boring.

Betrayal is an interesting game, that much can be certain. It offers a lot in terms of replayability but the random encounter factor can be a bit tiring. Sometimes you want to play out a specific scenario, just to see what happens. I do have to say that I enjoy a game that gives good service to tropes and no matter where you end up there is a good tension amongst the players. I just wish it wasn't as frustrating to play the game you want.

Meh, kinda. Cooperative until a triggering event, then various forms of upsets, including one player's betrayal. In my (so far) first and only game, a giant bird carried the house away and everyone had to fight over parachutes, of which there were only enough for half of the players.

The only real drawback for Betrayal is that the sheer number of different types of tokens and monsters and obstacles gets difficult to manage.

For some reason every time I've played this game, I've been the traitor. This is NOT an exaggeration. I've played it at least 10-15 times (before I started logging plays), and have never not been the traitor. Talk about spooky...

After going quite a while without playing this, and realizing that my game group just doesn't care for it, it was time to say goodbye to it. There are other, shorter, less-fiddly, more exciting games that capture the same theme.

Fun game.  Haunted house.  Co-op that turns into most players vs. traitor.  Lots of fiddly bits that can be hard to keep track of.  The attribute clips on the player board are terrible; they often slide around and won't stay in place.

I love the theme, but I have a hard time getting other players interested in the game enough to make it a good time.  I'd like to try a few more times, and this rating may change, but as it stands  there is just a little too much of "draw card, read action". The whole first half of the game is a little unfocused and repetitive, and when the latter half comes around, the players I've played with have been too tired or disengaged to keep the game kicking

This is definitely my favorite game (as of 6/05).  The fact that you go from working together as a team to explore this house, to a betrayer vs. everyone else scenario is what makes this game so much fun.  I've played a bunch of times, and only once has the betrayer been victorious (and that happened to be when I was the betrayer).  Great game all around.  It's a shame they released it before they got all the kinks worked out.  Having to check the many pages of errata can be annoying.

+2 immersive, descriptive, thematic 
+1 makes for great 'collaborative storytelling' - leading to yelps and giggles and banter. 
+1 huge replayability with lots of different scenarios 
+1 despite a lack of strategic depth and high luck factor; there's still an RPG "I can save the day with my cool gear and stats" factor which is enjoyable. 

-1 for such a big-box game, it is very light on strategy. 
-2 Rules can be frustratingly vague. (Broadly forgivable for a 'storytelling' game, but if you're the traitor, trying to figure out a confusing, conflicting rulebook on your own, in a 'everyone vs me' situation can be upsetting/stressful for some newer/shyer players...and can eventually lead to a rules lawyering, unimmersive anticlimax) 

This game is enjoyable how DnD is enjoyable: Collaborative storytelling. Not for rules lawyers or shy, but With "rule of cool", it can be awesome.

RATING: 7
Absolutely loving this game. The paranoia of the early game is great.  The early game starts remarkably selfish with players wanting to be near, but not too near other players in case the haunt begins.  Then the haunt turns it into an all vs. one game and the fight begins!

RATING: 8
Great, somewhat light game with pretty good story telling and rpg aspects. Good introduction to storytelling rpg. Not too serious, so makes a good party game. Decent replayability but some of the scenarios are lopsided (recommend nudging the rules in one direction or the other to try and balance) or kind of drudgy. Good fun, win or lose.

Loved playing this game each time. My biggest reservation is that in my games the "traitors" have often been the weakest rule decipherers. The double blind process is interesting, but I wish it were more clear what each side knew right off. I think multiple plays help, but they don't clarify. So far, the traitor has never won in 5 games.

Rating may go up after I download and read the expanded FAQ for this game.  We enjoyed our first play of the game but things did slow down a couple of times as we couldn't come to a group decision on how to handle a couple of unexplained situations.  We likely will play this at least once a year around Halloween.

I love the theme of this game.  I enjoy how the house reveals itself as you explore and it is fun to slightly dread each omen card that comes up.  I don't like the betrayal part quite as well.  In our group it takes a long time to figure out the rules for the betrayal section and I have never seen the betrayer win yet. (3 plays)  It is thematic fun but I wish that the betrayer had someone else to bounce the rules off of, it can get confusing when you are by yourself, trying to figure things out in a short period of time.  Ah well, practice makes perfect.

Horrible experience, tabletop really sold this one, but it fell horribly flat for me. Will probably take awhile before I play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not without its' faults, but still a fun game to play with a group. As others have mentioned, some of the haunts seem a tad broken. This can be overcome if your willing to make up your own house rules (which might be a turnoff for some players). All in all, still a rather enjoyable experience.

One another note. The plastic "clips" that are supposed to keep track of your stats have a tendency to bee too large and won't stay in place. I was able to remedy this by dipping each one in boiling water and "pinching" them with tweezers until the openings were smaller (thus making their grip tighter).

I have the 2010 2nd Edition.

Like a combination of Mansions of Madness and Zombies!!!, BaHotH is surprisingly lighter weight then it looks and plays relatively straightforward from the first game.

Most of the mechanics and difficulty level relies heavily on luck, so Eurogamers better look the other way and go back to counting their cubes, but if you enjoy theme over strategy then you might like this.

Love the modular house and Haunt/Betrayal feature. 

Unfortunately I find getting a game in quite difficult, as my serious group were initially put off when a scenario rule broke logic (they drowned whilst in a boat) whilst my casual group don't like the responsibility of being the traitor, and can't handle their own unique set of rules when the Haunt starts.

I really like this game a lot. However, it does seem skewed in favor of the players or the betrayer most of the time. What keeps it from perfection is the imbalance in the given scenarios. I would look for alternate ones online.

RATING: 9
Played once.  I really like 1 vs many games but sometimes it's tough to determine who is the 1.  I really liked how everyone works on the same team to explore the house until that key moment when 1 person is revealed as the betrayer and the entire game changes.

I ended up being the betrayer in my first game and was quickly killed but I managed to get enough in place that the outcome was determined by a single turn.  I really want to get this one back on the table.

This is a great game of exploration and betrayal.  It is fun to run around finding things and waiting to see which of your friends is about to turn on you.  Haven't run out of new scenarios yet, but I am sure it won't be as fun once you don't have any new scenarios to play.  But the game comes with a decent number of scenarios, so you won't run out anytime soon.

A ton of story and fun packed into 60 minutes of play. Atmospheric. We always get into character creeping around the old house... waiting for the betrayal.

The two phases of the game - set up/exploration and betrayal/action - mesh very well. You get that tense build up each game. 

With 50 scenarios, I've only scratched the surface with this one. But I've already seen a wide variety. It's just plain fun not to know whether this time the players will all be fighting each other, on teams, or one against many. I won't ruin any the scenarios but each is interesting and unique.

The clips to keep track of your stats suck, though. Really bad. They never stay on.

Played: About 12 times.

I liked the simpleness of it: you can basically start to play right away, whilst listening to the rules. Nice looks and there's even some tactics. The right kind of mood and atmosphere would no doubt make it better; we had glaring lights and bleak communal hobby room surroundings.

With the right audience, this is a relatively quick, fun, and thematic game.  I don't recommend back to back sessions - but whip it out once in a while with a small group and you'll have a blast playing through 50 of what i can only appreciably summarize as classical b-movie horror stories.  It's these horror adventure stories that really make the game a lot of fun.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game consists of two phases the first phase being rolling the dice and randomly exploring the house. At some point during the game based on a dice roll you randomly come across the 2nd phase of the game. During this phase the real fun starts and there is some random scenario. The scenarios are quite interesting - some are really cool like one person turns into a zombie lord and starts summoning and controlling zombies to attack everyone else, while others we found to be rather stupid. We had one guy turn invisible (meaning we didn't know where he was) and then he just threw dynamite at everyone and killed them from afar. 

This game is best played with the casual crowd, as it can be a lot of fun with random events happening - Our one friend fell down into the basement and died there 3 games in a row...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A lot of fun with the right group. The only real downside is that the pre-haunt game can sometimes feel like an extended, going-through-the-motions setup for the true game that comes when the traitor is revealed.

RATING: 7
After playing several times, the first half of the game is completely bland and tedious. The haunt phase is sometimes a blast, but at other times it's extremely unbalanced and anticlimactic -- to the point where the story/rpg element can't compensate for it.

The more I play, the more bugs I find. (I started out giving this game a 9 -- over time I gradually deducted points for various reasons. Guess it doesn't stand the test of time.)

Still willing to try again with newbies, because it's a blast the first few plays.

EDIT: OK I played the new edition once and it's less buggy! Woohoo. Had fun, but the haunt phase was very unbalanced again. I guess that's just how it goes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love the idea, but was sadly underwhelmed by two things. Firstly, the components for keeping track of your character's stat changes (of which there are *a lot*) were completely worthless. A phone app was needed as supplement which is just dumb. But I heard something about the components being fixed in another edition? But secondly, the scenario we got seemed extremely luck-based. The bad guy was given a monster which he couldn't control, he had to toss dice to see where it went, and his goal was to kill all the other players. He managed to do almost nothing and the good guys quickly won. Still, I'd be willing to play again, just on account of there being so many scenarios.

Really fun and tons of replay-ability.  You are a group of adventurers exploring a haunted mansion (building it as players as you go along so it's always different) only to find that one of the adventurers lured the rest their to kill them.  Each game you will play one of fifty different scenarios.  My only complaint of the game is some scenarios are unbalanced unless a player or two has a specific item.  Some of them also seem overly complicated and the game could do well with an errata.  Beyond that, I have never not had fun playing it.  Best with 5-6 players.

Ameristrash con olor antiguo, mueves a una nueva habitación, sacas la carta que te indique dicha localización y haces lo que te pone en ella. A mitad de partida uno de los jugadores será el malo y todos lucharán contra él. La gracia es que hay muchas tramas que dependen de la carta y la localización donde activaste esta segunda parte del juego. Estas tramas están sacadas de películas de serie B, e incluso Z. Nos salió la trama de La Masa Devoradora (The Blob), esa misma noche me puse a verla.

This game oozes atmosphere!  Unfortunately the game itself has many flaws in the sense that the rules nowhere near cover the majority of the situations that arise.  Nothing that can't be fixed by some small rules patchings while playing, but I can imagine this to be not to the liking of most people.  Me I don't mind, I just like the mood and so play it regularly as an evening ender, just to wind down...  Be sure to grab the FAQs though, and check every scenario if it has an errata!

Good game , the randomly generating map and random game objective/ traitor reveal makes up for many game sessions and you will probably never play the same game twice.
But having to learn new rules for each scenario ends up making a mess of the rules on the second half of the game, it is confusing for both new and experienced players and sometimes, depending on the house layout, makes the game so unfair for the traitor or the survivors.

Yes, the rules can be impenetrable. Yes, you should have at least a couple of experienced players to play the haunt and stay with the group. Yes, it is entirely possible to memorize solutions to scenarios. It's terrible at low player counts. And I love it and play it every chance I get.

Barely a game, and there are times when it is barely fun.  With that being said, you really have no idea what will happen when you play this game, and are almost guaranteed to have a memorable experience when the haunt occurs.

It's like Resident Evil mixed with Scooby Doo, and I really enjoy it.  It's the type of game that I'll keep in my collection even though it rarely makes it to the table.  Just playing it once every Halloween would be enough for me!

I love to play this game, but sadly nobody in my family or friend group likes it, it is too long for them!  I love the thematics and how they work with this tile-laying theme.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite games. It's decently fun until the haunt starts and then all Hell breaks loose! Suddenly you have a battle of survival or Betrayal. and it's crazy fun! This game is like an hour long RPG, where you end up having stories to tell later on, rather than just victory point conditions. With 50 scenarios, you won't get sick of this for a long time!

My only very small caveat is that some scenarios felt lack luster and were a bit of a let down. Even on those games I still had fun.

The mechanic of this game is... almost none existent. It's a simple roll and move game disguised as something much more complex; but the theme is so strong that, for me, it holds it all together very well! The haunt feature half way through really makes it interesting and pits one player against the rest. I really quite like it, but it only works as much as you get in to it: Do voices. Get in to character. Curse people's souls as they push you in to a pit to hell. It's everything you want from a family game.

Well, Wizards replaced my whole set of tiles because they were badly warped (and a few were damaged). So now I have a pristine set again! :)

Other than that, it's a fairly OK game. The big number of scenarios, coupled with a random selector of the scenario means you get a good amount of replayability.

Not terribly complex, but it could have used more scenarios with hidden traitors. Would increase the tension at the table a good amount.

As it stands, 6.5 feels just right following the BGG grading scale.

- Update: I have other and better games with traitor mechanics by now. Dropping this to a 5.5. Likely will leave my collection

AWESOME! IT WAS HILARIOUS

RATING: 3
Rated based on just one play, so may not have gotten the best out of it, but it just seemed completely random...

You have no aim before the haunt - you're just wondering around exploring rooms which either give you a good thing, or a bad thing, or nothing - for no apparent reason!

Then the haunt happens, and it's a race to see if you can survive or not (depending on which haunt it is I guess).  The traitor mechanic seems shoe-horned in.

The theme doesn't come out AT ALL.  It was just utterly, utterly dull.  And considering all the other players are RGPers and LARPers, I'd have expected a lot more role playing, but it just didn't come out.

Poor game, which I'd never want to voluntarily play again.

Not a bad simple intro game, but at the same time there are some ambiguities in the rules that can make things confusing.  If you do not take the game too seriously it is a good time, but if you are looking for a well polished game this may not be the one to look at.  I ended up giving my copy to a friend who enjoyed it more than I did.

This is an evergreen. There will be some scenarios you won't like, there will be some you really love, but each game is a new adventure and it's that turning over of a new leaf that keeps me and my friends coming back to it.

Played this game for the first time at Gencon and had a blast.  Really enjoy the theme of this game, and I'm partial to exploration types of games.  My pre-teen daughter likes the suspenful exploration part of this game, and I like the mechanism of one player becoming a "traitor" which switches the game from exploration to tactical combat, which is such great pacing (i.e., suspense to action)!  Have to say, though, that the game spooks my younger daughter (8.75).  I've only played 5 of the scenarios, and I could see how repeating scenarios would get old.  The rules are also pretty confusing even with the updated pdfs.  I imagine that this game will fall to a solid 7 with time -- pulled out mainly around Halloween.

RATING: 8
Horrifically fun and simple scenario-based game that thrives on storytelling-oriented gamers. Really a box of gameplay ideas in a haunted-house scenario. Won't win any awards for its design, but boy-o-boy is this a fun game with any crowd.

RATING: 6.5
Players are a character with hit points on might, sanity, knowledge and speed. Players are exploring a haunted house, building the house with tile draws, until a "haunt" begins, then one player becomes a traitor. The victory conditions then depend on the haunt scenario, but usually involve killing off the traitor for the rest of the players or if you are the traitor, killing everyone else off. It's a fun, campy game and if you are young and impressionable, you are bound to like the game. However, the rules do not appear to be very clear in some of the scenarios, so you may have to make up the rules as you go along. Some neat ideas, too bad the execution of the ideas wasn't worked out in detail.

RATING: 8.3
I have the remake and I like it a lot. Well produced (though not good enough for the price tag in component quality its still worth it overall)

Makes for an easy to play, roleplaying experience that is high in luck, high in fun, fast-paced, takes little time, offers a lot of diversity thanks to the wonderful variety of scenarios and wonderful fluff. Probably the best halloween game and a very good novelty game. It's not one for taking out every week but it's certainly fun to pull out for a nice easy but spooky time every once in a while and for casual or non-gamers.

This is not a game I would pull out unless I was playing with young people, casual gamers, or had a large group such as 6 players who wanted to play a proper thematic board game (not resistance or something) but there were definitely players who wouldn't understand something more complex than this. It's highly luck but still a lot of fun and a good game.

If you enjoy a narrative and social time with board games you will like this game (thus ignore my rating). Not for me or many others however; minimal to no meaningful decisions to be made that exert control over the game. More just roll with it and see what happens. I'll try these games but won't seek them out in any way, I usually can't stand them (my personal subjective rating would be 1). Similar to and equal in experience with Dead Winter.

A bit too swingy and random with too much downtime but love the square tiles and exploration and feeling of excitement of adventure. Love the omens and different scenarios and items and events, just wish the gameplay was more balanced and less random

Played again and felt like the scenario was a bit better balanced but not crazy on the number of rules checks necessary. But I really enjoyed the narrative behind the game (locked myself in the elevator with the murderer and activated the music box to trap him with me - it makes a nice little story). Im also still not a fan of players being eliminated and waiting out in games though, personally.

I have now played this game quite a few times. Less than 20, but more than 15.  This game is still very fun.  Some of the cards and rooms have become a little too well known to me, but the scenarios are all so different that the game is different every time I play.  This game is an incredible "gateway" game to introduce to non-gamers, as I have found that everyone of them so far has become horribly addicted to it.  Gamers, for the most part, also find this game very amusing and fun.  Since the game often takes only around 45 minutes, several games can be played in one sitting.

Fun, atmospheric game that you play for the story, not the strategy.  It's like grabbing one of those odd-shaped assorted chocolates you've not tried before;  is it going to be filled with your favorite flavor, or one that makes you cringe?  Doesn't really matter, because soon you'll be reaching into the box again hoping for either a repeat performance or a better one.  

Average component quality costs this game a star;  amount of story variations gains it back (don't forget to check on BGG files for additional stories).

50 games in one. I had to try a horror game with this much versatility and I wasn't disappointed. I play this game every chance I get, because no matter how many times I play it, there is always something new in it. Who is the traitor, what does he want and how do we prevent it. Even after playing it for months, I have been surprised at the ingeniuety of the scenarios, and how different they all are, so every game really is something new. And if you should happen to get a haunt you've tried before, chances are that you have forgotten most of it since the last time because there are so many. My thumbs up to this game (so far the only one i've rated 10), and I hope there are going to many expansions in the future. The one cloud in the silver lining is that you need to download the FAQ's to play it properly, but that is a minor detail.

This may be less replayable at some point, once we've seen most of the haunts. For now, though, fantastic.

Main strength: Total Randomness. You don't know who the traitor is, what scenario you're playing, or the layout of the mansion when you start. Even if you'd replay a haunt, the random placement of tiles and characters would still make it different.
Main weaknes: Total Randomness. Sometimes the random placement of tiles and characters can lead to very short and one sided games...
As a side note; I have the revised version of the haunt books. Without those, I suppose the score would drop one point. Also, I have a summary of all the markers in the game (made my some nice fellow here at BGG). Without that, I'd drop the score one more point...

Though there are many other examples, this is the first game I think of when someone says "tile placement". Betrayal also instantly evokes Scooby-Doo for many of us across a certain age group.. and the betrayer mechanic just adds that much more to the mix. My grading of this game is highly linked to my appreciation of the theme, but as many have noted, there are quirks in the mechanics. This is especially true in how the betrayal aspect can play out. The general consensus seems to be that the “Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate” smooths this element out.

Fun, light and reasonably simple game. First half is really about running round exploring and trying to "buff" your character before the haunt arrives.

After the haunt arrives you are trying to complete your objective with incomplete information (you don't know what the other team/player knows) which is interesting and can lead to some nice opportunities for misinformation.

Mindless Fun. Everything is dictated by the dice role. Just play it for the theme and the story and you will be fine.

RATING: 4
What Betrayal At House On The Hill tries to be is the Swiss Army Knife of horror games. It wants to be 50 horror movies in a box, and at first glance it seems to have that potential. Seeing tokens titled 'Blob', or 'Dracula' or 'Spores' gets the imagination churning. The choice of playable characters, plus the randomness of the room placement, Event/Item/Omen draws, and the Haunts allows for millions of potential variations (no hyperbole).  The randomness of where tiles are placed makes each mansion unique and artistic and exploring the old house is like being the Scooby-Doo gang, you can just picture The Mystery Machine parked out front.

But the game is almost unplayable when the Haunt begins. The instructions feel like they are lacking vital pieces of information required to execute a successful Haunt, making the game confusing, or downright impossible, to understand. 

Also, I wish there were miniatures instead of cardboard for most of the components, even though that would have jacked the price up. Oh, and the character artwork sucks pretty hard.

This game was just OK for the first half while you are waiting for the story to develop.  It was pretty cool not knowing where the story was going until the 'other shoe drops', but even after that, it felt a bit random and not all that much fun for me.

Remember fun?  Remember what fun was?  Remember when you could just lose yourself in an experience and not worry about things like elegance and component quality and the Jones Theory?  Betrayal is simply fun.  And that's a thing in short supply these days.

RATING: 8
This is a fun, simple dungeon crawler. Not a ton of strategy, since you are pretty much told exactly what you'll need to do (feels more like a scavenger hunt), but it's still fun.

Game 1: Played as Flash. Wound up being the traitor and needed to open up a demonic gate. Result: beaten to death by animate statue.

Game 2: Played as the Prof. As part of the good team, need to use the special Ring to defeat the Demon Lord. Result: beaten to death by five demons plus the traitor.

---Preliminary thoughts---
Cooperative with a traitor (like Shadows over Camelot of Galactica)

The theme is very similar to Mansions of Madness, but the evil player (traitor in this case) is not revealed until after 30 minutes of play, when players have geared up exploring the house.

I like the tile system allowing very different houses each time you play. Also, there's 50 different haunts (adventures) -> replayability is high.

Components are nice, but no way as great as in Mansions of Madness.

The biggest drawback 30 half an hour, where you wander aimlessly through the house. This and the components make me prefer Mansions of Madness over this game.

For cooperative with traitor games, I prefer both Galactica and Mansions over Madness. It's not a bad game, but it's one I would not play, because I have better ones.

Fun, silly. Decent enough game and worth the 1-2 hours it takes to play. Matches the theme well. It is a game that I find I enjoy more with each play, especially if all the components are bagged (there are nearly a half-ton of small chits in this game).

When I first tried it, my initial thought was "won't the number of scenarios restrict the replay value?" The answer has, so far, been no. The game's silly immersion into the depths of creepy horror and morphing board design make this a different game each time. I find that you get a lot for your money with this one.

Grandioso juego!Además de tenerle gran cariño por ser el primer juego de tablero que me compré, reconozco que he disfrutado muchísimo con cada partida que he hecho. Me encanta ir descubriendo habitaciones, armas, encuentros y luego, cuando parece que lo tienes todo controlado, todo cambia y entra en acción la maldición! Nunca sabes quién puede ser el malo de la película y eso, al menos para mi, le da mucha chicha. Y luego, las historias... un gran homenaje a las pelis de terror de serie B de toda la vida... momias, vampiros, mad doctors, fantasmas... hace años que estoy esperando algun tipo de expansión pero de momento parece que no se animanBueno, como podeis ver, este es MI JUEGO, sin dudarlo un instante!

This is a fun game, but it has a lot of great competition ([i]LNOE[/i] et al) and it rarely gets to the table. I think the game length is almost perfect for the genre.

I love the theme of this game. The campy B horror scenarios. The game uses a modulated board so depending on the scenarios the game can be super easy to win or super easy to loss.

I like it alot. Easy to grasp, simple dungeon crawl rules and mechanics paired with very nice horror scenarios and a nice traitor twist (in most scenarios) which turns the game to an assymetric fight for survival midgame. Good pace and length to the game too as it is not too long to mix into a normal game night with 2-3 other games.

RATING: 8
We always have a lot of fun playing this one. It's relatively quick, varied, and it never gets old (for me). It can be very unbalanced, but I don't really see how you could fix that, given the extremely variable nature of the game. Treat it more of a group activity and less of a game and it can be a blast. If you demand strategy, look elsewhere.

I really like the flavor and theme of the game. My group likes it and even my parents like this one.

More than once now we've played with seven people, where one person agrees to sit out and narrate (this works well when multiple people haven't played it before) - reading the cards as they're drawn and working to pull everyone into the atmosphere of the game. 

I wish they would release an expansion or two. It wouldn't take much to add a ton of new scenarios with just a couple of new tiles and a new omen.

I'm a sucker for theme games (with additional sucker points for horror theme) with lots of well done components, so adjust rating accordingly, but I had a surprising amount of fun with this one across multiple plays.

Not all the stories are balanced, but still is a very envolving game and one of my favourites. The only big problem that it has, is that it's very very very dependent of the language, and as I'm from Chile, it's hard to find a group of 4+ who speaks enough english to be the traitor without help.

I enjoy the game very much especially for the modular board and the repayability. Till now I plaued twice, ironically the time when the haunting began very early (at 4), it took more than 90 minutes to finish whilst the time the haunting took till @8nto commence it finished in just under an hour. I really like the different strategies pwr situation. The wording is at times a bit blurrer in meaning, the gane may need to be set on the floor due to lacking space andthere are tons of tokens. The rest ate all reasons to love the game.

Great horror experience board game. The haunts feel very different and rules explanation is very easy to get started since it starts out as a coop. There is a great app to handle stat-tracking for your character which is nice. Will play this when in the mood for the experience more so than wanting to win. Some haunts can be unwinnable but you go into looking for a thematic horror experience.

It's fun to explore the haunted house, acquiring stuff and stats, all the while wondering when the Bad Times will come.  The scenarios are crazy and varied, if not all perfectly balanced.

But it's nothing if not thematic.

I think this is the ultimate halloween game. Also, if you are a person who is not sure if you would like role-playing games, this is your chance to try it out. Lift the tiles, to reveal parts of the dark, evil house on the hill. Your character will be thrust head-long into the mystical caos of the house immediately. And in no time, the second part of the game begins, and through a secret scenario you will have to complete the task cooperatively with your teamates to defeat the traitor and its minions.

I really really love the new updated rules to this second edition. They make the game so much easier to play an they are very clear and concise. All those questions I had playing this game over the years are now answered!!! Yes!!! 

I really like the thick cardboard components of the first edition, the new cardboard is thin and seems to warp easily. The box is absolutely hands down awesome (artwork wise) and the box insert is so much better than the original. Other than the cardboard, the components are true to the original edition and I really appreciate that. The cardboard chits are easier to deal with too.

I like this game a more than other people in my group. I like the minis and the exploration aspect quite a bit and sort of treat it as a role playing/acting game.

Although there are 50 haunts in the box, I've gotten a few multiple times (which kind of makes them fall flat). Still fun though.

All froth and no substance. 

I'm sure Betrayal works well as a random story generator, but I don't want a story, I want a game. 

The theme doesn't appeal to me, and that's about all there is to like about it. All of the decisions are either obvious or so random that it makes no difference, which is boring. 

Frustratingly, all the roleplayers in one of my game groups love Betrayal and play it at every opportunity.

My group has a running joke. Every time someone asks a rules question about a game, I snap-reply: "It's not clear." The joke started with this game.

BaHotH has a well-earned reputation as a game with a kludgy ruleset, with lots of ambiguous corner cases and curious omissions. I'd also argue the game lacks a strategic element. Without an mechanic for learning the traitor's identity or a clue as to what the haunt might be, the players have no way to prepare for the second half of the game that differs meaningfully from session to session. You're always discovering as many rooms as you can; you're always avoiding rooms that threaten to lower your stats; you're always heading towards rooms that boost your stats; you always want items; etc.

After the haunt, your best strategy is usually clear -- and it's usually "run up and punch bad guy."

I suppose it's not meant to be a deep game, but it has so many bits and pieces it seems like it should be a little deeper than it is. The rules aren't simple or clear enough to justify its reputation as a "casual" game either.

That said, it works best as an "experience generator," when players can really have some fun hamming it up as they read the Event cards aloud, or throw themselves into the role of traitor with malevolent cackles and witty taunts.

But it's a game that's begging for someone to come along and break it open, to find the real gem of a game that's hiding inside it.

A fun game with two distinct parts - the exploratory phase before the haunt and the conflict phase post-haunt reveal. It's a lot of fun and the theme is well done - though definitely better with more people (4 or 5).  I'll be interested to see how it holds up to repeated plays. 

Still waiting on my tiles from Wizards of the Coast, as the initial ones had the severe warping problem.

A good game with the right group.  The first part of the game is just setup for the 'haunt', which is where you find out how to win.  Some haunts are better than others.

If you take the game lightly, it can be fun, because the game can be unfair at times.

RATING: 7
It's an atmospheric horror game that reminds me of Arkham Horror but it's better IMO because it's shorter, there are fewer decks of cards and there is NO BANK LOAN!  There's a LOT of luck involved with tile drawing, card drawing and dice rolling but it's a decent game.

My biggest problem with the game is that, once the haunt is revealed, it's almost like you have to briefly teach everyone a new game.  There are usually a few pages of new rules, ways to win, board effects, etc. It has caused some questions and confusion every time I play this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting board game with horror/scary theme. Players explore the house with a view of finding item/events/omen that will help them when the haunt starts. Haunt triggered by omen cards and room means for 50 different haunts. Fun game that works better when u get into the mood/theme. Really comes down to the haunt you get, we enjoy it on a stormy night!

Very cool 2 part game which plays like a B-movie horror flick. Just play it up and have fun. A great beer-N-pretzels game.

Thematically great the first few times you play it, but once you know all the rooms and items, it becomes predictable. You basically go through the motions and wait for the haunt to occur.

The expansion is supposedly an improvement but there are mixed reviews. Haven't played it yet.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Here's the reason I can't rate this higher - if you get the right haunt with the right amount of time elapsed in the game, it's an 8 or even a 9.  When that happens the game is interesting, challenging, and does a great job of capturing the flavor of a horror movie.

The problem is, there are haunts that will really make you wish you'd picked something else instead.  They can be long, overly fiddly, too easy, or too hard.  Or a combination of the bad.  When that happens, the game can be a 4 or a 5.

There's a lot to like in this game and I've heard that the newer version fixed some of the issues with the haunts.  If that's the case, it could be a dramatically improved game.  But the flaws in the version I purchased are enough that it rarely sees the table because there are more consistent options available.

For me, this one goes to 11.

After over 30 plays, I can easily say this is my favorite game of all time.  

And... 50 scenarios included.  Fifty!

Don't take this game too seriously. This is just a fun game if you are a fan of horror genre AND games that unfold themselves to become a story. I've played with the 2 player variant and with 3, 4, 5 & 6-All good!

*Update 11/14, after about 100 plays over 7 years or so:

Still, my favorite game. STILL scenarios I haven't played, and if I do get one I HAVE played, I pribably played it years and years ago and forgotten all details.

I've now played some of the custom haunts that people have posted, and some of these are pretty good. 

But what I'm really hoping is that original designer Bruce Glassco does an official expansion or re-theme. Please?

Great idea. Take all horror movie tropes and put them into one box. Modular board creation adds element of exploration, but layouts will oftentimes not make sense.

Trouble is, unless you're playing with people who are experienced, the traitor may very well end up not having a clue on how to win, and the bad part is they can't ask anyone for help. The components, while fairly sturdy, are too numerous to inventory unless you use a storage bin that most likely not fit in the box. "A" for effort, C- for execution.

After a few plays I think this is best with four or maybe five.  Definitely an experience game, but quite enjoyable.  We haven't dealt with the erratta, but just make rules up as needed.

Very easy to teach to new players as before the haunt starts everyone is on the same team.  Great atmosphere if you go with it, but it does have balance issues in some of the haunts.

RATING: 7
Componenti di scarsa qualità, meccaniche da Ameritrash, scenari contati e ruolo imponente del fattore fortuna. Un'insufficienza annunciata si trasforma in una piacevole sorpresa. 
Il gioco è quel che è: non ha niente di trascendentale, le meccaniche non fanno sollevare un sopracciglio ma alla fine ci si diverte. Quando viene attivato lo scenario, e il giocatore designato se ne esce per leggere il suo obiettivo sale la tensione e inizia un'altra partita.
L'alea a volte sbilancia lo scenario, tanto che diventa una passeggiata per una o l'altra fazione. 
Da giocare solo col gruppo giusto: e con quel gruppo, nonostante tutto, merita una partita.

I'm really not sure about this game. Sometimes you can really get into the story as it unfolds, other times it just feels like you're moving aimlessly around on bits of cardboard. I suppose it depends who you're playing with and your mood.

The pre-haunt is the most fun part of the game, but sometimes it goes on too long and it is ultimately pretty pointless. The haunt section is extremely random and is usually either biased towards the traitor or towards the party, depending on the scenario. The rules for the haunt are often unclear. Overall, the game is frustrating and random--this is one of the few games where I would rather not play a game at all than play this game.

This game is really boring until you get to the betrayal, especially for new players because there isn't enough theme. I've introduced several groups to it and the beginning always produces confused glances and questions like: "Why are we doing this?" and "When does it get interesting?"

After the betrayal happens it turns into a decent game.

RATING: 5
This game is fairly long and very random.  While the exploration might appeal to some, you're as likely to find something that hurts you as helps you.  In the beginning of the game, you're just wandering aimlessly, with no goal to work toward.  Once the "haunt" occurs, it turns into a semi-cooperative game (which aren't my favorite) that usually isn't very balanced.

This game can swing wildly between balanced, fun scenarios, and short, lopsided scenarios. The house is built randomly, the items, omens, and events come out randomly, and the traitor scenario is chosen randomly. Mixing all that together only yields a good game sometimes.

Half of this game is exploration, the other half is an exciting story that can be horribly unbalanced at times. I think it's still fun, but it really requires the right group of players. I will say though that I wish this game had been cleaned up both story-wise (and rules for those) as well as component-wise. The minis look god awful, the stat trackers are horrendous and the little chits are just text. I realize Wizards of the Coast isn't really a boardgame company, but they put very little effort into some of their games.

This game could definitely use a deluxe version. Nice components, better minis and a nicely bound book.

I can see why this would be a good game. However both attemps at playing it have left me wishing I hadn't bothered. I was the betrayer both times. Both were the same senario, both times I died without getting a turn because of board layout/player placement. So anti climax is an understatement.

Great game thematically and has a soft spot for me as one of the first "nontraditional" tabletops I was introduced to.  Good replay value due to the difference of the haunts, but they don't usually feel very balanced; highly depends on the number of players.  Not a great game if you're looking for heavy strategy, but still great in my opinion.

Seems easy. I don't remember ever losing (though I haven't been the traitor), and have played several times over a long period (though only one play per instance of play, meaning there are large gaps of not playing this). It is fun every once in a while, but I wouldn't want to play a whole bunch of it at once.

RATING: 7.5
I like the story-telling in Betrayal, all searching the mansion then a random twist to turn one into a traitor.  I like how different many of the mansions, items, and haunts are and generally make each game a fun, unique experience.

The game can be fiddly with the rules and interactions between items and haunts/villains/minions.  The first edition was terrible with its rules, however while the second edition was a vast improvement, there can still be questions.  Second Edition also removed some great haunts and dumbed down the chits, so didn't like that change.

Wandering about with (literally) no rhyme or reason, watching random things happen to you, then suddenly something is happening and you can't really prepare for it and a bunch of dice get rolled and then the game is over. Kind of disjointed from a storytelling perspective too, considering the narrative doesn't even begin until 3/4 of the way through the game.

2-games played: ridiculously cool game!  The humor of the game, crazy scenarios, and well-designed thematic mechanics make this game a real gem.  So far we've had to exorcise the house before it swallowed us in a vortex to hell; the other game we all got shrunken by a mad scientist who sicked some super cats on us.  

My friends and family have all thoroughly enjoyed this game, I can't wait to see what other plays will have in store.

I haven't really tried playing with the updated/clarified rules and scenarios.  That in mind, the game is frequently unfairly weighted against one side.  And there are way too many tiles to sort through.

There is no objective for the first half of the game and once the haunt is revealed it almost always ends up extremely one-sided.

I would be happy never playing this game again.

Love this game, and it is in very close competition to being in contention for my favorite game.  I think the fact I have not played it in a while, you need at least three players, and the limit (although I know it will take a while to reach it) of scenarios all play a part in that.  Along with a few other nit-picky things.  Don't get me wrong though, it is still a great game and still a ten, just not my favorite anymore as I have some new games that have just tickled my fancy more.  This may change if it makes it to the table a few times, of course.

A classic game of exploring a haunted house.  As you add more rooms and obtain more items, at some point the game will take a turn and one character will start the "haunt".  Taking a secret tome this player will now be your opponent and will have a unique set of win conditions.  The other players take another tome to find their win conditions.  One the "traitor" returns to the table, the real fun begins!

Great concept, but the execution is a little clunky. Somebody will be able to streamline this haunted house with faster, slicker mechanics in the future.

They do a really good job with the 50 varieties of haunts. The explore phase is fairly boring. The painted miniatures is a big plus. It just takes too long for each player turn to stay interested in a 6 player game. Elimination, while completely necessary for this genre, is kind of a bummer if you are the first one to go.

Recently uppped my rating of this game to an 8 from an earlier 7. Coached a game for my game group of 10-13 yr olds, and it was a hit, and it was fun for me to read the cards in a diabolical voice. 

I notice too that I really and am gravitating to like a lot of the new Avalon Hill releases (all Wizards of the Coast branded). Titles like Nexus Ops, Betrayal, and Monsters Menace America are seeing table time for my Tweens group.

Edit: I've actually bumped this up again, and I can tell I like this game more than the average-going Ameritrash fan. It has to be with the right group of people though. It's dudes on a map, and if you are more interested in efficiency of strategic moves than you are in throwing yourself into the mood of exploring a haunted house, this won't be for you.

Really liked the game concept of placing tiles and moving through rooms-- plus having a traitor turn up. The ending came fast and was a little underwhelming-- but I think that was just more to do with the cards/tiles that happened to be played.

Updated to add after a few more plays: I've found my enjoyment of the game really depends on the traitor scenario... some of them are really terrific fun and others have been sort of "meh."

Good concept.  Inconsistent play.  Co-op, tile laying, exploration game turns 1 vs All game of attack/survive in creepy house of horrors.  First half of game is very repetitive and has lost its luster.  It has become a tedious waiting game.  "It is the haunt, yet?  No?  Ugh.  Your turn."  The 'haunts' are awkward, clumsy, poorly explained, rhythm killing, too often very unbalanced, and on occasion...over on the first round.  Personally, not a fan of the occult theme on many haunts.

(2 plays) (Haunts played - 10,28)  We had a lot of fun breaking out this game.  I had read a lot about the rules problems here, so we decided that one player would be the official rules guy.  Whatever he decided would go, but he listened to us if we thought he was off base.  It worked just fine.  The heroes got totally destroyed in both games, with no hope of winning, but we still had fun.  I don't know what the percentage chance of the Heroes winning is, but for haunts 10 and 28, I think the circumstances of a hero victory would be pretty rare.  As a game, broken? maybe, but as an experience, worth the time spent.  Sticklers for rules details will HATE this game, unless they can switch it off and go with the flow.

Great game with it's flaws. It's a cliché, horror B-movie in a box, hence there is some glitches and some rules that are not quite clear - but go with it and it's a wonderful experience everytime. And 50 scenarios - do I have to say more? 50 times without the game repeating the same plot. 

It do require a group of like minded players though. It's a game for the story, not the strategy or mechanics.

I got to play this game finally at my local meetup. There was a mad sellout of Will Wheaton effect when this game aired on Tabletop so it was always semi-on-my-radar.

The game is interesting and I can see the game to have some legs because of the random variable setup and how players react to the game. 

If you enjoy story telling games this can be a good game. I did get some chills down my spine when I think about if we'd be playing this at night with candle lights. It will creep me out. lol.

I won't turn down a game but it's not enough for me to just own it, especially I can see it to be horrible at anything less than a 4 player count.

For anyone with a liking for horror themes. Players must be into this game can be a lot of fun with the right people.

You must download and read the FAQ...loads of confusing statements in he rules.

When you do get a good haunt (it doesn't matter who the betrayer is) you will want to play it again immediately.

Fantastic game that always turns out differently. With 50 different stories there is no shortage of content. I have found that even people who aren't really into board games can be easily drawn by the theme and exploring the mansion. Can get finicky near the end with the haunt rules (after haunt triggers) and a more clearly worded rule book would do wonders here.  All in all a solid game that will let you have a great time exploring a haunted house.

This is a relatively light and fun game of exploratory tile laying with a thematic twist. Players start out cooperatively exploring a haunted house - revealing rooms, discovering items, and stumbling upon traps, ghosts, and curses galore. But at some point, a traitor is revealed in their midst with secret, deadly plans for the others. The game is pretty simple to pick up and to play. The only difficulty lies in the post-Haunt scenario descriptions, which at times can be annoyingly vague and confusing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun experience, with the combination of Omens and situations creating a different "Haunt" experience. That being said, the game is pretty unstable; the difficulty of winning the game is all over the map; sometimes way too easy, sometimes way too hard. Some rules and item interactions in particular also don't seem to jive very well with some of the scenarios. Do yourself a favor and check the errata on the Avalon Hill website for whatever scenario you dial up before you play it.

Not sure what to say about this one. There is a lot that I like but a lot that I do not. I think that, if redone in a "revised" edition, this game could be absolutely awesome. As it is, it tends to feel like an okay to play a few times haunted house movie game.

There's nothing really wrong with the game, I guess; I just don't particularly enjoy it.  The idea is very cool.  The biggest problem I've found is that the haunts seem unbalanced.  It's been rare (over the course of 20 or so plays) that there's been genuine tension over who's going to win.  Maybe 5 have come down to a close finish.  The rest have been heavily tilted in favor of either the traitor or the heroes.  Meh.

Good game but quite complex and fiddly. Players explore a haunted house until one horror scenario is revealed, at which point one player 'betrays' his friends and takes on a role to kill them off, using whatever tools are applicable to the scenario. Ranging from werewolves, vampires, zombies and psychos to bizarre witch and cat stories, the game kind of relies on the 'traitor' knowing the game inside out, as they have all the secret knowledge. The random cards drawn through out the game are great for building up a degree of 'horror film' tension until the big reveal.

Finally Updating my Score, down from 8 to 7, and I feel that it belongs here for two reasons:
1) The value of this game is entrenched in who you play it with.  It's 'heavy theme' and too many rules are up for debate.  Make sure you play with easy-going people.
2) Big luck factor. If you hate luck, don't bother. I happen to like an element of chance in a game and so it works for me.
My group is able to look past the erratas and simple rules, and we enjoy the fun atmosphere that this game provides.  Just about every scenario has been fun, and for the most part, favoured the heroes.  Some haunts are better than others, and some are used way too liberally.  I really hope AH come out with an expansion pack with new tiles, new heroes, new haunts, and reprints for misprinted tiles (ahem, underground lake, anyone?)

All and all, I like this game.  The last time that I played I started to like it less - one haunt was fun, the other was totally pointless. With this said, I believe this game deserves a high rating because I'll continue to have fun with this title as it's a fresh, low-strategy choice for beer 'n pretzels.

Update:  This can easily be a party game for your 'boardgame inclined' friends.  They'll love it, because it's pretty simple and fun, with great atmosphere.  Plus, they're totally turned-on by the fact that there's 50 scenarios.  Their eyes will light up like your own when you first read it.

But I repeat - rule heads and chaos haters avoid!

I like the theme of the game, and I love how someone can become the betrayer at a moments notice. I'm really disapointed in the new version's components though. Fresh out of the box, and each tile was so warped that they look terrible all together.

I love the idea of this game.  I wanted to love this game.  But I just don't.  The rules are too ambigous and it's an inconsistent experience.  The pieces are top notch, but the counters are just too fiddly (and there's so many of them).  Too much time is spent searching for a little bit of cardboard.

RATING: 8
A very popular game with the group I play with. Had it for years, only play sporadically as it's always seen as a filler game, but only if there's definitely enough time to play it. Consequently, there are still plenty of haunts we haven't yet seen.

The initial period of the game, prior to the haunt reveal, when the players are searching the house, creates a nice atmosphere of expectation.  To add to the mystery, the eventual traitor isn't necessarily the one who draws the trigger haunt.

Once the traitor is banished from the room, each side reads its version of the rules.  The traitor returns and the remaining heroes get to see any set-up changes.  The game continues with each side trying to determine the other's new abilities/powers and aims.  Once one side realises (or thinks it realises) the other's route to victory it's a race to the end: sometimes, the heroes have to actively battle the traitor (and his minions); in other scenarios they merely have to avoid the traitor, in short, running away.

I think we've probably played about 10 of the 50 scenarios, so far.  Mostly, the scenarios have played out well, providing an initially neat guessing game followed by a well balanced fight or chase.  However, 1 or 2 have proved a disappointment, either because they seemed an uneven contest, or because the scenario was won in an incredibly short time.  Another problem can be that the traitor has no one with whom to check his version of the rules: he can't confer with the others without giving away some of the secret.  One of our damp squib games occurred because the traitor had either misunderstood or just misread his rules.

Overall, as I've said, this game has maintained its popularity with my group.  It's a good game to include a new or casual gamer, provided that the newbie can be included in the hero team rather than be the traitor against Hill veterans.

Fun game, newer gamers love it to death. I find it a bit too fiddly with the combat, and some rules are hard to remember. And then the Haunt, while an awesome mechanic, sometimes is too complex, especially again, with newer players. And even veterans are caught frowning at the Haunt rules occasionally.
Biggest complaint though is that the Haunt can be incredibly unbalanced sometimes, even being done in a turn or two after being revealed.

We played scenario 28 which seemed broken. My character spent most of the game stuck in the basement without encountering the traitor at all.  My friend who owned the game we played said that all the scenarios they had run so far seemed to be broken or have confusing rules.  This game screams out for a set of home brewed rules and scenarios.  Until then, count me out.

One of the most unique games I've played. T.I.M.E. stories took the story telling aspect of this game to a whole new level, but I really enjoy the traitor aspect of the game.

I am the kind of player who does not mind random elements in games. However, I believe that the player should be able to at least partially mitigate what boils down to bad luck with strong play.

On our first play, my group did not have the necessary rooms/items in play when the haunt rolled around, and it became pretty clear that we were toast. I don't mind difficult, but we lost entirely due to random elements. No amount of strong play was going to save us. I will try again, but I'm a bit disappointed.

The game is not horrible, it is well themed and it strives to offer many different scenarios (when the betrayal happens) with very different game mechanics and objectives.

Unfortunately, the designers have been too ambitious and the result is a number of scenarios that - for the most part - are poorly balanced, the topography of the building, or the location/profile of the characters making immediately obvious who is going to win the game as soon as the betrayal happens.

It would be nice if the designers would rehash the game and publish an updated, better version, because the ideas behind the game mechanics are nice.  But as it stands is not a game I particularly enjoy playing.

Cute little quick cross between mansions of madness and Dungeon run. Just like in Mansions, you explore a spooky house and encounter little events here and there that can earn you items or push you towards death, and just like in Dungeon Run, at some point one of the players becomes the antagonist and the other players have to scramble to beat them.

The game is a little to random for my taste, but it's quick so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. The minis are pre-painted which is nice, but the paint job is a little rough. Additionally the markers you use to remember your varying stats slide around way too easily making it ripe for error.

Love playing this game. Replay-ability is very high, not knowing which haunt you will get and there are 50 of them. I have never played with 5 or 6, but I enjoy playing with 4 the most.

Fun as an experience, not as a game. While the initial portion of the game is fun, the 50 different haunt scenarios often have complex, unfun rules and setups, and are rarely balanced (although this last point is often a surprisingly fun element). After more than five or so plays, the flaws in the haunt designs begin to hurt the experience, but the game can remain fresh if at least some of the players are inexperienced. 

A decent game to introduce people to board games, but not to keep them interested.

This just isn't a game for me. Mostly because the gameplay is really bad if you're at all competitive. The fun from this game comes pretty much purely in the thematic narrative that emerges, the story is why you play the game. I play games for many reasons, but one of them is to test my strategy and skills and get better. This game has no appreciable skill and so simply isn't my type of thing. Those who really enjoy story and don't care who wins or loses or how fair it is will enjoy this. Most others will probably find this frustrating like myself.

I don't think I played this with the ideal group (half of the players were inexperienced gamers, not to mention sleepy), but I can also tell that this isn't the right game for me. I didn't like how when the haunt occurred it felt like we switched gears and began playing a completely different game. I preferred Dead of Winter's hidden traitor mechanic, which didn't bring the game to a halt. There's also the issue of one player getting stuck on a basement tile for 4+ turns... We didn't complete the haunt, but it seemed like it would either have taken forever or been impossible to win. I would only play this again if the rest of the group really, really wanted to.

Despite my usual taste in board games and my disdain for both cooperative and thematic-centric games, Betrayal is surprisingly entertaining for me. I definitely wouldn't want to play it all the time, but there's enough going on that makes it feel like I'm actually able to do things effectively. Well, except for some of the haunts, which are horribly unbalanced. Sometimes the betrayer (or, "the douche") is basically an unstoppable god that can just happily slaughter all the players, and sometimes they can't do anything effective. Thankfully, once the haunt happens, the game is close to over, so it's not something you have to suffer through endlessly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.25
Very fiddly game and flimsy pieces which does not really affect the gameplay but it is just something I noticed, especially due to the fact that the game has been published by WOTC, one would expect better production values. 

The game plays very counterintuitive and the board, character discs, cards and tokens are all very hard to make out and most of the game's downtime is generated by those issues. Furthremore, I am not a big fan of player elimination and in both games I played I ended up sitting around doing nothing for ages, not good. 

Once the haunt starts, the chaos begins. The basic idea is nice but having two times 50 sets of rules each time you play makes it utterly chaotic and nobody really knows (and cares) what is going on anymore. In both games I played, all players were disinterested after a while.

A disappointment.

This game can be very fun.  Sometimes it can be very slow going.  Once the rooms that enhance your attributes are discovered, everyone tries to increase their attributes to the max.

Love the tile laying concept applied to exploring a haunted house. The Haunts can be great as well and add variety to the game. Points taken off because of ambiguous rules in many of the Haunts can make them frustrating for casual players. The Haunts can also be extremely unbalanced taking some of the fun away.

This is a game that is simply broken from a mechanics standpoint and is frustrating to play.  It had tremendous potential.  Avalon Hill has worked to make corrections however.  I keep hoping someone writes a completely new rules set for the components and publishes here as a variant.

Pros:
1. It's a fun social experience that your friends will talk about afterwards.

Cons:
1. This barely a board game. The first 75% of the game is just wandering around and reading cards while bad or good things randomly happen to you.
2. A ton of luck in this game.
3. You can be made irrelevant to the game within the first 5 minutes.

Summary: Fun game to play with a few friends maybe once to kick off a night when playing with people who are not heavily into board games. Other than that scenario, I can't really see a reason to ever play this game again.

RATING: 5
This is a game that is easy to pick up for non-gamers. There are only a few inherent rules (such as making ability rolls), with a lot of the direction taken from Events and Haunts. It's easy to explain as you go, which gets the game off to a quick start. Just make sure you have your tokens ordered before you begin to speed play.

I would like another play to solidify rating. Wasn't explained in great detail when I first played this.

UPDATED

Wow. Talk about a world of difference. My first play was at a FLGS board game night and the rules were glossed over by one of the guys who had played it before. As a result, the two new people (myself being one of them) felt confused and just like the others were trying to steer the game.

Now that I own my own copy the magic of this game opens up for me. It's a whirlwind ride where you never know who is going to turn traitor and it makes exploring the house before the haunt an adventure. Great game that I am now very happy to own.

This game is built around a very cool idea, but is just as likely to be arduous and boring as it is fun and exciting.

You see, the game is split into two parts: the adventure, and the haunt.
During the adventuring phase, players take turns exploring the mansion, finding new rooms, and picking up items.  This starts off interesting enough.  Ooh! We're exploring a creepy place full of creepy things dripping with flavor text.  Nice.....  
Except after a little while you realize that there aren't any meaningful decisions to be made during this entire half of the game.  You never know what you're about to walk into, and every circumstance is decided for you by dice and card draw with zero player input.
But this is just the beginning, right? The portion where we're exploring and powering up before the Haunt, that special moment when everything goes crazy.  We can wait.  Right?

Well here's the thing: since the start of the haunt is random it might start way early, before anyone's had the chance to prepare enough to stand a chance against it... or it may start hours late into the game when every player has become strong enough while waiting around bored to tears to have absolutely no trouble completing the challenge.

Ultimately you have a game in which the majority of plays are either lopsided for the co-op team, or for the Haunt player, but still wants two to three hours of your life to get there.

RATING: 9
Great genre, creative and wide-open gameplay leads to some rules niggling. FAQ/errata seems sufficient for our play. Fun outweighs niggling by far. Enjoy it every time I play it.
Probably the one game that gets people into the spirit of a boardgame/theme/role more than any other.
Truly a unique game in the entire milieu/oeuvre of boardgames.

This is a fun mostly-coop game. I really like the tile placement mechanics, with certain rooms only able to be placed on certain floors, and I also like the variable ways the hauntings occur. 

A couple of issues about the production are missed placed backs on the rooms, and Haunt 28 is missing vital information for the Haunter.

(I have 1 more play than recorded, don't remember the date played.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As long as you have not played with all of the scenarios the game keeps on surprising your group with fun. Not as a hassle to set up as Arkham Horror, and not as frightening, but still plenty of enjoyment to be have.

The problem is that most of it is completely random and there are some instances where it just is practically impossible for either the Players or Betrayer to win. You are playing a very luck-heavy game with a lot of illusion of choice.

It being a Co-Op game for the beginning is great and the mood switches immediately when the Haunt happens. The gradual ticking of time definitely can be intense!

I enjoy the theme and gameplay. Once you get over a couple confusing things and quirks it is an enjoyable game. Unfortunately the haunts might be weak sometimes because of the setup of the house or the player amount etc, but I keep coming back because I enjoy what it offers THAT much. Sometimes the threat of a great haunt/house setup is enough to push through those occasional dud plays.

It's a tile based game that's a card management based game that's a dice throw based game that's a number strategy game that's a plot twist game.  If you understood that, you're ready to play this gem without reading the rulebooks.  Seldom plays the same twice, and seldom does it take more than an hour to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played twice and enjoyed both games. Seems a little lacking in the item department.I was expecting to see more items on the tiles. I.e mansions of madness 2nd edition. Plays okay. Although the haunt is different each time the routine of turning tiles that you already know feels like it could get a little dull. At this point in time I am quite familiar with the ground level tiles and many of them don't do much at all. Waiting for the haunt is the high point. Have to check the rules as it seems many of the tokens aren't being mentioned or used.

It´s a quick and fun game, a bit too random for me but with a nice atmosphere. The haunt can be over quite fast if the traitor is unlucky and than all that exploring seems a little pointless.
What really turns me down is the fact that there are quite a lot of errors and some misprints. That´s not something that you would expect from a professional game company.

RATING: 7
I may rate this higher once I've had a chance to play it again. It looks like there's a lot of potential fun with this, but the randomness of the first game I played really killed that session. When the haunt was finally drawn, none of the characters we had could deal with it and so we were mercilessly cut down, one by one in a very brief amount of time. 

NEW COMMENT: Got a copy of the 2nd Edition, and a few more plays and adjusted my rating accordingly. Bad situations (as above) can happen, but the game is still fun and interesting and with the wide variety of possible scenarios leading to a unique experience every time.

This game has huge replay value.  I have played it about half a dozen times and have yet to play the same haunt twice.  If I had one complaint is that it can be easy to start the haunt early and the directions for the haunts can sometimes be a bit hard to follow.  Seems like the traitor has it easy as the investigators have yet to win any of the games I have played.

Contrary to popular opinion, I think this game is bad. I didn't find the fog-of-war exploration exciting nor were the "haunts" compelling. I dislike that in the middle of the game you have to read off something to "start the haunt" which is essentially when the game really begins anyway. Clunky design and bad components.

I hate this game. It fails at being both a game and an experience. There's no meaningful decision making and cards and dice determine pretty much everything to the point where it feels like the game is playing itself and you're just a component to move the pieces around. As an experience it's woefully lacking. There's no unifying theme, it's just a disparate kitchen sink of the most generic horror tropes you can imagine. And it doesn't even manage to be cheesy about it. If you want a horror B movie experience, go watch a horror B movie.

Got it for christmas and did a quick 2 player run using the variant posted here in BGG. Well, it does require one to be creative with the rules, there's lots of stuff that isn't explained thoroughly and where a sort of creative layman's sense is required to solve it.

Still, the theme is well put and exploring the house is fun. The different levels of the house are intriguing and it's sometimes fun little horror ride, running away from those giant monsters etc. frantically trying to find that one item that might save your sorry butt :-)

I really enjoyed playing this game and it went over well with my wife and our friends.  My wife has a reluctance to play anything on the slightly heavier side of gaming and was terrified about the possibility of becoming the betrayer because she would have to be on her own to figure things out.  

Sure enough, when the haunt happened, it was her that was singled out.  She was still able to read through and finish off her portion (and even ended up winning), so it's a testament that the game is accessible to just about anyone willing to try.

RATING: 7.5
Classic "horror movie in a box" type of game. Cooperative until a haunt triggers then  becomes a one vs. all which can be tricky as the rules tend to be vague for the traitor. Benefit is that everyone knows who the traitor is so that player doesn't need to worry about being obvious or anything. (Mostly) modular tiles and 50 haunts in the base game allow for great replay-ability. The exploration of the house is enjoyable although theme and logic can be broken depending on what you draw as you struggle to explain why some rooms are where they are. Components are so-so quality but the game is fun enough and has that stereotypical horror theme that has yet to be replaced by any other game.

Have to admit that I was a little disappointed at the first go-around.  We played twice in a row.  First game sucked because it lasted maybe 30 minutes and we never got a traitor.  The second game was better, but still seemed rushed.  Production value is medium, with LOTS of little non-descript tokens.  This is just a first impression, though.  I seem room for me to warm up to it.

This is not the best game in the world, but it happens to be a favorite of mine sense I played the original when it came out.

This was an interesting game.  I'm not really a fan of the horror genre or cooperative games, but watching the house get built was kind of fun.  I enjoyed this more than Arkham Horror, and it took far less time to setup, explain, and play.  Not recommended to play with inexperienced players (especially those who don't understand the game mechanics when they are thrown into being the Traitor.  That just makes for a painful experience for all involved.).

Fun tile laying game with a lot of replayabililty, but some 50 scenarios don't play out very well because the instructions are very subjective. I wish the designers of this game would have worked out 20-25 really good flaw free scenarios instead of doing 50 scenarios. It is hard to enjoy this game with fewer than four players and some of the components are sub-par. Still, this is the closest thing to an RPG I'll play. I haven't played Dead of Winter yet, but I'm thinking that game could replace this game for me.

Very well designed game that delivers on the time beautifully. The game can be drawn out if everyone isn't engaged, and people tend to make team decisions after the haunt is revealed that can take away some of the intense fun of cooperative games. Many of the haunts can be unbalanced, and it can be very intimidating to be the betrayer on a early play through.

RATING: 7
My rating may come up, since I enjoy the theme very much. But my first game moved slowly and ended abruptly, with lots of game-defining dice rolls -- and none of those had established any cause-effect relationships to the development of the story up to that point. In short, we rolled dice to determine the winner, which REALLY is a bummer. The board is marvelously designed, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The biggest problem with this game is that it doesn't ever feel truly spooky, even with proper music. Additionally, many of the haunts/rules aren't clearly worded, which can make multiple scenarios seem one-sided.

Another big problem is that this game's two phases are vastly different when it comes to speed. The first phase is very slow. The second phase is almost like an explosion. While this can be a good thing. I find that it doesn't work because it seems less like a trip-wire we found the boss, instead of a spooky, dungeon-crawl.

RATING: 4
This game definitely comes with the caveat that "Your Mileage May Vary".  It is very luck-based and you if you have any expectation for enjoyment you should be sure to just relax and go along with story.

The haunt was interesting, and hearing about other haunts makes me want to try again.  With my experience in the game, however, I'm probably only going to play this game again while drinking a few beers and on Halloween.  There aren't enough positive things going on otherwise.

First, player elimination.  I don't understand how games can still have that.  We had one person die within the first round of the haunt and just sat there for the next 45 minutes.  That, in and of itself, ruins this game for me.  So, so bad...and the designers should feel bad.

Second, there seem to be dominate characters.  I've heard this might change from haunt-to-haunt, but my wife and I spent the entire haunt trapped because we weren't strong enough to break free.  We had ZERO opportunity to increase our might before the haunt.  So, effectively we had one person eliminated and two others rolling dice on their turn to eventually just sit back in their chair, which is the same as being eliminated.

So, so, so bad.

I'm aware of many of the problems with this game (lopsided player balance at the start of the haunt, over-abundance of tokens, strange narrative stories due to random card draws, etc.), but I have enjoyed every play of this game.  

I love the change in mechanics half-way through, the modular board (with the mistaken pool that can show up on the top floor), the haunts as well as the story lines they spawn, and the semi-cooperative nature that can either become fully cooperative , one-vs-all , or fully competitive.  It all keeps you on your toes and makes every play different.

The biggest mystery here is why other people gives this game good scores.

For the first 80% of the game you'll be moving your playing piece around a map and randomly seeing if you take damage and/or find objects.

Then, after that pointless grind is finally finished, there will be a boss fight. The fight will have a mildly interesting concept i.e. a poltergeist that must be controlled by reposiitoning candles etc. But it will simply require the same grind of obvious decisions and randomness to resolve it.

That's it.

It's worse than the similar Mansions of Madness, which does itself suffer from the same problem but does other things better.

Theme - 5/5. Yes please. Haunted creepy house? Awesome scary movie group dynamics? People turning traitor as the night goes by? Every horror trope in the book? Sign me up.

Complexity - 4/5. Complexity wise, it's really not too complex that it's impossible to explain, but not so simple that it's super easy. However, some scenarios are just difficult to understand at times unless you've read the rules multiple times. So the varying complexity is both a good and a bad thing. The rules are well laid out however. Read the rules before you play, this is not a read as you go game.

Length - 4/5. This is definitely a whole night game. Again, same issue with complexity, games can run from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on what you run in to. But it never was so long that I wanted to just step away.

Fun - 4.5/5. This would be a 5/5 if not for certain scenarios being so ridiculously one sided that either the traitor or the survivors just want to go 'fuck it' after all of that build up. That drops it down a point. The amount of those kinds of scenarios that are SO one sided that they're annoying are relatively low though.

Replay-ability - 5/5. You can play this game until the cows come home because it changes each and every time. And with so many scenarios, you'll probably be playing it for years before you see every single traitor scenario.

Production Value - 3/5. The pieces are nice, especially the character pieces, as are the cardboard rooms, however they damage easily, ESPECIALLY with those damn sliders. It's not horrible value, but I feel like it the cardboard and the sliders together along with the tiles in general, while amazing, could have used some serious work. Also no easy way to organize all the various different bits and pieces in the box itself. I love the game, I do not love all the parts I have to sort through every single time to set things up with no base way in the box itself of finding them other than plastic baggies.

Overall - 4.25/5. A great game that has some problems that need to be ironed out, but are mostly fixable with a little bit of elbow grease. Hard to get tired of it.

Bonus: Customization - 5/5. It's pretty easy to make your own scenario or character for this game. Look online, they're all over.

A decent game, but the gameplay is bland.  The first 75% of the game is pure exploration.  There is no real goal and no threat since players cannot be killed.  The last 25% of the game has a clear objective but the conditions surrounding this portion of the game tend to vary wildly from game to game.  

Unfortunately Betrayal fails to deliver that sense of urgency and dread that a good horror game should have.  

Go for Chill: Black Morn Manor instead.

Played it a couple times.  I like it, but I'm not sure of my opinion of it.  It's a good idea, with good mechanics, but two of my three games have been a little flat.  Maybe it's just the haunts we got.

Edited to add: Played a little more recently, and it's upped my opinion.  It's a solid game.  Drips with theme.

Fun to play and creates at the start a teamwork type scenario. Unfortunately, after all the teamwork that is done to get every character stats padded someone has to become that bad/haunt person which can lead to an unfair game for the haunt to try to win.

RATING: 3.25
This isn't a very good game, though it is a lot more fun than any of the other games I have rated this low. You move your adventurer around a house, building it up from tiles often in a layout that makes no sense (it is a haunted house) and drawing cards for random events. Eventually one of the players turns on the others and there is a race to see who will succeed or fail. The atmosphere is well done but none of the elements of the game really gel togethor. Probably better if you are drunk.

RATING: 6.5
Betrayal can either be a great game or a terrible one, depending entirely on how lucky you are in he setup of the mansion when the haunt begins. The premise is simple enough, split up and explore a haunted mansion until one player turns traitor, at which point the game divides into teams that are fighting for survival. There are over 50 different scenarios for the haunt, but while the sheer volume of content is great, balance can be an issue.

I've seen games where the heroes don't even have a chance to begin before the tiny house with an early haunt drops into hell, or games where the haunt began with the toughest fighter in the hero party already having the gear he needs to kill the monster the haunt revolves around.

It's a fun game with the right crowd that doesn't take it too seriously, but can often be too one-sided from the moment it really begins.

Finding the specific chit you need for whatever event is happening is mildly annoying, but the revealing of the house and the tension of the haunt rolls are great. And the atmosphere. This has me interested in Chill: Black Morn Manor.

"Arkham Horror" für nicht ganz so Arme. Großer Nachteil. Ein Spieler muss sozusagen "Gamemaster" sein. Dennoch: Sehr unterhaltsam mit der richtigen Gruppe.

RATING: 7
Betrayal is a very fun game. What's not to like about a group of people exploring a haunted house?!!?! :)

The modular board ensures that games are always different. The betrayer mechanic works very well and the way that the betrayer doesn't know that they are the betrayer until "The Haunt" happens is very cool. So everyone is a team player until things go bad. The random "Haunt" effect means that it will be a new adventure every time (at least until you've went through the game 50 times (this is how many unique haunts there are). If 50 aren't enough (that'll last you some time!), you can even get new custom ones on the internet for even more replayability.

If I have a minor quibble - it is regarding the quality of some components. The player pieces came bent and seem a little flimsy, so I'm a little reluctant to try bending them back into shape. Though they do have nice basic paint schemes. The other complaint is the sliders on the player stat board. The sliders fit terribly and always require a bit of user fixing (sliding a bit of paper underneath usually helps a bit, though is untidy) to work at all. Apart from that, the board components are really top notch.

Quite a fun game that I rarely turn down the option to play.

RATING: 3
I've played this game 6 or 7 times and have never had an even moderately enjoyable time playing this game, win or lose.

Most people who like the game say it's all about the theme, and the theme is what makes the game so good, but that has never been the case for me. A good theme draws you in and has you make compelling decisions that make sense with the theme. This game does not have that.

The first half of the game (Pre-Haunt) is the same every single game. You wander aimlessly, discovering flavor text that by the 5th time you play you've already seen before. It doesn't feel any different from playing a roll and move game.

Once the haunt starts, it gets even worse. The vast quantity of haunts suffer from an appalling lack of quality. 

Firstly, the wording in the book is confusing and unclear much of the time. In most games, the betrayer has to clarify something about his abilities and objectives with his opponents, which seriously takes away from the immersion and theme.

Secondly, almost every scenario is paint by numbers with obvious choices, so you just go through the motions until the scenario is over. Where you need to go is obvious on every turn, unless you want to take an obviously sub-optimal move in an attempt to avoid the monotony.

Lastly, and most importantly, in almost every scenario it is blatantly clear who the "winner" is going to be as soon as the haunt is read and understood. Either the betrayer is overpowered, or the non-betrayers are able to easily find some sort of exploit to make it impossible for the betrayer to progress. I've never played a game where someone doesn't say "Well...this is unfair." within 5 minutes after the haunt is revealed. In the rare case it isn't, it is just standing in place rolling dice hoping to reach an arbitrary total to end the game as soon as possible.

Yes, I know that many would argue that being focused on the result of the game is the wrong way to go about it. After all, it is about the journey, not the destination. 

I would counter that Betrayal at House on the Hill takes the easiest lay up of a theme, a story driven Haunted House game, and goes out of its way to ruin the enjoyment and immersion of the players at every given opportunity through repetitive game play, no compelling decisions, and a broken end game.

1 and 1/2 plays so far (halfway through 2nd game... it's "saved" on the dining room table as of 12/24/10). A bit premature but I'm going out on a limb and handing this game a solid 8 and I won't be surprised if I come back later and boost it up to a 9. Fast playing, easy to learn, kids love it (I know... graphically gory text throughout the game and "bad dad" is exposing kids to all this horrible, evil stuff. On the flip side, they love it.).  We play with home-made Scooby Doo characters (don't want to spring $$ for real Scooby minis so I printed up my own characters). Having Velma, Freddie, et.al. on the table helps alleviate some of the goriness (it's always stingy old man Smith behind the rubber mask, right?) and also helps kids identify with the game. Plus the player characters (the painted minis) provided w/the game are IHMO creepier than the encountered monsters!  As for the game itself, Betrayal will become a regular on our gaming table.  This was an Amazon purchase, an impulse buy of 12/2010 when Amazon was giving it away for $19.00!

Have enjoyed this game the few times I have played it.  I know there are discussions about the rules and the like, but go with the spirit of the game and just have a modest immersive experience it is quite fun.  I like the mechanic of unknown conditions/enemies during the haunt.  Requires a bit of thought to plan how to do it best.  Can see with frequent play that the games is memorized, but I play so infrequently that I don't see that happening, so fun each time I play.

If they had spent as much time on game refinement, testing, and especially fine-tuning the rules as they had the story and scenarios, this would be a great game.

Very enjoyable exploration game with a traitor aspect.  This one has a more role playing feel to me that most of the other RPGs in a box.  The biggest complaint I have is that the printing that I purchased has tiles that warped over time (character and mansion location) so it really doesn't lie flat anymore.  Still a great game, but too bad the production quality wasn't up to snuff on this printing (from 2010 or so).

A game with a lot of replay ability and a really good horror theme. The traitor is random depending on the haunt you have in your game, which make it really fun and can really break "teams" in games. With over 50 official scenarios two games are rarely the same. Really need an expansion though, since playing the game with the same events and items coming back every time can make the game feel weird since the scenarios are different.

RATING: 7
16-07-2014. Rated after 5 plays or so (2 recent). Fun game, in which you explore a house to improve your character. Some rooms in the house allow you to take item/haunt cards. Then, at some point a haunt is triggered. The game comes with about 50 haunts, which are triggered by which cards were flipped in the game. Then, one of the players betrays the others and starts with an objective to win (often by killing other players or achieving something nebulous). The other plays try to stop him.

The game is not perfect. The components are pretty poorly executed. Tokens could've been much better. Sometimes depending on the layout of the board/house haunts are impossible to win for one of the parties.

Regardless, if the game works well, it is amazing and easily one of the most interesting experiences to be had in this genre of games. Very fun.

Betrayal is a semi-cooperative game that has players exploring an eerie-looking mansion. As the story unfolds players find out that the house is haunted and one of the players turns on the group. However poor the decision to enter the house, players are often eager to send more explorers into the mansion (even if just to see what kind of gruesome death they will die this time)!

I found this to be a microwave version of Arkham Horror. What I liked about it was the way in which it generated a story. What I didn't like about it was that as players, you didn't have many choices or much control. You simply explored a new room and read a card to find out what happened to you. I also found the components to be below average. We often had to use one kind of token to represent something else.

The variety of situations that will occur cause grey areas during gameplay that can be interpreted different ways. This can be frustrating for people who don't like reading deeply into the rules; it can also cause too much down time. It's also hard for people who don't want to learn a new process everytime they play. Nonetheless, I really enjoy what I've played and wish to play more.

RATING: 5
Too random to be a real game. More of a story telling piece. If you like to strategise, win games through skill and solid decision making this is NOT the game for you. Average all round. Some haunts feel really broken depending on the circumstances in which they activate.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - The components are not unique in any way.  But the game play is extremely different then anything before its time.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] -  This is was the first time a player took on the roll of the game and played against the other players.  


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - The ease of play, great team feeling and many scenarios make this game immensely replayable.  A great game for a group.





Wow that's a lot of little cardboard pieces!!!  But it makes for a fun little game.  Lots of errata though you almost have to have it in order to play.  Every time we play this game we are not sure we are playing correctly.  This game almost requires a moderator who is very fluent in all the rules to play.  We have fun with it.

--Oct2010-- I'd be happy to play again: it was a fun (if odd!) experience.  The new version seems to be quite sensible and deterministic:  we had no serious questions about the proceedings.   Yet despite the excellent atmosphere, I don't think it's one I'd buy.

RATING: 7
A fun "casual" game. Has a good atmosphere, especially fun to play with kids as they immerse themselves in it and become properly frightened ;) . A simple game to pick up and play, with fairly simple mechanics and a large number of haunts to discover.

My only problem with it is that the "traitor" is picked mid-game, when the haunt begins, rather than at the beginning of the game, like in Mafia or Battlestar Galactica. This does lead to more co-operation between the players, though, I suppose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy this game, but I do understand that some people (my wife) do not enjoy the actual traitor aspect.  I do appreciate how each game has the potential to have a vastly different endgame.  It's tough to find three people to play, so my plays have occurred mostly at conventions.

Nice, thematic romp, with a haunted house theme (my favorite type of horror). VERY much dependent on the quality of the haunt. A lot of games have been cut off abruptly by an almost unplayable hunt, such as those where the traitor is trapped in the basement and can't do anything.

I love how this game has 50 different scenarious.  I love how all the playable characters have varying strengths and weaknesses.  I love how every time you play, the layout of the house is different.  

There is a bit of chance involved (dice rolling, what tile will come up next, etc.), but that just makes this game more fun IMHO.  You need to be a little afraid of going up against the bad guys, like you would in real life.  Or what's the point of running around a haunted house?  A ton of fun here...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I enjoy this game a lot.  Downside is that despite there being 50 scenarios, we keep pulling the same exact 2 or 3 we've already completed (which is unexpected and kind of a bummer).

A lot of luck involved, but losing and finding out what the traitor was up to all along is pretty fun in itself. The tension of surviving the house is definitely there, and the game plays plenty fast.

RATING: 6
Very thematic "dungeon crawl" style game that plays well if you have the right attitude.  Rules lawyers will go into immediate status seizures if they try to play by the printed rulebook due to the gaping holes, but if you just work together to decide how things are "supposed to" work, you'll have fun!

It's really not an incredibly challenging game, but for mixed company (and wives who aren't into gaming) it does pretty well.  The theme is well thought out and rich, the pieces are decent (and prepainted) and the scenarios are plentiful enough that it should be quite replayable for many years.  Quick, easy, straightforward.  The artwork is decent.  I'm lukewarm on tile-laying games--but this one gets a .5 point boost 'cause I'm a die hard horror fan.

excellent story telling game with lots of replayability; not for people who want lots of independence, but this game is full of surprises 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Main problem of the game are the various unclear parts of the game. Haunts essentially add new rules to the game, and, if there's any part not written clearly, you can derail the experience of the game. Also, if the Haunt is triggered before the players have the items necessary to defeat it, that's it for the game. I don't think moviegoers will mind the Bad Ending, but, if you're expecting a "fair" game, this isn't it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A huge amount of theme, but almost every scenario seems to be wildly unbalanced in one direction or the other. (I'll still gripe about the one where I was the traitor, and I had three crappy domestic animals with which I was supposed to somehow kill all the other players. Round one, fight!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game for casual gaming. Made better when players treat it as role-playing rather than just playing the game's mechanics (which, admittedly, are a bit subpar). The traitor/haunt mechanic is may favorite part of this game.

RATING: 10
This is one of those situations where a rating is more reflective of my enjoyment than the quality of the game itself. It's not that Betrayal at House on the Hill is not a well-designed game. Quite the opposite in fact. It is a very accessible thematic experience that has an insane amount of variety, creating situations and narratives that continue to surprise even after numerous sessions. It's an absurdly generous game, and one that most non-gamers will really enjoy. It somehow manages to strike the balance between spooky and aggressively goofy, which is impressive.

But it is also a very leaky experience. There is an enormous amount of variance in how games can go, very little of which is in the players' hands. One game might be down to the wire, and another might be basically impossible for one side. The Haunts are all (in my experience) at least entertaining to read and go through, but there's also a real chance that the game can kind of collapse in the back half. It's this wobbly nature that will keep some people from really enjoying the game, assuming they can tolerate the huge luck factor. For my part it is the price you pay for one of the most entertaining games out there. Warts and all, it's earned its place as one of the most fun and distinct games of the last 20 years.

RATING: 3
One of the biggest disappointments in this hobby. I got first edition - game is nicely done and looks like it has some idea. Till the haunt game is just boring - picking cards and nothing more actually. We had haunt scenario with dopplegangers and when we realized what was it all about we stopped and pulled out Age of Steam. It looks nice but I don't think older players would appreciate this one. Better for youngers kids.

Great background story to begin with. Unfortunately, the plot disappears suddenly when you start playing by doing actions aimlessly in the house until someone is randomly chosen to be the lucky "betrayer". This player has nearly all chances in the game to wipe out the rest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
Betrayal is painful. The first section is just pointless meandering waiting for the second phase of the game to start. The second phase usually suffers from poor balance. Further yet, it's sometimes to even play the second phase properly thanks to ambiguous and poorly written rules.

If you want a thematic experience, just play a role playing game. Betrayal lacks the interesting decisions of board games and the player agency / storytelling chops of an RPG.

The FAQ is a definite bonus. Needs editing but a fun fun game.  Underrated game.  Changes each time it is played.  Strategies changed with each different scenario.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I loathe the first act, for the same reasons I dislike the D&D adventure games - move on a grid, draw a card, read some text, roll some dice, say, "Oh. Now I'm stuck for three turns," and repeat. All this sans any role-playing element or enjoyable interaction. What's more, no mistrust of the villain exists until, well, the villain exists, so there is no tension or negotiation at work, unless you're negotiating to play Anything Else: The Board Game. 
The second act is fine, I suppose, but no narrative or decision led to its unfolding. Just random events. Plus I'm convinced half of the haunts are broken or wildly unbalanced. 
The only redeeming aspect of this game are the good-natured folks I've played it with, but by hour two I'd much rather be killing their armies or stealing their grain or blocking their workers. Or letting them give me a root canal.

Played only 1 scenario (Werewolf) and got smoked by the bad guys.  Still fun and engaging for a group of people.  Nice coop (sort of) experience.

RATING: 9


One of my faves. Can totally tank (usually when playing with the wrong people--stay away from engineers when playing this one, IME), but more often than you would expect, plays out excellent creepy stories. It's not actually scary, mind you (you want Psycho Raiders for that), but it's hella fun.

Again, not a game where you want to be too attached to the results, as they will be largely random, but the trip to get to them is golden. A game where reading out the cards is essential.

I've replaced most of the tiles with figures (my old Dreamblade habit came in handy here), to get the most out of the theme evocation. Works well, especially as the characters are so small, it feels right to have all of the monsters be a whole scale larger than them. Monsters are larger than life, that's the whole point of them!

This is my favorite game of all.  The beginning game is simple enough to get everyone up to speed and feeling comfortable with the mechanics.  Then one of you will betray the others, as determined by the system.  Each side has hidden win conditions.  This game is full of emergent story (I personally enjoy the games where the 8 year old girl turns traitor and wins).  This is a high-drama strategy game where the players are reacting to events.

This is more a ludic experience, one that a gamer shouldn't miss, than a game on its own.

At that moment, the particular game to play may be more or less tense or balanced, but definitively fun.  The game wins a lot if played in a RPG mood.

I don't mind randomness and luck at games at all. However, this game is like if a Eurofan made a satire of luck-based games. I tried Betrayal several times with an open mind and no good. In the beginning there is literally only one decision in the game: which direction to move which is a meaningless since it is a random tile draw. So, after moving to various rooms determined by random tile draws forcing random card draws with options determined by random die rolls until we discovered who was the bad guy determined by whoever happened to have a certain highest stat (i.e. random) because someone randomly failed the omen roll against a meter that had been rising because random, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Whenever someone suggests this I will vigorously lobby for Dead of Winter instead. The widespread appeal of Betrayal eludes me entirely.

Okay. I LIKE this game. I really do. I WANT to give it a higher rating. But the truth is that the game has problems. Serious problems. Many of the scenarios are unclear, poorly constructed, or just broken as printed. A thorough errata is currently avaialable, but truthfully? A second edition is what is needed here. Has SOOO much potential.

A group of strangers arrive at an old house on the hill. Do we need a reason to be there? Hell no. Oh yeah, and the front door is locked behind us, hmm, that's odd. Once we're there, we get to explore the house, have a whole bunch of strange or painful things happen to us, and then at some point one of us snaps. This person (the traitor) goes nuts and is hell bent on killing us, and those of us with any shred of remaining sanity try to stop the traitor. There are fifty scenarios to explain what happens to the traitor and how you stop them.

This game is dripping with theme. It's somewhat like a DM/GM-less RPG: you pick a character with unique stats (knowledge, sanity, might, and speed), and you roll against your attributes to determine the outcome of most events. There's really not a lot of strategy here, it's a very luck-heavy game, but this is not the kind of game you play to win. You play to make a story, and there's a fair amount of replay variety to these stories, especially after "the haunt." With the right light-hearted group, and the right mood music, this is a fun game.

2nd ed. Much smoother rules/gameplay. Great low complexity game for non-gamers or light gamers who enjoy a horror theme. And it is a horror game, so be aware that the event cards can be pretty disturbing.

Another great game. The fluctuation in game length can be a bit irritating - sometimes we pull this out early and are left trying to find another game to slot in after we tear through one play, other times we pull it out late to cap off a night and end up running much later than planned when the Omen roll never fails. Overall, though, this is a great little game that even many of my "non-gamer" friends will agree to play.

Fast-paced, highly atmospheric dice-fest which, if played in the right company, is an absolute blast.  But, as with any good Hollywood blockbuster, if you look too closely or take it too seriously, all the holes become all too apparent.  So my advice is to play this, but not too often so that it retains its unique appeal.

Having played this once, I'd have to say it was a fun game.  I dig the atmosphere of the whole haunted house, and some of the descriptions on the cards are actually pretty creepy.

Unmitigated awfulness. No meaningful decisions to make, almost entirely luck driven - (makes Monopoly look like chess in comparison!) - absolute garbage. Perhaps fans of the game enjoy the narrative, but if I want such an experience, I'd much prefer reading a book to playing this excuse for what purports to be a "game".  OK, theme-wise I was probably never going to like this, but the randomness, the downtime and the fact that players are eliminated, or worse, virtually eliminated with a weakened character (through no fault of their own) all contributed to making this an extremely boring and pointless waste of time.

Lotsa fun if everyone is into the theme.  If non-themer is traitor then it puts a damper on it.  Lots of addenda/errata to print out, but most not that big a deal (Who cares if theres a lake in the attic?  Just roll with it).  Way too many parts (cardboard chits) to be worthwhile, only needed maybe 10% of what was included there.

Semi-co-operative tile exploration gateway game with a strong horror theme.

Pro: Very atmospheric, especially if you have some music playing in the background that fits the tone. The mystery of who the Traitor might become, if anybody at all. Variety in the tile and card effects. Could be seen as a gateway to tabletop RPG's. 50 different missions to go on means huge variety.

Con: Very simple mechanics. Token artwork and appearance is very uninspired and bland. Certain missions don't feel playtested at all, and information given to players is vague at best at times.

Not for people who seek heavy strategic decisions. I have used this successfully as a gateway game. Very thematic but also very fiddly and unbalanced, so the beginners need help.

I can't say enough good about this game. It is pure fun! If you in anyway enjoy fun horror theme and light RPG elements and you're not hung up on "a game has to require strategy to be worthwhile" then you can't go wrong. I'm interested to see how it plays once we've played all 50 Haunts... To avoid frustration you must get the updated rules and FAQ

RATING: 7
This was certainly an interesting experience game.  I think it does a reasonably good job of recreating the B-movie horror feeling.  After all, why is this odd assortment of characters wandering around by themselves in a Haunted House (TM)?  Sure it can be really lopsided, but this is almost more of a role-playing game than a traditional board game -- the fun is in the journey or story and not in the success or failure of the game.  While not a game that I would want to play all of the time, it is certainly something that I would be willing to play several times a year.  I already look forward to giving it another spin.  Of course, you have to have the MASSIVE erata in order to really play.

This is an excellent game all around. I was very pleased with the replayability as well. However, I think the game can be a bit unbalanced depending on the number of players and which Haunt your party receives. The betrayer or investigators could heavily have advantages. The theme is excellent and reminds you of that old school horror; like Stranger Things. Either way, the randomness of the tile placement and the fun my group had was worth the money and playthrough. I see this hitting the table frequently!

Light thematic romp. That's all there is to it. The lightness with theme has a vibe of Totan and Galaxy Trucker, though it's more "competitive" than both and makes a more coherent narrative. It's similar to them in low overhead which leaves you a lot of space to goof out and invest in whatever you wish. Also the game has a bit of sandbox feel to it with you running around the house. Plus when this stops being fun, the game changes into one against many scenario. It's light goofy fun. Quite unlike MoM which is far more serious. Probably also better than anything Flying Frog will ever put out. Has the similar vibe, but it's more tight when it has to be and more loose when it can allows to be.

When I read through the rules this went on my "avoid" list since it's entirely random. When I skimmed the 20 page FAQ I just shook my head and wondered why WOTC didn't bother playtesting or proofreading. I've now played it once and it was even more random than I suspected; I got one move, was stuck in a spiderweb, then killed by a giant cat. Clearly I don't have the "strategy" down.

Some scenarios are great. Others are a little flat (read: Boring) but with the right people, it generates good atmosphere. Do print errata. I really want to like this game...

Whoever says Catan is the ultimate gateway game is wrong. It's this one. This game will bring non-gamers into the world of gaming faster than... something that's really fast.

RATING: 7
Appearance: 7/10
Mechanics: 7/10
Clarity: 7/10
Pieces: A lot

This is a "Nothing Else" game, meaning when that board hits the table, the TV is cut off, cell phones are put on vibrate and all the lights except the one illuminating the table are turned off. This is NOT a game you break out during a rowdy party. It has a story telling components that can't be fully appreciated with a lot of distractions.

The artwork is a bit dated looking, nearly all the pieces are made of cardboard and the plastic miniatures are uuuuugly, like painted army men. Another bothersome feature is the little plastic pointers used to keep track of your stats. They aren't tight enough to hold onto the character tile so you have to place them on top of the numbers and hope you don't knock them off.

The mechanics aren't the best, simply because there is always a chance that The Haunt (essentially the critical moment) can be triggered so early in the game that the players are completely unprepared which can end in failure.

The rules can be a bit iffy, especially if an event calls for the addition of creatures/monsters to the board. One of the best features of this game is that you can create your own scenarios or find some online, essentially giving the game way more replay value.

I do highly suggest that you buy or make foam board trays to hold and separate you cards and pieces. Using baggies and rubber bands is very time consuming when setting up/breaking down.

I would recommend trying before buying on this one.

I love the first half of this game, exploring the house by laying tiles and drawing encounter cards. The second half is unreliable entertainment, depending heavily on whether the scenario is any good or not. I have downloaded and printed off the new and improved (edited) scenario books, but have not tried playing with them yet. I wish that the counters had better artwork, and stat sliders are slowly damaging the character pentagons.

Btw, all you geeks are wrong about the Underground Lake tile. Look closely at the tile, and you will see two levels worth of smashed floorboards above the lake itself. So, the actual lake may be at the basement level, but the room tile is properly labelled for the second floor, because the entrances are a couple of levels higher than the water level.

RATING: 3.1
As far as game mechanics go, there were a lot of interesting things going on; that may have been the problem - a game too enamoured with clever mechanics. Streamlining is called for, in my opinion.

The theme is okay, but spooky ANYTHING is very, very difficult to pull of successfully. Especially written down on little cards, and read out loud. I think the games authors made a reasonable effort at something that would require a superlative effort to really sing.

The mechanic of the "Betrayal" is way too clunky, and stops the flow of gaming dead while everyone searches for little pieces of cardboard. The blatant break also makes the first half of the game seem irrelevant. I understand that it is intended as an opportunity to pump up the stats of the characters, but in our session it didn't seem to function that way.

Then I can start nitpicking the design - cards the same colour on both sides, resulting in easily being boxed, symbols that don't read well on some room tiles, and plastic number indicators that are ambiguous also point to a game that was rushed to market. I felt a little like WE were playtesting it.

Too cludgy.

Very thematic game - when you're playing the game it does feel like you're in a haunted house movie.

New players sometimes have trouble with the start of the game, where it isn't clear what exactly you're doing (or supposed to be doing), so it helps to have an experienced player to link the game to the haunted house tropes. The experienced player will also help keep the pace up. Without that, the combination of the rolling rules, combat rules, and two stages (and sometimes the second stage has multiple steps) will slow the game down and undermine the tension.

People tell me that it is very hard to beat the betrayer, but my experience has been that the betrayer usually loses. Perhaps we're playing it wrong?

I really want to love this game.  I love the subject matter (staying overnight in a "haunted" house), all the expected clichés, and the pre-painted miniatures of the main characters.  I enjoy slowly building the house tile-by-tile. 

Somehow, though, it's not terribly spooky.  We've had some good Haunts and the "betrayal" causes an interesting shift in the dynamics, but something about the mechanics just doesn't quite click.  Are the attributes unbalanced?  Are all the attribute buffs/debuffs a little too arbitrary?  Are the found items not effective enough?  Whatever it is, we ended up vaguely disappointed the first several times we played.  

Our last game, however, felt much more like I think it should have and we all enjoyed it, despite a kind of sucky "haunt" (we were fighting evil music - duh duh DUUUUH!).

After a couple more games, it's slowly growing on me.

Players should be aware, that it's not a balanced experience. Depending on the timing of the haunt and the state of the map when it happens one faction might have a significant advantage.
Roleplaying helps ... not taking it too seriously is required. If all players can agree to that having a good time is all but guaranteed.

The first time I played this I think I rated it an 8. Every time I've played it since my rating goes down a bit. It has some interesting mechanisms they just feel extremely dated, I guess because the game is 13 years old.

Oh yeah and the f*cking clips on the player cards suck!

Love the modular board and the co-op aspect, especially when one of your 'buddies' turns bad.

Don't like the longish set up with tons of tokens and fiddly rules - actually was dreading if wifey was going to be the traitor as she would have struggled with the rule book. Plus the couple of scenarios encountered so far have been a bit pants! thus no real desire to get back to the table.... May be for Halloween parties only.

The mechanics are quite neat, until the haunt comes up.  The reliance on picking up specific chits out of a sea of them was not quite the best way to handle this I have to think.

Cooperative, Adventure. Probably the game I've enjoyed most in this genre (horror/survival with RPG elements). The haunt system is nice and offers a lot of replayability (superior to Arkham Horror in this regard) and is faster-playing as well. Does have player elimination, which can be a problem, so I wouldn't play this at a game day if only 5 people were present, but in a larger gaming group or at BGG.con, this is mitigated by the availability of other games/players.

This is a solid "I'll play it if I'm in the mood" kind of game. With the right crowd, it can be a lot of fun. Although: it can drag on for just too long even *with* the right crowd, and some early player elimination can leave players with little to do. The game isn't nearly as maintenance-heavy as something like Arkham Horror, and isn't nearly as fiddly (in general) as some make it out to be. Sure, there are some ambiguous places in the rules with respect to the scenarios, but it's easy to just make a house rule and move forward. I think Betrayal actually does a very good job of capturing the table-top role-playing vibe.

This is the go to game when we have large groups of players. Looks intimidating for new players, but easier to understand after playing a few turns. Basically a game of exploration and dice roll to see what happens. Goal is to increase roll chances by upgrading number of dice rolled, until the haunt/traitor is revealed. Then it is all against one player to complete a task. Game and scenario different each play-through, still haven't played them all. The more players the better, sometimes the traitor is overpowered and needs more players just to beat, other times the players outnumber the traitor, just depends on final scenario. Love!!!

This one was kinda surprising.. I had heard mixed things about it, so I went in somewhat apprehensive, but in the end I really liked it.  I disagree that the first half drags, since it seems like something horrible could be around any corner (one of the reasons I like Arkham Horror so much).  Add in the fact that the game really doesn't take that long to play and I can't see where the problem lies.  In the end it's downfall will be a lack of expansions, but until I've seen it all multiple times, I'll happily play this anytime.

Since I have started playing non-mainstream board games in December 2016, this is easily the best horror board game and one of my favorites!!   Strong unpredictability is what make it so appealing!  May the Haunting begin!!!   Who's the traitor??!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to pick up until you the haunt happens where it can get a bit delayed if the traitor is a non-gamer.

Mindless, random and luck based during exploration phase and can get really imbalanced when the haunt happens and the traitor becomes the one with the best cards.

That said, i see this as a fun game to play...just don't think too much about the mechanics and if they make sense...since those should not be the point in playing this one.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy this game, especially the initial exploration phase. Moving and interacting with the rooms is supported by intuitive mechanics. While I appreciate the huge variety of haunts, they can be overly convoluted for non-gamers, grind the game to a much slower pace, or lead to quick and anticlimactic endings. It's these haunts that make this game horribly, horribly broken.

The dozens and dozens of tiny tokens make this box an absolute nightmare. If you have access to a 3D printer, I highly recommend printing an organizer, available on Thingiverse. There's a separate listing for a lid made by another individual. It makes finding tokens much easier, and you will no longer cringe whenever opening up the box.

It's a really intriguing game. Played for the first with some friends last weekend. Our first play through was over 2 hours, the 2nd was a bit less than 2 hours. Uncovering rooms and triggering events was surprisingly exciting to me. I initially rolled my eyes at having to put together a house but many of the rooms add a good deal of interest to the game. Switching to the haunt was definitely the highlight. Reading your new roles/goals, planning a strategy, and setting up the new board is awesome. 

That being said, the haunts that we did varied immensely in difficulty for the traitor. Replay-ability is also a factor. Since it was our first time all of the haunts were new to us. But, in the future if we were to get one of the same haunts both sides would know how to prevent the other team from winning. I guess that would allow more strategy but it would really suck for the traitor to have the rest of the group gang up on him. 

The amount of pieces is a bit daunting. SO MANY little tokens. My also group doesn't typically play dice games either so having 8 was new for us as well. On the positive side all 8 dice are the same. 

I would keep playing the game. Definitely at least until we get through all the haunts.

I love this game. I would actually rate it a bit higher, except for this one little problem... of the errata being almost as long as the rules. Playtesting and editing, guys. Still, if you grab the errata online, (most of it has to do with clarifications of various scenario rules), it's entirely playable, and has enormous replay value.

Fun factor depends a lot on the scenario, and the only one I played so far wasn't probably among the best. The potential this game has still emerged, hence the 8 rating.

Rating down 1 notch because of extreme randomness, that makes you feel like you don't really have much/any control on what's going on. The element of "exclusive information", quite unique to this game, keeps it still interesting enough to me.

Played twice to be sure the first game wasn't a fluke. The gameplay summary for this game is as follows: Spend 45 minutes moving 1-3 spaces then stopping and reading a card. Then the teams split up and spend 10 minutes reading their respective books. Then play a very unbalanced game where you're only aware of 30-50% of the rules until you win or lose without feeling like you actually did anything. Sold my copy very quickly

I don't mind randomness in games but this one has a bit too much for my taste. The theme is definitely there in this game and that is usually enough to paste over gameplay issues. In this game however it's just not enough. All of my plays of this have been underwhelming. One time it was a truly anticlimactic ending after acquiring a decent amount of gear, and the others I felt as if I did nothing but get abused by the game the entire time.

Get it if you can.  Nearly 100% of people who've played this game enjoy it, many will drop what they are doing when they hear that a game is starting up.

Almost fun.  I would love to have a decision in this game though, even if it were once every other turn.  The game is just entirely random.  The setup phase takes way too long as you are just toolin' around aimlessly building the house.  When the scenario finally kicks in they are unplayable out of the box.  You need the FAQ for almost every scenario -- this is unforgivable.  I don't mind random experience games (heck I love Tales of the Arabian Nights, but at least that gives you the illusion of control).  I can't see ever intentionally playing this again, there are just too many better games.

RATING: 6
The first couple of games are great, but especially the first part deteriorates fast in terms of fun since there are too few cards and it does not take too long to know them all. After that point it is just waiting for the horror to happen and although there are a lot of possibilities, pretty much none of them are actually balanced well, in most cases either the survivors or the bad guy simply stomp their opposition. But nevertheless a game which is fun for some plays and afterwards something that can be used infrequently a start-up before something bigger.

Rating after 1.5 plays at GenCon 2010.  The end game book is a really neat idea, but the game play up to that point seems directionless.  Maybe if you played a lot you would learn the value of which floors to explore and when?  I'd definitely play it again.

Definitely a game that is all about the experience. My rating may go up with more plays, but the unclear rules, and the difficulty of adjusting to a whole new set of them right in the middle, make this a bit less than I had hoped for. Every game, it seems, we find ourselves asking, "am I allowed to do this?" and "do I need to roll that again?", and just making up the rules as we go along.

Component quality in the second edition is simply inexcusable. My stacks of room tiles look like leaf springs from an old car.

Played this a few times with my teen board game club and they seemed to really enjoy it. They especially liked the 'secret goals' aspect of the game and would whisper conspiratorially to each other and seemed to have a lot of fun. My biggest complaint with the game is that there are so waaaay too many little counters and bits to sort through and it can take a long time to find the little bit you need when the time comes. I guess if I bought a bunch of little plastic bags and found some system of sorting them all it would help this a lot. It's not something I would play back to back several times in one evening but it is pretty fun exploring the house and setting off the random encounters and events. The most interesting thing about it is the 50 different goals that change the game each time you play and wondering who will end up being the traitor in the end. The teens in my club all wanted to be the traitor every time.

My girlfriend and I love this game. We've played several times in the last month that I bought it, and it serves as a great party game. Like most of my games, I put all of the pieces into little tackle box organizers, which is REALLY important for this game since there are about a jillion different tokens. Nothing kills the game faster than to have to spend five minutes digging around for the "Madman".

Semi-cooperative game with a traitor mechanic.  To be 100% fair, Betrayal is plagued by clunky mechanisms and unbalanced scenarios.  However the theme is excellently presented and the game truly shines as an experience.  In particular, the randomized haunt and the hidden information between the heroes and the traitor really add to the tension and make it a very entertaining experience.

My friends and I enjoyed the game quite a bit both times that we played. Some of the tile rules for the special tiles were a bit tricky to understand initially, and we were actually playing them wrong the first time. I think the game would feel a bit repeatative after a few plays since it's the same exact thing until the haunt scenario comes into play, but it's still enjoyable and I think it's a good game for friends who don't play a lot of games yet.

Amazing game. I have been lucky enough to be the traitor 3 of the 5 times we have played the game and it is SOOO MUCH FUN. I will say the game is far from balanced but frankly I don't care win or lose this is a great game. 

One small complaint was that during one of my 4 traitor experiences most of my moves where scripted to a point where I felt like I had very little control over the character. That being said I still loved playing the traitor because the thematical setting for the game is so dam good.

On the one hand, this game is a fun concept and drips with theme. On the other hand, the randomness can lead to unbalanced situations. In the first game I played, the traitor started in an untennable position and was quickly dispatched. Our second game was timed, and we had to stop before the end. Perhaps my rating will decrease if I play enough to start getting repeats in the scenarios. However, that only means that this game is ripe for a scenario expansion book. After my third game, I'm starting to think that the Omen cards come out to fast and the Item cards not fast enough. After five games, I've played only one in which the haunt portion seemed balanced. In all the others, the situation was hopeless for either the traitor or the other players.

RATING: 7
Betrayal at the House on the Hill breaks my heart. I absolutely love the way the game works with the exploration of the house, the finding of objects and the creepy omens. The atmosphere of this game really shines. Particularly when assisted when people really get into it.

But then the game screeches to a halt for the 'haunt'. 

The idea of the haunt is good in that each time a different story will occur based on the things that the players have done so far, but the different rules for each haunt are what really break the game's flow. The traitor has to go off (often having to literally leave the room) and read a few pages of rules and everyone else has to get to grips with new rules as well.

This can be particularly difficult when you are playing with people who are not especially used to this kind of game or there is one person in the group who is not comfortable with reading, doesn't understand rules easily etc. and then they are the traitor.

I wish the creators could come up with a way to make this all work better but I suspect the problem is too deeply entrenched in the game to be fixable....

A friend once told me that this is a really entertaining game. 
He was right.
I played it several times and it is always funny. Gameplay and mechanincs are easy but interesting and well designed imo.

The Game itself does not contain alot of miniatures or tiles with extra ordinairy artwork. Enemies are usually only little markers. 

But the Storyline and the huge variety of scenarios (several dozens) combined with the horror themes (lycanthrophs, vampires, ghosts, Frankenstein) always make me grin deviously.
Every game is different due to the puzzle like maps and events. The real fun starts after the haunt begins and the parties get assymmetric information about how to win the game. The scenarios incorporate FFA, 1 overlord against the rest, 2 teams and hidden traitor, backstabbing (maybe more, i dont know all scenarios).

I absolutely recommend the game for friends of explorative semi coop games with a favour for mystery/horror themes, but: u should have fantasy. U dont get miniatures for all the evil minions. (nothing for pure fanboys of cool plastic-matter)

My advice: play it with more than 3 players. The more, the better.

First off, I'm not that into the horror theme, so that doesn't help. I appreciate the creativity in the variety of scenarios, and for fans of horror, I'm sure they appreciate the theme.

I personally don't enjoy the randomness of this game. The tile building system is interesting but that's the only random thing I enjoy. I don't feel like I'm having 'fun' in this game when I play. I just move and roll, move and roll, oh now my friend is a bad guy, let's hope the randomness allows us to stop him. Oh, we won/failed. 

I don't think there's a strong narrative to be had, other than the loose (and inexplicable) group of 'friends' being betrayed in a non-spooky house.

I like playing this, but only with the right crowd.  It's certainly not for everybody, but with the right people it's a heck of a lot of fun.  The scenarios aren't equally appealing, so a game can be wasted with a bad scenario draw.

Played this with friends, and, while we had a good time, I don't think I would ever want to buy this for myself. I'm interested in all the hauntings, and I'd like to flip through the manual, but I don't really want to play the pre-haunting game a hundred times to see them all. I'd rather just host a game of Dread.

Crazy fun and a very cool theme! The rules are the downside of this game though. While the basics are clear, once the scenario occurs often the interpretations go astray. We have since improved our understanding with FAQ's & revised rules from this site. I don't believe we've played a game correctly yet, but we still have a good time with it.

Fun at first, gets samey quickly. The expansion helps, but to me, board game/ rpg hybrids rarely satisfy. Give me one or the other. The best mechanic is the differing objectives between teams, but this is constantly underutilized by the scenarios. Some are brilliant, most are underwhelming.

RATING: 4
Cooperative with hidden/random traitor.  Theme is great, components are crap.  Takes too long for the cooperative first half to trigger the hidden traitor.  Playing through the cooperative portion is dull and redundant after a few plays.  Too few cards and tiles means you've seen it all before.  Most of the time the scenario after the trigger is too heavily weighted toward one side or the other.  All that said, occasionally the game will fire on all cylinders and will be absolutely amazing; those moments are sadly few and far between.

This game has the largest enjoyment deviation I've seen.  Usually the haunt is really anti-climactic, and extremely lopsided.  Then there is that one game where it is tense and it's perfect.  The good games don't really make up for the crazy amount of broken anti-climax.

RATING: 6.6
Components - .7/1 Cards and tiles are fine. Points deductions come from 2 things. The "clips" that are put on the character card to track you skill points are rubbish. They don't have enough friction to keep their place at all so you spend an unacceptable amount of extra time trying to manipulate them or simply not blow away your current attribute values. This is such a pain point I took off .2 for it. The 2nd is that the rules for the haunts tend to be a little to ambiguous about some of the rules (this isn't every haunt) but it's happened on several. This causes issues because generally because of the nature of the asymmetrical information once the haunt begins. For example if the traitor doesn't understand, they have to ask one of their opponents to help (or spend time looking up the answer).  

Fun - .7/1 I think the people I play with have had more fun with the game than I have. That being said, most of my issues come well after play. I find that in the moment I'm having a good time so that's why it gets a high rating in this category. 

Replayability - .9/1 There are several dozen different haunts that are triggered by a combination of where the haunt starts and which card triggered the haunt. In addition since it happens based on a die roll it can happen early with none of the mansion explored or after everyone is properly tooled up. 

Strategic - .5/1 This gets a meh rating on the strategy because early on you want to explore, there isn't really any strategy, it's just explore and hope that luck of the draw gives you things. Then since the haunt is completely randomly chosen you don't really have much to decide with that either. Once the haunt begins, that's where you actually do have to make decisions. In the number of games we've played so far I find that there still isn't a whole lot of decisions, either you have the stuff you need or you don't, so you either need to go do what you need to with the items, or you need to keep exploring to acquire the necessary items. The traitor generally has the more strategic decisions to make in my experiences so far.

Theme - .8/1 They've definitely got the spooky house bit down. The tiles and the cards definitely reinforce that narrative. That being said, it's a bunch of haunted house tropes all encompassed in one so it does seems a little all over the place (hence the small point deduction). 


Personal Review - 3/5 It's a fun horror game that in my mind is really about the experience as opposed to the gameplay. I just don't know what else to say that I haven't already stated.

Great little game, very light, but a lot of fun due to the story that ultimately gets told.

I know some haunts are reportedly better than others, but that's ok.  The two I've played thus far have been very memorable.

Definitely needs the right crowd -- if a player isn't invested and willing to just let the story flow, it could really hurt the game.  But hey, no different than having a gamer who doesn't want to be at the table for something euro-heavy.

This is exactly how a game with a traitor mechanic should NOT be designed.

The game plays out with players picking characters and exploring a mansion waiting for something to happen.  Essentially the game's setup is "played" is the best way to describe it.  You unlock different rooms and collect items and special effects until a Omen roll is made that matches or exceeds the total number of Omen cards drawn thus far (so it usually goes until there's on average 6+ Omen cards drawn).

Then a player is randomly chosen to be the traitor and the scenario actually starts.  The traitor and the rest of the players are given different scenario books that detail their win condition and you play it out until one side wins.

This is not a good game.  I don't mind the random selection of the traitor, in fact Battlestar Galactica with a similar mechanic is one of my favorite games.  What I mind is the aimless first phase of the game.  You have almost no control over what you do, you're just discovering rooms aimlessly and collecting items and stat bonuses (or detriments if you're unlucky).  Then when a traitor is chosen you have no idea whether or not you'll be woefully unprepared for it.  In our game we actually explored a large percentage of the available tiles until the second phase started and it was nigh impossible to beat the traitor in the second phase.

You could even (though unlikely) potentially start the second phase with the first omen roll, or turn over 6 omen tiles in the first six turns and still start the second phase early.  With literally no idea what the win condition is for 3/4 of the game you have no idea what to prepare for.  Not that it would matter anyway since what stat bonuses and items you collect is completely random anyway.

Just no.

Played our first game, my wife became possessed.  Both girls worked out the hero strategy.  We had an easy time because the all the pieces we needed were already on the board.  As a result, the game was shorter than usual but we can see the games potential.  When the haunt started the game clicked for everyone and everyone was enjoying the game.  

Update: Souring on this game.  Too many fiddly rules.  Enjoyable for an occassional play but would not be disappointed if I traded it.

Heavily-atmospheric experience game.

Surprisingly, I like Betrayal at 2 players just as much as I like it at higher player counts, but then I'm biased towards two-player experiences in every aspect of my life, at least when the other player is my husband (awww). 

I don't like the pressure of being the traitor when in a larger group, so we have a house rule when playing with others that allows people to opt-out of betraying before the game begins. (Or to opt-out people for the good of the game... not every pre-teen is capable of going off to another room to read their part and devise a strategy.)

Those damn faulty sliders, though, right?

This game breaks my heart. I wanted to like it, but every ending devolved into a discussion on the rules and more or less just agreeing on a winning side. The exploration portion is decent enough, but really isn't all that interesting after 3-4 playings.

This is a GREAT game to borrow as it is a blast at first, but jeepers, does the return on investment dwindle after that!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The portion of the game before the haunt begins is pretty boring.  All you do is wander around a house, drawing tiles and cards until someone causes the haunt to occur.  It's not very interesting and after a while you'll see players get bored and ignore beneficial rooms just to get the haunt started sooner, which is probably not a good sign.

The flavor text on the cards is actually surprisingly eerie and really helps the game not become total drudgery in the beginning.  My favorite is a card where two boys are playing with a top and one boy offers the other the chance to play with it.  That boy, Jonah, then says, "No, I want ALL the turns," and beats the other child (presumably) to death with the top.  That's fucking brutal, man.

However, that may indeed be one of the problems with the game.  The flavor text is so good that the production quality just can't match it.  Sure, that might be a really cool text description, but the components are made out of relatively mediocre art and laughably cartoony drawings.  I thought the game was supposed to be more pulpy than the text makes it sound.  The problem seems to be that the graphic designers went the 1313 Dead End Drive route with the artwork and monster tokens, while the scribes (what do you call board game writers?) took a much more Edgar Allen Poe bent with the stories written on the cards and in the manuals.  It's such a cognitively dissonant effect that I can't decide whether the game is trying to be completely malicious or satirically cheesy, and it hurts any atmosphere that it was trying to develop.

Believe it or not, though, the haunt is actually worse.  Mainly, this is because every time you play, you're basically learning a new set of rules.  Some of the haunts are straightforward and balanced, but I am assuming that many are not based on our sample size (28 games, 16 of which were completely decided almost before someone even made their first move).  The straightforward ones are quick and fun for everyone.  The more complex haunts, however, are often total disasters.  If you don't have more than one person comfortable with reading and interpreting rules in your group, the game will basically turn into a complete disaster as one side does something that's not allowed simply because they mistook the rules for a certain action.  It is also hard if the Hero side includes a lot of visual learners, because then everyone in the group will have to read the rules to get them, turning the setup into a 20 or 30 minute slog as everyone familiarizes themselves with the objective and how they can accomplish it.

You might think, well, maybe that's a problem with your group.  Surely, I'll take that, if not for one thing:  the rules are also poorly constructed.  This is the major flaw in the game for me.  I could live with people flubbing a rule every now and then as long as the game were still fun or at least playable, but too often we've hit the haunt, tried to soldier through it, and just had to quit because the rules were ambiguous or unfinished.  We have to go to this room and make Knowledge/Sanity checks, but it doesn't say how many or what they do.  We have new combat rules that contradict those in the rulebook, but they aren't fully fleshed out so someone doesn't know whether a certain move is legal or not.  It's big issues like this that can often make the haunt unplayable, which then just kills the game and makes the initial 30 minutes of exploration feel like a waste.

So why a 5?  Well, I want to like the game and we HAVE had at least 4 good games of it.  Still, I fear that it may get traded if it continues to give us a horrible ending to a middling first act.

RATING: N/A
Not recommended in its current version, based on production deficiencies and unwillingness by WotC customer support to address the issue.

The 2nd edition (apparently it's 2nd printing of 2nd edition) has clips that are manufactured to work with thicker cards than the ones provided. They simply fall off and are utterly useless. The boiling water trick won't help, even if you hold the clips together with pliers while cooling; it's a different kind of plastic than the figures.

WotC customer support says they will to provide replacement clips (identical to the ones in the box, which means no help at all) but will not provide replacement cards (which could be glued to the originals, doubling the thickness and fixing the problem).

Anyone purchasing the game should know in advance that this is effectively a kit, not a finished product. In order to play you'll need to build up 24 card edges (6 cards x 4 edges) with tape of sufficient thickness to engage the clips, or find some other means (e.g. pencil and paper) to track stats for the characters. For a retail boardgame by a supposedly major publisher, I find that unacceptable.

RATING: 6.5
Okay, so this is not "Chess"!  In fact, it is rather the opposite of a "strategy" game, falling squarely into the category of an "experience" game.  In fact, in the first half of the game there is almost no strategy at all as you explore the house, and when the haunt starts and players have identified their new goal and seen the new house setup, the strategy usually becomes quite obvious.  Truth be told, you are pretty much there for the experience as the game plays you (just like if you were in a real haunted house!).  But the most important thing is, it is a FUN experience!  And with 50 possible scenarios, you get an entirely new experience every time you play!  Unfortunately, since this game was not properly playtested, a lot of work has to be put in before the first game can be played (downloading the updated Hero and Traitor booklets and FAQ, correcting wording on a couple of the cards, reading this thread... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/159868 ...in order to pencil in some changes to the updated booklets).  If not for this, I would have probably increased my "game design" rating to a 4.5.  But, in my opinion, it is worth all the time and effort (and paper and ink!).  In fact, this is one of the best "gateway" games out there, due to the fact that it takes almost no time to learn, it is largely a co-operative effort (you can always choose an experienced player to be the traitor), and, as I have already discussed at length, it is more about a fun experience than brain-burning strategy.  In summary: good times!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

This goes for $100 now?  Good lord why??  You move randomly around a random board having [i]no idea[/i] what the victory conditions are, then when the victory conditions are revealed (and even then only partly), usually the game ends almost immediately because the conditions cannot be satisfied by one side or the other.  Utterly, utterly pointless game, not even considering the massive amount of errata.

Now that I have played this game a couple times I have decided I like it rather well.  The different scenarios are cool and I like that you have to work together to try and prevail.  The modular nature of the house is also neat because you get a different house each time.  Overall a fun game that I think is a little underrated.

RATING: 6
Really dependent on your group and the Haunt IMO.  I've had rounds that I've adored and others where it felt like the game was punishing you for not dragging the game out.  When it shines, it's a classic.  When it fails you don't want to open the box for a month or two.

Theme runs deep, but B movie-ish.  Easy to learn and play.  Second play much better.  Components are fair, thick chits and modular board pieces.  However, modular boards were slightly warped.  Rulebook could also be clearer.  Game length is good at about 2 hours.

RATING: 8
Rated highly despite how hard it is to figure out how to play some of the haunts. (Note I have only played the older version of the game; I hear the newer one has clarified all the haunts, which would be great if it's true!) Normally rule problems like that would cause me to lower my rating, but in this case the sheer enjoyment of being immersed in the Z-grade movie world wins out. My teenagers love it and even my wife will play.

Similar to Arkham Horror. We jumped on it when we were all beginner board gamers and no one could really explain the rules correctly so this is gathering dust until we dig it back up.

RATING: 6
This game is all over the place.  Sometimes it's too long, sometimes it's very short.  Sometimes it's a close, down-to-the wire win, sometimes it's a complete blowout.  Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes it drags.  I play it fairly often for its rating because it's hard to find good 6-player games, and this one scratches a particular itch.

The good: it's a nice bit of B-horror-movie fun. Some of the scenarios are incredibly interesting and tense (like a recent one I played that had the house collapsing as the heroes struggled to exorcise it). The random-traitor setup allows for some light screwing-everyone-over fun without the desperate keeping-secrets tenseness of Shadows, which can be a welcome respite.  

The bad: Oh, god, attack of the zillions of indistinguishable bits.  Why not have a few generic bits that say "Monster" or something, rather than 10,000 little circles, some of which say "Rat" and some "Dog" and some "Aliens from beyond the grave"?  It makes it impossible to find what you're looking for unless you have a really OCD storage system.  The scenarios can be terribly unbalanced, or they can be really boring for the traitor (one had me doing nothing but, I'm not joking, reading results from a die-roll table every turn to the heroes. That's it).  

It can still be a decent game, but it could desperately use a reprint with some rules clarifications and overhauls and a solution to the bit problem.  I'm not sure it's worth the slavering, pay-100-dollars status that its out of print nature has bestowed upon it.

D&D light, not *that* much game to be found in here but what there is is thematic, suspenseful and entertaining.

Great theme. Takes a few turns to really get into each game. Variety in the haunts is great. I've played a dozen times or so and would have repeated one haunt but we used the rules in the book which said just do the next one (or something like that).

RATING: 8
Carmen loves this game. It's a lot of fun, but it seems that whenever we introduce this game to a new player, they always end up as the betrayer and then have a hard time with the set of rules just for them. Still a fun game!

Also in the same box: Widow's Walk
Carmen and her group have played the game with the expansion several times. They like the additional room tiles, but they don't care for the scenarios as much as the base game. They seem like slightly different variations of the base stories but aren't balanced as well.

This game is quite fun. I would almost classify it as a "party game" in the way that it gets people talking and laughing. Good fun! After a second play I'm a bit put off by all the missing and vague rules. I also don't like that you have to keep going back to the rulebook through out the game.

RATING: 7.5
Betrayal is love-hate for me. There are some freakishly good scenarios that keep everyone on there toes -- but many of them just fail to perform. 

Too often, a lot of time will be put into building the house, and trying to get the 'exciting' part started, only to have the action be short lived by it being too easy for one of the two parties. 

This problem is made worse when one or more of the people playing has never played before, and ends up confused.

That said, this can be very, very fun. Especially if you have some way to play in a funeral home (my first play ever) or in the middle of a forest (when we were teaching it to my family)

Game experience varies wildly.  Some haunts are quick, some are painfully slow.  Can have a great time, can also just drag on.  If you're playing with one or two new players, they are guaranteed to be the traitor (Murphy's Law) -- just have someone switch characters with them.

Update: Bringing it down a notch.  3 hours of pain in the last haunt, no fun at all.  Experience is so inconsistent.  Need a break from this game.

RATING: 7.2
3-6 (best 5-6). 60 mins

Haunted house theme, with hidden traitor 1/2 way thru, with 50 unique scenarios. Not balanced, but fun and thematic, one vs many game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is interesting and unique. The board builds itself and the 50 different scenarios allows for ultimate replayability. The haunt mechanic is key, as it picks a random person at a random time to play out a random scenario for the crew to survive.  The game never plays out the same way twice.

Now this does cause some people trouble when they get fixated on a knowing the rules and knowing what to do at all times, but this game is meant to be played with a bit of mystery and secrecy.  The good guys do not know what the bad guy knows and vice versa, including abilities and what objects do under certain circumstances, and even often how to prevent catastrophic quest failure.  

To enjoy this game in the best way, have at least 4 players, (hopefully a full compliment of 6), and don't focus so much about not knowing what to do.  Try things and move on. Failure is a surety for someone, and the game is balanced pretty well, where the success or failure of the mission is going to rely on the relative tactical skills of the party and the betrayer.  You are going to lose half the time.  

If I had any gripes about the game, its that the shere number of tokens you need to search through in order to find what youre looking for makes the game flow slow down for a bit, but separating these out in advance could help. Also the figures, (only 6, one for each player potentially), are a bit flimsy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much of a "game" in the 'strategize, play to win' sense, but lots of fun anyway.  Definitely has problems though.  The big flaws (IMHO) are not the imbalance or the sometimes unclear rules, but the haunt normally does not offer options or encourage movement; it simply becomes a question of hoping you roll better on your combat rolls than the foe.  Scenarios that encouraged running around the house would be much more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Purchased at Toys R Us in early 2008 or late 2007

This is a great choice if you're looking for more of an experience than a game.  You really are best off with at least 4 players IMO, but some people play with less.  It would probably work, but there's much better choices for 2 or 3 players.

A fun and easy co-op game where players explore a haunted house until inevitably one of them betrays the group.

Fantastic game, very dynamic, plays fast and the replay value is just insane, I actually think this game has the biggest replay value among all the games I currently own. The concept of traitor is brilliant in Betrayal - you never know what may happen in the next turn(s)! The amount of stories (50) is also very impressive. The only downside of this game is the quality of certain elements (e.g. the train counters for the characters, but it's not really a big deal can be easily fixed with transparent tape).

I'd also say that this is very very light version of Mansions of Madness (which I also really like and enjoy).

I am a fan of thematic games, this scratch the itch of good old day when haunted houses were still a thing in my childhood lol, while the game seems to be imbalanced, i just loved to play it with my thematic groups... coz they are easy to set up and the game time is very friendly around 1 hour. 
Maybe if they come with better minis and trinkets for the sake of good atmosphere, i would rate it higher. but again this is an old game of 2004, cant expect too much quality if its components compared to mansion of madness from FFG.

Betrayal can be a lot of fun. It has a very well established campy horror-flick feel, an entertaining exploration mechanic, a hidden traitor mechanic, and an absurd number of possible end-game conditions each with special rules for both the traitor and the rest of the group. The trouble with Betrayal is it's lack of depth. Players explore the house and roll dice until one of them trips a supernatural switch by mistake and becomes the game's villain--a role which up until that point was fulfilled by a predominantly harmless house.

This is essentially a party game that dresses up as an Ameritrash game for Halloween. It requires a large group to work well, and relies on the group dynamic and table chemistry that results from the theme to elevate this game above average. It is a game worth playing once, and worth adding to your collection if you enjoy the theme and feel enough. The dice rolling can get a little bit fiddly for non-gamers and the absence of strategy can be taxing for gamers, but overall it can be a lot of fun to play with a group looking for a casual, thematic experience with some dice rolling on the side.

another party game with hidden identities. I think it is a bit overwrought and the person playing the bad guy or whatever it is has to know what they're doing. If you like lots of theme and stuff you might like it more. (original comment 5.29.13 after play with Dumfries group). I have down graded this a little as like so many games, the time factor is too immense for the little choices you have. Too  much down time, too much luck/random stuff. Oct '15

Horrendously bad.  Absolute garbage.  Mechanics, components, rules, the whole lot.  One big dookie sandwich.  I simply do not understand the appeal.  This game is random layers on top of random layers thrown together with a slight mix of completely broken mechanics/systems trying to justify these layers of broken randomness by calling itself story-telling game.  I'm almost as much a game collector as I am a gaming enthusiast, and I couldn't help but give this game away, and that was after I was on the verge of simply throwing it away.

Played twice, won once, lost once. Once the haunt begins, it depends on the haunt whether it is interesting or not. Didn't like the fact that one player has to read special rules mid game. Good replayability though, and I like that each character has different abilities.

A fantastic game for all horror fans.  The house builds through random tile selection and placement.  This combined with the 50 scenarios for how it can become haunted make this one of the most replayable game I own.  There is a good balance of secret information for the traitor and the rest of the group.  Best played with 4+ people.

After finally getting around to playing this game, I found it to be a little "clunky" with rules problems, and some scenarios that were near impossible to complete that makes the game drag on and on. Despite all this, we had a good time playing this and wanted to play more. The fun factor is definately there and I had a good time playing, but I think others in my group enjoyed this a lot more than I did. I am sure that when I get through more scenarios and the rules become more clear through experience, I can give a truer rating... for better or for worse. UPDATE: I traded away my copy of this game.

I've played this twice now and both times it has fallen really flat for me.

Wandering around aimlessly until something (entirely random) happens is not my idea of a fun game. Do I want to stay close to the others in case I turn out to have to kill them all, or should I keep my distance in case they're trying to kill me? Since there is precisely no information to base the decision on, it ceases to be a decision.

Just awful.

This game is easy to learn and quickly explained - that makes it very accessable for non-gamers.
I also love the re-play value this game has thanks to its 50 scenarios.
The first phase can become a bit boring, when you just keep adding rooms and reading cards (mainly event cards), as there are a lot of rooms with card icons, and movent has to stop when entering such rooms. Player could feel like they can't do a lot.
That usually changes once the haunt phase starts - then the game can become a crazy race for the lifes of the survivors.
Sometimes, the scenarios can be over quite quickly, just because the important rooms are already revealed and close to each other. This is (of course) a bit unsatisfying.
On the other hand, other scenarios can be a crazy race against time (and each other) and make you burst with laughter.
Games never last too long, so even if you had a "bad pull" in one game, the next one to make up for it can just be played straight afterwards.

What do I say about Betrayal? Betrayal was, for a long time, my favorite game. There's a reason for this. There really isn't another game that does what it does well as well as it does. You're exploring a spooky house with your friends. Spooky house things happen! The flavor text is wonderful. The scenarios are varied and you don't know which one you might get going in. That said, it's really random. You could start a haunt almost dead. You could start a haunt with seven items and your skills buffed highly. It rarely has to do with skill. New players playing as the traitor can break the game. The scenarios being triggered in a certain way can break the game. The game can break with little provocation. But until there's another non-mythos horror game with this lovely atmosphere and feeling of exploration, I'm going to hold onto this one and keep breaking it out on nights when we don't quite feel like playing something else.

Ez a játék nagyon komolyan akarja magát venni, de ne dőljünk be ennek! Ez egy ízig-vérig horror-vígjáték, ahol az elején meg nem lehet tudni, ki lesz az "áruló", aki majd a többiek ellen fordul. Összesen 50 különböző scenario, végtelen számú házlehetőség. És a végén mindig* győz a ház. Közben pedig nagyokat lehet kacagni a legabszurdabb helyzetekben, pl a varázsliftet hibátlanul kezelő sárkányon.

This game is screaming for a reprint. New scenerios, tighten up the ruleset, clarify the haunts. Fun, but could be better

Components are TERRIBLE, especially the character sliders. Warping tiles, bad cardstock. c'mon, Hasbro......do this one right.

Probably one of my favorite board games to date. I always love playing this game, probably to the point I've made my friends stop enjoying it ha! I love the game's tile exploration and the mechanics behind the omens. It will never stop being a fun game to play with at least 4 people, while less is still fun, 4 gives more variability.

The good part of this game is when you build the 3 different floors of the House. The bad thing is nearly everything else, beginning with the holes in the rules (just look on the Wizards-Website and see how long the erratas are) and ending with the fact that the game is not adjusted to the number of players (so you're mostly doomed when playing the traitor).

A pity, as the game looked very promising in the beginning.

Betrayal is a great story generator, when it fires on the right cylinders. But it's nothing more, and the parts are hella random, so the experience is fragile.

Your traitorous scientist could hatch a mad plan to collapse the house into Hell, and then immediately trip down a coal chute to his death.  This summarizes everything great and terrible about the game. 

On the other hand: "Hey guys, I'm going explore this spooky old house. [i]I don't know what the fuck is going to happen.[/i] Want to join me?"

Great atmosphere, one of the more fun and unique games my group plays.  My only complaint is the lack of concrete and sleek rules... I love flipping through a FAQ as much as the next guy.

Literally Scooby Doo in a box.  This is a cooperative game where you and your cast of characters get locked into a large, deserted house.  As you explore, you uncover haunts that eventually turn one of your party members into a traitor, completely changing the game into a race between the traitor and the rest of the cast on who can complete their objectives first. It is a highly thematic game, so put your roleplaying hat on and grab a drink.  Time to find out why there's a surgical room next to the kitchen upstairs and a crypt overlooking an underground lake downstairs.

The story was well developed, at least the scenario we played, but I seemed to be waiting on other people to finish their turns and forgetting what was going on.

RATING: 7
This game seems like a really hard thing to judge at first play since there is so MANY ways it can turn out.  First thing I noticed half way through play is that it needs little baggies like NO game before it due to all the little cardboard chips.  I really enjoyed the tile laying aspects and the interesting events that unfold through its exploration.  We had an underground lake scenario for the finish and we ultimately lost to the monster, either way the game switched gears into something else entirely at this point.  My rating is based on simply entertainment value, at first glance it appeared fiddly, but it wasn't.  I'm really interested in giving this MANY more plays.

I played this game with some friends one summer when I was installing alarm systems in Orlando, Florida. It's an incredibly fun game with lots theme and great traitorous twists (hard to beat too). I will say though, the friends who introduced me to this game are hardcore gamers and I doubt any of my family members or current friends would enjoy playing this (or at leat they would never attempt to play it). Still, I think that if you're going to play a board game during Halloween, it's got to be either this game or Mall of Horror. High tension, crazy monsters (or Zombies) and tons of betrayal. Yum, yum.

Tiles may come warped due to packaging issues.  I have requested replacements, but it is unclear if the request will ever be fulfilled.

Tiles were eventually replaced, but I'm a little disappointed that they moved to a more generic token system as opposed to the specific tokens for every element which made packaging them up into discrete baggies for scenarios easier to do.

This has been a favorite of mine since I first picked it up in 2010. I am a huge fan of themed games. This game is dripping with theme. You are just a lone soul trapped in an eerie house that seems to have a mind of its own. But you are not truly alone, for there are others trapped in there with you. You might trust them from the start, and maybe you will even help each other out when your flashlight goes out or when something terrifying grabs you from the darkness. But soon enough, one of those strangers will betray you. The atmosphere is always so tense and mysterious. 

The mechanisms are very luck based. Most things you encounter will require dice rolls, and some characters are better at certain things than others. However, I think this fits will with the uncertainty and mystery that comes from the act of exploring a strange house.

The fact that there are so many scenarios is what really drew me to this game. You will rarely hit the same scenario twice if you play this game often. I have played this game over 20 times and the most times I have done a single scenario is 3.

This game is a good one to pull out during Halloween or if you have a group that gets really into the theme of the game. Again, it is one of my favorites.

My biggest gripe would be that the books should tell you what the other group should know or not. In our haunt, the heroes were told how many hits the monster needed to take, but the traitor didn't have this information until we have him a way to track his damage.

Another thing is that some information seems to be shared when it shouldn't. We were told the revolver doesn't work on the monster and the traitor was told that too. He felt it would be cool for us to have attempted to use it only to find out it didn't work. I agree with that because it would have been a good moment thematically.

I also don't like the fact that some of the haunts base the amount of damage something might need to take on the number of players. It seems a few players die within two turns of when the haunt starts, so you have to count them but don't get their help at all. Scenarios are either too easy or too hard because of this.

The good news is that this is all dependent on the books. AH can sell an update or expansion with two new books and maybe a sheet of counters to fix these problems or make corrections. Maybe add a few new room, too.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - Exploring the house is great fun and finding the various things that inhabit the house. Characters are affected physically as well as psychologically which is perfect for this type of game. Love how the tension builds that the something will eventually happen. It looks like there are lots of possible scenarios to play out. Would be a great spooky game to play with candlelight at night.

This was one of the first games in my collection and I really liked it at the time. As I've played better designed games, its flaws have started to stick out like a sore thumb. The first half of the game is pretty boring. You are just moving, collecting stuff, and really just waiting for the haunt to happen which is where the real game begins. Once the haunt does begin, however, the game is often times not really balanced at all. 

Really, the best way to look at this game is as storytelling game with little strategy. I have nothing against games that focus on the story, but I never really feel engrossed in the story that unfolds in Betrayal. 

I will still play and enjoy the game, and I will always have a bit of nostalgia associated with the game. My hunch is that I will continue to play this game quite a bit (especially around Halloween), but its luster has faded a bit with time.

A co-operative game, where you run around aimlessly for a while and then someone becomes a traitor?  I was skeptical, partly because I dislike [thing=37111][/thing], which has a lot of similarities.

[b]Pros:[/b]
:star: Unique characters and stats are somewhat amusing
:star: Huge variability on the scenarios

[b]Cons:[/b]
:nostar: Basically no decisions the whole game
:nostar: Co-op then random traitor mechanic means the first part isn't really co-op at all because your best chance of winning is to make yourself strong
:nostar: Theme relies heavily on flavor text instead of mechanics
:nostar: Midpoint of the game (where traitor is revealed) breaks the immersion because now you need to figure out how the rules work.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
Wow, was this a dud for me.  The first part of the game is so structure-less.  You move to an open room, flip the tile, possibly roll some dice, then possibly take damage or get an item.  There are virtually no decisions at all or the decisions are obvious.  The cards have some flavor text, but relying on flavor text alone feels very dated to me.  I just didn't get into the theme, and the theme is the only reason to play this game.  The twist in the middle was an amusing story, but then again everything felt quite obvious.

To be honest, part of my negativity may be because of how poorly I did.  Every card I flipped over was negative, and I failed just about every roll.  My physical stats were reduced to the minimum by the time the twist came around, then I turned out to be the traitor and the other heroes just slaughtered me and my minions for an easy, anti-climactic victory.  I felt like I was just watching a bad movie for an hour instead of playing a game.  Hopefully I never have to play it again. 

UPDATE: I let myself get talked into another game of this and it was another miserable experience.  An hour or so of aimlessly wandering around a mansion and watching random events happen at me, followed by the plot twist.  In this game there was a dragon and some ancient armor we had to find to defeat the dragon.  We got the sword and armor on one person before everyone else died.  Then the epic battle with the dragon!  Except, both the dragon and the "knight" had damage reduction built in.  After 30 minutes of swinging back and forth and neither person taking a single point of damage, we decided to call it a draw.  

What a trainwreck of a game.  [thing=205059][/thing] has a similar theme but is 1,000 times better.  I will do everything in my power to avoid playing this again.  I am completely baffled by how this game is ranked in the top 500.

I would never call this a "great" game -- there's a serious luck element to the first half of the game, and it's frustrating to have your character start the haunt badly mauled by a variety of events or room tiles you had no idea you were running into.  That frustration doubles if the traitor is the one player who avoided all the pitfalls and is now armed with dynamite and a revolver.

But the haunt...ah, the haunt changes everything!  It's still a bit easy to get screwed over through no fault of your own, and an early or late haunt can certainly seem unbalanced.  That said, no one I play with seems to care, ever.  It's pure survival-horror fun, and the unpredictability makes it thrilling.  

It may not be great, but it is fun, and that's still a big reason why I play games!

Played it a couple of times and now I'm cursing myself for not getting into boardgames back when a person could actually buy this. Now I've got to wait and see if I can score a good deal from eBay... blah! Really great game. Love the theme. Love the bits. Sure, it's Ameritrash, but at least it's *good* Ameritrash! :)

A light hearted dungeon romp without enough decision-making.  Broken without the massive errata list.Update - played again.  I can't figure out why I rated this a 4 in the first place.  If anyone forces me to play one more time, I might have to rate it a 1.

RATING: 6.75
This is my initial reaction score. We got a weird first haunt which put a damper on my excitement, but I'm pretty convinced the right group of people with even a decent haunt would be a good time. 

Update: With a better haunt and a more open minded (read: eyes actually open) group, this game was much more fun, but it's still massively flawed.  That being said, I wouldn't say no if an excited group pulled this game out and asked if I wanted to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The reigning group favorite.  Just a ton of fun, clever mechanics, and a different game every time.  Yes, the mechanics are deeply flawed and often unbalanced during the Haunt, but the stories more than make up for it in my opinion.

A gleeful Ameritrash romp where the end-game is all too often anticlimactic. Some of the haunts aren't much fun at all, some are situationally fun but fail because of specific house setups or other factors. But when it works, it really, really works.

RATING: 6
Played it and didn't love it. The game would be a great family game because of the variety it offers in different scenarios. But it doesn't lend itself well to children as many (maybe all?) of the scenarios require at least one player to leave the room and read his/her own set of rules at a certain point in the game. So it doesn't work well for children.

Having played this one a few times now, it's definitely grown on me. The replayability has made it a lot of fun, but more than that I've found the last few games really wind up getting a good storyline going, and even with just some three player games we've had a lot of fun with it. Some of the rules have been a bit confusing (the blob, for example) but using the "resolve confusion in favor of whatever will make the game more fun" rule seems to have served us well. Looking forward to trying it with some larger groups, but it's been great so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Outstanding replayability! Immersive, slightly unpredictable gameplay that adds tension as the game progresses. Extremely fun with appropriate background music and a group that is committed to playing a lengthy game.

From personal experience I can tell you that a good insert for this game will knock your setup time from 15 minutes to 15 seconds. And once you've experienced the headache of sorting through all the different tokens, you'll see for yourself.

It depends on when the Haunt is triggered if the game is good. First half starts off strong and fun, but some of the campaigns are less fun then the others.

I'm always the traitor.
Really easy to pick up on until the haunt starts where you're probably gonna be doing a little guessing and troubleshooting to figure out what you're actually supposed to do.
The tracking of character stats is really annoying because the pieces can easily be moved on accident.

RATING: 2
So, let me get this straight. I spend most of the game moving into random rooms, at which point random things happen to me? Fun. Say, what am I trying to do here anyway? Oh, I'm sorry, that's random too, and you don't get to know until virtually the end of the game. Hey, you might even be the bad guy and not know it, so better not try to cooperate with the other players to mitigate any of this randomness. If you value flavor above all else maybe you'll like it. I like actually making choices.

There are all kinds of technical/balance issues that I could point out about this game, but every single one of them is totally overshadowed by the amount of pure fun we have playing it.

More of a shared experience than a game, though there are some strategies to figure out once the traitor is revealed.

This game requires a LOT of fixing and needs to be played once to figure out how it all works.  But once you've done it the game is a blast! Buy some monster miniatures too! 

I cannot stress enough that you should download the correction and organization files.  Then be patient with the game the first time through, though it is a light game there are a lot of rules.

A real shame it is out of print.

Update: Rating stays the same. I cannot get this to the table. It has the same problem for me as Funny Friends - I am scared to teach it because it is so convuluted. Don't get me wrong, I really like it, but if a newbie ends up being the traitor they rarely know what the hell to do. This should be a social/party game that I get played a lot, but it just doesn't work that way. I really do want to play this a lot more than I do.

Back in print now.  That is great.  




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

Seems like such a great idea for a game. The problem comes during the betrayal. After playing the game 5 times we always feel like, "that was it?" The time that it takes for everyone to understand the scenario leaves everyone feeling like we could do something else.

This game has a special place in my heart... it was one of the earlier modern board games I played, and I was completely smitten with the mansion building mechanic. If anything, I wish the game was just the first half of the game. Building and exploring the mansion is fascinating every time, but the haunts are generally unbalanced and uninteresting.

The game is split in two: 
1. You explore the house finding rooms.
2. One player becomes a traitor and must kill the others.

Problem is keeping the first part fun after numerous playthroughs. The second part can be over way to quickly if conditions are right. For new player being the traitor can be a bit daunting.

Great in theory but not so much after a few times round the bend.

This is fun if you enjoy B-movies and games with a strong theme.  If you want any sort of balance to your gameplay, you'll be disappointed.  Everyone works together for the first 2/3 of the game, encountering events that change your stats and your inventory almost randomly.  Then suddenly one of the players becomes the bad guy, a "plot" is read, and the two sides fight to the end.  The game has usually been unknowingly won or lost by the time the scenario is determined, though -- It all comes down to whether the items and rooms associated with the scenario have been found, or whether you had good luck with the random events that changed your stats.  Fun for what it is, though.

RATING: 6.5
While I do enjoy a well integrated theme, this game cuts a little close to role playing for my taste. I found the discovery portion of the game quite entertaining, but was put off by the second half when combat begins. I also don't particularly care for the way cooperative play is integrated into the game as it felt awkward and distracting (particularly the way cards are passed - just plain silly).

Break this out every Halloween, great game about looking around a strange house (Why is the underground lake upstairs?) and then some one (or ones) turns on the group and all hell breaks lose. (Figuratively and sometime literally) If I had one complaint it's that sometimes rules contradict and it really up to you how things work out (Rule book needs so much more to it)

RATING: 7.8
+ This game is a crowd-pleaser with it's thematic gameplay and it's ability to change the game with it's haunt
+ This game is not hard to learn which makes it a good beginner level game, but also provide fun game after game
+/- If you are looking for a strategy type game than this is not it, has a lot of luck elements, but that's what makes this game fun to play as it is not meant to be taken seriously. 
- Because it is heavy on the luck element, it can be pretty brutal on players if things are not going their way.
- When the haunt happens, the flow of the game shifts which is cool, but the time it takes to read the rules and get things worked out on the board can hurt the interest level of a game group (especially if there are new players).

RATING: 6
The theme and concept of Betrayal with the different scenarios just sounded amazing but when playing this - which I have done many times with 4 players - we never had that much fun with the game. The first "explore" phase is not that exciting and when its time for the haunting (when the scenario from the book kicks in) its either over very quickly or the rules are very confusing. I know many love this game but for us it wasn't a hit

One of my favorite games of all time. It plays differently each time and it has a bit of an RPG feel. The fact that there is a traitor in the game but no one knows who it is until a certain point is awesome. I love the exploring part, and while a few of the traitor scenarios aren't that great, most of them are amazing and there are a ton of scenarios. If you play a lot, you might start to run out, but you're going to have to play a lot. Love the theme as well, the theme is amazing and the feel is nearly perfect.

The problems are obvious, but WOW what a fun game. Dropped to a seven from an eight after a few games, since I've seen more of what can (and does) go 'wrong'. It's still a blast to play.

******

The 'problems' are that missions can be, by pure strokes of luck, incredibly easy or impossible for one side or the other. If a fluke die-roll brings out the haunt turn one, it may be impossible for the heroes to win. If it happens very late in the game, it may be a matter of taking object A (which they found early) to room A (which has been explored, along with the almost all the rest of the mansion, for the past two turns). As long as you don't play it too much, I think it's a definite winner.

Played this 4 times with 4 different groups of five or more people. Due to the random nature of the haunts and the way the board is laid out this game is really hit or miss. In my experience most of the haunts have been unenjoyable with the person running the haunted just going around the house haphazardly slaughtering the defenseless explorers. In fact, most of the time the haunt happens before we find enough items to even defend ourselves at all. I can see how this game would be fun, but because it's not consistently fun and disappointed so many groups of people before my very eyes I don't think it's worth buying.

RATING: 8
I played the 2nd edition with the Widows Walk expansion. Highly recommended! 

Things I love: The expansion does a great job adding to and in some cases fixing the game. (it finally gives the house a bathroom!) The randomized house structure keeps things interesting. Love the theme of the game. The mounting suspense/ dread as each Omen shows up is great and can't be beat. 
Things I don't like: Some Haunts are somewhat broken or unbalanced. Many rules are unclear and take frequent visits to the forums for fixing. Easy for players incorrectly play any of the myriad of one-off modifiers (events, items, room conditions, etc)
The Weird: Everybody has a pentagram room in the basement of their house, right?
 For 100 possible Haunts and a dozen plays or so sessions it feels like I've experienced multiple haunts 2 or more times. Not sure why that keeps happening. 

Some games go quickly, some take forever. Just keep an open mind and enjoy it for what it is. Scooby Doo + House on Haunted Hill + Random cliche horror movie.

One of the most thematic games that I have ever played. Each of the haunts tell a different story and the rules reinforce it. It is harder to play with new players due to a rule book with a lot of rarely used rules and because they have to learn a new haunt each game. The success of each team is very luck dependent.

Despite all of its flaws, the stories it tells are worth it.

This game is a fun experience. It's held back by two things: a slow and aimless initial exploration stage, and a tragically poorly user-tested rulebook for the traitor stage of the game. More than half of my plays of this game have involved one side or both seriously misunderstanding a mechanic of the Haunt. Even when both sides interpret the rules correctly, the game can be horribly unbalanced due to the random state of the explored mansion when the Haunt begins.

Its a nice light romp through a house you build.  I really enjoyed the house building.  I think I enjoyed Drakon for that a bit more.  As far as a read a whole bunch of cards adventure game, this is shorter than most.

I like the game and haven't come to a haunt yet (after about a dozen plays) that we as a group of gamers couldn't over come.  Sure some of them took some discussion to decide what the rules meant, but each one seemed to work out.  Avalon Hill as well as this website has done a good job pin pointing what appears to be all the errata and dispelling it.  I would not suggest this game for new gamers as many reviews have simply because it might frustrate them to not have perfectly clear rules.  Long time gamers who are willing to debate and make house rules will love it.

Not really my kind of thing, but I'll gladly give it another go, and I was surprised to hear from experience player that they've never had anyone but the traitor win.  Right there that takes most of the fun away for me.  Also, one of our players got stuck in the basement following the collapsed room, and never did find a way up the stairs.  That there wasn't a rule about this seemed absurd.

This game can be awesome, and it can totally bomb.  The problem with a scenario-based game is the wide range of ideal conditions under which the scenarios will function properly.

I really enjoy this game because I like its theme a lot, and the fifty different haunts, along with all of the different combinations of room tiles and event cards, make it so that the game never plays the same way twice.

The game has both cooperation (with your allies,) and competition (with your enemy,) at the same time.

The haunts also vary greatly. Some times the heroes will have to fight monsters, while at other times, they'll need to solve puzzles, and retrieve items, or bring special items to a specific room in the house.

Mansions of Madness is my 3rd favorite game, but Betrayal at House on the Hill is my 2nd favorite game, because I feel it's more haunted housish.

In most of the Mansions of Madness Stories, the Keeper is able to start putting monsters on the board from the beginning of the game, and even if they're not near the investigators, the clock is ticking. The players also sort of know what they've gotten themselves into, based on what actions the Keeper has in front of him.

In Betrayal at House on the Hill, there is no sense of urgency, at the beginning of the game. Your characters came to the house because they thought it would be interesting to explore it, not because they believed there was something going on inside, that needed to be stopped.

The players also have no knowledge of what the house's layout is like, and they can accidentally fall through holes, into the basement, and have other such mishaps.

The explorers will leisurely wander around the house, finding strange objects, and sometimes witnessing events that can't logically be explained, unless you accept that the house is truly haunted.

All this goes on until one of the explorers betrays the others, and the heroes must put a stop to him, if they want to leave the house with their lives (and the players had no idea which of the fifty scenarios they'd be playing at the beginning of the game).

I like this change of pace from leisurely (if somewhat nervously,) exploring the house, to frantically putting a stop to the horrors the traitor has unleashed.

I also like the zaniness of the house, that the Mythos cards in Mansions of Madness can't replace. The house's mystic elevator can go anywhere, the very walls themselves can swallow an explorer and spit him out somewhere else, and as I eluded to before, players can get lost in the basement.

Both games are great, but I just find the unpredictability of Betrayal at House on the Hill's modular rooms, wonky encounters, and fifty different Haunts a little more interesting than Mansions of Madness.

This game is pretty solid but there are some things that seem like they skimped considering this is a major release from a major company.  Things like the attribute sliders being a little too far away from the numbers and being a little sticky to slide, a total lack of artwork on the items cards, and lengthy descriptions you have to read through on the cards before you find out exactly what they do (this is fine but they should have just had shortcut symbols at the bottom for like Strength+1 instead of requiring the entire paragraph to be read.)

The game tiles and player pieces are good quality.  The monster and item tokens are tedious because their are so many of them and they all look the same.  After two plays, the traitor and his/her monsters seem overwhelmingly powerful.  Lastly, the instructions leave a lot up for interpretation, (aka house rules).  On the whole, not ready to give up on this game yet.

Whooah, I loved to play this game. Even if its replayability is limited, I think that if I ever play 50 games of this, I will get more than enough for my money. Now I need only to get it.

RATING: 6
If randomness is equal to replayability (it's not) this might be one of the most replayable games ever. The rooms came in a random order. The events, also. And, most important, the "evil" player and what he/she must do and what the others must also do in order to win the game.

It is somewhat fun, but BaHotR isn't balanced at all: some "missions" are almost impossible to accomplish for one side of the other. I'm still to see a really close game. Maybe I should play more, and I would see one or many, but this is unlike to happen.

The bits are cool, though.

I've been told by others who like this game that I just got unlucky with my play through, but this was pretty dull.  Walked between rooms, triggered punishing debuffs on party, then we had an event without even a betrayal.  I'll give it another try, but dubious.

This game has the potential for a lot of fun and teamwork with the right group. As long as people aren't caught up with perceived vagueness in the rules, randomness, imbalance, etc., it provides some good ol' run-around-and-find-stuff-and-hit-stuff fun. There is a huge lack of strategy, but it's got quick play and is often fun to look back on. This used to be a 10 for me, but my tastes have changed a lot since college.

There is so much theme bursting from this game that it's ridiculous.  It really feels like you're exploring a haunted house together, and the flavor text on the cards is strong.  The traitor mechanic in the middle of the game is just cool, and it is fun to see what each scenario has in store.  Yes, the game is fiddly, and yes there are some unbalanced scenarios, but all of that is worth it when you consider the quality of the entire experience.  This is the perfect game to play on a dark and stormy night, I really enjoy it.

This is a very fun game if you let yourself get into the theme.  Without the theme, this game would only be OK.  Focus on the fun of exploring the house and seeing what is around the next turn.  Unfortunately, many of the games end anticlimactically.

RATING: 7
Very interesting game that starts off as cooperative until the haunt happens and all hell breaks loose!  It sucks when the person that has gathered the most weapons and stuff becomes the betrayer because it makes that person harder to kill.  The game can be a bit slow with 5 players and it can take a while to build up to the haunt but when it does, and everyone reads their roles to begin, it gets really fun.  50 haunts give it great replayability.  Get the blood dagger!

I have only played this once so far and was surprised to find that it wasn't terrible. I received it in a trade and had read so many complaints about it. I am generally not very tolerant of errata and this game had plenty, apparently. I did print out the revised Traitor's Tome and Secrets of Survival, as well as the (always excellent) rules summary from Universal Head. Perhaps that helped, but it played smoothly enough. We didn't have to look up much in the rules. 

Still, it's not one I'll ever want to bring out in a hurry, so I gave it away to family of mine.

Betrayal at House on the Hill quickly builds suspense and excitement as players explore a haunted mansion of their own design, encountering spirits and frightening omens that foretell their fate.

An interesting game where you start out exploring a mansion together with your buddies ... then 1/2 way through the game things change and all of sudden it is everyone against the one who "betrayed" everyone else ... trying to stay alive.

The board is built as you explore, and the "betrayed" person is randomly chosen as the game progresses.

A quick, well-themed, semi-cooperative game where one player randomly becomes the antagonist midway through the game.

Some scenarios are well-balanced and interesting; others, not so much, so how much fun can vary quite a bit.  But, I've had some really great experiences with this game, so the few clunkers along the way are ok.

If a bit more effort had been spent on getting things balanced so that good experiences consistently occurred, I would rate this higher.

My friends really seem to like this game, but I find it a bit too disconnected. The beginning phase is extremely random, and the revelation of the betrayer halfway through doesn't give the game life until far too late. At the same time, having to go through an additional rules session in the middle of gameplay is very distracting.

The themes are strong, though, and the characters interesting. It just isn't for me.

Great beer & pretzel game that can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike. Played seven times sofar, and enjoyed it best with 4+ players. A lot of dice rolling, but the atmosphere is unprecedented and downtime is neglectable. Can be played in little more than an hour (with three players --- playing time lengthens considerably with each additional player), which suits the game perfectly. The game, however, is not to be taken too seriously: If you are looking for balance, look elsewhere :-).

Played this game twice before. Seems broken each time we played. The theme is excellent and quite engaging. However, the rule book needs to be rewritten. Perhaps a game you play occasionally and even then, sparingly.

03/2011: Played this game again and it was again, an anticlimax. The rooms in play were too close to each other and as a result, a very easy victory for the heroes. Not I would call an exciting game play for the 1.5 hours. Yet, There is so much potential in this game.

If you like Arkham Horror but don't want to deal with a crap-ton of card decks, this one is for you! The mid- to end-game is initially exciting, but lucky draws in the first half can swing the game in favor of the Adventurers or the Traitor later on. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but it's still exciting.

In the first game, the scenario we played ended up practically falling into the traitor's (my) hands.  In our second game the haunt started quite early.  During play, I noticed some potential holes in the rules, and clearly there are limits to the replayability.  Despite that, it was a lot of fun.  This game lives and dies by it's theme (pun intended), regardless of who wins.  It is similar to an RPG in that the rules are a framework and guideline, but if you are paying too much attention to the rules during play, you are probably missing the fun.

O.K.  Some revision to my assesment.  We just played a scenario that was nearly impossible, and implied several rule exceptions while explaining few of them.  There was also no traitor, so we had to run the monsters outselves.  I hope there aren't many other scenarios like this.

The main trouble with this one is that it's a game that takes longer than it should.  Very popular with my gaming set, I usually complain it's going to take too long, get assured that it won't, and then it promptly does. :(

I do like the way it allows one person to turn evil, however, so it's probably the standard of a "5" game for me--I am often disappointed, but I will still play.

My wife loves this game.

There are too many cheesy bits and counters; they could have made due with a lot fewer.

Rules are a bit fiddly and the health/sanity tracking on your character's board is frustrating. Thematically awesome, and the unexpected traitor mechanism can be quite fun, but also completely unbalanced. Basically: I play this for the theme, not the dissatisfying gameplay mechanics.

So far one play which was very enjoyable, inevitably some faffinf slowed things a little as people get to grips with the rules but I can see the rating going up with further plays.

Pros: highly thematic, storyline gameplay, semi-cooperative with traitor mechanic, moderate replayability with high number of scenarios to play

Cons: game length varies significantly with either phase of the game capable of being too short or too long, little strategic depth, limited player control, high randomness

Great theme but the flow of the game can feel really clunky with the pre-haunt and haunt halves. Additionally, there is the downside of having to look up and read the whole set of different rules for each individual haunt. Not necessarily a competitive strategy game, but one that is still quite enjoyable for its theme.

And there are 50! yes 50! different possible scenario's. Ton's of replayability!

RATING: 3.5
The traitor mechanic is something I've been interested in for a while. I was very excited when this game hit the table and went in ready and willing to love it. Unfortunately, the experience was dry and stale.

The gamestate before the traitor reveal seems to not matter at all. The players mindlessly roam the house, placing new tiles, collecting items and changing their stats until the haunt begins. 

Even though I was really bored by the time the haunt began in our game, it managed to rejuvenate my excitement - now the game really starts! The traitor left the room and read his instructions and we read ours.

When he came back, he was pretty confused (as he should have been) and we had to all read the "for the traitors eyes only" rules to try and figure out what was supposed to happen. Well, that was a mood killer. It didn't even matter because the traitor in this scenario (as the game has many different scenarios that can happen) basically doesn't do anything. In fact, we didn't even know if he was a good guy or a bad guy, or if he was even supposed to play. If he was a bad guy, and his goal was to kill everyone, then he was best just sitting still and doing nothing. It didn't matter because of how the scenario panned out, he was stuck, unable to move. The game then proceeded to end in a few turns because of random luck.

It was an incredible let down. Part of me wants to try again with a different scenario, but even the pre-haunt stage is an utter bore, so I'm not left with much faith in this games design and don't have much interest in giving it more of my time.

The only negatives I have with BAHOTH are the health markers (the little plastic pieces for the character cards). They do not grip the cards properly. You can easily fix this by lining the edges of your character cards with electrical or scotch tape, but games as amazing as this should be playable out of the box.

Replacing the cheap cardboard markers and tokens with small plastic 3D tokens would increase the visual attractiveness of this game but would also make the game more expensive. I will be toying with a 3D printer soon and will be attempting to create full 3D token kits for this wonderful, highly replayable, and easy to learn fan favorite of our tabletop group. I am also toying with the idea of creating 3D rooms to use instead of cardboard tiles... Our gaming group is also working on rules for 5-8 players (possibly up to 12) that will include a team of betrayers instead of a single betrayer to accomodate our ever-growing group of tabletop addicts, but I digress.

Amazing game with a few non-critical flaws here and there. With exploration, strategy, problem solving and minimal RPG aspects to this game, it is HIGHLY recommended for any gaming group.

A very thematic and fun game, with very minimal rules explanations needed before the start of the game (combat is unnecesaary until the haunt). With 50 scenarios, it provides a lot of variety. Sometimes the game can seem to drag on, however, particularly if you get a bad haunt.

The basic idea is very good but has these two flaws:

This is single-handedly the best board game I have ever played. It is always a blast playing with my friends and the seemingly endless haunts encourage massive replayability. The mansion changes every time you play, further adding to the strategy and general unpredictive nature of the game. While best played with 5-6 people, it is still entertaining with 3 or 4 people. I doubt you will ever have a bad time playing this game. If you like creepy B-movie style board games, you will most definitely want to try to survive a night of Betrayal at House on the Hill.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Do I enjoy it? I guess. As in, I enjoy it more than doing nothing. Would I ever pick it? No.
Let me outline what you do for half of the game: 1. Move into a room. 2. Randomly draw a tile and place yourself on it. 3. Draw a random card. 4. Follow card instructions, usually roll dice.
Does this sound fun? Let me continue. In Shadows over Camelot and Dead of Winter, one of you is a sneaky traitor. You lie and outwit those pathetic, honest do-gooders. And you know what? It feels good. Dang good.
In Betrayal at House, a traitor is randomly selected HALFWAY into the game. And it's no secret either, so there is no opportunity to trick your opponents. In fact, there's no teamwork either in the first half because what's the point? You might be helping someone who's destined to become the traitor get even stronger.
After the traitor is selected, you will play through a scenario with your friends. I have to give the game credit because it does have many scenarios. But this is also where the nightmare begins for me, or the shit hits the fan so to speak. This is where the rules get so darn fiddly it'll make you want to flip the table. Movement rules are so goofy, actions you can take are unclear, is there any reason to explore?... what are we supposed to do again?... so wait monsters block movement, but not when they are stunned. They miss their next turn right? oh shit the traitor took his turn BEFORE he took his monsters turns. Can I transfer followers? So if I drop this item you can't pick it up and use it because I used it's strength boost in a strength check on this turn.
What. A. Disaster.
Let me say though that it was not my game, and I had not read the rules. My friends watched a video of how to play the game, which was annoying so I had to go through the manual myself. STILL it was very confusing and I've played enough games I usually know this stuff easily. After several plays it's still just as confusing. I'm not kidding.
This game has great theme. My wife and my friend's wife like it. Something about a spooky house, ghosts, and monsters is fun. As a gamer though, I just don't see the strategy or anything else that's good about it.

A fun game that pits one player against the rest.  The trick is that you don't know which player is the traitor until some ways into the game.  There are lots of different haunts (scenarios) so no need to fear that the game will loose replay value quickly.  We played with 3 players and it was still pretty fun.  More players probably would have been better.

RATING: 6
This game unapologetically chooses narrative over gameplay, and it's so committed to it and sets the stage so well that it mostly works.  There's rarely an interesting decision to be made, but the atmosphere and narrative matches the gameplay well enough that you barely notice.  The feel of exploring a spooky house from a b-movie horror flick is captured perfectly.  Something about the discovery of the house by tile plays and cards fits perfectly with the setup of a horror movie.  The first phase of the game never fails to build up the suspense before the big reveal.

That's not to say that the game is without flaw.  The reveal is sometimes anticlimactic, as either the adventurers or the traitor have an easy path to victory.  The rules, even in the second edition, are a mess, and players need to be comfortable with houserules to cover the rules holes.  Characters have stats that mostly are irrelevant except as hitpoints, and the method to track these stats are chintzy little pointers that don't work well.

But all-in-all, this is a good value for a theme-first group.  You'll get plenty of plays out of this game before you get tired of it.

Build a haunted house room by room, then the cheesy 1950'ish horror story starts. The game wasn't quite as fun as I had hoped, as our first scenario was wildly unbalanced to the heroes side. And also due to the fact that my wife thought we were playing a euro, and was taking a long time on her turn to calculate all her potential moves, so the downtime for me the traitor was quite long.

All time classic thematic semi co-op game where one player betrays the group half way through the game.

Highly random setup adds a lot of variety, so even though there are a finite number of scenarios it never gets stale.

Occasionally the randomness can cause an individual game to be a bit unfair on one side and essentially a foregone conclusion, but this is pretty rare.

Would be a 10 but the component quality could be better in some cases.

As the first boardgame that I've bought, I really enjoyed the game!

Pros:
1. Every time you play the game, it's different! It was probably one of the first few games to have this feature. Not only is the map different (because you build the 'house' as you explore it), the scenarios are *almost* always different, too! :D
2. Interesting horror-themed game, where you explore rooms and don't know what will happen.

Cons:
1. It's a little old, and probably have some new games with similar mechanics in the market now.
2. There is a HUGEEEE amount of small tokens involved. If you hate tokens, you'll find this game to be rather troublesome.
3. Lack of expansions - lack of character variations. There are 'stats' for each character, but they have no unique abilities of their own. That's one of the biggest 'cons' for me.

Overall, I really loved the game! The amount of replayability makes the game very worth it, especially if you love the horror theme! :P

This game can be a bit intimidating for first-time players (particularly if they end up being the villain/monster during the haunt) but overall the game is super fun and engaging. I imagine House on the Hill is subject to some of the same aspects of unbalanced play that we found with Betrayal at Baldur's Gate, but so far all our play throughs have been great and all the different haunts have been entertaining. Really high replay value.

3 joueurs : 1e essai à 3 joueurs. 2 gentils contre 1 traître et les 2 gentils n’ont pas fait le poids. Après la partie, nous nous sommes demandé si cela était dû à notre configuration 2 vs 1 ou au scénario généré aléatoirement (et qui aurait peut-être mieux convenu à plus de joueurs).

+ Expériences multiples : personnages individuels personnalisés.
+ Icônes : sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
® Je crains qu’il retienne peu l’intérêt des joueurs lorsque le stade de la nouveauté sera passé.

Jeu de maison hantée où chaque joueur incarne soit :
A) un explorateur qui doit anéantir la(les) entité(s) maléfique(s) de la maison afin de s’en libérer;
B) un sbire (traître) au service de la maison et dont le but est de tuer les explorateurs.

1e essai à 3 joueurs. L’une des particularités du jeu, c’est qu’au début d’une partie aucun des joueurs ne sait s’il est un traître ou non, les alignements étant révélés pour tous seulement au déclenchement de la seconde étape de la partie appelée "La chasse". Lorsque la chasse est déclenchée, les joueurs doivent alors se regrouper selon leur alignement et lire secrètement le scénario qui s’applique dorénavant à eux. Cette mécanique de "2 scénarios secrets" a comme défaut que chaque groupe ne connait pas les règles particulières de l’autre et ne peut donc pas valider si celles-ci sont appliquées correctement ou non, ce qui fait qu’on se demande parfois ce qui se passe... De plus, si un joueur est seul dans son groupe (ex : le traître) et qu’il a des questions sur son scénario, il lui est quasi-impossible de se valider auprès des autres au risque de dévoiler ses informations confidentielles. D’ailleurs, je dois mentionner que ma première partie s’est déroulé avec une copie anglaise et que mon niveau d’anglais n’était pas suffisant vs l’abondance de règles et de "flavor text" à lire (et c'est pourquoi j’ai profité d’une opportunité de "suicide accidentel" afin de me sortir de cette partie). De ce fait, je considère que ce jeu est injouable pour une personne qui n’a pas une excellente maîtrise de la langue du jeu. À noter que si j'avais joué avec une version française, j'aurais été plus encouragée à continuer la partie malgré mon impression que le jeu a mal vieilli (très forte présence de hasard dû aux tuiles et événements piochés, ces derniers étant résolus en brassant des dés…).

Props to the game for having an interesting second half, but that first half is a bit too random for my tastes.  Once the traitor is revealed, and once the other players start working around the hidden information, it improves, but not enough for me to want to play this over and over again.  It's interesting enough to prevent me from ever refusing to play it on principle, though.

I like that players can't be eliminated before the Haunt starts, and the variety of Haunts. Some of the Haunts are poorly written/unbalanced but that's forgivable considering how many there are. Exploring the house has gotten a little boring at this point, though. I've seen most of the cards and tiles. Since exploring is usually the bulk of the game, I'm less excited to play this lately but will probably be enthusiastic about it again after a break.

RATING: 6
[1st edition] It could have been a solid 7, mostly for the theme, but it gets two votes less because of:
1) ugly bits;
2) incomprehensible rules (even with the errata).

[2nd edition] The second edition is an actual improvement on the first one (even if not on the bits), so it deserves at least a 6.

RATING: 7.5
I really like the concept of having a different haunt during the latter half of each game. It adds a lot of replayability to the game. However, I did find that, when playing with a small group of 3, some of the haunts can be largely in favor of the traitor. That is, the traitor will often get bonuses to stats to help make up for them being outnumbered. This, in general, makes sense. The problem is, in a 3 player game, it becomes 2 vs 1 during the haunt. This, combined with the increased stats, makes it extremely easy for the traitor to win as all he really has to do is to take out one hero. Overall, unless you are playing in a larger group or have uncovered most of the rooms before the haunt is revealed, my bets will go to the traitor winning.

RATING: 6
Fairly simple to learn and teach. The major selling point of this game is the replay value, but it fails here for me. The 2nd phase of the game is a somewhat randomized Scenario, but is generally over pretty quickly while the first phase is always the same. Long, Repetitive, and the only goal is to wait for the dice to start the 2nd phase. It's primarily used for theme.

RATING: 9
Betrayal is very interesting, the way you discover new rooms of the house, the omens, the events, the items... all of it is very good and a little bit scary, but when a member of the adventurers turns evil then it reaaaaaally is scary. Nice turn of events, the design is great, and the story you make on the way is really good.

RATING: 6
The rules can be a bit ambiguous at times, and I didn't love that so much of the win conditions came down to die rolls.  However, I think this is the type of game that's more about the experience than winning.

RATING: 10
Fun game with two phases: 1) exploration, 2) haunting.  All through out, this is a co-operative tile-laying exploration game of an old mansion.  When the haunting kicks in, one player betrays the others, so it's a contest between the betrayer and the rest of the players.  For the sake of variety, a book of scenerios is consulted at that point to find out how the game will proceed.  As the nature of adventure games, it's not balanced, but the end result makes for an interesting story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow, is this game awesome or what? OK, sure, there isn't much going on before the haunt, but afterward, everything becomes very tense and thematic. Since you never have to play the same scenario twice, the game doesn't get old and repetitive in the way that Arkham Horror does. This is a great game because not only do I enjoy it a lot, but very casual players do as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Betrayal is a nice alternative to other more complicated one vs. many games like Descent, Mansions of Madness or Battlestar Galactica. Gameplay is essentially a very simple dungeon crawl, but at a certain point the players split into opposing camps (usually one person becoming the villain) and then try to make their push for victory.

There is a bit of unevenness in the game's complexity. The exploration of the haunted house is right out of gaming 101, so players can get up to speed in 5-10 minutes. The haunt phase requires each team to add a page or so of secret rules to the game, so it can be problematic if an inexperienced player gets singled out as the "traitor".

The first half of this game would be a high 9 for me on the BGG scale. I thought that the exploration mechanic was extremely well-implemented, and the horror was handled in a better way than Arkham. I stopped logging my plays of games, so I've played this probably 8-10 times, and I've only had one fun haunt; it's always been wildly skewed toward the traitor or the team to the point of feeling very anticlimactic. I am very interested in the second edition to see if the newly rebalanced haunts improve this situation, because I really want to like this game.

Whoa, this game was totally unexpected and at the same moment it was one of the best board game experiences ever. I had to make my group play it and man, were we in for a ride.

This being a 3 player game I only rarely get to play it, which may account for the low rating.  I liked the game, being as it has wonderful high quality bits and pieces.  The fact there are so many cardboard chips put me out a bit, and it seems the game is tilted toward the traitor. Still, I will continue playing it when conditions allow.

Fun little traitor game. As most people have said there are some issues with rules conflicts but overall if you just go in to have fun it works out alright in the end. Have only been the Betrayer once so far. The start of the game before the Haunt is fine but once that kicks in, it's where the game comes alive. Or undead depending on the Haunt.

RATING: 7
I like co-ops. I like traitor games. I like horror.

So, I like this. Only played once, but the variety in possible outcomes seems like a huge strong point in the game. It does seem like that variety could lead to lack of balance, but I feel that a game like this is more about the journey than the destination.

RATING: 3
The crappiness of this game hurts all the more because the idea is so awesome.  But, man, there are a lot of problems:

1) The exploration mechanic is almost exactly like the old Mystery Mansion, but all the fun is killed by the fact that bad stuff, which you have *absolutely no control over*, keeps happening to you.  What this devolves into is finding one good room and "exploring" it repeatedly to beef up your character.  

2) The haunt is a really cool idea and can be fun if you can figure out the horribly written and error-ridden rules.  Basically, it works well enough if an experienced gamer gets drawn as the bad guy, and fails miserably otherwise.  

3) And of course, there is the ridiculous search through 10,000 chits preceding the haunt, completely killing the momentum.  Why, oh why, did they not just include 20 colored blocks or tiddly winks or some other generic bits?!  Do chits with the word "Zombie" on them really add to the atmosphere?  This is frankly one of the most glaringly stupid component decisions I've ever seen.

A very cool idea and some fun at times, but really poorly executed.  Here's hoping the second edition gets it right, because despite my negativity, there's a really cool game in here somewhere.

This game is solely for the atmosphere it produces.  Some of the Scenarios are really ridiculous, but at the end of the day I playing because of the crowd.  this game is by far one of my favorite games because its so easy to play and pick up and the feeling it brings for the right crowd is great.

only 1 play so far and I ended up being the haunt. It was really fun to play but my dice rolls were SSOOO BBADDDD that as the haunt I had essentially no power and I lost. Basically I just sat there while they performed their seance to banish me and win. So the luck factor was against me that night but overall the theme and play style was great. I'd play it again.

Rating of 7 seems like a low score as I did enjoy this game but it reflects that I feel I would need to be in right mood for it. I love how the rooms appear and are set out and the idea that no-one knows what they are doing for part one. It is not totally satisfactory that due to the luck of he draw the haunting can be over in two moves. Shame. Nevertheless it was enjoyable.

The rules are so fiddly in this game.  If you are the traitor you basically have to make up the rules as you go seeing as you can't confer with your peers.

It is a great idea, and I understand the dilema of changing one rule and checking against over 50 scenarios, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth thinking about it.  Past that it is a fun game.

50 ways to play the game, though every game starts the same. Fun, funny, and fascinating stories emerge as you play through the house. Expansion adds an additional 50 ways to play, so definitely has replay value. The fun isn't in strategic meddling and tactical maneuvering, it's about trying to hedge your bets against who in your party will go nuts and start hacking at people. It's about trying to figure out how in the world you are supposed to win and at the same time prevent the psychopath from slaying you all.

RATING: 6
In this horror themed game the most frightening part isn't any story, but those damn counter tokens that are supposed to keep track of your stats. They are a nightmare. There are apps to replace them but they're not perfect either. There are some rules here and there still unclear even after playing the game a bunch of times. Balance of the haunt scenarios is also always a concern. The game isn't perfect, but it is a great concept and its cons don't ruin the experience.

We really had fun with this game, until we discovered Mansions of Madness.  Additionally, my tiles have warped and are very difficult to play with.  I have since learned that this is a common problem with the second edition of the game.

But after giving this game a little bit of a break we decided to revisit it and we were not sad that we did.  We remembered how much fun the game can be and it has become almost new again.  And to top it off, I got replacement parts from the game company for my warped tiles.  I am very pleased.  

*EDIT*  I have since contacted the publisher about the warped tiles and received replacements in a very easy manner.  Much respect.  Great experience.

Fun lightweight game. It is interesting that halfway through the game one player becomes the traitor. Also has a really neat board creation system.

Played once so far and it's cool and creepy. I'd like to play more but haven't been able to round up two more people. :-( The issue of the rules being such a mess has made it harder to find people to play with.

Bought a replacement copy to give one more shot. Need to print out the replacement rules etc. Sold it on eBay. They're just worth so much! And I'm not so sure it's that fun of a game.

There's something about Betrayal that just doesn't click with me. I think there is a fun game in there somewhere but I also think the whole experience feels a little too "random" for its own good sometimes. I don't mind randomness in games generally but in Betrayal, it seems to get in the way more often that not.

Not a game I'd refuse to play but not one I'll tend to request either.

quite pointless. The idea behind is nice but the exploration is purely random, no real decisions, just random dice... for quite a long time. Then, all of a sudden, 3 rounds with an artificial aim.

Probably not my kind of game.

RATING: 3
[1st edition, rated at 3] Nice idea, very bad execution. 2 of my 3 games were abandoned, since important information was missing (we didn't have the errata)

[2nd edition, rating 4.5] Much better rules, but bad production value (warped bords, loose stats markers). 2 plays; 1st play was decided when the haunt started, since the traitor was in much better shape than the rest of the players (plus he got a monster); still had to play 30 minutes to end it. 2nd play was a traitor without any chance, but at least it wasn't known for the heroes how weak he was (but not much fun for the traitor)

Hit and miss group fun. When it's a decently penned scenario this game can be horrifyingly terrific. When it's a poorly conceived one the game feels terrifyingly horrific to play.

Every time I teach this game to a new group, we end up playing at least three games. The beginning is hokey. X amount of people start searching through this haunted-esk house. Then there's a twist, someone goes crazy. At this point, the players are divided between the Survivors and the Traitor with each receiving their own new rule book. The game becomes us versus him/her as the players act out one of fifty horror movie plots (randomized a card vs. game tile combination). In the end, everyone walks away feeling like they have taken part in an 'event', so there are rarely sore losers.

Unfortunately, this game has been discontinued.

I'd call this a cooperative game, though it isn't listed a such.  There are well documented production glitches, but all the same I've enjoyed all of my plays of this to date.

Our gateway game! Still love it and it got better with the expansion but my rating is based on the base game. After a couple of plays you've gone through all content (i.e. items, event, and omen cards). Though, I've played almost 20+ times and only got the same haunt once so replayability is still on point. Still one of my first loves.

I don't think I've ever played a game of this where everyone didn't have a good time. Starts off with simple exploration, and then gets tense real fast. Sometimes the haunt scenarios seem a little slanted one way or the other depending on the number of players, but overall pretty well balanced.

Also, every time I play with someone new, they're always the betrayer. Every. Single. Time.

For a short, light, storytelling experience, this game is a solid choice.  There aren't a lot of meaningful decisions to be made throughout, and that's going to bother serious gamers.  The gameplay is like reading the cards in Arkham Horror without any of the strategy stuff.  You kind of just wander around and stumble upon stuff. 

The lack of decisions isn't all bad.  This game works well with casual gamers, and I've brought it out several times with the extended family.  Like with Arkham Horror, the game is mostly cooperative which is nice for non-gamers, but unlike Arkham there isn't much worry about the Alpha Gamer/Quarterback problem since the decisions don't really matter anyway.

Fun game if you're okay with being taken along for a ride without much steering.

Oh, how I want horror games to all be really good. Horror and fantasy-themed games are my absolute favorites (screw trading sheep or slaves - give me a sword or a big nasty to fight!). But Betrayal fails.... It fails the same way all bad horror movies fail - by being uninspiring in the first half and by being predictable in the last. The premise here is good - ambitious if you will. The components are excellent. But then it all just falls apart. It's as disappointing as Hellraiser III or Omen II. Damn.

One of our favourites! Played it again after some time and it felt refreshing once more! Betrayal is one of those games that you can explain to new players in a very short time, then add more rules as the game progresses. Always a hit in our table, I cannot wait for the expansion!

Absolutely awesome game. I love the co-op portion of this game and also the fact you don't know who is going to be the traitor until the middle of the game is a really cool feature.

I like the theme and how the game prioritizes that over gameplay. It is also fascinating how the designer managed to make the game feel so different from one haunt to the next.

RATING: 6
Betrayal at House on the Hill has a ton of theme and is great for playing in October with people that can really get into the theme of a game.  It's a blast when you have the right people playing.  

The reason you need the right people playing is that the game has significant balance issues.  I love how you get a "random" haunt every time you play and the house configuration is always different as well.  The problem is that the haunting can happen way to early (or late) in the exploration and it can make it really hard to win for one side or the other (most often in our games it is the house/traitor that wins).  This is fine for those of us that play games for the experience and not for winning.  For those that want well balanced games and close competition, this game would not be recommended.  

We have a great time with it when it is the season, but otherwise it says on the shelf.

The perfect Halloween haunted house game. Find a better clip solution for the character cards but once that is done you will be given an experience that is like none other. At a point in the game one will randomly become a traitor and the others may have a chance to win the game. While it may be randomly unbalanced it is played for the experience. Best with spooky music and players who really get into the atmosphere.

So many errors and omissions and stuff in the rules/tiles/cards. Shame on Hasbro/AH for such shoddy editing and proofreading. 
But other than that, I like the game. Glad to see the FAQ is out. Have played seven games of this in about a month, with two or three traitor wins, (a couple of which might have been different with the errata). Very fun and a bit of strategy once the haunt occurs.

I was recommend this game at a con after playing Evolution and was wanting to get my hands on Betrayal, I don't regret getting this game as I quite enjoy it.

Betrayal is a game where you're a group of explorers exploring this old house with randomly generated rooms based on what tile you get, collecting items and such until the haunt begins when triggered. Once the haunt is trigger the game enters a new phase where you play a scenario that may or may not have a traitor among you. With 50 haunts there seems and sounds like there'd a a good chunk of replayability. Also there's dice rolling and skill checks like a DnD game which I like.

I enjoyed Betrayal and would recommend checking it out.
If I there were any cons to the game, I would say that everyone at the table needs to know how to read and I say this because I had someone in my group who DIDN'T know how to read and that was unexpectedly frustrating. Another is the rules are a bit unclear, and that replayability I mentioned earlier while is in theory true, but after a few games the first half will start to play somewhat samey as you see the same cards you pick up, the same room tiles, and you're really hoping that the haunt comes up because there's the main fun of the game. Though the first half could be considered the setting and stocking up as you prepare for the haunt which is a good mindset I'd say.

Would recommend at least a playthrough despite some issues

RATING: 7
Based on my one play, I wish that I had picked up a copy while they were still available at Toys 'R Us.

Overall, I imagine that my rating would oscillate wildly depending on the brokenness of the haunt and the length of the game.

Very good atmosphere game but kinda boring until the creature subverts one of the players. Good for what it is trying to do. The Avalon Hill version has a huge errata list that you need to have. You need to play with people that are fun to be around. (Could be said for most games. lol)

RATING: 7
Pros: 
~ Very good role play value.  You feel like you're in the house. Your mind creates visuals as if you were reading a good book.
~ The visual quality is excellent, particularly the house tiles and the little figurines for each player.
~ If you have (or are) a good game master, it's quick to get new players playing quickly.  There's only a minute or two worth of rules that you need to explain when you start, then you can just explain the rest as they come up.
~ Perfect for Halloween time!

Cons:
~ There are a lot of rules. It is highly recommended that the game owner learns the rules on their own first, then game-masters it for other people.  Do not unbox the game with a group and attempt to learn the rules all together; you'll get bored.
~ Given the high volume of rules, it's ironic that in pretty much every game, you'll encounter situations where the rules aren't solid.  If you're the type of gamer who enjoys the occasional make-it-up-as-you-go-along situation, you're fine.  If you're a strategic gamer who expects rules to be tight, you'll get driven a little crazy.
~ Caveat to strategic gamers: Although you make a lot of decisions in this game, you'll soon realize that your decisions are more or less meaningless.  The outcomes are almost entirely driven by the luck of the cards, house tiles, dice, and haunt.  

Overall this is a very right-brained game.  It is clear that the designers are very good storytellers and graphic artists, while being not so strong at writing tight rules and generating intriguing strategic decisions.  If you're into role play/storytelling/visuals/characterization in your game, you'll love Betrayal.  If you're into making strategic decisions, you might not like it so much.

RATING: 5
Despite 5+ plays, I have never been the traitor. Maybe my opinion of the game is skewed by that. Betrayal is definitely more of an "experience" than a game. It relies on the large number of possible traitor scenarios to keep the game fresh from play to play. The conditions which determine each scenario are largely random (though once you know what a particular scenario's conditions are, you can try to steer things in that direction, but I don't know how successful you would be) and the determination of the traitor is similarly done by looking at some arbitrary condition in the game which is satisfied by only one of the players. Exploring the haunted house can feel a little pointless and dangerous if the pre-traitor phase of the game drags for too long. The game outcome of the scenarios themselves is excessively determined by the initial conditions of the scenario (what items each player has, how good their stats are, what the position of each player in the house is, etc.) which leads to most scenarios playing out far too easily for one side or the other. I do like that each side has a secret goal within each scenario, and that the players do not know the rules for the traitor; but this lowers the replayability of the game, since this interesting aspect is often lost if the scenario is replayed. As I said, Betrayal is focused on the thematic experience of playing, rather than creating an interesting, well-balanced system for players to interact within. It's not my type of game, but I can see why it has a lot of fans.

A quick and fun horror themed game. It is true: there is a heavy amount of luck involved, but the top-notch theme compensates this totally. The more people. the more fun. The best thing about the game is the "haunt mechanism".

I *like* this game!  I get why I probably shouldn't - it's very random, the scenarios ('haunts') aren't remotely balanced for all possible player counts, and did I mention it's very random?  It's VERY random!  Still, it captures the feel of the theme so well it's really hard to fault the game mechanics.  Not one to play 'competitively', AT ALL, but with a group that is telling a story as they go along...basically perfect.

A decent explorer game. My main issue with the game is that the reason to explore isn't perfectly clear. The risk/reward balance is correct, but feels to lean toward the "risk" part of the scale.

Raise rating from 6 to 6.5 because of raw number of plays. Lowering back to 6 from lack of plays after adding the expansion, which ruined the game for our group.

This game is just FUN to play. You explore a house and all kinds of nasty stuff happens to you. Then suddenly one of your friends, or you, becomes a traitor. After that, you follow a storyline and get a condition on how to win the game. The perfect game for Halloween :)

Cool concept, but glitches on a few levels.  Large periods of gameplay can be essentially meaningless (early and un-winnable late-game).  The player boards are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.  House layout can be thematically absurd.  Interesting, but poorly executed.  Best possible game can get into maybe the 8.5 range (high!), while worst possible can be literally unplayable.  Peak-to-trough is unacceptable.

Fantastic game with a LOT of variation.  The twelve characters, customizeable, tile-based board and the 50 different "haunts" make each game a unique and interesting experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An enjoyable cooperative game with a horror theme. The exploration phase is a little too aimless and predicable for all its randomness. But the variety of the haunting keeps the replay value high. No, it's not fair or balanced and is dominated by luck and circumstance. But it is fun. I would rate this higher if the rules were tighter and not so desperately in need of a revised edition. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting cooperative adventure game marred by large errata and FAQ. While the second "haunting" phase is interesting and holds tactical challenges, the first "exploration" phase doesn't hold much interest (outside of the flavor text, which gets old after the first few plays).

I had incredibly high hopes when I first bought Betrayal.  You build the board as you go, one player gets to turn & play the bad guy, horror theme, a variety of scenarios.  I still think it sounds fun.  But, most of the people I play with don't share my opinion.  Between the vast number of cardboard chits (which there are some very nice storage systems available here) and a slight misunderstanding of the rules 1 time.  It is tainted in the eyes of people I play with.  So My rating has lowered.  I still think it should be fun, but the people I play with disagree.  so I kind of stopped even hoping to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Fun until the haunt happened, and then it was all downhill from there. Having to "pause" so the betrayer can go read what they're supposed to do while the rest of the players decide how to get out ... it really kills the flow of the game. Also, the rule book is pretty bad -- we had questions about things that we couldn't find answers to in either the rule book or the haunt texts.

SUCH a good concept. Haunted house, co-operative, someone becomes the traitor because reasons. The whole leave the room thing, yeah, not happening. Almost every game I've played, whether I am the traitor or not, I felt that the odds were unfairly stacked in the traitors favor. (the Abyss? forget it good guys) As the good guys, I have been victorious far less. The phone app helps a lot.

Played 4 times. Pretty interesting (despite the terribly warped tiles that came in the box: how hard can it be to produce normal tiles, like most companies do???). José enjoyed being the traitor. Sophie found the game a little scary and wants to play it in broad daylight next time. 

The game is pretty random, but it is really thematic, especially if you coincidentally draw an Event Card that really matches the room (e.g. Sophie drew a card about laying in a coffin when she tumbled into the Coffin Chamber from the Collapsed Room). The one haunt we've played was incredibly fun, trying to find Voodoo Dolls around the house, while the traitor ran around trying to kill the weaker characters with a spear (however, she was ovecome by me and Wouter, who had a ridiculously high speed to dash around the house like a maniac). 

Overall: fun, thematic game with quite some randomness and annoying warped tiles. I definitely wanna find out more of the haunts!

I'm Disappointed in you, me.

Okay so why did I feel that way? it's because I kept getting shafted in that freaking game. Omens kept making me lose sanity, and I didnt get anything [i]cool[/i] (Note to Game Designers - If you want me to like your game, make sure my character finds some cool stuff/equipment/plot points/whatever I want to be a involved by choice, not by luck!)

I know the dice tower guys say that the games rules are broken on some scenarios but I haven't encountered this at all. I think it's a really fun twist on a coop. The race to get stronger before the haunt begins is almost as fun as the race to do whatever you are supposed to do after.

A ridiculous story telling and exploration game with a traitor. The components - specifically the character boards and clips are really lacklustre - they don't grip the boards properly and can get knocked about. 

The fun factor of this game largely depends on the scenario which is randomly assigned based on game conditions. It's best with the full player count of people not taking it seriously.

My wife and I just love this game!  It's not flawless, and occasionally it feels unfair, and people get eliminated.  However, it's so rich with theme and ripe for roleplay, we always have a great time with the kind of people that we play with.  Always hits the table at Halloween boardgaming events.

I love walking the corridors through the unknown.  And with one of my friends about to betray me, I can feel the itch between my shoulder blades... until I betray everyone else.

RATING: 5
This game does a pretty good job of evoking a horror exploration through a haunted house.  However, there are very few choices to make, even in the haunting phase.  The haunting part was the best part- and I have played multiple times, but it goes by fast and is not that balanced.

The first part of the game basically consists of your observing things happen to your character- it matters little where you go, and there are no things you can do early.. might as well randomly roll to see your stats before the haunting and save a lot of time.

I originally posted this game as a 10. It is such a fun game, but I had to drop it to a 9 because the rules are filled with two many "what if" possibilities that we always end up house ruling.

RATING: 7
Very neat game where just about anything can and will happen.  The component quality could be a lot better, and some rules can be a little confusing and vague.

However despite its flaws, its a fun game with a unique story each time.  It is a real shame the game failed.

RATING: 8
Played the original version a few months back.  Doing so made the rerelease a must buy, and I'm not disappointed.  There are some production value issues, mainly that the cardstock is thin and warps easily.  But otherwise, the bits are streamlined and the haunt list has been revised and expanded.  Something of an "experience" game, but it's a fun experience.

It's an okay game. Exploring the house and not knowing who is the traitor is very cool but the game have some problems
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better cooperative games.  I especially like the whole constructing the mansion as you progress, which will no doubt provide tons of replayability.  However, it is marred by a variety of problems associated with the different scenarios.  Not to mention ambiguous rules that require a ton of errata to clear up.  Depending on when the haunt starts and if there is even a traitor involved, your experience can sometimes be very unsatisfying due to how it is resolved.

Overall, I think Betrayal at House on the Hill is very thematic and well worth playing.  It just sorely needs an update to make the game more balanced and less confusing.

RATING: N/A
Although this 'Ameritrash' game seems to have a rather vague rulebook at times, it manages to maintain enough charm to overlook the vagueness.
Due to the variety of scenarios, you will always come away with a fun story, and I would recommend it to anyone who just -enjoys- gaming, rather than the winning aspect.
Never go into this thinking you will win. Because you won't. 
Ai. Ai.

RATING: 9
This game is as close to perfection as a game can get... in my book at least!  I love  the fact that every session incorporates both co-operative and competitive playing variations.  Although the game inherently contains some minor flaws, almost all of them can be ironed out with the supplements provided here on BGG. 

The game elements are very nicely done and my only complaint is in regards to the villains - actual miniatures would have really taken this to the next level.  I understand that this would not have been at all possible with every boss monster though.  All in all, I love the survival/horror theme and the idea of pitting one player against the rest half way through! 

The game components are top-notch!  The character wheels are very unique and avoid the excessive use of more counters (there are so many as it is!) to mark health in all the different categories.  The character pawns are not painted the best, however, they really are of high-quality materials and depict the characters well.  The modular board has to be my favorite of all!  It is durable and attractive.  It contains some pretty interesting elements as well.  

As I mentioned, this game comes with an excessive amount of chits in the first edition!  Be prepared to sort through them all!  The second edition does an excellent job consolidating the amount of chits included in the game quite nicely.

The new release of this is game has had so much negative feedback concerning components, haunts, actual "new" additions, etc.  I am happy with my first edition, but I really love this game and ultimately decided to purchase the second edition as well.  I am happy I did so, because it contains new items, updated rules, etc.  

This is THE perfect gateway game and it should be a staple in every horror gamer's collection!

I haven't had any major issues with the components in my version. The character card clippies did slide around a bit, so I put some tape on the card to thicken it up (kind of a bummer I suppose.)

My group loves this game. I have no problem finding 6 players to fill the table and ask for more after we finish. These aren't even "gamers" I'm playing with, so this finds its way into the gateway game niche for me.

RATING: 4
The rules-to-gameplay and bits-to-gameplay ratios are way too high in this game.  That being said, however, played with a nutty bunch of people, you can have a lot of laughs playing it.  The theme seems rather well sewn into the fabric of the game.  Unfortunately, most of the decisions one has to make are either arbitrary (should I explore leftward or rightward?) or self-evident (should I go to the pentagram with the symbol in hand so I can work on winning?).  ...and, again, good luck finding the wall switch token, or the cloud token, or any other specific token in the sea of identical-looking tokens....

Okay, Betrayal at the House on the Hill. We all know what this game is. Pure Ameritrash with a hard-on for theme and LOTS of dice. However, it's a guilty pleasure with the right group. I've had nothing but a thrill with this game - always a different map each game, usually someone new taking on the traitor role when the haunt happens, and a lot of tension from some seriously should-not-have-happened dice rolls.

The first part, exploring the house and opening up the rooms, is by far my favorite. When you get to the haunts, it's definitely hit or miss. Some haunts are awesome. Others are just weird. And a lot of the time the haunt rules are written kinda badly, so you're not sure about the intricacies.

Game is really interesting and always fresh. The issue I have is the instructions is not always clear after the haunt starts. The scenarios can be confusing and a lot of time was spent rereading  the manuals during majority of the turns.

CONS: Could have used a dog and madman miniture since both are frequent additions to almost any game.

RATING: 8.5
Interesting game in which you can focus more on the story it creates than on winning the game. The different scenarios make this game a totally different experience and most of the time, people will be talking about what happened even after the game ends, because everything that happens in the second half of the game is quite memorable.

Play this game with at least 5 people and expect lots of randomness. This game has a great amount of luck involved, but that also makes this game accessible to non-gamers, as long as the traitor is familiarized with the rules when the haunt happens.

One of our first games, and a very very popular party game for people new to gaming - gateway?

I am 99% sure I played this years ago at a game night. It was OK, but I forgot about it until it was on TableTop and then impossible to find for the next year and a half. I bought a used copy when I saw one because I was a bit worried I would NEVER FIND IT AGAIN. Then I think it got reprinted or something. Fun game with a few good twist elements. I remember moving between floors was confusing or the graphics made it confusing.

This is the one game from the co-op genre that I actually enjoy. The reason for this is that instead of arguing about strategy or who is going to do what, this game tends to be a more casual game of "lets see what in the world is going to happen to us." I've enjoyed many good games of this with close friends.

This is a fun game with a great theme. Fairly simple to learn and teach. Everyone that I have introduced this game to has loved it. My only complaint with the game is that some "haunts" are completely unbalanced for either the good guys or the bad guy and that can damper the fun, but most times its not something that you'll notice once you're in the game.

An interesting "experience" game that no one should be playing in order to display their superior skills/best someone else. If you would rather play and win than play, lose, but have "fun" - you probably won't enjoy this much.

The theme is well integrated. The storylines that emerge tend to be enjoyable in a B-movie kind of way. But, on the other hand, the funky events coming together can sometimes crash the 'rules' and grind the whole thing to a halt. So, be aware that that's a possibility and plow ahead if you can remember that you're basically sitting over a toy with rules.

I really wanted to like this game, and I've gotta say, for the most part, I did.  The scenarios where the traitor has monsters or whatever running around with him seem to be the best, but that's not to say the others are bad.  Really cool game, pretty quick to play compared to many of todays and dripping in atmosphere.  Only let down by some bad editing/proof-reading - WAY too many errors in this game.  Also, once you've played it a lot and learn what haunts are what, a lot of the 'wow' factor disappears...

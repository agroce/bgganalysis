RATING: 6
I've had some brilliant games of this, but not played it a hug number of times, and suspect it can be very inconsistent. The game itself is fairly uninspiring, but the rules about not speaking to each other turn a can fairly bland game into a really tense experience.

With that said, I got pandemic a short while afterwards and haven't played TWD since. Pandemic just does the "frantically deal with escalating chaos" idea so much better.

Same kind of feeling as in Mall of Horror, but as a co-op game there is more joint effort. In the beginning only one of us (in a three player game) got a useful weapon, so we lost already in the ninth round.

This to my suprise turned out to be a very good license game, that perfectly captures the desparation of the show.
Basically, a very streamlined co-op that has a very cool team leader system that allows for one player to be the alpha player once every few rounds, smartly bypassing the problem of one player becoming the alpha leader the whole game. I like the way the event cards pose small dillema's each round.

Simple rules, but missing something to make it more interesting. Too easy in the basic mode. Maybe the expert mode (where you are not allowed to talk about your event cards in advance) is more interesting.

Great co-op, especially with the Ulterior Motive cards. They make it 98% co-op instead of 100%.

The Leader mechanic and non-public Events get rid of the age old problem with co-ops where the smartest player takes everyone's turn for them. In this game, every player makes decisions that affect the group.

For solo play, I tried playing both Event cards each round and it was tough as hell!

A simple, lucky heavy co-op game. Move, Roll for zombies numbers, roll  for attacks (use modifiers)and drawing event cards/resource cards to add more zombies;simple. That said, I enjoyed the game and liked the hidden information mechanism that does go some way to capture the tension of the Walking Dead story. Not added the expansion yet.

RATING: 9
A solid game that does a nice job of capturing the feel of the zombie apocalypse. It has a bit more randomness than I would like, but has a solid resource management angle combined with some Ameritrash elements. I've played 5 times now and enjoyed every play. 

I've played one solo game as I understand the rules, and it did not play well. The rules here are not clear. However, I made up my own rules for solo play, and that made it more interesting. With this solo variant, you play two Survivors as if they were both controlled by two separate players, and ignore all solo rules. The Sheriff designation is toggled back and forth between both Survivors as normal.

I would add a rule that all guns bring one walker to an area. The shotgun card with over 14 would then bring two walkers. I also think that melee weapons are a bit underpowered, given how effective they are in the hands of the Survivors in the show. They should either get one extra die, or +1 or +2. As it is now, the incentives are heavily tilted to using guns at all times, which is not always the best idea. 

In spite of some minor shortcomings, I think this game will be a big hit. The card game by Cryptozoic was a big stinker, but this is a winner in my book.

Is this the greatest game on earth?  No.  Is it the best board game about zombies? No.  So why would anybody play this?  Because it is just a quick fun game!  Don't take it too seriously and just have fun.  The game plays quick and if you are a fan of the show, the artwork/photos will get your group talking...   

Just ask yourself 3 questions: 
1. How many walkers have you killed?  
2. How many people have you killed? 
3. Why?

Go play!

Can't recall much on this one as it's been a while since I've played it. When I did play it, we just played the Beginner Mode which likely wasn't the optimal way to play. It doesn't really matter though, as people should just play Dead of Winter over this game.

Some interesting ideas here however this game was not designed for those who have a lot of experience with modern gaming.

The leader mechanic is quite unique and means first player actually does something. The leader chooses where everyone goes for the turn (although players have the option to defy the leader) and must play both event cards they have drawn for the turn but the special ability of their particular survivor is active for the turn.

Artwork is taken straight from the TV series (I assume) and fits well with the theme of the game, and the components are of an acceptable quality. The insert fits everything well but is made of that weird velour felt type stuff.

Sold with promo cards in 2014.

Game is pretty decent co-op game. I feel like the game could've been designed a little better. It's a pretty boring looking game. It's surprisingly good for being a game based from the TV show... however, I'd much prefer a different zombie themed game like Dead of Winter.... or a different co-op game like Pandemic or Robinson Crusoe.

This looks like it could be a good game, but i find that for a fun game rather than an extremely challenging game, you need to make up some house rules.

Sadly, this is a game that i have played about 5 or 6 times so far, and am a bit bored already. There should be an easy mode set of rules, as after 5/6 games, and in none of them you have survived paste the round 7 (of 12) mark, and can't see how you could possibly ever win without a lot of luck, it gets a bit tiresome.

Will i play it again? sure, i'll try it again, but it is not "fun" in its original form. Its damned tough.

Not terrible, but very little to make me to want to play it again. There's only 4 spots on the board there doesn't feel like there is much to do. Decide not to go where the leader makes you by moving go 1 of 2 other spaces, draw a card, or maybe trade with someone. It feels more like the game is playing you. I would be willing to try it again, but I was unimpressed.

Four plays in, the first three we played two player with one character each, and the game seemed impossible to win. The most recent game we each played two characters and things went better. My first impression was that it's a luck-fest, but after playing a bit more there's a lot more thought required and some reasonably tough decisions to be made despite the randomness. Rated 7 for now and I doubt that will increase but we'll see how I feel after playing a few more times.

Not many positive vibes about this game - but I enjoy it. Quite a straightforward set of rules, some decent strategic options and enough variability to keep it fresh. I like the changing dynamic/impact of the rotating leader role too. Plus, it does feel like you're in a Walking Dead TV episode.

Solitaire: This is pretty flat as a solo game, rarely feeling tense and not really telling much of a story. As a huge fan of the comic and the show, that's disappointing.

It is short, though: 10-20 minutes solo, making it filler in a big box. That puts it in a similar space to Friday and Onirim, two of my favorite solo games, but it's not nearly as fun as either of them.

It feels clunky in places: Maggie's leader ability is useless solo (no one to give things to), the clever mechanic about combining ranged attacks is entirely absent, and there just aren't enough events to really build up many walkers (barring unlucky draws and rolls, of course).

I tried it on all four difficulties (standard/beginner, hardcore/beginner, standard/expert, and hardcore/expert) and won all four games. That's a problem, as I don't feel much incentive to play it again solo. If I did, it would be on an expert setting; having to move before seeing my events made things slightly more interesting.

I suspect it would be more fun co-op, particularly with the Ulterior Motives and/or a few bad double event plays.

Tired of hearing people complain about some weapons being "too powerful." What they fail to mention is that the better the weapon, the more scarce the ammo. You don't figure that out on your first play, so these one-play reviews/ratings are misguided.

The Katana CAN be a great melee weapon. But if you don't roll a 4 or higher on a D6, it is the worst weapon in the game! I have seen it roll four 5s & 6s in a row. Thing is, there were only 2 Walkers there anyway, so the lucky roll was not game-relevant.

This is a great co-op game, with a very clever solution to the problem of someone else playing your turn for you: The Leader Mechanic.

The game is all about NEEDS. You need to draw Equipment, Food, Ammo, and Allies. But you need to protect those resources from running out as well. The game is also about risk. Do you draw a Food card when there are 5 cards left in the deck and there are three rounds to go?

Some good ideas, but ultimately a little too live-and-die-by-the-dice for me. The distrust between players feels really tacked on also. I really feel like how well you do in this game is determined by the setup, but it's not bad for what is basically a Last Night on Earth knockoff...minus the player controlling the zombies.

This Walking Dead game is my favorite so far. There are so many different ones it took me awhile to discover this one. In this game players are working together to protect 4 key locations from Walkers. There is an event deck which brings more walkers and other terrible things you have to deal with. Each round an event is drawn and everyone has to decide how to best deal with the threats cropping up all around you.

Also, the leader of the group is the one who makes the overall decision of who goes where. But each player also has their own mission they need to accomplish too. Sometimes the two decisions conflict and a new leader needs to be instated. Each player also has a unique ability that kicks in when they are the leader.

The expansion has been highly recommended and it is very inexpensive to purchase along with the game. I haven't tried it yet, but I believe someone takes on the role of the Governor.

If your a fan of the tv series I think you will like it,and if you were thinking of choosing between this and the other Walking Dead Board Game,Choose this one "The Best Defense" I think it's much better!

This is not the best cooperative game, nor is it probably the best zombie game, but it's probably the best game based on the Walking Dead TV show. If you have people who like the TV show, and aren't too "snobby" about their board games, this is a good choice to live the show. "Dead of Winter" does several things better, and it feels a lot like "The Walking Dead", but it's not "The Walking Dead".

The game is better than I first thought. We succeeded on the second run with four players, so for people that are experienced Coop- Gamers it might be too easy. I consider to buy the expansion, but it is only available in english yet. Very thematic with all the pictures from the TV series on the cards, and when you play Michonne, get the Katana and you roll 5 sixes in a row and clash through that group of zombies - awesome! We use the Zombies! miniatures instead of the tokens, that is much cooler.

My main thoughts about this game:
1. one game lasts around 60mins. Even though I love playing long games, it's good to have a shorter, lighter title like that.
2. Doesn't take too much table space, easy to set up, randomized board (it matters little, though, because it's just 4 tiles, but makes every game a bit different). 
3. Clear, fitting the theme, objective - last 12 rounds and you win, or perish. 
4. Not bad for fans of TV series. For other people - there's no reason to choose this one over Dead of Winter now. Dead of Winter does all this game is, and much more. And is much more customizable (in terms of length, complexity, strategic planning and character development).

That said - I don't regret having it. It's part adventure, part zombie killing, part resource manager, part collecting items and doing personal goals.. It has bits of all elements people like, just in a lighter form. It doesn't excel at anything and isn't very exciting, but is by no means terrible or broken.

RATING: 4
The game ended early to make room for late-arriving players, and I can't say that I minded. A win comes after 12 turns of survival, but I was happy to throw in the towel after turn 5.

Some interesting nuances (e.g., defying the leader, emptying a deck = game over), but pretty basic and dull overall. And the game really seemed to drag.  

I'd play most other coops over this.  Even the mediocre ones.

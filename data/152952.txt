1st play: An interesting real-time card game. I think the basic decks are maybe a little too basic, and the game is probably more interesting with expansions. 

No need to play a 2nd time.

Real-time games can be tricky. Hawken pulls it off nicely,with some excellent balancing mechanics. Plus the ability to customize your Mech is pretty sweet.

Tense, and momentous. Real time games are rare, and this one thought through the issues well and it's a surprising hit.

I played 2x at GenCon 2014 and I liked the concept of the game being played in real time. It actually made it feel more like you are playing a video game then a card game.

I have yet to play this at home tho, I will revise the score when it comes back out.

Some cards started falling apart out of the box: not a good sign. And my first few games didn't seem very balanced. I think there's potential here, but no one else is playing it and I don't know if I'll put forth the effort.

Cool game. Plays fast and was easy to learn. Love the integration of the mechanics to the theme. We need more mechwarrior games!!! This one fits the bill, but on a very light scale. Needs quite a bit more customization options, though.

RATING: 6
fast paced game, fun and light. Bought it really cheap. 
This is the kind of game you can play when you are not worried about winning. And just want something that doesn't involve much thinking and planing. 

its a god game to play when you have less time and want  something light. I feel it still depends just a bit on strategy.

I think the pilots are not equal in terms of who as more probability to win. 
would like a lot more if we could deal the cards and use them as the game progress.

I'm not fan of real-time games (besides Escape the Curse of the Temple) - my worsening reflexes as I get older isn't helping either.  This game doesn't change that. It doesn't have any real decisions - it's all luck of the draw and hope your guns and missles come out before your opponent's do.  For me, it seems that he turns go so fast,that  tension doesn't really get a chance to build up.  I doubt I will play this again,

Great game! I thought that my serious group won't like it so I bought it primarily for my son and I. But it was other way around. The guys loved it and we played many fun games. We also played it multilayer and it worked fine. I see no reason why it is 2 player game only.We also got a couple house rules which made game longer and complex but not so much to ruin the main game (repair in cover).It is now more like computer version. With draft mechanic it is now a great game. Hope to see more packs and cards if not we'll make our own :P Thanks criptozoic great fun!

Very disappointing. When I played I kept wondering if I missed something. It definitely doesn't feel like a real-time mech battle and almost doesn't feel like a game. You basically sort your cards as fast as you can.

I love real time games, however this one has only two choices: how to place the card (face up or face down) and when to grab the Fire button. Also, 1x1 real time is weird, because I see real time as a fun experience and 1x1 games tend to get competitive. It does not work.

Fast and simple card game. The boxes are awful quality from some kind of soft cardboard!? Has a cool theme but not a very strong one. Cool idea of disposing of cards when taking a hit. Plays quickly in under 30 minutes, with fast card players is less than 15. I don't like it a whole lot but it's not a bad game. Still keeping it.

A bit too complex to teach, so it hits only an extremely niche few who like fast paced tactical card play.  You must know the rules well before starting, or you'll get trounced.

Realtime speed game with a mech theme. Might be decent with a lot of plays, but player imbalance makes it no fun.

RATING: N/A
Based on the hit video game, Hawken! Grab a Mech and get to fightingâ€¦ fast! Your deck of cards contains primary and secondary weapons systems, thrusters, special abilities, and various other high-tech instruments of war. Draw cards and place them onto the table as fast as you can, but be careful or you might overheat! If you don't wish to play a card, place it face down and it acts as cover for the round, absorbing a bit of damage from your opponent. The action is in real-time, but a game round ends when a player snags the FIRE! button from the center of the table. The speed of the Mechs are calculated, which determines the engagement range. Then weapons are fired and internal heat is generated. Quick reflexes are helpful, but a quick mind will win every time!

Own both Hawken - Sharpshooter vs. Bruiser & Hawken - Scout vs. Grenadier

I did have fun, I must admit, so when I learned this game I played it again right away - and somehow that still doesn't mean I think much of this game. It's a real-time combat card game where both sides are turning up the cards of their deck frantically before one of them presses the FIRE button and the situation is evaluated. As you keep discarding (as damage points) 3 to 20 cards from your deck without looking at them, it pretty much does not matter if you know your deck or not... (Hey, wasn't it the same problem I had with the game above?) It seemed to me the results would not change that much if you simply followed the following no-brain rule: START, reveal 5-5 cards and press the fire button; evaluate, GOTO START. During our two plays it seemed the Scout vs. Grenadier pre-constructed decks were rather imbalanced in favor of the lighter construction but I might not know because of the discards; also as the game allows custom creation of your own decks this should not be much of an issue.

I liked this game and I usually dislike real-time games. In this game you can't just put down the cards as fast as you can. You have to check what your opponent is doing and choose what to do with your cards. The Grenadier amd the Scout also feel quite different from each other and require a different approach.

I like the hit and run tactics of the Scout, but the Grenadier is able to do massive damage even if the scout is hiding.

Cool mechanic with the way you play cards as fast as you can.  Nice art, fun little game.  I'm glad this only costs $15, any more and it proooobably wouldn't be worth it.  But it's a fun little 20 minuter.

I really like this game so far. It does a good job of balancing the difficulty of the decisions you make with having to make those decisions quickly. It has some clever design elements such as overheating, distance/speed, and cover. It is a fairly light game, but it captures the theme well, is fun to play, portable and cheap. I have only played with the scout/grenadier decks and plan to purchase the other ones. I would love to see this expanded to offer more customization in the future. As far as real time games go, this is a good one.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Owned: Bruiser, Grenadier, Scout, Sharpshooter.

Excellent, maybe the best use of real-time in a game that I've played. Really benefits from repeat plays, learning the flow of the game as well as some of the special cards in each deck.

I hope they put out a few more decks. I'm not sure that I want to bother with custom decks as we enjoyed the existing "mechs" as is.

Just when this game started to get stale, I bought a few more sets to customise mechs more and it kept the game fresh.

I keep premade mech decks together for quicker setup time.

Great 15-20 minute filler game.

Very original realtime 2 player cardgame that plays in 15 - 20 minutes. The quality of its components could be better, but then it is very reasonably priced. My son and I love mech-based videogames like Armored Core, so the theme of Hawken is spot on for us. It is not just a matter of throwing down cards as fast as you can either - you definitely have to keep an eye on what your opponent is playing if you want to have a chance at winning. Great filler that hold a unique spot in my game collection. Own both sets, but really have no preference for one or the other.

Like: Real time element. The way health is tracked. Heat Meter.

Dislike: The real time element is great, but also it's flaw, speed does make a big difference.

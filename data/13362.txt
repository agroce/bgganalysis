RATING: 6
Played a Tyranid Army for a while but couldn't keep up with the constant price increases from the manufacturer and the constant army codex changes that made my army obsolete when the next codex came out. Eventually sold off all my stuff. I play occasionally, but I have to borrow an army and have to have someone explain all the rules during the game because everything has change multiple times since 4th ed.

Very good theme.  Miniatures are very cool.  Games are won by making the right army list and being smart deploying your units.  Games usually take a long time.  I used to play Dark Angels and Tyranids.  I enjoyed making buildings for cityfights. A lot of the fun in Warhammer is using your own assembled and painted minis, and hanging out with friends; kind of like a nerd's version of a Superbowl party.  4th ed. rules are an improvement over 3rd.

My gateway drug to gaming... I got into 40k in seventh grade (1993) and picked up a 2nd edition set the first day it came out (I was with my family in England at the time). I remained on and off hooked until half way through college, when I realized that Euros were a whole lot more fun.

40k was cool, but costs so much. Especially if you hate painting and hire someone to paint your figs for you like I did. For the amount of money it took to make the game feel cool, I couldn't get over the fact that I was an opium-blazed proletariat in the big world of GW.

When I realized I could buy hordes of Euros for the amount I spent on GW each year, I sold off a bunch of stuff and put the rest away. It hasn't been out since.

40K has a fantastic back story, and beautiful miniatures in a huge variety of styles.  However, the game play itself does not suit my tastes.  I prefer Fantasy, but will play 40K once in a while.

RATING: 5
Fun game, too freaking expensive and time consuming to really enjoy if you have a family or a job. Building your own army is the main cornerstone of the game, and is serious fun if you aren't forced to sit there and wish you had another $400 and 15  hours to spend to get a few more Terminators and Predators on the field.I had spent 3 years buying into this game a piece at a time, but the Armageddon expansion is too much. I need to field multiple squadrons of $50 tanks? I'm out.

RATING: 2
Terrible rule system.  Any in game "tactics" that resemble real/common sense tactics are purely coincidental.  Great miniatures.  Wonderful fluff.  It is a shame that the rules have been dumbed down as much as they have.

Recently updated to 4th ed. The "Battle for Macragge" box is a good package. Love that crashed lander scenery. Lots of cool background story and brilliant miniatures. It can take a very long time to play and collecting armies is very very expensive. Also at some level the rules just really bug me.

RATING: 7.5
I play mostly small scale games 500-1000 points and the system works great (you can even play much lower - although you'd only need a 3'x3' area if you're going to play less than 300pts games). And the game is amply supported by some of the best miniatures on the market. :-)

I've marked this as previously owned in my collection but I still have it on the shelf. It's still available on the secondary market and is worth picking up for the miniature painting and terrain eye-candy. There's also rules for playing kill-team which isn't in 5th edition so this rulebook still has some value today.

Played this for 2 years before I finally got fed up with GW's policies and shabby rules updates and book editing. Playing this game is almost like a wild west gun slinging contest when it comes to figuring out the right rules. Terrible hand to hand combat and morale rules, crappy prices and shit support. New FAQ just released for Nids had to be retracted already.

RATING: 3
Terribly slow and cumbersome battle game. After four hours of playtime, most units are still in the same positions. Here and there a single wound is scored but not much else happens. Incredibly boring game, that really only gets playable after spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on miniatures. Also, special characters are WAY too strong compared to normal foot soldiers, and you can have an unbalancingly high amount of those leaders in your army.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As far as miniatures games go, Warhammer 40K is one of the best ones. Each army has its own spirit and plays really different, and the rules are simple but no "dumbed down" (BTW, I think 3rd edition rules were). If there's something bad about this game is its cash-bleeding nature, as GW is constantly putting out new miniatures, army books, and so on, so in order to keep yourself in touch with the game you have to spend periodical and large amounts of cash.

Unsurprising that this game gets bad reviews on a site primarily for board games. But for the right people it is brilliant. However there is a lot of movment to inadvertantly kill the theme of army lists, giving the unscrupulous power gamer something of an advantage and the hobby as a whole is expensive but it is still worth a good, long look.

I first started playing WH40K with the second edition, and, at the time, I loved it. Fantastic game.

I tried playing the third edition, but the guy teaching it to me was a schmuck, and that soured me on it (plus, in the game I played, I was told my orks couldn't shoot at the 20+ termagaunt unit directly in front of them, because one of them had managed to get in base to base with an ork from another unit - watch as I roll my eyes...).

I've since tried the 4th edition, and while it's certainly not my favourite game, it's better than a kick in the shins with a frozen boot. I'll play it, but I'm not spending money on it.

The best version of the 40k rules since Rogue Trader.  Still suffers from poor editing and a lack of statistical analysis.  However 40k still has the best "fluff" and miniature line in sci-fi table top gaming.  After 16+ years it's still one of my favorites that I come back to time and again.

Currently running: Black Templars, Tau, Imperial Guard(WIP)

This game can be an expensive life-style both in cost and time.  I'm all for GW making money - but I haven't shaken the feeling that some rules were deliberately broken/unbalanced in order to justify yet another edition or yet another series of units (i.e. miniatures) being scrapped to be replaced by something new.  I'm off the GW bandwagon, for sure.

Own three armies:

a. Tyranids (1,500 pts)
b. Sisters of Battle/Witch Hunters (1,500 pts)

I will trade my desert-camo painted:

c. Imperial Guard - Tallarn (3,000 pts)

The rules are too simple for the most part and do not promote interesting tactical decisions.  Can still be fun, but no longer worth the investment for me (after having played for many years starting in 1997).

RATING: 7
A rather simple but still enjoyable miniatures game, 40K is the game to play if you want to be able to find opponents.  While I'm not always the biggest fan of the company, I still can enjoy the (often quite beer-and-pretzels) game and the amusing science fantasy fluff.

I own (EDIT: owned) a Space Marine (Blood Angels) Army that I got about 13 years ago.  Haven't played in about 9 years, ever since the store where I used to play closed their doors.  My FLGS hasn't gotten into WH40K yet - I think he realizes that WH and 40K stock is dead in the water in a boardgame store.  Especially when there is a dedicated GW retailer about 2 miles away.

I may crack (haha...funny...crack...when refering to a GW minis game...haha...crack) out my army again to see if anyone is interested in playing, although I will need a new Codex and 4th Ed rulebook.

EDIT:  Now effectively useless, as I traded away all of the usable marines, and am left with a smattering of bikes, tanks, and 'Naughts.  Oh well.  GM me if you are interested in any Blood Angel hardware.

RATING: 3
As bad as the rules were before, this edition has completely ruined any tactical or strategic elements from the game. the new editon mostly just organized the horibly scattered rules of 3rd edition. Warhammer 40k is a wargame that has NOTHING to do with war.

A bit more simplification, a bit less of that quirky humor and flavor. A step down, in my opinion.

For me these are the rules where I most enjoyed WH40K.
All the miniatures from 2nd Ed came back and the Codices where specked up from reference sheets to sourcebooks again.
Fun and playable Rules. Big battles where finally posible with some depth to them.
I didn't play any later Editions so I can't tell how the game evolved after this point

For a war game (most of which have stupidly complex rules) W40K has easy to grasp mechanics, which is high up on the rating. The universe is richly detailed and fully immersive. The only downside is the cost and time. If you are not interested in making the models and painting them, don't bother. If you are prepared to look past the extionate prices you will have found a truely fantastic game.

Oh dear, where to begin. The system is completely and utterly broken. The basics are fine, but when you come to the special rules for all miniatures, I'm not even going there. Buy, assemble, paint and prepare about 40 miniatures. Then see them bashed to pulp by somebody's "all that and a bag of chips"-commander/spacemonster/supersoldier. Redo, switch army list and try again, buy a new set of ridiculuosly expensive miniatures. Realize they're changing the rules, again...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple & fast combat rules, not realistic, but they keep things interesting.  4th edition not a big change from 3rd edition, primarily incorporating the new HtH rules that were out in WD earlier, but also making vehicles (finally) the mobile gun platforms they're supposed to be.  What a money and time suck, though.  I don't think I've played a real 1500 point game of 40k in a decade, but I still keep buying and painting miniatures (although I'm only two squads and three tanks away from completing my 1500+ point Imperial Guard army, finally!)

The idea of the game is great! Collect and paint your own army. That is what I like most with the game. But when it comes to the rules it is rather unbalanced, or rather not the rulse but the army list are unbalanced.

What can I say.  I liked painting the miniatures for a while, and got two armies completed. Tyranid and Space Marine.  Then we moved and haven't managed to reserrect a painting place to resume the best part of this game.  The mileu was fun in parts and did its best to be interesting but the flatness of the rules towards a bucket of dice resolution just wasn't enough.

Still like the miniatures and would like to paint the bad ass Necron army I have some day...

Do not play this game.  Stay away.  It will devour your life.  I can't stop... help me...

Update 7-3: Wait a sec, you mean there are games where you get to fight battles with cool units and characters, but you don't have to pay money per unit you own, AND the rules are more detailed yet streamlined at the same time?  Hex'n'counter, where have you been all my life.  Minis, say hello to eBay.

Specifically, the hero rules are retarded, and the whole-side activation system with no overwatch is just brain dead.

This is not a game, it is a crafting hobby.  Doesn't mean it is worthless, it's just not a good wargame.

40K addicts should at least play Epic, which keeps all of the units and flavor, but drops all of the suck.

Better than other editions, still full of loopholes, strange values, and generally very inconsistent. Fanatic players say it's strategic because an expert player beats a novice player. I say that's normal in a game, but an expert WH40K player wins expecially because he knows rules that novice players don't know or overlook, and he knows the best combinations of troops to play. That's not my way of playing a strategy game: it must offer choices to novice players too, and must beat them on CHOICES more than on knowledge of the single rules. Too much rules are like bad rules for me.

Most of the fun of the game is collecting and painting.  But I only enjoy painting when I do it really slow, and with the amounts of units you have to paint I feel like I always need to rush through and finish because there's so much left.  The game itself is okay, but it takes too long for the relatively small amount of activity that occurs and the outcome is very random.  Finally, it's WAY too expensive to collect.

Games Workshop company policies and their rules that leave you with more questions unanswered than anything else really bog down what could be a fun miniatures game.  Its also unfortunate that they cater to sales instead of focusing on making the "less cool" armies more interesting.  Nobody needs yet another Space Marine codex, but those outsell every other army in all their game lines, so thats what gets all the attention every single month.

I bought "The Battle for Macragge" on a whim. I haven't played 40k since 2nd edition, but I did play often. I really just bought it to check out the goodies and read the rules. After reading the rules and hating them, I passed them on to a friend (old Eldar player) who hated them so badly, he refused to play even one scenario straight out the box. The background story and minis are top notch no doudt, but the game has devolved into a such a Frankenstien monster of a rules set it has lost all of its flavor. Bleh.

Vastly over-rated and HUGELY over priced game system.  I have played sci-fi mini games for over 35 years.  None of the GW games come in the top 10.  Figures are very nice, and three times the cost of their competitors.

Its like crack...  the great miniatures, the excellent backstory, and the gameplay is finally starting to tighten up after all these years.  The direction of the new codexes is excellent.  Sure the gameplay isn't perfect and its more expensive than collecting  pacific islands, but the fluff is great, the playerbase is huge, and its more than just a game since you can spend hours painting, modeling, writing fan fiction, bullshitting, etc.  Once they finish re-doing the other new codexes to bring them in line, and the 5th ed rules appear, this could seriously go up to an 8, which is amazing considering what an unbalanced mess it has been in the past.  Blood for the blood god!

This game has the best background universe in all gamedom, hands down.  Devilishly baroque, medieval and futuristic simultaneously.  The actual game part—when you have the minis arrayed for battle on a big, green table—is really a small portion of what this is all about.  Taken purely for the game aspect it's kinda thin.  Where this shines is as an entire hobby-system:  perusing the background material, planning an army, collecting the minis, modeling and painting, hand-crafting convincing terrain.  It's the total package that gets the 8.  No other minis game even comes close to touching all those nubbins so completely.

[q=HiveGod]8 --> 6  I'm at the point now where I'll actively avoid playing this... It's a fine-enough game, no doubt—it's just that I've had my fill.  I've pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.[/q]

I dabbled in the madness we all call Warhammer 40,000 a few years ago. I managed to stop before I purchased too much. I really like the system but I'm a player and not the best painter so it didn't workout too well for me.

RATING: 3
As miniatures makers, very good. They have been the bests for a long time.

As a game, it's nearly broken. It's even expected to be nearly broken, this way they can re-write the game continually in order to sell more.

As a hobby, it's like a cult: every month they promise you a gaming paradise that never comes and little by little you lose all your money.

I know what I'm talking about. I had a 10,000 point Eldar army, I have been a W40K fanboi. No more. I have sold my minis and trashed the books (they were useless). Avoid this game.

Well what can I say...This game looks awesome and its kind of awesome. But personally I dislike the rules. Rules always favour most recently updated army. And dunno...Its just dont feel as right as Fantasy Battle does. Ive been playing this since 2nd edition and well its better than those days im sure. Had too much card/counters/tokens etc etc. But not still quite good enough.

But anyways. Miniatures look good. If you like wargames in grim darkness where is only war. This is the game you must have then. oh...and btw...paint your stuff! :)

This gets a higher rating than Fantasy Battle mostly on the strength of its shorter playtime. Games of 40k are much faster, with less fiddly rules and more maneuverable squads. I'd actually still be willing to play this with somebody if they provided an army, which is more than I can say for Fantasy. The less generic universe is a plus too, even if it is ridiculously overwrought.

Several plays.  I lived and breathed this game when I was heavily into in the mid 90's.  But, I think I was more enamored with the modeling aspect than the game - at least, more than PLAYING the game.  Though I did love to read about it.  The new rule set definitely clears away SOME of the abusive tactics, but the cost to just begin playing is far to great to justify.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun buckets-o'-dice fest best suited for friends or reasonable competitors. While the system is breezy fun and painted armies can be remarkably attractive on the table, it is also prone to abuse by unsporting children. Furthermore, there is a defensive threshold that prevents wounding, but the point-cost is far too cheap, (so buy those big expensive models, kiddies!). And most agree that Games Workshop is a predatory and unscrupulous company. Would rate higher otherwise. Clever and varied universe, great selection of Army lists, and quick game times keep me in the hobby...grudgingly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Basically the previous edition with all the cool rules replaced by more general and "streamlined" ones. Whatever that may mean. Nicer pictures, more expensive. But, what can you do, the kids don't play by the old rules no more and the old guys don't play any more at all. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A relatively fun sci fi war game.  Main problem: superior fire power inevitably dominates.  Much less tactics than its fantasy counterpart.  However, the skirimish ability allows for crowded and cool tables, and the game can be especially cool when linked (with Battlefleet Gothic, e.g.).

People might argue with my rating on this game.  The rules have become so simple and the game has lost a ton of its original flavor.  The reason I would give it such a high rating is mainly because I've played it so long yet am always willing to play it frequently.  The universe tied into this game is quite large allowing for a lot of variation on the game, of course if you get locked into playing one army with the same roster every time, I could imagine this game getting boring very quickly.

I was a rabid 40k player for about 5 years.  Cheesy leagues and the loss of the GT system undermined my interest and now I hardly every play.  4th edition solved some of the problems of 3rd edition, but brought on a whole new set of issues.  The emphasis on shooting, although reasonable in a science fiction game, made for a much 'flatter' game that was often interesting only the the player who brought the most guns (and who brought the army that HAD the most guns).
I'd like to start playing again, but I'll have to be much more careful who I play with.

The games are long, but they look good with everything painted and all that scenery. It's a shame the mechanics aren't better. Nearly all of the decisions are made before the game begins (army composition and deployment), the execution comes down to dice rolling, like running an experiement.

Serious design problems around game balance, vague rules, excessive randomness, lack of meaningful decisions and dominant strategies, not to mention the cost.

I'd probably rate this game higher in "actual fun of playing" but because of the rediculous cost of getting into it and the time consuming assembling and painting of minis (which I found only somewhat entertaining), its rating has to take a hit.

Truly an excellent tabletop miniature game. More of a hobby aspect to it then just a game. Painting, modeling and making terrain is what has kept me busy with this game for years. I played the second edtion and loved the rules for that version too but since grown quite used to the latest edition. This game will see a new release next year 2004 because as is the habit of GW they take all the feedback from players world round and try and improve on the rules and game play which to me makes a lot of sense when dealing with a game of this magnitude and variables. Some people have a real problem with the way GW markets and also the rules themselves, but when it comes to tabletop, and true hobby gaming these guys do it best and 40K like Warhammer are the best you are going to get. They have some of the best miniature designers in the world working for them and the artist are excellent. They do need to work on their grammar and proof reading of material. I recommend anyone entertaining the idea of getting into this game to really try it out first before delving into spending tons of money on the product which is very easy to do.

It's a fun game and the rules allow for so many interesting strategies and options during a turn and I love how much you can customize and personalize your armies. But for how much of an investment of money and time you must commit in order to enjoy the game in full I just haven't found it to be worth it lately. The time it takes to assemble, paint etc. all the units and the fact that you have to spend a small fortune to get an army big enough to be interesting just completely turns me off now. I have to admit to having had a lot of fun playing this in the past though (not that I ever really went crazy buying that much stuff like some people). I had Space Marines and Tyranids.

The game that made me the rules lawyer I am today.
Still my favorite setting, the longest and most successful gaming saga of my life... GW literally made thousands upon thousands of bucks off me and my friends on this one and although I haven't played since 4th edition days, my armies still stand ready and waiting for the call.

Death to the false Emperor!

Tough to rate, love the fluff and the models, gameplay is questionable at times, but fun in general. I have stopped collecting due to high prices, but would still play if asked to

Far and away the best thing about this edition of 40k is the Kill Team rules.

RATING: 5
A cumbersome but comprehensive gaming system wrapped around a fantastically imaginative universe where anything is possible.  You must like miniatures and miniature painting to like 40K.

Good Miniature Game to start with, but there is better out there

I thought that new game editions were published to improve game systems and close rules loopholes. 40K 4th edition proves me wrong. See my additional comments under Battle for Macragge.

Painting the miniatures is the most fun.  I changed the rules for when I play this, because some of them didn't work for me.

My son is really into this now and I like it a lot too.  Really love the battles even if it's a lot of luck on the dice.  However I really get into putting the armies together and figuring out different configurations to go with different point totals.

Expensive Wargame... it really requires dedication..
It´s beautiful though when you have your miniatures in the table. It´s more like a whole hobbie.

Very cool game with great minis. Heroscape...bleh! This is where it's at. Superb mythos..."The rewards of tolerance are treachery and betrayal".....that is just plain scary.

To say I 'own' this is an understatement. Too many figs to count...haven't played in years mind you.

 With every new edition, the games goes worse. First edition (Rogue trader) was a nice skirmish game (simple but with sufficient chrome). 2nd moved to more massive battles, but it was ok. 3rd edition is the worst of all, horrible vehicle rules (move or fire), too dense battleground, no supression fire, too much minis, and the worst flaw, too much simplified rules to get kids playing (and spending on) it (all foot minis move the same!!!)... The 4th is a little improvemente, basically it tweaks vehicle rules, but the rest is the same. But one thing is constant, every new edition sees lower points cost per mini, so you need to spend more money. If you can, try to play Rogue Trader or 2nd edition, very different (and better) games.

Most likely I won't ever play this game again, because this is an old version.

Rated after a play with the latest rules. Rated this as 6, ok game, but the later rules are better.

The cleanest edition of the basic rules yet.  If only they weren't screwing up the new codexes.

5th edition is actually much better than this 4th edition.

This is a mini game with problems. The miniatures themselves are delightful, and the storyline is rich for those who look for that kind of thing, but the mechanics need help. I play Chaos Marines (Iron Warriors).

I currently have a small Tau force.  Fortunately, the group I game with has plenty of minis already painted that they are more than happy to share so that we can have some 40K fun!

I like the game but would rather paint the minis.

I spent quite some time on this hobby. I like paining miniatures and creating custom stuff like terrain. Also planning out your army is something I often really enjoyed.

Playing the actual game takes some effort. You need quite some table (or floorspace in my case) space in order to play it. Also moving your army to where you are going to play a game is not a trivial task, and can result in damage.

Having you own painted army take the battle field has a very great visual appeal to me. The tactical play of the game is also an aspect I really like.

The is only thing though that makes the hobby a bit prohibitive, besides the space requirements. And that's the price point. This is a very expensive hobby! 1 transport costs about the same a new brand new boardgame! An army starterset even more so, and even then you still have a weak army, not even close to playable if you take the 1500 point army limit. And there are the paints that cost the same as a Magic the Gathering booster pack!

But if you have the disposable cash, or intend to keep it as your only hobby, that the cost factor might not be too much of a problem. And otherwise there are always people who quit the hobby and are selling their army on Ebay. Which might save you doing a paintjob, if that's not your thing.

4th edition was good. 5th is much better.

I still own this, but I don't see much reason to list each edition separately.

I don't like this as much as I once did.  I'm bothered by the latest edition's lack of screening rules and the clunky role transport vehicles play.  I'm also not a fan of the constant power fluctuation with each released army book.
